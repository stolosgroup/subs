00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,796
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>Hurry up!</i>

3
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>Look! It's Jupiter!</i>

4
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,296
<i>The largest planet in the Solar System.</i>

5
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,421
Daddy, there is an eye on Jupiter.

6
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:25,296
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

7
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,588
What's a windstorm?

8
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,088
Jupiter is like a huge balloon,

9
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:31,546
composed of 90% hydrogen.

10
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,838
Grandpa, you know what's hydrogen?

11
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,130
What is hydrogen?

12
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,005
It's the fuel for Daddy's rocket.

13
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,255
You see, Grandpa.

14
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,546
Hydrogen is a fuel for Daddy's rocket.

15
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,713
Oh.

16
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,880
Liu Qi.

17
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:45,963
Huh?

18
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,588
<i>A day may come</i>

19
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,255
<i>when you can see Jupiter
without a telescope...</i>

20
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:52,463
<i>Daddy will come back.</i>

21
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,088
<i>Where are you going?</i>

22
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:58,148
<i>Daddy is going on a mission.</i>

23
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,588
<i>The world's most important mission.</i>

24
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,505
<i>After I leave,</i>

25
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,630
<i>you'll be Liu Qi's only guardian.</i>

26
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,463
And with this,

27
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,046
you'll get underground city residency
without drawing lots.

28
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,005
It's the only way

29
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,255
to make sure you'll survive

30
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,921
<i>both you and Liu Qi.</i>

31
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,426
- I didn't have a choice.
- That's enough. Trust me, I get it.

32
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,796
<i>Father...</i>

33
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

34
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,463
<i>At first,</i>

35
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,921
<i>nobody cared about this disaster.</i>

36
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,189
<i>The number of wildfires,
has been the highest...</i>

37
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,564
<i>Just another wildfire...</i>

38
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,708
<i>...several locations all over the planet.</i>

39
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,106
<i>...another drought...</i>

40
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,564
<i>...survival of the planet.</i>

41
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,268
<i>Sea level continues to drop...</i>

42
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,176
<i>...another extinction of a species...</i>

43
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,333
<i>And this had intervened
to prevent further spreading of the riots.</i>

44
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,401
<i>...another vanishing city.</i>

45
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,713
<i>Until everyone was entwined
with this disaster.</i>

46
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,921
<i>The Sun is rapidly degenerating
and expanding.</i>

47
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:26,213
<i>At this rate, the Sun will engulf Earth
in 100 years.</i>

48
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:31,796
<i>Within 300 years,
the Solar System will no longer exist.</i>

49
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,296
<i>To face this cataclysmic catastrophe,</i>

50
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,505
<i>mankind united like never seen before.</i>

51
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,314
<i>...to prevent the future catastrophe...</i>

52
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,731
<i>In order to maximize
the chance of human survival,</i>

53
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,213
<i>the United Earth Government</i>

54
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,088
<i>decided to propel Earth
out of our Solar System</i>

55
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:51,380
<i>to fly towards our new home
4.2 light years away.</i>

56
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,588
<i>This mighty and enduring human migration</i>

57
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,088
<i>is named as the Wandering Earth Project.</i>

58
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,963
<i>The first test
starts in 36 months' time.</i>

59
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,713
<i>Mankind will devote
every possible resource</i>

60
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,755
<i>to construct 10,000 Earth Engines
on the planet's surface</i>

61
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,588
<i>to propel Earth out of the Solar System.</i>

62
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:12,421
<i>The height of every
Propulsion Engine is 11,000 meters.</i>

63
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:13,338
<i>They will provide</i>

64
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,296
<i>a total of 150 trillion tons
of propulsive force.</i>

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,213
<i>Salute!</i>

66
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,356
<i>The construction
of the Navigation Platform</i>

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,838
<i>International Space Station
will be completed</i>

68
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,630
<i>at the beginning of this month.</i>

69
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:25,796
<i>Three hundred eleven Chinese senior pilots</i>

70
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,189
<i>- and 709 engineers that were selected.
- One. Lift off.</i>

71
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,671
<i>Meanwhile,
to safeguard Earth's trajectory,</i>

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,088
<i>the United Earth Government consolidated
global astronautical capabilities</i>

73
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,630
<i>and spent 30 years building the Navigation
Platform International Space Station.</i>

74
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,213
<i>The Navigation Platform
International Space Station</i>

75
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:49,213
<i>will travel with a relative position
of 100,000 kilometers from Earth.</i>

76
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,921
<i>It will provide warnings, navigations,
and communications for Earth.</i>

77
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,505
<i>Centrifugal drive,
ready for activation.</i>

78
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:02,880
<i>Worldwide sea level
will rise 300 meters in ten years' time.</i>

79
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,421
<i>The cities of Haikou and Zhanjiang</i>

80
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,213
<i>will be the first to be hit
by the tsunami.</i>

81
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:08,796
<i>To deal with the rapidly
deteriorating conditions,</i>

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,005
<i>the UEG constructed an underground city
beneath each Earth Engine.</i>

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,588
<i>Until Earth's arrival at its new home,</i>

84
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,380
<i>these will be the only refuge for mankind.</i>

85
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,189
<i>The right to underground residency</i>

86
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,838
<i>will be selected by drawing lots.</i>

87
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,296
<i>A winning lot cannot be transferred,
shared, or gifted.</i>

88
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,463
<i>Beginning now, mankind,</i>

89
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,796
<i>a tiny tribe of the Solar System,</i>

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,588
<i>will be embarking upon a 2,500-year
wandering voyage.</i>

91
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,481
- Don't rush, walk slowly!
<i>- The surface temperature</i>

92
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,171
<i>will drop to minus 70 degrees Celsius
this year.</i>

93
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,546
<i>Surface residents
from each district will be located...</i>

94
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,046
Easy. Hey.

95
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,546
- Hey.
- Don't push!

96
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,713
<i>Daddy will fly up into the sky</i>

97
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,713
<i>and turn into a star</i>

98
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,380
<i>to always watch over you.</i>

99
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:15,796
<i>Daddy, is it true that
you're going to turn into a star?</i>

100
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,463
<i>Of course.</i>

101
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,796
<i>From now on, you just have to count</i>

102
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
<i>three,</i>

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
<i>two,</i>

104
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:25,588
<i>one.</i>

105
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,421
<i>Look up.</i>

106
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,255
<i>You will see Daddy.</i>

107
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,963
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

108
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,963
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

109
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,213
<i>Bye.</i>

110
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:02,338
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

111
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,671
<i>Welcome to</i> The Morning News.

112
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,463
<i>These are today's headlines...</i>

113
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,421
<i>With the arrival of the new year,</i>

114
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:18,171
<i>the first batch of personnel from
the Navigation Platform will be returning,</i>

115
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:21,338
<i>having completed 15 to 20 years
of station duties.</i>

116
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:26,171
<i>Underground citizens around the world
are eagerly anticipating their arrival.</i>

117
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,335
<i>Therefore...</i>

118
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,713
"Anticipating. Anticipating.

119
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,421
Spring breeze has arrived.

120
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,046
The spring now is heading
closer and closer.

121
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,671
The yearly planning starts with spring.

122
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,380
It's full of effort.

123
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,130
It's full of hope."

124
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,606
Zhou Qian, tell us.

125
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,213
How do you define hope?

126
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,630
Hope is something precious.

127
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,713
It's precious like a diamond...

128
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:36,838
...for our time.

129
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,546
Hope is the only direction.

130
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,310
The only direction to our home.

131
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,213
Well said. Please sit, Zhou Qian.

132
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,630
Han Duoduo, do you have any thoughts?

133
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:47,671
Well, I have nothing to say.

134
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,755
I just want to take a look outside.

135
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,380
But it's too dangerous outside.

136
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:59,522
Be seated. Class, don't panic.
It's just a display malfunction.

137
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,106
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go back. Xiao Ming, go back.

138
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,290
Class, don't panic.

139
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,380
- Did you do this?
- Shut up! Let's go!

140
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,921
Teacher, look,
Han Duoduo has just run away!

141
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,671
<i>Happy New Year, folks.</i>

142
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:14,397
- <i>Why don't you celebrate?</i>
- Happy New Year!

143
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,255
Hu Kou.

144
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,838
Is the Committee giving out
dumplings tonight?

145
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,505
Come. All you think about is food!

146
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,296
- Where is Grandpa's vehicle pass?
- I've got it.

147
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,588
Shall we grab some dumplings
before we leave?

148
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:27,338
- Forget it. Don't come then!
- Liar!

149
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,838
You said you'll take me outside.

150
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,213
<i>All personnel,
return to your post.</i>

151
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,171
<i>All personnel, return to your post.</i>

152
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,630
- Where is my order?
- It's here.

153
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,838
Durian-flavored, dried earthworms!

154
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,439
What are you looking at?

155
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,213
Hey, come on,
it's just a day trip.

156
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,380
- What's the rush?
- That's what it is to you.

157
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,838
I'm not planning on returning.

158
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,588
Get moving!
We are going nowhere without the suits.

159
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,046
You had the mahjong I needed,
why didn't you discard it?

160
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,296
I was going to win. What the fuck?

161
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,439
Isn't that bunny girl's tail

162
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,546
- soft and sweet?
- Hey, no.

163
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,439
- Are we meant to be together, angel?
- No. I told you. You and I...

164
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,546
Now tell me, what are you doing here?
It's New Year!

165
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,870
I can't believe how cheeky you are.

166
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:09,921
Hey.

167
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,296
Let's go.

168
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,088
Yi Ge?

169
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,755
- Yi Ge?
- Bring it on.

170
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,421
Are the suits ready?

171
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:22,255
You have the stuff?

172
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,046
Pretty new.

173
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,713
Fully checked. They work.

174
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,255
And I got you skewers, too.

175
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,671
Freshly made.

176
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,755
Good.

177
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,088
Grab the suits.

178
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,380
How old are you?

179
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,880
Hey, check out this tag Yi Ge made!

180
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,546
Just like the real thing.

181
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,546
- It's yours.
- Thanks, Yi Ge.

182
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,130
Return the suits tomorrow.

183
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,421
Thanks, Yi Ge. See you.

184
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:20,338
Hurry up and move.

185
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:21,814
Didn't you say
you are not coming back?

186
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:22,838
Hold it.

187
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,296
You're not coming back?

188
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,255
And this is all you paid me?

189
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,546
For two of my thermal suits?

190
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,463
Yi Ge, I'll make it up when I get back.

191
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:37,838
For years, I have been known...

192
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:40,713
for honest trading only.

193
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:42,421
No credit given.

194
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:45,380
Yi Ge, I really need to go out today.

195
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,838
What for?

196
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,005
Just stay here with your sis
for the New Year.

197
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,921
Hey, boss, look! He's gonna do it!

198
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,505
Look!

199
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,005
You filthy repairman.

200
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,546
I dare you! Use it here...

201
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,005
Oh, man.

202
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,564
Duoduo, get down.

203
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,880
I want him dead!

204
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:21,963
<i>Dear friends...</i>

00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:46,046

- Excuse us.

<i>- Please wear your suit</i>

208
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,630
Will they report us?

209
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:56,713
These suits were stolen.

210
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,005
They'll expose themselves if they report.

211
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,338

Excuse me.

223
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,421
Can I chew gum while wearing the helmet?

224
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,064
- Chew what?
- What is your problem?

225
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,671
<i>Check all thermal suits and helmets.</i>

226
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:37,796
<i>Please wait here.</i>

227
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,005
<i>In three days,</i>

228

<i>Attention,

234
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,963
Oh, my.

235
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,213
Just look at yourself.

236
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:18,731
Is it your first time outside?

237
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,630
Have you ever been outside?

238
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,421
It wasn't this crowded last time.

239
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,546
You are such a liar.

240
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,630
How long to get to the surface?

241
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,338
It's five kilometers,

242
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,463
so at least 15 minutes.

243
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,213
Okay.

244
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,189
It's a communication device.

245
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,921
Press once to sync with the transporter.

246
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,213
Twice for regional broadcast.

247
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,838
Three times for the private channel.

248
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,838
Once outside, stay close to me.

249
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,171
No running around.

250
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,838
Are you afraid?

251
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,935
<i>Surface level reached.</i>

252
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,588
<i>All personnel, please be ready.</i>

00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:08,713
Let's go!

254
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,088
Haven't you had enough
looking around? Let's go!

255
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,588
I snuck out.

256
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,338
Am I going to get expelled?

257
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,346
Have you already been
kicked out of your unit?

258
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,505
Nonsense.

259
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,796
Which one is Transporter 373?

260
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,380
Duoduo, come here!

261
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,755
Okay.

262
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:34,963
- Give me Grandpa's vehicle pass.
- Here.

263
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,546
<i>Han Ziang.
Senior driver.</i>

264
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,838
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division

265

<i>Routes are countless.</i>

00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:52,005
<i>Safety is foremost.</i>

267
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:53,838
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

268
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,213
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

269
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,088
This is the clutch. This is the gear.

270
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,171
What the...

271
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,171
Can you even drive, Hu Kou?

272
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,130
This transporter is not for everyone!

273
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:15,171
It requires five years of training.

274
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,106
- I am a genius just for making it move.
- Hmm...

275
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,130
- Okay?
- Genius.

276
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,671
Just step on the clutch, hand on the gear.
Heavy step, light hand.

277
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:29,713
Watch out! People ahead!

278
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,296
- Watch out!
- Shit! Fuck!

279
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,880
Watch out! Watch out!

280
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:54,546
<i>The world outside is huge!</i>

281
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,921
<i>What are you yelling about?
So embarrassing.</i>

282
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,005
Wow.

283
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,963
Such strong winds today.

284
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,921
Why are they mining these mountains?

285
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,421
It's for fuel.

286
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,213
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

287
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,213
Well, basically, it's just burning rocks.

288
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,671
Whoa! That's the Earth Engine!

289
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,338
These are Propulsion Engines.

290
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:16,088
There are 10,000 of them around the globe,
made for pushing Earth forward.

291
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,713
This isn't the most gigantic one.

292
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,796
Those Torque Engines along the equator,

293
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,838
they are the real giants.

294
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,088
<i>Synchronal translation activated.</i>

295
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,130
Peiqiang, happy retirement.

296
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,421
One more day until I go home.

297
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,213
Don't stir my dignity.

298
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,796
Save this moonshine for yourself.

299
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,921
Okay, I will store it
somewhere safe for you.

300
00:19:58,005 --> 00:19:59,838
Save it for your farewell party.

301
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,130
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.

302
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,546
Don't you know that

303
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:15,380
vodka was smuggled onboard
back in Yuri Gagarin's day?

304

<i>O2 level stable.</i>

305
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,296
We'll be entering
Jupiter's orbit today, right?

306
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,421
Yes, we began preparing already
for Emergency Protocol No. 3.

307
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,713
Something doesn't feel right.

308
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:38,630
There's no other way.

309
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:42,296
Earth can't leave the Solar System
without using Jupiter's gravity.

310
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,820
It is a risk we must take.

311
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:45,088
God will bless us.

312
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,505
Once this is over, you can return home.

313
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:50,996
It's the last procedure
for daily inspection.

314
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,213
Check the Centrifugal Drive Control unit.

315
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,963
Record the temperatures
of the Centrifugal axle bearings.

316
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,213
Understood.

00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,838
<i>Congratulations on the completion
of your duty and journey home tomorrow.</i>

324
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:42,463
My dear friend.

325
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,546
Let's see each other together on Earth
three years from now.

326
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:49,088
But now, please,
go catch up with your son.

327
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,255
You haven't spoken to him for a decade.

328
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,421
I'll see you again on Earth.

329
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,088
Here, my friend.

330
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,213
You're stuck with me
for the next three years now.

331
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:33,296
<i>Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.</i>

<i>Earth's trajectory is off course
by 9.23 degrees,</i>

333
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,630

<i>Disaster warning protocols activated.</i>

338
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,255
There's a supply station
50 kilometers ahead.

339
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,713
Once we get there,
you go back by yourself.

340
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:10,713
Catch the first shuttle back,
so grandpa won't worry about us.

341
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,838
Oh, come on.

342
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:16,380
If your dad catches you,
he's gonna kick your ass.

343
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,963
You know I'm a genius.

344
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,213
No one can catch me.

345
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,380
What the hell? Check point.

346
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,189
How did you get in here?

347
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,880
Well, unregulated driving.

348
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:30,546
Unregulated? You committed theft!

349
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,838
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.
I didn't steal it

350
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,838
Nonsense.

351
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,463
All transporters belong to the UEG
as public property.

352
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,796
It's not up to your grandpa!

353
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,397
What are you doing?
It's way past bedtime.

354
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,421
Yes, sir.

355
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,088
Uh, I'm just getting
to know new friends, that's all.

356
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,130
More friends, more options.

357
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,213
Hand it over.

358
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,380
- You think it is yours?
- Mm.

359
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,755
- Hit the sack.
- Mm.

360
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,250
Have a nice stroll.

361
00:23:58,005 --> 00:23:59,505
I am Tim, eh.

362
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,758
My dad is from Beijing,
my mom is from Melbourne.

363
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,588
Chinese-Australian coproduction.

364
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:05,421
Come on, just joking. Let's shake hands.

365
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,546
Huh?

366
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,630
Hello.

367
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:11,713
Coproduction.

368
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:12,981
Let go of me!

369
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:15,213
Ow, that hurts!

370
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,535
<i>Name of the visitor?</i>

371
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:28,838
<i>Han Ziang.</i>

372
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:30,963
<i>I'm here for my grandson.</i>

373
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:43,755
Huh?

374
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,296
What?

375
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,255
Yes.

376
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,088
Someone's here
to bail you out.

377
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,171
Hello, sir.

378
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:00,088
My grandson is a mechanic trainee.

379
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,713
He just wanted to touch a real thing.

380
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,046
Maybe you can, uh...

381
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,338
- go easy on him?
- Hey.

382
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,880
Transporters are highly valuable
public property.

383
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,338
- Uh...
- Lending out your vehicle pass privately

384
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,171
is also a serious offense.

385
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:17,380
Oh, well.

386
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,088
This is good stuff.

387
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,671
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

388
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:23,921
It's all in here.

389
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,338
Oh, well...

390
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:31,005
Same old trick.

391
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:32,505
Hm?

392
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,130
Stop doing that, old man.

393
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,921
What old man?

394
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,671
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

395
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:00,630
Running away from home.

396
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,522
You're too old to be running away.

397
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:03,380
He is your own father.

398
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:06,147
Where are you going to hide?
You even brought your little sister out?

399
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,046
Outside is dangerous!

400
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:10,296
And you!

401
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,463
You learned to steal now?

402
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:15,838
Huh?

403
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,380
You stole my pass!

404
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,505
Do you do whatever your brother
tells you to do?

405
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:21,171
Are you stupid?

406
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,939
I didn't intend to bring her along.

407
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:24,647
- But she was begging me...
- You're her brother!

408
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:26,338
...to take her.

409
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,546
Liu Qi!

410
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,838
- You're such a liar!
- Here she goes again.

411
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,005
Nicely said.

412
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,630
Ignoring your elder's advice is so...

413
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,106
Why don't you mind your own business?

414
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,647
Don't take it out on the wall,
take it out on me if you...

415
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:38,838
What the hell?

416
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,505
It's an earthquake!

417
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,005
Thirteen Orphans!

418
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:50,338

Emergency authorization code

You know that girl from the other day

520
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:03,463
- was totally consensual.
- You shut up.

521
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:05,046
They are not here for you.

522
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,671
Huh?

523
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,130
Hm.

524
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,005
We are a rescue team, unit CN171-11,

525

533
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:38,891
What could be that important?

534
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,814
<i>Boss!

<i>Wait. Isn't that
the Earth Engine's trigger device?</i>

540

No Earth Engine has shut down
for the past 30 years.

541
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:58,505
This is not a simple rescue mission.

542
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:00,005
A lot of people will die.

543
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,130
<i>Boss!</i>

<i>Clear the road!</i>

563
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:24,880
Liu Zi, report 171's locations.

Unit 09, 13, and 15's signals
were last received at Huaian.

566
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,814
The rest of the units have made it
to the Shanghai Region

567
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:34,130
and are en route to Hangzhou.

568

- Boss.
- You guys go take a look.

569
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,421
- Roger that.
- Yes, sir.

570
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,171
Liu Zi, scout the area.

571
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,796
Our team is up ahead.
The estimated distance is 80km.

572
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,796
Follow the crevasse.
Rendezvous in an hour.

573
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,546
This place worries me.

574
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,588
Pass through as soon as possible.

575
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,130
- Load up. Move out.
- Roger.

576
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,213
<i>Engineer team, stay alert.</i>

Don't be afraid.

587
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,255
This was Grandpa's home.

588
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,380
Look at those tall buildings,

589
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,296
once, they were full of people.

590
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,880
<i>Back then,</i>

591
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:24,796
<i>no one was concerned about the Sun.</i>

592
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,171
<i>Everyone was concerned about</i>

593
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,588
<i>the thing called money.</i>

594
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,796
Grandpa couldn't make
a lot of money back then,

595
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:36,630
but I was happy every day.

596
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,713
<i>Especially on my way home every day,</i>

597
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,255
<i>I could smell from far away
your grandma's cooking.</i>

598
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:49,421
<i>Actually, to be honest,
she could barely cook,</i>

599
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:52,213
<i>except for the scallion noodles.</i>

600
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,463
I tell you,

601
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,338
her scallion noodles...

602
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,130
...were incredibly salty.

603
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,046
But I slurped them up.

604
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,046

MOSS. Where's my son now?

611
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,255
Why are they in Shanghai?

612
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,630
<i>Transporter 373</i>

<i>Thanks for your understanding.</i>

629
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:10,296
I'll resettle the civilians
at the Jiaxing refuge center.

630
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,380
But a transporter needs special skills.

We'll be needing driver Han Ziang.

633

When we get to Jiaxing,
let Grandpa and the others get off.

00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,255
<i>After I leave,</i>

647
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,505
<i>only one guardian can accompany Liu Qi</i>

648
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:03,171
- <i>into the underground city.</i>
- Mama!

649
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,005
<i>She's gravely ill.</i>

650
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,213
<i>She won't hold up much longer.</i>

651
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:09,421
<i>Stopping treatments...</i>

652
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:15,338
<i>...is the only way
to ensure both of you and Liu Qi</i>

653
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,546
<i>will survive.</i>

654
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:19,213
That's enough. I get it.

655
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,130
So be it.

656
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,213
<i>Father...</i>

657
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,255

00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:08,255
Something is about to hit us from behind.

Oh, my god! Am I gonna die here?

675
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,130
Oh, well, death is normal.

676
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:52,630

Let go! Let go.

679
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:05,005
Go away!

680
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:06,963
Let go!

Go!

685
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:23,796
Come on, keep moving.

What? Evacuation?

691
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,671
MOSS, connect me to the UEG.

MOSS, open the cabin!

- Help!

704
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,671
Help!

705
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:39,671
Didn't you say death was normal?

706
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:40,796
Huh?

707
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,963
Help us!

708
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:46,088
<i>Boss, we've lost contact
with the other units.</i>

<i>I can't reach them!</i>

710
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,421
Transport the Lighter Core with me.

711
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:51,731
Chui Zi, Ya Tou, save the others.
Liu Zi, find a way out!

712
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,675
- Everyone, abandon the vehicle!
- Yes, sir!

713
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:57,505
Go!

714
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:00,755
Get inside!

715
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,755
Quick! Get in, quick!

716
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,755
Help us! Help us!

717
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,588
What's going on?

718
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,671
Are you okay?

719
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,875
- Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
- Hurry up!

720
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,546
That is normal.

721
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:25,296
- That is normal.
- Old man, quick on feet.

722
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:38,463
Boss, the Lighter Core works

723
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:41,505
Fuck you!

724
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:44,213
Are you still hauling
this damned ball now?

725
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,630
This is the last Lighter Core
intended for Hangzhou.

726
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,130
We lost all our units.

727
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:53,421
This Lighter Core is Hangzhou's only hope.

728
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:54,630
Nice speech,

729
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,588
but what about my two grandkids?

730
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,755
Boss, this building looks intact.

731
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,755
We can try to climb up from inside.

732
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:16,338
Good.

733
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:17,963
Let's get the Lighter Core out now.

734
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:52,630
- Liu Zi, find a way out.
- Roger.

735
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:00,963
<i>Gang Zi, Zhou Qian. Load the Lighter Core.</i>

736
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,130
Hold on.

737
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:12,505
Load people first.

738
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:19,213
Load... people.

739
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:26,772
<i>Stop wasting time.
Load the Lighter Core and people together!</i>

740
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:32,796
Slow down. I've become acrophobic.

741
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:42,880
Boss, I found an opening.

742
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:45,463
We can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling!

743
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,296
Chui Zi, Liu Zi.
You'll have to find a way out. Go!

744
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,463
Ya Tou, you take over.

745
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,296
Hu Kou! Grandpa! Hurry up!

746
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:14,046
Gang Zi, report position of Lighter Core.

747
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,255
Fiftieth floor.

748
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,421
Below Han Ziang!

749
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:22,921
Here!

750
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:24,005
Here it is!

751
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:27,255
- Right here! The thinnest part!
- Thin?

752
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,298
- Good thing. I'll leave this to you.
- Okay.

753
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:54,546
The pulley can't hold any longer!

754
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,671
Pull up the Lighter Core!

755
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:58,546
- Are you okay, old man?
- Leave me! Pull up quickly!

756
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:06,588
- Wang Lei! Pull my grandpa up!
- Go up quickly.

757
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:08,921
Gang Zi! Your position!

758
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:12,338
The Lighter Core is now at the 75th floor.

759
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:21,463
Old man!

760
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:40,463
Get up here, you old man!

761
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:52,963
Wang Lei, I can't hold it anymore!

762
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:59,213
Old man! Old man!

763
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,130
Let me go, kid.

764
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:21,713
Grandpa!

765
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,338
Grandpa!

766
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,546
Gang Zi!

767
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:46,796
Boss.

768
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:48,088
Gang Zi is gone.

769
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:17,255
Step out of it.

770
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,588
Han Ziang is gone.

771
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:19,711
Get those two out of here.

772
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:21,671
Liu Qi.

773
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,171
- Duoduo, let's move.
- Liu Qi.

774
00:51:24,463 --> 00:51:25,838
- Liu Qi.
- Come on!

775
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:30,463
Hu Kou.

776
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:31,963
Hu Kou.

777
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,588
Are you and Duoduo...

778
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:35,296
safe?

779
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:39,880
Old man.

780
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,088
Move.

781
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,671
Where are you, old man?

782
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,338
I'm going to get you.

783
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:46,005
Grandpa!

784
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:47,713
Grandpa!

785
00:51:47,796 --> 00:51:50,921
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

786
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:04,921
Hu Kou, save Grandpa!

787
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:07,088
Liu Qi, you save Grandpa!

788
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:46,213
<i>On the 17th day
after the Earth stopped spinning,</i>

789
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,838
<i>I saved a child.</i>

790
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:53,838
<i>She was handed over to me
by countless hands.</i>

791
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:59,921
<i>I really don't know who her parents were.</i>

792
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,755
<i>Every soul under the water</i>

793
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,838
<i>is her mother and father.</i>

794
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,838
<i>I named her Han Duoduo.</i>

795
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:17,213
<i>I named her after my daughter.</i>

796
00:53:17,546 --> 00:53:19,838
- Grandpa!
- I am so sorry, old man!

797
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,296
<i>My grandchildren...</i>

798
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,213
<i>- don't be afraid.</i>
- Come up now!

799
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:24,296
<i>From then on,</i>

800
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,338
<i>we are a family.</i>

801
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,088
<i>Hu Kou.</i>

802
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:41,588
<i>As a brother...</i>

803
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:46,255
- <i>you have to watch over your sister.</i>
- Old man!

804
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:48,463
<i>Take Duoduo home.</i>

805
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:01,796
Grandpa!

806
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,171
- Grandpa!
- Duoduo.

807
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,939
- It's dangerous.
- Duoduo!

808
00:54:04,963 --> 00:54:06,505
- Step back.
- Duoduo!

809
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:10,588
Grandpa.

810
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:12,213
Why didn't you save my grandpa?

811
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:20,755
This is our fate!

812
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:23,130
Let my brother go!

813
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:25,046
Duoduo.

814
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:30,088
- Chui Zi. Ya Tou, take them away.
- Yes, sir.

815
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,046
- Don't touch her!
- Duoduo, it's dangerous.

816
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:37,255
Stop moving.

817
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:41,630
You will both freeze to death here!

818
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,005
I'm not leaving with you.

819
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:46,088
I'm going home with my brother.

820
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:48,671
Boss, marching to Hangzhou at full speed,

821
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:49,921
will take three hours...

822
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:51,588
Transporter is gone.

823
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,963
So, I'm no longer useful

824
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:57,755
to you.

825
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:04,171
Give them supplies
and the navigation device.

826
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:05,296
Let's move!

827
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,671
Let's rush to Hangzhou.

828
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,338
Duoduo, let's go home.

829
00:55:10,796 --> 00:55:13,421
Grandpa is gone.

830
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:16,546
Where is our home?

Liu Peiqiang.

851
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:46,963
What are you doing?

852
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:50,213
The space station has broken free!
Earth's communications will be paralyzed.

853
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,296
People on Earth are abandoned.

854
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:53,838
My son is still out there!

855
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:55,921
Have you lost your mind?
Because of your son?

856
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,671
We're in a low consumption mode.

857
00:56:57,755 --> 00:57:00,130
You'll be handed over
to the military court!

858
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:01,796
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

859
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:02,921
See for yourself.

860
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,588
Perhaps MOSS is malfunctioning.

861
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:09,951
It's insubordination.

862
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:13,733
What are you planning to do?

863
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:16,272
Head to the central control module.

864
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,338
Stop the space station.

865
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:22,130
<i>All violators,</i>

866
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,338
<i>stop contact immediately with Earth</i>

867
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,338
<i>and return to hibernation area.</i>

868
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:28,213
<i>Lieutenant Peiqiang...</i>

869
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:32,296
Liu, are you absolutely sure
we have to go through the airlock?

870
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Makarov,

871
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:35,241
maybe you shouldn't come with me.

872
00:57:36,338 --> 00:57:38,213
You won't make it without me, Peiqiang.

873
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:41,796
Plus, let me ask you, do you think
you know the exterior like I do?

874
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,463
Don't forget, we Russians invented
space station 100 years ago.

875
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,713
The airlock wasn't designed for exiting.

876
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:53,716
Are you sure this is going to work?

877
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,630
I'm sure.

878
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,213
We want to take our kids
fishing on Lake Baikal.

879
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:03,463
I'd rather have hotpot in Chongqing.

880
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,460
<i>The central
control module is approaching.</i>

881
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:13,463
Russian cosmonauts are invincible!

882
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:19,546
Grab me on to me, Makarov!

883
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,130
I don't want to die!

884
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:24,588
Makarov!

885
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:26,880
Quick! Pull quickly!
Pull quickly!

886
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,838
Go!

887
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:38,796
I'd rather sleep in the hibernation unit.

888
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:42,796
Jupiter has captured Earth's atmosphere.

889
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,463
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

890
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:54,755
<i>Over there!</i>

891
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:57,046
<i>The distress signal is coming from there.</i>

892
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,338
Even air rescue's plane has crashed.

893
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:14,463
- An intact transporter.
- Yeah.

894
00:59:15,463 --> 00:59:17,463
It could be the source
of the distress signal.

895
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,147
I'll check the transporter.

896
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:21,338
You go onboard for shelter.

897
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:23,046
Search for anything useful.

898
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:32,064
Anybody, come help!

899
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,408
- Let go of me!
- Liu Qi!

900
00:59:34,296 --> 00:59:35,546
Pull her!

901
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:37,505
I'm going to kill her!

902
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:42,605
Come here, quick!

903
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:44,338
You! Calm down!

904
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:45,939
We are a rescue unit.

905
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:54,588
It's okay.

906
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,755
Calm down. Calm down.

907
01:00:05,796 --> 01:00:07,588
The mission of our rescue unit

908
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,671
is to restart the Torque Engines
along the equator.

909
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:13,231
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.

910
01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:16,171
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

911
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,505
I don't know
how many aircrafts had survived.

912
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Thank you.

913
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,671
Calm yourself. Talk to us after you eat.

914
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:25,713
Huh?

915
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:28,421
Why is there a foreigner
in a Chinese rescue unit?

916
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:29,755
Who's a foreigner?

917
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,338
My father is from Beijing.

918
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,630
I am an authentic...

919
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,505
Chinaman.

920
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:39,880

921
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:41,296
Well, that's good news.

922
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,463
We can go home.

923
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,463
Man, you can operate it?

924
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:48,046
Yes. And?

925
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,338
Everyone. We've got to hurry.

939
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,838
The engines along the equator
are the more important.

940
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:41,641
It'll take more than ten hours

Huang Ming! Huang Ming!

958
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,397
Check the status
of the Lighter Core, and keep moving.

959
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:13,939
- Boss! Boss, we no longer have a target.
- Keep moving, am I clear?

960
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,147
- Step aside.
- What's the point?

961
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:16,046
- Why?
- This Lighter Core is the only hope

Yes, no more deaths.

But Han Ziang, Gang Zi, Huang Ming!

967

and all those lives of our rescue unit
have died in vain.

01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:52,213
It's our only chance to go home.

976
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:55,546
What?

977
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:56,880
No one is forcing you.

978
01:04:57,421 --> 01:04:59,255
You can switch with them anytime.

979

Boss, where are you going?

985
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:31,838
There is a Lighter Core onboard.

986

<i>Please assist us to rescue Sulawesi.</i>

988
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:57,130
Everyone, our mission is to restart
Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

989
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,338
Only a handful of Lighter Core
can make it now.

990
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,213
The survival of Earth depends on us.

991
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:04,213
Who are you? Where are you coming from?

992
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:05,296
Li Yiyi.

993
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:08,046
- Emergency technical observer of UEG.
- Oh.

994
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,046
What a high rank
for someone so young.

995
01:06:15,963 --> 01:06:17,088
When this is over,

996
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:21,380
I will settle the score,
for my grandpa, with you.

997
01:06:30,546 --> 01:06:31,755
Head South.

998
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:33,630
We're going to Sulawesi.

999
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,130
<i>Will all violators

<i>and return to hibernation area?</i>

1001
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,005
I've got to correct you.

1002
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:03,046
It will take more than 2,500 years

1003
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,963
for frozen Lake Baikal to liquefy.

1004
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:06,171
That's okay.

1005
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,046
We have children,

1006
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:10,713
and their children will have children.

1007
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:14,213
There'll be a day
that ice turns into water.

1008
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:20,630
There's another 20
to 30 meters until A3 intersection.

1009
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,963
Look! A1 intersection exploded.

1010
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:30,796
Maybe there are others
who knew about the insubordination too.

1011
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,463
And they are trying to make their way
to the central control module.

1012
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:36,130
Makarov, stay close to me!

1013
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:37,838
Hurry! Climb quickly!

1014
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:44,296

1015
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:55,088
Makarov!

1016
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:58,005
Somebody help me! I want to go home!

1017
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,713
Liu Peiqiang!

1018
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:11,255
Just one more cabin
till the A3 intersection.

1019
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:12,755
Let's jump! We can do it!

1020
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,546
The central control module's approaching.

1021
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,838
Jump!

1030

Once crossed...

1049

it's the dark side of Earth.

Maybe.

Why is it here?

1068
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:15,671
It had swam this far.

1069
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:16,915
It was probably heading home.

1070
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:19,088
Heading home?

1071
01:12:20,171 --> 01:12:23,546
Once the mission is completed,
you can reunite with your father.

1072

When I was a child,

1073
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:29,963
someone told me that
he is just like a star in the sky.

1074
01:12:30,671 --> 01:12:32,463
When I lift my head, I'll see him.

1075
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,630
Later, I realized it was all lies,
you know?

1076
01:12:36,713 --> 01:12:37,713
In Beijing...

1077
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,796
it's impossible to see the stars.

1078
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,296
Actually, in my heart...

1079
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:48,255
that star no longer exists.

1080
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:52,380
Grandpa told me
to watch over my sister...

1081
01:12:53,046 --> 01:12:54,296
and take Duoduo home.

1082
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:57,380
I'll do that.

1083
01:12:58,463 --> 01:12:59,713
I'll take Duoduo home.

1084
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,880

1090

<i>Once the readings rise back to normal,</i>

<i>The UEG was informed,</i>

<i>but still chose to perform

<i>But this mission was predetermined

<i>The evacuation of the space station</i>

We're all dying! We're all dying!

1133
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:38,546
<i>You are all heroes of the Earth.</i>

1134
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:41,713
<i>We will forever remember to honor you.</i>

1135
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,171
<i>We will shoulder your aspirations</i>

1136
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:47,255
<i>and send it to our new home</i>

1137
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,755
<i>in 2,500 years.</i>

1138
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,088
<i>Everything will come to an end...</i>

1139
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,755
<i>in the last seven days</i>

1140
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:56,130
<i>before Earth collides with Jupiter.</i>

1141
01:15:56,213 --> 01:15:58,255
<i>Let us go home.</i>

1142
01:15:58,338 --> 01:16:00,098
<i>Hug your parents.</i>

1143
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,671
<i>Kiss your beloved partner and children.</i>

1144
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:07,838
<i>Gather with your family
for a proper goodbye.</i>

1145
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:09,630
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

1146
01:16:09,713 --> 01:16:11,272
<i>End of broadcasting.</i>

1147
01:16:11,296 --> 01:16:12,296
<i>Farewell.</i>

1148
01:16:13,921 --> 01:16:15,671
Hu Kou, I wanna go home.

1149
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:24,046
Seven days, where? Yeah, right!

1150
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,588
Within a day,
our atmosphere would be drained empty.

1151
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:31,130
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.

1152
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:34,255
Where are the seven days
you were talking about?

1153
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:38,463
CN171-11, all members move
immediately onboard.

1154
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:42,838
Ready to evacuate.

1155
01:16:43,338 --> 01:16:45,463
Screw you, damn Jupiter!

1156
01:16:45,546 --> 01:16:47,421
Screw you, Jupiter!

1157
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,338
<i>Please get ready,
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

1158
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:58,546
<i>MOSS will assist your return
to the backup hibernation unit.</i>

1159
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:08,046
MOSS, this is an emergency communication.

1160
01:17:08,463 --> 01:17:12,130
Code number 5711 62310.

1161
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:15,296
Let me speak to my son one last time.

1162
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:22,463
<i>Liu Qi is not in his assigned area.</i>

1163
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:24,421
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1164
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,046
<i>Han Ziang is not in his assigned area.</i>

1165
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:28,671
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1166
01:17:28,755 --> 01:17:30,755
<i>Wang Lei is not in his assigned area.</i>

1167
01:17:30,838 --> 01:17:32,171
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1168
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,046
<i>Contact with Transporter 373 was lost.</i>

1169
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,630
<i>Its last transmission
was from Shanghai area.</i>

1170
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:41,005
<i>I can no longer recall your face,
you bastard.</i>

1171
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,380
<i>Jupiter is right in front of me.</i>

1172
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:47,088
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1173
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:51,505
<i>From the day
the Wandering Earth Project initiated,</i>

1174
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:53,921
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

1175
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:03,546
<i>Hey.</i>

1176
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,796
<i>Look, look.</i>

1177
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
<i>It's Jupiter.</i>

1178
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,338
<i>The largest planet in the Solar System.</i>

1179
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,421
<i>Daddy, there's an eye on Jupiter.</i>

1180
01:18:11,505 --> 01:18:12,838
<i>That's not an eye.</i>

1181
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:15,171
<i>That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.</i>

1182
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,963
<i>Jupiter is like a huge balloon...</i>

1183
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:24,588
<i>composed of 90 percent...</i>

1184
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:25,713
<i>Hydrogen.</i>

1185
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:35,171
Li Yiyi!

1186
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:37,296
If we mix Jupiter's
and Earth's atmospheres,

1187
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,546
<i>is that combustible?</i>

1188
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,338
<i>By now, Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.</i>

1189
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,755
<i>The combustion shockwave
will be over Mach 1,000.</i>

1190
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:51,606
<i>The generated force
will be sufficient to push Earth away.</i>

1191
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,421
A hydrogen-oxygen mixture can be ignited
with a single match.

1192
01:18:54,505 --> 01:18:55,921
All we need now is a match.

1193
01:18:56,338 --> 01:19:00,005
No, no, the distance between planets
is over 70,000 kilometers.

1194
01:19:00,088 --> 01:19:02,213
Even ballistic missiles
can't reach that far!

1195
01:19:03,046 --> 01:19:04,046
Li Yiyi.

1196
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:05,838
What about this match?

1197
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:07,005
What match?

1198
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,005
I can modify
the engine's operating system...

1199
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,005
I can blast the beam much higher!

1200
01:19:21,338 --> 01:19:25,546
Wang Lei, Jupiter's combustion shockwave
can propel Earth out from Jupiter.

1201
01:19:27,338 --> 01:19:28,463
Yes, I'm listening.

1202
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:29,921
No need to yell.

1203
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:32,755
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

1204
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:37,213
That's a suicide mission.

1205
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:40,546
Yes, but it's much better
than waiting to die.

1206
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:42,838
Anyone wanna quit?

1207
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,255
<i>The Helios Project's
evacuation procedure is initiated.</i>

1208
01:20:18,671 --> 01:20:21,755
<i>All rescue units...
All rescue units are evacuating.</i>

1209
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:24,564
<i>Calling Navigation
Platform International Space Station.</i>

1210
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:26,171
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1211
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,755
Repeat, calling Navigation Platform
Space Station.

1212
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:30,130
We came up with a new plan.

1213
01:20:30,213 --> 01:20:31,338
Please respond.

1214
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:33,421
All communications have been blocked.

1215
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:35,272
Attention, everyone.

1216
01:20:35,296 --> 01:20:37,171
We only have 30 minutes left.

1217
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:38,838
This mission has three steps.

1218
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:41,046
Step one. Shut the engine down
to gain control.

1219
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,397
There's seven nozzles
in an Earth Engine.

1220
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:48,005
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1221
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:50,713
to generate a plasma beam
that would reach high enough.

1222
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:53,088
Does anyone recall
the <i>12 Chimes of Spring</i> festival?

1223
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:56,255
I wrote that program.

1224
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,171
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1225
01:21:00,963 --> 01:21:02,323
- That was you...
- Boring, I know.

1226
01:21:02,921 --> 01:21:05,202
I'll use it to override the system
so we can have control.

1227
01:21:05,463 --> 01:21:07,671
Step two. Once we override the system,

1228
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:11,088
the auto-unlock mechanism won't work.
So, it has to be unlocked manually.

1229
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:15,130
Captain Wang and Antenna,
Scarface and Band-Aid.

1230
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,796
- Well, my name is...
- Whatever.

1231
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:21,077
- The manual unlocking depends on you.
- Pretty cool, huh?

1232
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:25,755
The last step. Put the Lighter Core
into the reaction chamber,

1233
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:27,046
reignite the Earth Engine.

1234
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,856
Blast the plasma beam
70,000 kilometers into space

1235
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,880
and light up Jupiter.

1236
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:36,481
The combustion shockwave will travel along
the atmospheric transference,

1237
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:38,505
boom, propelling Earth away.
Get it for me, please.

1238
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,921
Liu Qi, you'll drive the Lighter Core
to the reaction chamber.

1239
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:43,588
Installation procedure, uh...

1240
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:44,796
is basically automatic.

1241
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,588
Hey, China man. You go, you go with him.

1242
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:49,088
Why am I involved?

1243
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:50,463
Are you kidding?

1244
01:21:50,546 --> 01:21:53,463
Installing a Lighter Core
requires a minimum of 13 months training.

1245
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:54,838
Wanna take this place?

1246
01:21:56,505 --> 01:21:57,731
Once the mission is accomplished,

1247
01:21:57,755 --> 01:22:00,005
we all head
to the underground city immediately.

1248
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:02,255
This wave will definitely be a very...

1249
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,088
a very...

1250
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,505
humongous.

1251
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,630
This is a make or break move.

1252
01:22:10,713 --> 01:22:12,130
Succeed or die, any questions?

1253
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:13,213
I...

1254
01:22:13,713 --> 01:22:14,713
Perfect.

1255
01:22:17,463 --> 01:22:18,463
Hey.

1256
01:22:20,046 --> 01:22:21,046
There.

1257
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,338
It's the control center.

1258
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,981
<i>Attention, all evacuating rescue units.</i>

1259
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:32,005
<i>We need your assistance.</i>

1260
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,546
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1261
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,838
<i>We need your support.</i>

1262
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:36,505
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1263
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:47,713
Looks like we are on our own now.

1264
01:22:51,755 --> 01:22:53,171
Oh, mighty Newton.

1265
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:55,005
Enlighted Einstein.

1266
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,713
Holy Hawking.

1267
01:22:56,796 --> 01:22:58,171
Also, Amitabha Buddha.

1268
01:22:58,255 --> 01:22:59,755
Gang Zi will bless us.

1269
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:02,565
I learned the installation procedure...

1270
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:04,796
during my internship.

1271
01:23:06,088 --> 01:23:08,838
Don't forget, your brother is a genius.

1272
01:23:09,088 --> 01:23:10,130
He's a genius.

1273
01:23:44,296 --> 01:23:46,213
Wait. This is an emergency mission.

1274
01:23:46,296 --> 01:23:47,380
We need your help.

1275
01:23:48,463 --> 01:23:49,713
I'm sorry, but it's all over.

1276
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,130
I don't care about your mission.

1277
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:53,189
- I wanna leave in one piece.
- Please you gotta help us.

1278
01:23:53,213 --> 01:23:55,255
Evacuate, it's too dangerous.

1279
01:23:58,671 --> 01:23:59,671
Over here.

1280
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:03,713
Captain Wang. We're counting on you.

1281
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:06,838
Don't worry. Zhou Qian, take Duoduo
upstairs call for backup.

1282
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:07,963
Roger.

1283
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,921
Duoduo, let's go.

1284
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:41,755
The Earth Engine has been shut down.

1285
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:47,671
All right, men, let's hit it.

1286
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,147
<i>It's fully automatic!
What are you browsing at?</i>

1287
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:53,147
<i>Why is the manual so thick
if it's automatic?</i>

1288
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:55,546
What are you doing?

1289
01:24:56,296 --> 01:24:57,338
Shit!

1290
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,963
I'm trying to figure it out!

1291
01:24:59,046 --> 01:25:00,838
Wire cores without color markings.

1292
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:03,546
They need to be in sequence.
Everything is in gray.

1293
01:25:04,463 --> 01:25:07,463
This is for the transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

1294
01:25:07,546 --> 01:25:08,380
Press to speak.

1295
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:11,046
- Huh? What's up there?
- Space station.

1296
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:16,921
Come on. Next.

1297
01:25:18,005 --> 01:25:20,463
Uploading trojan
<i>12 Chimes of Spring</i> festival.

1298
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:47,796
Requesting unit CN171-11.

<i>We're executing our last rescue mission.</i>

1301
01:25:52,838 --> 01:25:53,755
- <i>Requesting support.</i>
- I don't understand.

1302
01:25:53,838 --> 01:25:55,380
Why are these people still trying?

1303
01:25:55,463 --> 01:25:57,505
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

1304
01:25:59,463 --> 01:26:01,671
Unit CN171-11.

1305
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:03,755
<i>We have one last rescue plan.</i>

1306
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:06,338
Requesting support, requesting support!

1307
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:09,963
<i>We're the rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1308
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:12,189
<i>We still have one last rescue mission.</i>

1309
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:13,088
- <i>Requesting support...</i>
- Would be great...

1310
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:15,251
- <i>...requesting support!</i>
- ...if there was miso soup.

1311
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:18,856
<i>We're done with the last one.</i>

1312
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,088
<i>What's next?</i>

1313
01:26:20,213 --> 01:26:21,213
Just one moment!

1314
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:23,005
It should be fully automatic.

1315
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,463
The next step is manual labor.

1316
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:29,088
The program he wrote
lacked the percussion pin procedure.

1317
01:26:33,713 --> 01:26:35,046
<i>You call this...</i>

1318
01:26:35,796 --> 01:26:37,255
<i>a pin?</i>

1319
01:26:39,671 --> 01:26:41,171
No rescue units responding.

1320
01:26:41,255 --> 01:26:42,895
<i>Nobody is responding.</i>

1321
01:27:08,838 --> 01:27:11,338
What is Error 425?

1322
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:12,463
What does it mean?

1323
01:27:13,088 --> 01:27:13,963
Li Yiyi!

1324
01:27:14,046 --> 01:27:15,838
How is this fully automatic?

1325
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:17,296
Didn't I give you the manual?

1326
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,689
- I know, but...
<i>- It's for situations like this.</i>

1327
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:20,588
I know, but what is Error 425?

1328
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:21,963
Read it yourself.

1329
01:27:26,005 --> 01:27:28,189
<i>Warning, Han Ziang illegally operating...</i>

1330
01:27:28,213 --> 01:27:30,046
Li Yiyi, you know what, you are...

1331
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:34,338
Tim. Helmet on!

1332
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:36,546
- Wait a moment!
- Forget about it!

1333
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,630
Okay, what's next?

1334
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:54,713
Fully automatic.
It says it's should be fully automatic.

1335
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,046
Why is it stuck here?

1336
01:28:12,505 --> 01:28:14,963
Without a hardware tweak,
you won't be hacking shit. Let me...

1337
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:16,286
Hu Kou, where are you?

1338
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:17,755
I'm not getting any response.

1339
01:28:17,921 --> 01:28:19,041
There's enough space behind.

1340
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:20,963
More fun crossing in front of you.

1341
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,481
We don't have too much time.

1342
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:32,338
This freaking door is jammed.

1343
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:33,421
Here.

1344
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:48,213
<i>Lao He! How can you fix it
without a diagram?</i>

1345
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:49,380
Shut up. Let me focus.

1346
01:28:49,463 --> 01:28:51,671
The jumpers haven't been touched
in over a decade.

1347
01:28:51,755 --> 01:28:53,921
One mistake, it'll be game over.

1348
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,005
Li Yiyi, the ignitor is ready.

1349
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,921
No. It says installation incomplete.

1350
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:26,380
Looks like it's almost done.

1351
01:29:38,255 --> 01:29:39,255
Liu Qi!

1352
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,380
Liu Qi! Are you completely crazy?

1353
01:29:42,463 --> 01:29:43,671
Save your nonsense.

1354
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,171
Get out and help.

Duoduo. Can you move?

1360
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,588
One, two, three, hold on!

1361
01:31:13,046 --> 01:31:14,088
Liu Qi!

1362
01:31:15,296 --> 01:31:17,005
Have you found the problem?

1363
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:19,130
It's stuck inside.

1364
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:24,505
Li Yiyi.

1365
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:26,338
You go on. Go!

1366
01:31:27,963 --> 01:31:29,630
- Duoduo, leave me here.
- No.

1367
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:31,546
Hurry up and evacuate
to the underground city.

01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:56,755

<i>Hey! Can anyone help us, please?</i>

1375

<i>Please follow MOSS' instructions,
and return to the backup hibernation unit.</i>

<i>It's Han Duoduo.</i>

<i>We still have one last hope.</i>

1380

Duoduo? Are you okay?

1381
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:37,116
<i>Is Liu Qi still there?</i>

1382
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:40,880
We're all here.
We're at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1383
01:32:41,463 --> 01:32:43,314
<i>We'll ignite Jupiter...</i>

01:32:44,505 --> 01:32:45,505
We're gonna need some...

1386
01:32:45,546 --> 01:32:47,588
<i>Unfortunately, seven hours ago,</i>

1387
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:51,213
<i>this plan was already proposed
by the Israeli scientists.</i>

1388
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:53,630
<i>The probability of success is zero.</i>

1389
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,505
Don't worry, Duoduo.

1390
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:57,338
I will try to contact the UEG.

1391
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:04,630
<i>Details of the plan have been uploaded.</i>

UEG, I'm Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

1395
01:33:18,213 --> 01:33:19,397
Please send a global order now

1396
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:23,755
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of Sulawesi as reinforcements.

1402
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:48,005
Today...

1403
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:50,726
it's the first day
of the Chinese New Year.

1404
01:33:52,713 --> 01:33:54,421
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

1405
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:58,546
As a father,

1406
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,630
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

1407
01:34:01,463 --> 01:34:02,713
I won't give up.

1408
01:34:04,755 --> 01:34:06,546
We have nothing to lose.

1409
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,851
For the sake of our children...

1410
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:12,671
I'm begging you.

1411
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,505
<i>As a United Earth Government,</i>

1412

<i>we cannot accept your request.</i>

1413
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:22,713
<i>However, as a private individual,</i>

1414
01:34:23,338 --> 01:34:26,963
<i>I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.</i>

1415
01:34:27,338 --> 01:34:31,463
<i>And the rest will be up to the will
of each individual.</i>

1416
01:34:32,796 --> 01:34:35,022
I don't understand
why should this happen to us?

1417
01:34:35,046 --> 01:34:36,421
Please, help me look...

1418
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,064
- We have no hope to live.
- Please, I can't find...

1419
01:34:38,088 --> 01:34:39,731
- Be careful.
- We have no hope to survive.

1420
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:41,546
Somebody...

1421
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:44,213
<i>Hello, personnel from every rescue unit.</i>

1422
01:34:45,338 --> 01:34:46,921
<i>My name is Han Duoduo.</i>

1423
01:34:47,588 --> 01:34:49,838
<i>I'm a middle school student.</i>

<i>My legs are trembling.</i>

1427

<i>Everybody is going all out,</i>

1428
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,338
<i>but there is nothing I can do to help!</i>

1429
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,505
Yesterday, my teacher asked us.

1430
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:12,338
<i>"What is hope?"</i>

1431
01:35:13,088 --> 01:35:14,463
<i>In the past,</i>

1432
01:35:14,921 --> 01:35:17,838
<i>I never, never believed in hope.</i>

1433
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:20,505
But now, I do believe in hope.

1434
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,755
I believe
that for the times we're living in now,

1435
01:35:24,463 --> 01:35:27,630
<i>hope is precious like a diamond.</i>

1436
01:35:28,755 --> 01:35:30,671
<i>Hope.</i>

1437
01:35:30,755 --> 01:35:33,880
<i>Hope is the only way to guide us home.</i>

1438
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:37,588
Please come back
and fight together with us.

1439
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:40,213
Light up Jupiter,
let's all save our planet.

1440
01:35:42,046 --> 01:35:45,463
We located at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine,

1441
01:35:45,546 --> 01:35:47,630
under the command of Captain Wang Lei.

1442
01:35:48,463 --> 01:35:51,130

<i>The global broadcast is over.</i>

1446
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:03,255
I... I want to go home.

1447
01:36:05,171 --> 01:36:06,630
I wanna see my mother.

1448
01:36:07,463 --> 01:36:09,171
Listen, when the Earth is destroyed,

1449
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,838
there'll be nobody, nobody left to see!

1450
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:14,713
We're going back.

1451
01:36:19,005 --> 01:36:21,213
Allright, let's go! Let's go!

1452
01:36:21,296 --> 01:36:23,838
We're not unlikely
to make it home in seven days.

1453
01:36:23,921 --> 01:36:27,005
Why are we returning then?
What's the point?

1454
01:36:52,755 --> 01:36:53,939
Coordinates located.

- I'm pulling!

1464
01:37:28,046 --> 01:37:29,588
I can't pull it again!

1465
01:37:29,671 --> 01:37:31,838
- Pull me out!
- I can't! It's too heavy!

1466
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:34,380
Tim! Tim!

No!

1471

Liu Qi! Pull me up! I don't want to die!

1472

Lao He! The reaction chamber is ready!
Are you done or not?

1473
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:07,463
Death is normal.

1474

<i>Still 5,000 kilometers short.</i>

1504
01:41:45,338 --> 01:41:47,380
What? Li Yiyi!

1505
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,005

01:42:04,463 --> 01:42:06,963
<i>We cannot hold any longer.</i>

1512

There's another way.

1513
01:42:23,213 --> 01:42:24,963
Liu Qi, Wang Lei, We still have a chance.

1514

Hang on.

A civilization without lives

01:49:50,963 --> 01:49:53,213
I'm heading to the backup elevator
to pick up the others.

1609
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:54,713
Five minutes left!

1610
01:49:54,796 --> 01:49:56,755
<i>Get down now! This is an order!</i>

1611
01:49:57,046 --> 01:49:58,088
Yes, sir!

1612
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:08,890
<i>Duoduo! Watch out!</i>

1613
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:13,338
Boss! Hey, boss! Boss!

1614
01:50:15,171 --> 01:50:16,255
Duoduo!

1615
01:50:17,505 --> 01:50:19,921
She's here!

1616
01:50:22,588 --> 01:50:25,463
- Duoduo.
- Get Duoduo out of here.

1617
01:50:25,546 --> 01:50:27,005
I can't hold on any longer.

1618
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,838
Backup elevator collapsed.

1619
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:38,046
Li Yiyi, do you have any other way?

1620
01:50:39,463 --> 01:50:41,130
Wang Lei! Wang Lei!

1621
01:50:41,213 --> 01:50:42,671
Li Yiyi.

1622
01:50:42,755 --> 01:50:44,171
Hurry up and think of something!

1623
01:50:46,005 --> 01:50:49,213
Earth Engine!
We can try hiding under the Earth Engine!

1624
01:50:49,296 --> 01:50:52,439
<i>If the thrust of the Earth Engine
can counteract the force of the shockwave,</i>

1625
01:50:52,463 --> 01:50:54,263
- <i>you guys can still stand a chance!</i>
- Liu Qi.

1626
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:56,046
I cannot get out.

1627
01:50:56,963 --> 01:50:58,130
Go, now.

1628
01:50:58,255 --> 01:50:59,421
Liu Qi!

1629
01:51:00,505 --> 01:51:01,505
Go!

1630
01:51:02,046 --> 01:51:03,421
Hurry!

1631
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:21,088
<i>Members of rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1632
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:22,546
<i>Attention.</i>

1633
01:51:23,963 --> 01:51:25,255
<i>This is...</i>

1634
01:51:25,338 --> 01:51:26,546
<i>an order.</i>

1635
01:51:30,463 --> 01:51:31,630
<i>Live on.</i>

1636
01:52:52,213 --> 01:52:54,296
Liu Qi! Duoduo!

1637
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,213
The transporter!

1638
01:53:35,296 --> 01:53:37,463
The transporter is falling down!

1639
01:54:19,796 --> 01:54:21,046
We...

1640
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:23,963
We finally made it.

1641
01:54:28,838 --> 01:54:30,880
<i>Warning. Low temperature.</i>

1642
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,130
<i>Warning. Please check helmet's seal.</i>

1643
01:54:34,588 --> 01:54:36,838
<i>Warning. Low temperature.</i>

1644
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,963
<i>Warning. Please check helmet's seal.</i>

1645
01:54:40,046 --> 01:54:41,630
Liu Qi.

1646
01:54:41,713 --> 01:54:43,130
Help!

1647
01:54:43,213 --> 01:54:44,505
Tim! Get down here!

1648
01:54:44,588 --> 01:54:45,689
Right away, I'm coming!

1649
01:54:45,713 --> 01:54:47,233
- Help us!
- Right away!

1650
01:55:35,463 --> 01:55:36,588
<i>Earth...</i>

1651
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,588
<i>survived.</i>

1652
01:55:47,171 --> 01:55:48,171
<i>The Sun</i>

1653
01:55:48,338 --> 01:55:50,630
<i>is located at the Milky Way's Orion arm.</i>

1654
01:55:50,713 --> 01:55:54,463
<i>Its mass constitutes 99.68 percent
of the Solar System.</i>

1655
01:55:55,755 --> 01:55:58,796
<i>Now, the core of the Sun
is rapidly degenerating</i>

1656
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,022
<i>- and expanding.</i>
- Go to have a look there!

1657
01:56:00,046 --> 01:56:01,505
<i>Earth will be engulfed.</i>

1658
01:56:02,505 --> 01:56:06,505
<i>To survive, mankind began
a groundbreaking project</i>

1659
01:56:06,588 --> 01:56:08,088
<i>to maneuver the entire planet</i>

1660
01:56:08,171 --> 01:56:11,546
<i>to a new home
located 4.2 light years away.</i>

1661
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:13,421
I miss you all so badly!

1662
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,711
- Hi, guys.
- Sir.

1663
01:56:16,338 --> 01:56:18,838
<i>The project is divided into five phases.</i>

1664
01:56:18,963 --> 01:56:22,463
<i>Phase one. Mankind will construct
10,000 thrusters</i>

1665
01:56:22,546 --> 01:56:23,731
- <i>for Earth's propulsion...</i>
- Hey, that's him.

1666
01:56:23,755 --> 01:56:25,338
<i>...called Earth Engines,</i>

1667
01:56:25,421 --> 01:56:28,546
<i>along with 10,000 underground cities
to protect human lives.</i>

1668
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:29,838
I... I didn't do it.

1669
01:56:30,505 --> 01:56:31,838
See you!

1670
01:56:33,088 --> 01:56:34,505
<i>Phase two.</i>

1671
01:56:34,588 --> 01:56:37,921
<i>Activating the Torque Engines
encircled along the equator</i>

1672
01:56:38,005 --> 01:56:40,130
<i>to stop Earth's rotation.</i>

1673
01:56:40,213 --> 01:56:41,213
<i>A non-rotating Earth</i>

1674
01:56:41,255 --> 01:56:43,838
<i>will create mega tsunamis
that will sweep through the planet,</i>

1675
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:46,296
<i>eradicating half of the global population.</i>

1676
01:56:50,338 --> 01:56:51,647
I'm all set and ready to go.

1677
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:53,005
If there is no accident...

1678
01:56:54,505 --> 01:56:56,689
- <i>Phase three. The Earth...</i>
- ...in three hours...

1679
01:56:56,713 --> 01:56:58,314
<i>will use the gravitational force
of the Sun</i>

1680
01:56:58,338 --> 01:57:00,630
<i>and Jupiter for final acceleration,</i>

1681
01:57:00,713 --> 01:57:02,921
<i>embarking on a voyage of wandering.</i>

1682
01:57:03,005 --> 01:57:04,125
Will your sister come along?

1683
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,380
Screw you.

1684
01:57:07,963 --> 01:57:09,088
After all these years,

1685
01:57:09,963 --> 01:57:11,088
you haven't changed one bit.

1686
01:57:13,213 --> 01:57:14,213
<i>Phase four.</i>

1687
01:57:14,588 --> 01:57:18,421
<i>When the Earth leaves the Solar System,
the Earth Engines will turn on full power,</i>

1688
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,671
<i>spending 500 years to accelerate
to five one thousandths</i>

1689
01:57:21,755 --> 01:57:25,380
<i>of the speed of light,
then gliding for 1,300 years.</i>

1690
01:57:25,463 --> 01:57:28,296
<i>After that,
reversing Earth Engines' directions,</i>

1691
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,880
<i>spending another 700 years
in deceleration.</i>

1692
01:57:35,963 --> 01:57:36,796
Liu Hu Kou.

1693
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,046
Where have you been?

1694
01:57:38,713 --> 01:57:40,130
Why is Li Yiyi here too?

1695
01:57:41,088 --> 01:57:42,088
<i>Phase five.</i>

1696
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:44,338
<i>Earth begins to join
the targeted sollar system,</i>

1697
01:57:44,421 --> 01:57:45,713
<i>arriving at our new home</i>,

1698
01:57:46,046 --> 01:57:48,630
<i>becoming a new planet
of the targeted sollar system.</i>

1699
01:57:48,713 --> 01:57:52,505
Stop calling me Hu Kou.
Where are your manners?

1700
01:57:54,046 --> 01:57:55,046
Call me brother.

1701
01:57:55,338 --> 01:57:56,755
<i>Liu Qi.</i>

1702
01:57:56,838 --> 01:57:58,338
<i>Junior driver.</i>

1703
01:57:58,421 --> 01:58:01,921
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division
reminds you.</i>

1704
01:58:02,463 --> 01:58:04,130
<i>Routes are countless.</i>

1705
01:58:04,213 --> 01:58:06,296
<i>Safety is foremost.</i>

1706
01:58:07,213 --> 01:58:09,005
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

1707
01:58:09,088 --> 01:58:11,296
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

1708
01:58:16,963 --> 01:58:19,005
<i>Can you drive? Liu Hu Kou!</i>

1709
01:58:19,088 --> 01:58:22,213
<i>Li Yiyi! You're blocking my view
with that bag!</i>

1710
01:58:22,296 --> 01:58:24,421
<i>Not my fault.</i>

1711
01:58:25,463 --> 01:58:28,380
<i>How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?</i>

1712
01:58:28,838 --> 01:58:31,005
<i>This project will last
for 100 generations.</i>

1713
01:58:31,088 --> 01:58:33,772
- Be careful, someone is there!
- Oh, shit, what's going on?

1714
01:58:33,796 --> 01:58:36,963
<i>We have no idea
what the new Sun at 4.2 light years away</i>

1715
01:58:37,046 --> 01:58:38,380
<i>will bring to our new home.</i>

1716
01:58:38,755 --> 01:58:42,171
<i>But from this day on,
the courage and perseverance of mankind</i>

1717
01:58:42,255 --> 01:58:44,338
<i>will be etched among the stars.</i>

1718
01:58:45,005 --> 01:58:47,213
<i>This long voyage of hope through despair</i>

1719
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:50,213
<i>will last 2,500 years across the cosmos.</i>

1720
01:58:50,755 --> 01:58:53,671
<i>It is also known as
the Wandering Earth Project.</i>
