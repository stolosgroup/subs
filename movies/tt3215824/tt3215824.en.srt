Morning, ma'am.

18
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,033
I'm with the Fire Department,
he's with Florida Gas.

19
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:31,283
Yeah, our system alerted us to a gas leak
where our main feeds into your boiler.

20
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,867
Is your husband home?

21
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,742
He's in the shower.
Should we get out of the house?

22
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:38,408
No, this is as likely a computer
error as an actual leak, but...

23
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,367
we should check to be safe.

24
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,825
- May we come in?
- Please, yes.

25
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,658
- Thank you, ma'am.
- [woman] Yeah, thank you.

26
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,367
Hey, how far away
is Jacksonville?

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,617
With traffic? Six hours.

28
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,075
Maybe more.

29
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,033
You got blood on your shirt.

30
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,158
You should change
before we continue.

31
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,908
Well I'd hate to take a detour.
This'll be on the news in a half hour.

32
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,033
If he has any sense he'll
be on the move already.

33
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:27,033
Uh, it'll take him a day to get
the courage, another to plan it.

34
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:30,658
We'll be there, besides.
We don't take unnecessary risks.

35
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,992
- I'm sorry.
- Happens.

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,450
Come on, bud.
We're gonna be late.

45
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:16,367
It could also mean, like,
very slow to understand.

46
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,783
I'm pretty sure I was that.

47

That makes more sense.

48
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,867
Just tell her you're sorry

- We're playing hooky.

Oh, I bet. Mean and sexy.

96
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,950
Why'd they put you
in a fire tower?

97
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,200
Well, I'm just lucky, I guess.

98
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,825
- Yeah, fuck them and their tests.
- [Ryan] Assholes.

I'd really like today to
go different than last year

105
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,992
and the year before that and every other
fucking year that came before that.

106
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,117
- Last year was fun.
- All right. Last year <i>was</i> fun.

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,992
So, who can tell me
what the goal of the day is?

Threesome sounds
pretty good.

Or winning the lottery.

110
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,450
Threesome for you
<i>would</i> be winning the lottery.

111
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,117
- That's fucked up.
- Very true.

112
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,658
[Ethan] The goal, you fucking
clowns, for the day...

113
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,367
- No fighting.
- [Ethan] Exactly right.

114
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,033
And please do not jump off of
shit with parachutes, okay?

115
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,700
- Oh, who would do that?
- Oh, I have no idea.

116
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:45,283
I... am older now,
and...

117
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,867
Well, I'm older.

118
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,617
- Just trying to keep you alive.
- Hey, no, no, hey, hey.

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,575
Don't you worry about that.
That's our job.

120
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,325
You just write the parking
tickets and we'll keep <i>you</i> alive.

121
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:54,950
[Ethan]
Fair enough.

122
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,450
- Make good choices, please.
- Oh, here's to good choices.

123
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,075
- [all] Good choices!
- [Ben] Now we're talking.

124
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,533
I'm feeling naughty.

125
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,450
Well, me being
the team player...

126
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,367
- I guess I can help you with that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

127
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,158
I do not have sex with a man
I have seen shit in the woods.

128
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,867
Get the fuck out of here.
I have the very same rule.

129
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,992
You don't have sex with men
who shit in the woods?

130
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,533
- Who the fuck are you kidding?
- [Hannah] Oh, are we being too loud?

131
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,158
Are we too loud, Ethan?
I'm sorry. I'm so...

132
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,867
- How about this? Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

133
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,700
[all] Congratulations!

134
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,158
[Ben] Come on now.

135
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,575
[man] Would you
just get into this?

136
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,075
Could you just get
your head in the game?

137
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,117
Hey, do you want to
dance with the devil?

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,117
I'm gonna show you how to dance with
the devil right now, you fucker.

139
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,408
- Ooh!
- Listen, the objective is to put it <i>in</i> the hole.

140
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,700
- [Justin] That's what she said.
- I'm gonna show you how to do it, snowflake.

141
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,617
Boss...
you're up, let's go.

142
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,408
I do nothing involving
the word "corn."

143
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,325
[laughs]

144

Yes!

147

See? That's how it's done.

148
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,492
- Nothing left to prove.
- [man] How can I follow that?

149
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,033
Give me that.
This is how you follow it.

150
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:09,325
Yeah! Yeah!

151
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,283
I'm not judging.
I'm just trying to understand.

152

That's your
fucking boyfriend?

Oh, fuck, dude this is perfect!
He's fucking vaping!

He's trying to quit smoking.

Oh, does it hurt?

Hey, eyes on me.
Quit your sulking, all right?

At least I thought you were.

210
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,575
I'm a forensic accountant,
which means...

211
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:15,033
I look for things
that don't add up.

And I found some.

213

The man I work for, he was killed
today because of what I found.

The DA has police protection

a little hard on her.

But you know something,
she's an asshole.

She deserves it.

She's plenty hard on herself

237

need any help from you.

[Ethan] Nothing like arguing with my wife
about how I spoke to my ex-girlfriend.

Especially when
my wife takes her side.

I'm not taking her side,
I'm just not taking yours.

You are taking her side,
because I don't even have a side.

Then you're on her side.

- Yeah, we'll take the truck.
- Roger that.

It's a lot to swallow, Ethan.
How well do you know this guy?

296

He was married to my sister.

- I'm okay, sweetheart.

Sure you don't want
a piece of this steak?

You know I don't
eat that crap.

- Yeah.
- That shit right there is gonna kill you.

I think I rode this
ol' bull back in the '70s.

I don't blame you for
not eating this meat.

I don't know what you want
me to do for you, here.

Well, I'm not sure what
I want you to do, either.

If he's telling the truth,

00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:32,950
What, he's here?
Why is he here?

467
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,492
He's... Fuck! Fuck!

468

00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,075
Hey, wait!

474
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,033
Hey!

475
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,575
Stop!

476
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,492
[Connor grunting]

477
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,867
Come here.

478
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,783
I'm not gonna hurt you.

479
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,825
Stop! Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

480
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:52,783
I want to see where
the blood's coming from.

481
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,033
It's not my blood.

482
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,575
Whose blood is it?

483
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,742
All right, listen.

484
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:04,700
My name is Hannah.
What's yours?

485
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,367
- Fuck you.
- Oh, nice.

486
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,033
I'm a firefighter.

487
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:12,450
I work with the Forest
Service, and I can help you.

488
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,283
All right?

489
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,450
Talk to me and I'm
gonna help you, okay?

490
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,033
[both grunting]

491
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,867
[Hannah] All right.

492
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,450
Good luck!

493
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:24,867
Good luck.

494
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,367
Town is 12 miles that way...

495
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,283
over the Continental Divide.

496
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,950
Have fun with that.

497
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,658
Wait!

498
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:41,575
Yeah?

499
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,867
I have a radio in a tower...
over there.

500
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:56,450
- We can call the sheriff or...
- No, not the sheriff, the news.

501
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:58,992
Can you call the news?

502
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:05,992
Yeah. Sure, I...
I can call whoever you want.

503
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:17,908
You're fucking fast.

504
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,033
Man!

505
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:35,575
- Want me to drop you closer?
- He doesn't want us any closer.

506
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,742
Okay.

507
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:40,200
Pull around the front.
I'll meet you there when we're done.

508
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,617
- What's with the limp?
- It's nothing.

509
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:22,325
You missed the boy.

510
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,200
That seems unlikely.

511
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:27,533
Hmm.

512
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:31,200
We promise absolutes,
and "unlikely" is not an absolute.

513
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:36,117
The man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here,

514
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,950
so assume he was resourceful
enough to have duplicates

515
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,783
of everything we retrieved
from the DA's office.

516
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,825
And assume that those duplicates
are in the possession of that boy.

517
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:51,950
Assume the worst
case scenario.

518
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,117
Assume catastrophe and...

519
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,367
act accordingly.

520
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,992
It's a lot of risk.

521
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,033
That, I am aware of.

522
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:05,325
You have, what, maybe six hours
before this thing's untenable?

523
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:08,033
I can buy us more time.

524
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,950
But they have to
have the stomach for it.

525
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:14,450
I will make them
have the stomach for it.

526
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,867
Should have been
two teams.

527
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,575
Hit 'em
at the same time.

528
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,700
What got us here doesn't really
matter, now, does it, Jack?

529
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,117
- No, it doesn't.
- No, it doesn't.

530
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:29,533
It's a zero-sum game.
Treat it that way.

531
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,283
- Are we going to the station?
- Brother-in-law...

532
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,992
I think.

533
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,658
Maybe we get lucky.

534
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,825
This is a lot of risk
for a boy.

535
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:41,242
Well, they're worried
about what he might know.

536
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,325
And what he saw us do.

537
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:50,950
From this point forward,
we put down anyone who sees our faces.

538
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:55,950
That's gonna bring a lot of attention to
this town. There's enough of that already.

539
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,450
Give 'em something else
to worry about.

540
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,408
Let 'em focus on this
for a while.

541
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:09,325
Yep.

542
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,408
[Ethan] Allie, there's
no sign of Connor.

543
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,200
[Allison]
<i>Well, are they looking?</i>

544
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,450
Yeah, they're gonna set up
a search crew, but...

545
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,325
[brakes screech]

546
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:32,033
<i>Ethan?
Ethan, are you still there?</i>

547
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:53,117
[Hannah] Oh, God.

548
00:44:57,492 --> 00:44:58,575
[exhales]

549
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,742
Let's get you warm.

550
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,158
You hungry?

551
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,992
No.

552
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:23,075
Well, you should eat anyway.

553
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,367
Here. Here's some...

554
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:30,283
Candy and shit in it. Here.

555
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,742
So, here's the deal, buddy.

556
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:42,117
The tower was hit by lightning.
Everything is fried.

557
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,325
So we can't...

558
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,950
[groans in pain] Fucker.

559
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,825
So we can't
call the sheriff, or...

560
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:51,783
fuck me... anybody.

561
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,075
We are gonna have to
hike to town.

562
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:57,575
[exhales heavily]

563
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:05,408
So I need to know whether
we should do that tonight,

564
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,492
or if we can wait
till morning.

565
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:10,950
Are you in trouble?

566
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,117
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

567
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,408
Anyone else in trouble?
Anyone we need to be looking for?

568
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,533
Not anymore.

569
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,867
[sniffling]

570
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,867
All right.

571
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,950
Well...

572
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,825
You don't seem
much up for a hike.

573
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,700
My dad said if anything
happened to him,

574
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,908
I should find someone
I can trust.

575
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,617
Something happen
to your dad?

576
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,117
Are you someone
I can trust?

577
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:32,367
I'm absolutely
someone you can trust.

578
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,367
[exhales, clears throat]

579
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,950
[sniffling]

580
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,158
Where'd they find him?

581
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:17,492
On the road.

582
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,283
I hid under a tree.

583
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:23,200
And ran down to the creek.

584
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,408
'Cause creeks lead to rivers,
and rivers lead to towns.

585
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,658
That they do.

586
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,492
All right. Okay.

587
00:48:36,908 --> 00:48:41,075
- Are we leaving tonight?
- We're leaving right now.

588
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:49,033

00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,700
Babe, I have been calling...

593
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,617
- Can I help you?
- I'm Agent Freers, this is Agent Michaels.

594
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,450
Were with the FBI.
Is Deputy Sawyer here?

595
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,617
He's still on duty.
You can try him on your radio.

596
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,450
- We run different frequencies.
- Change the channel.

597
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,658
We spoke earlier and he
asked us to meet him here.

598
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,158
Do you mind if we come in?

599
00:49:17,908 --> 00:49:19,200
Yes, I do.

600
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,533
Show me your hands.

601
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,075
House is clear.

602
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,742
I think she's pregnant.

603
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:02,950
You pregnant?

604
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:08,867
- How many months?
- Six.

605
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,492
Boy or girl?

606
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:14,742
Girl.

607
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:18,742
Well, I want you to think about
her when I ask you these questions.

608
00:50:21,158 --> 00:50:23,367
You run a survival school?

609
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:29,200
Telling me the truth
is how you survive.

610
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,700
- Is the boy here?
- No.

611
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,575
- Has he been here?
- No.

612
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,867
- Have the police found him?
- Not that I know of and I would know.

613
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,367
- But this is where he'll come?
- I don't know.

614
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:50,367
Now, that sounds like you're telling
us the truth, Allison, but...

615
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,617
we have to know.

616
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:58,033
I am telling the truth.

617
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,908
I have to know.

618
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,742
I am telling the truth!

619
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,450
I have to know.

620
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:14,450
[sobbing]
I'm telling the truth.

621
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,117
Okay, my husband found him!
My husband found him!

622
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,950
- He's with my husband!
- Where'd he take him?

623
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know, he didn't tell me!
But I can call him!

624
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:24,117
- I can call him!
- [Jack] Okay.

625
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:26,783
Call him.

626
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,742
Where's the phone?

627
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,075
You keep this
conversation casual.

628
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,575
You hear me?

629
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:54,783
Okay.

630
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,158
[Ethan] <i>Hey, baby, I'm dealing
with this fire. What's going on?</i>

631
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:04,408
Hey, babe, how's the...
how's the boy?

632
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,325
- <i>What?</i>
- Is he hungry?

633
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:08,450
I bet he's hungry. I'll make him
something to eat if he's hungry.

634
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,825
That's a distress word.
You gave him a fucking distress word!

635
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:13,742
[Allison screams]

636
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,575
You fucking survivalists!

637
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,158
You wanna survive? I'll give you
something to fucking survive.

638
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:25,033
- You're pointing that the wrong way.
- No, I'm not.

639
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,492
[Jack screaming]

640
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,658
[screaming]

641
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,367
- You good?
- No, I'm fucking not.

642
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,075
Fuck!

643
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,367
[Hannah] I'm a mother pheasant
plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.

644
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,742
I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant
plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.

645
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:06,408
I'm a pheasant mother plucker,
I pluck mother pheasants.

646
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:09,283
- I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant...
- Pleasant mother fucker...

647
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,867
- [Hannah] Ooh!
- [chuckles] The most pleasant mother...

648
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,575
All right, break's over.

649
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,242
Okay, we gotta get downhill.

650
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:19,325
We're gonna take turns running.
When I say "stop," you stop.

651
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,242
You get down like this,
and I'm gonna run past you.

652
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:23,700
We're gonna keep switching.
Okay, ready? Go, run!

653
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,908
Down!

654
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,658
Run!

655
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,575
Down!

656
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,075
Run!

657
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:58,950
[Connor] No, no.

658
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,867
Please, please.

659
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,450
[Hannah groaning]

660
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,658
You got hit.

661
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,533
Missed me.

662
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:12,783
You got hit.

663
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,033
No, buddy, it missed me.

664
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,908
We gotta go.

665
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,825
He died right in front of me.

666
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,783
[sobbing]

667
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:43,533
Let it out, buddy.
Let it out.

668
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,325
There's no blood trail.

669
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:58,617
- You think we got her?
- It's 50-50, I couldn't see shit.

670
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,533
Ah, fuck.

671
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:04,908
- You okay? Don't look good.
- Well, there's nothing I can do about that now.

672
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:09,450
Go deep.

673
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,075
Allie?

674
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,658
Dispatch, this is Alpha One.
We need two more guys.

675
00:55:23,742 --> 00:55:25,367
- [gunshot whizzes]
- [exclaims]

676
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,700
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop it now!

677
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:33,158
Drop it right fucking now!

678
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:37,200
Drop your fucking weapon!
Step in the road. Step in the road.

679
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:41,575
Stop. Face away from me.

680
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:44,908
You're about to be a father. That's
the only thought I want in your mind.

681
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:47,617
Now, very slowly,
unbuckle your service belt,

682
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,950
drop it to the ground,
toss it to the left.

683
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:56,950
Drop to your knees.

684
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:02,283
Allow yourself
to fall forward.

685
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,283
Fall forward.

686
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,533
Hands behind your back.

687
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,242
- Backup weapon?
- Right ankle.

688
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:16,075
We have another man
with your wife.

689
00:56:16,158 --> 00:56:17,742
On my word,
she will be executed.

690
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:19,075
You will not be
a father anymore.

691
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,783
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

692
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,075
According to your wife,
the boy's with you.

693
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:25,575
Now, if that were true,
there'd be a much bigger

694
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:27,200
police presence
in your yard right now.

695
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,867
The boy hasn't been found.

696
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:32,867
We think he was tossed
from the vehicle in the crash.

697
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,825
There's a search crew who was
gonna go out in the morning,

698
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:37,450
but that got called off
because of the fire.

699
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,533
Search is exactly what
you and I are going to do.

700
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,783
Jack...

701
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,950
You really think we should
leave that loose end?

702
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:49,242
Clock is ticking.
We don't have time to search for both.

703
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:50,575
Okay, let's go.

704
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,283
Up.

705
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,575
[Hannah] A few years from now,
you are gonna find yourself near a lake,

706
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,992
or a forest behind your house,
with some saucy blonde,

707
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:08,658
and you are gonna want to take
full advantage of that situation.

708
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:13,492
Campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls.

709
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:17,950
And all you need is some
fuel, some heat...

710
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,658
and <i>voila!</i>

711
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,783
You're swapping spit
with a cheerleader.

712
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:29,450
- Getting struck by lightning made you weird.
- I was already weird.

713
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,950
You just look sad to me.

714
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:38,575
I look sad?

715
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:49,367
[sighs]

716
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,992
There was a fire last year that
I was in charge of fighting.

717
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:55,367
And...

718
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,492
I thought the wind was doing one
thing, and it was doing another.

719
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:04,283
So instead of fighting it,
we found ourselves running from it.

720
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,575
Which is not where
you want to be.

721
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:15,200
And there were three boys...

722
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,033
around your age...

723
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:23,283
They got caught in the fire,
and all I could do was watch.

724
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,533
I watched my mother
die of cancer.

725
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:38,617
It is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you.

726
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,575
I'm sorry.

727
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,033
Me, too.

728
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,325
All right. Let's just...

729
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,242
Let's get you warm, buddy.

730
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,992
- My dad called me buddy.
- Aw, fuck.

731
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:02,658
I'm sorry,
I won't call you buddy.

732
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,492
No, it's fine.

733
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,450
You can call me buddy.

734
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:15,742
I'm warm. Let's go.

735
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,450
No fucking way
the kid survived that.

736
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,450
Well, he ain't here.

737
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,283
You want to
search up the hill?

738
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:30,617
Like I said,
they'll send a team.

739
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,075
I'll check it out.

740
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,200
I'll tell you this much,
I've seen a thousand wrecks.

741
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:37,283
There's no way somebody survives
that, let alone a kid.

742
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:41,075
Well, good. Should be easy to find then.
So let's start fucking looking.

743
01:00:05,242 --> 01:00:06,325
[exhales]

744
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:25,325
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that?

745
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:28,242
Move.

746
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:40,325
Yeah, the kid made it.

747
01:00:40,408 --> 01:00:43,367
Guess we're about to judge
your tracking skills, deputy.

748
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,450
No, I don't think
you're gonna judge shit.

749
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:53,950
Yeah, I think I'm done.

750
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,575
I think I'm gonna
go ahead, I'm...

751
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:00,658
I'm just gonna
keep my dignity.

752
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,908
Look, we know how this thing's
gonna end, right?

753
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:07,492
Fuck it, I know.

754
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,492
So let's just fucking
do it now, huh?

755
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:15,075
Play your cards right, Deputy,
you could live through this.

756
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:16,658
[laughs sarcastically]

757
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,867
What the fuck do I look like?
Do I...

758
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,367
I look like the stupidest
motherfucker on this planet?

759
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,908
- Take a couple of steps back, Jack.
- Fuck you!

760
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,283
You gonna
let me live, huh?

761
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,867
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck that'd be mistake.

762
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,908
You let me live and
I will shout your description

763
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:32,367
to anybody
who will fucking listen.

764
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,117
- No, you won't.
- I'll fucking hunt you down!

765
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,533
You hear this fucking guy?
If I play my cards right, huh?

766
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:38,783
- I will fucking kill you.
- Fucking kill me. Shoot me.

767
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,700
- What are you waiting for?
- Give me the word, Jack.

768
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:43,242
Come on, give him the word.
I'm gonna fucking die right here!

769
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,742
- Right here!
- Jack, give me the word.

770
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:46,408
Fuck you. And fuck you.

771
01:01:48,325 --> 01:01:49,783
Jack, move left!

772
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,992
[panting]

773
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,992
You will not talk. Ever.

774
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:05,783
You know why?

775
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,908
Because when
we find this boy,

776
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:11,575
I'm not killing him.
You are.

777
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,742
That's how bad I don't want
to shoot a pregnant woman.

778
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:21,617
But you try this shit again,

779
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,825
I will fucking
burn her alive.

780
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,867
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yeah.

781
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:28,200
[Jack] Yeah?

782
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:30,408
Now, track.

783
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,325
Move.

784
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,158
You okay, brother?

785
01:02:52,242 --> 01:02:55,158
You're not making much sense
when you talk.

786
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:58,075
I am so fucking
sick of this place.

787
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:19,242
- Is that a fire?
- Yeah.

788
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,450
And it's a big one.

789
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:30,617
We gotta go back.

790
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:37,325
I'm not going
through that again.

791
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:39,200
We can't go through <i>that.</i>

792
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,242
That eats everything
in its path.

793
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:43,950
I would have seen this from the tower.
I didn't call it in.

794
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:46,742
They're gonna send a chopper
to figure out why.

795
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:49,325
Chopper is that way,
back there.

796
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,867
You don't get through that.
We're going that way.

797
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,158
All right?

798
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,033
Now.

799
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:45,992
[sighs in exasperation]

800
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,242
[sighs] Oh!

801
01:04:49,325 --> 01:04:50,617
You.

802
01:05:05,283 --> 01:05:06,658
[exhales]

803
01:05:14,408 --> 01:05:15,908
[groans in pain]

804
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:17,950
[breathes heavily]

805
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:26,075
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

806
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:29,158
[Hannah groans]

807
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:06,450
- Turn around.
- Why? I don't care.

808
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:08,075
We've shared enough today.

809
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,783
Come on.

810
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,117
Connor. Get down off the bed.

811
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,200
Get down off the bed.

812
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:02,617
[mouthing] Quiet.

813
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:16,992
Listen...

814
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,575
Those men that came for your
father, did you see their faces?

815
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,242
- Yeah.
- Come here.

816
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,325
What?

817
01:07:31,408 --> 01:07:32,783
Is that them?

818
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,200
That's them.

819
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,617
- Get under the bed.
- No. We can't stay here.

820
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,450
I know. Get under the bed.

821
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,075
Go.

822
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,950
Hey, how many people
stay in those?

823
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,492
[Ethan]
Usually one, but...

824
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:58,325
from the looks of it,
there's nobody home.

825
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,617
[Jack] Somebody's home.

826
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,283
What kind of fire watcher leaves
his cabin with a fire burning?

827
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:08,533
What are the chances that
fire watcher has a weapon?

828
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,825
You're in the forest of Montana,
so the chances are pretty good.

829
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:20,033
There's no tactical approach
to the top of that tower.

830
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:22,367
He'll know whoever's up there.
They'll show themselves to him.

831
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,825
We put them all down from here.
It's the safest play.

832
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:28,617
[Patrick] Yeah, I don't have
a better idea.

833
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,158
Hey, you're going
up that tower.

834
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:35,158
Boy's in there,
you're gonna bring him down to me.

835
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:36,992
If he isn't,

836
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,075
start a fire in the middle of that
cabin and burn it to the ground.

837
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,408
- Why burn it?
- So I know you ain't lying.

838
01:08:44,575 --> 01:08:45,825
Go on, go.

839
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,158
Move.

840
01:08:51,992 --> 01:08:53,533
[Ethan sighs]

841
01:08:55,992 --> 01:08:57,533
[horse snorts]

842
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:11,742
Nobody's here!
The door's locked!

843
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:14,325
It won't be the first door
you've kicked in.

844
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,742
Come on, we need
some higher ground.

845
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:28,575
If you're hidden,
you stay hid.

846
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:33,408
There's a rifle trained on me.
There's two of them and they're both armed.

847
01:09:46,992 --> 01:09:49,158
Connor, you're doing great.

848
01:09:49,242 --> 01:09:51,367
You just stay there,
okay?

849
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:54,908
Don't move. Don't talk.

850
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,742
You got a weapon in here, H.?

851
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:02,908
I have a pretty sharp axe.

852
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:05,075
Afraid that's not gonna do it.

853
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,908
I, uh...

854
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,950
I don't know how to
get us out of this.

855
01:10:14,283 --> 01:10:17,575
The fire's gonna be here in about an hour.
That should get us out of this.

856
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,950
We don't have an hour.

857
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:25,617
[sighs] Fuck.

858
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,325
[Patrick] I see nothing.
No movement.

859
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,867
He's just standing there.

860
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,117
I'm fading here, partner.

861
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,450
I know.

862
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,200
Wait, he's talking.

863
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,908
Yeah, he's talking, Jack.

864
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,908
[Ethan]
Get him out of here, H!

865
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:56,158
[Hannah] Run!

866
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:57,533
[gunfire continues]

867
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:01,700
- [Connor screams]
- [Ethan] Come on, Connor!

868
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:05,783
All right! Okay!

869
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:11,450
[gunfire continues]

870
01:11:12,242 --> 01:11:13,992
Go, H!

871
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,658
- Come on!
- Go, Connor! Go!

872
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,492
I got you.

873
01:11:24,408 --> 01:11:26,867
- [Jack] Movement! Running west!
- Fuck.

874
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,450
- [Jack] Take the shot! Take the fucking shot!
- [bullets ricocheting]

875
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,200
I got not shot! Fuck!

876
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:36,700
Okay. We move.

877
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:40,742
- [gunshots]
- Contact, right!

878
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,283
That was a deer rifle.

879
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:53,242
All right, I'll take the
shooter, you take the boy.

880
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:57,992
If there's even a chance that it's her...
I take the shooter.

881
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:01,533
All right.

882
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,575
Rendezvous back here.

883
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,742
Can you cover me?

884
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:08,867
- Moving.
- Move.

885
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,742
[gun firing]

886
01:12:20,658 --> 01:12:21,992
[exhales heavily]

887
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:27,200
[Hannah] Keep going.

888
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,492
Toward the fire?

889
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,117
Yeah, buddy.

890
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,325
[rapid gunfire]

891
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:05,533
- [gunshot]
- [Jack grunts]

892
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:07,658
- [shell casings clatter]
- [Jack groans]

893
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:13,783
[Jack] Just...

894
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:17,325
stop for
a fucking minute!

895
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:27,242
Where's my husband?

896
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,575
Tower.

897
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,825
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

898
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,367
[gun clicks]

899
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,283
You're out.

900
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:43,367
Fuck.

901
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:55,242
[Jack groans]

902
01:14:11,492 --> 01:14:13,408
I hate this fucking place.

903
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,242
It hates you back.

904
01:14:22,242 --> 01:14:24,283
[Allison breathes heavily]

905
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:38,158
[Hannah] Go.

906
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,033
Come on.

907
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:54,617
Come on.

908
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,242
Come here.

909
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:02,450
Come here.

910
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:03,908
Come here.

911
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:06,783
Listen to me.

912
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:09,825
You're gonna run a hundred
yards towards the fire.

913
01:15:09,908 --> 01:15:14,075
You're gonna turn left and you're gonna
keep running until you get to a creek.

914
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,575
When you get to a creek,
you find the deepest, widest part,

915
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:20,617
- and you get in and you lay down.
- No.

916
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,450
- You understand?
- No.

917
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:24,075
- I'm not...
- No, I'm not leaving you!

918
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:26,867
Hundred yards, left. Creek.

919
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:30,200
Hundred yards, left.
Say it.

920
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:33,950
- Say it! Hundred yards...
- Hundred yards, left.

921
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:36,992
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.

922
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,325
When you get there,
what are you gonna do?

923
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:41,158
- Lay down.
- What are you gonna do?

924
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,742
Lay down.

925
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:44,950
Go.

926
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:48,033
Go.

927
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,117
[grunting]

928
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:09,617
Oh, shit. God damn it.

929
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,117
Ethan?

930
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:17,200
Hey, sweet girl.

931
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,283
How did you...

932
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,617
- Where you hit, babe?
- Yeah, I can't...

933
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,617
I can't tell how bad it is.

934
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,992
Will you check for an exit?

935
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:30,950
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

936
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,242
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

937
01:16:35,575 --> 01:16:37,742
How bad is it? Yeah.

938
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:41,825
- It ain't good, babe.
- It's okay. [shushing]

939
01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:43,533
- Okay.
- It's okay.

940
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:45,283
- Okay?
- Yeah.

941
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,825
- Okay.
- Did you get 'em?

942
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:49,367
I got one.
I don't know where the other one is.

943
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:54,325
You did good. All right.

944
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:57,742
You gotta
get out of here now.

945
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,450
- Hey.
