00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,109
{\an5}When I came to this
country, I came with nothing.

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,194
I parked cars
while I went to school.

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,613
And I learned English.

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,992
{\an5}I later worked as a carpenter
until I got myself into college.

6
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,537
That's where Ingrid and I met.

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,080
She was studying interior design

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,957
and I was studying architecture.

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,669
And one year later,
we were engaged.

10
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,393
We had very little money,

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,479
so we got married
at a community center.

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,397
Well, actually a bingo hall.

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,738
We were so in love.

14
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,831
{\an5}Everyone pitched in
with something in the wedding.

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,043
The local pastelería
baked the cake.

16
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,338
My cousin, Junior,
bought me a tux.

17
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,175
{\an5}My Tío Walter
played with his band, Los Inmortales...

18
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,552
until they had to kick us out
the next morning.

19
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,390
{\an5}When her father asked me
how I planned to support his daughter...

20
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,559
I said, "I'm gonna
be an architect."

21
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,813
{\an5}And he said, "An architect?
You should have picked a rich wife."

22
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,950
{\an5}When Sofi was born, I didn't know
how I was gonna look after her...

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,079
{\an5}but I promised myself
she would never struggle the way we did.

24
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,207
Are you gonna work all night?

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,750
No. I'll be right there.

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,212
Oh, I love what
you're doing with it.

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,384
So, I built our house on my own,

28
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,219
and ten years later,

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,302
{\an5}we were the most
sought-after firm in Coral Gables.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,101
So, tell me,
if I did everything right...

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,396
how the hell did I end up here?

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,231
...committed to this marriage.

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,442
{\an5}- That's not fair. It's just unfair that...
- Billy. I understand.

34
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,070
{\an5}- ...she would start with that accusation.
- I understand.

35
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,632
{\an5}- Oh. Sorry for the offense, Your Honor.
- I'm talking about our marriage

36
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,967
and she thinks
it's some personal attack.

37
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,742
How dare I question His Majesty?

38
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,470
{\an5}- Guys, please.
- We're all just supporting characters...

39
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,930
- in the Billy Herrera show.
- Billy and Ingrid...

40
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,554
Let's stop accusing each other,
shall we?

41
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,749
Let's try this exercise instead.

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,753
When you do this, I imagine Y.

43
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,463
Again?

44
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,316
{\an5}It's very effective,
and I don't think we've done it in a while.

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,343
- I can check in my calendar.
- All right. All right.

46
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,054
When you don't answer
after I speak...

47
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,766
I imagine that
you find me boring.

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,311
{\an5}And I don't wanna be
with someone that finds me boring.

49
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,772
I wanna be with someone
that finds me interesting.

50
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,318
{\an5}Not some stubborn old man who's
stuck in a rut and takes me for granted.

51
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,154
{\an5}- You feel you're being taken for granted?
- Oh, yes.

52
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,739
I feel taken for granted.

53
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,675
When you call me a workaholic
and a stubborn old man,

54
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,743
I imagine
that you take for granted

55
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,826
{\an5}everything that I've sacrificed to
get our family to this point in our life.

56
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,999
Look, I never asked for much.

57
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,878
{\an5}We've been marching
to your beat for years, Guillermo Herrera.

58
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,796
It's the same routine.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,133
Sitting, watching sports.
Watching the Fishing Channel.

60
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,676
The Fishing Channel?

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,804
He likes to guess the weight
and the price of the fish.

62
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,972
I'm a fly fisherman.

63
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,183
It's an art form, okay?

64
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,937
{\an5}You watch it, you unwind,
you relax. I work very hard...

65
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,813
For what?

66
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,833
{\an5}...and I felt like you were judging
me on the Fishing Channel thing!

67
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,484
I didn't know
there was a whole channel.

68
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,278
For what?
We have everything we need.

69
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,821
Our daughters are grown

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,951
{\an5}and we should
be free to travel, to go to Greece.

71
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,494
Again with Greece.

72
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,913
{\an5}It's a metaphor!
You won't venture outside your own bubble.

73
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,624
{\an5}Okay, look. I came
to this country with nothing.

74
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,919
{\an5}I slept
on my Tío Walter's floor. I parked cars.

75
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,797
I became an architect,
I built my firm out of nothing.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,092
{\an5}I sent my daughter, Sofi,
to the top law school in New York.

77
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,778
She had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

78
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,553
I supported my daughter, Cora

79
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,865
{\an5}after she dropped out
of college, so please explain to me

80
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,517
{\an5}why is it every time
I come here, I am the bad guy?

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,287
{\an5}All right, look. You both have been
coming here for over a year, right?

82
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,479
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,064
So, I'm gonna ask you
point-blank.

84
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,566
Do you still want this marriage
to work or not?

85
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,902
- I'm here.
- No.

86
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,286
You're not gonna change, Billy.

87
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,955
And I'm tired of trying.

88
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,755
I'm tired too.

89
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,927
Okay.

90
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,772
{\an5}Well, just because your marriage
has devolved into rancor and reprisal

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,932
does not mean that
this divorce has to as well.

92
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,101
Since these issues
are very fresh in your mind,

93
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,062
you both need to gather
your entire family together

94
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,149
and you tell them
without blaming one another.

95
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,860
So, when do we wanna do this?

96
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,863
We'll do it tonight.

97
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,966
{\an5}Absolutely not tonight. My daughter is
coming home from law school tonight.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,093
{\an5}We can't lie to them.
They're gonna read us like a book.

99
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,637
{\an5}It's gonna be a little bit of a harsh
welcome-home party, don't you think?

100
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,833
{\an5}Either way, you're not gonna protect
them from the shock of this divorce.

101
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,044
Thanks for the help.

102
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,128
Great.

103
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
We'll do it tonight.

104
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,230
Huh?

105
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,314
A bigger smile.

106
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,487
{\an5}So, you wouldn't consider
yourself a postmodern kinda guy?

107
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,449
No. Postmodernism
has no regard for tradition.

108
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,618
Neoclassic architecture,
on the other hand

109
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,080
{\an5}demands you that you respect the
lineage of what you're trying to recreate.

110
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,957
So, I'm more neoclassical,
more traditional.

111
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,294
Which is why you have
so many clients in Miami.

112
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,004
Maybe so.

113
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,216
{\an5}I mean, Herrera Architects
alone brought Cuba to Coconut Grove.

114
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,720
{\an5}I think architecture is a great
way for us to connect to our culture,

115
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,013
to our home.

116
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,149
{\an5}Will you excuse me?
I just realized I need to get home.

117
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,522
- Sofi?
- Yes.

118
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
Coral Gables?

119
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,907
Yes. Home sweet home.

120
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,090
Sofi?

121
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,884
She's not here yet.

122
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,761
{\an5}Oh, good. I was thinking,
tonight? It's way too rushed.

123
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,365
{\an5}Perhaps we should take
a little bit more time with Doctor Saeger

124
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,100
{\an5}you know, so we can plan
how to break the news to the girls.

125
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,768
Billy, it's time.

126
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,270
It's too soon.

127
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,397
Why can't we just, you know,
give her a warm welcome

128
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,524
and then we'll break the news
in a few days.

129
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,653
{\an5}Because I need to get this off my
chest. And I'm not gonna lie to them.

130
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,865
Where is my Sofi?

131
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,742
Not here yet, Ma.

132
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,470
{\an5}She must have run out when she
smelled how many onions you're using.

133
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,163
- Really?
- Let me get some oranges.

134
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,999
{\an5}I'm warning you,
do not take over my kitchen today, please.

135
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,752
Oh, and one Vicks isn't enough?

136
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,087
It kept your father alive
for decades.

137
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,631
Yeah. Ma, it's my house.

138
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,758
But Sofi deserves
a good welcome party.

139
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,386
{\an5}Sofi deserves a small family
dinner with Billy, Cora, and me.

140
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,598
{\an5}How can you say that your mother
is not a member of the family, huh?

141
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,810
{\an5}Chi Chi, why don't you stay for
dinner? You know you're my favorite.

142
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,688
I'm not lending you any money.
Has he been gambling?

143
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,482
Where's the graduate?

144
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,068
Hola, Ingrid, Chi Chi.
What's cooking?

145
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,671
{\an5}I'm just trying to fix the ropa
vieja. She added too much onion.

146
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,280
Oh, hey. It smell delicious.

147
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,574
Tío Walter is here.

148
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,701
Tío, why don't you
stay for dinner?

149
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,827
I'd love that.

150
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,708
One happy family.

151
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,461
Please, just a moment.

152
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,633
{\an5}I don't care if you invite
the entire freaking neighborhood.

153
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,635
We had an agreement.

154
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,929
We had a plan.
So we're doing it tonight.

155
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,351
{\an5}Valentina loved
working with Cora and her designs.

156
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,520
Gracias, Cora.

157
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,521
Thank you.

158
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,064
How much longer?

159
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,649
Huan is almost done.

160
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,110
{\an5}She's been going on
about this dress for weeks now.

161
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,820
We're dying to see it.

162
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,572
Oh.

163
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,323
She hasn't shown you the design?

164
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,743
No. She wanted to surprise us.

165
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,829
You didn't show your parents
the sketches?

166
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,998
God, no.
They would have freaked.

167
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,334
Yeah, well, now
they're gonna freak on me.

168
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,795
{\an5}Just don't look my mom
in the eyes when she's yelling

169
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,755
and it'll be over
before you know it.

170
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Ready.

171
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,927
Okay. Well, how do you feel?

172
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,430
Like a woman.

173
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,475
Guess we're just gonna have
to let them freak.

174
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,019
It's not even a dress.

175
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,687
This was an unforgiveable
mistake.

176
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,065
{\an5}But I promise you,
this is not what Ophelia stands for.

177
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,568
What part of "quinceañera gown"
did you not understand?

178
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,196
Not every girl wants to grow up
to be a Disney princess.

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,799
You have worked at this store
for one month

180
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,551
and you already think
you're Stella McCartney.

181
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,243
This is a quinceañera store.

182
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,596
{\an5}Yeah. Well, maybe it's time
you stop being so old-fashioned.

183
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,582
Maybe it's time you found
another place to work.

184
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,833
Already on it.

185
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,128
I thought you'd be more
like your sister.

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,298
That's my ringtone.

187
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,425
Come on, Huan.

188
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,518
Sof?

189
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,728
Wrong daughter.

190
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,812
Hey.

191
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,397
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

192
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,861
What's up? Did Ophelia
like your designs?

193
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:58,157
{\an5}Not really. She decided
she wanted to go in a different direction.

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,076
What kinda direction?

195
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,952
One where I don't work there
anymore.

196
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,162
- I quit.
- What?

197
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,538
Wait, what?

198
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,416
Mamita, you just started
a month ago.

199
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,544
Okay, great. That's great.

200
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,505
So what's next?
What's the plan?

201
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,816
{\an5}Well, I've made it pretty clear
that I don't wanna go to college.

202
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,761
{\an5}So, why can't I use my college
fund to start my own business?

203
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,865
{\an5}Here we go again. The college fund is
for college hence the word "college fund."

204
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,349
I know, papi...

205
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,410
No, you don't know, Cora.
I mean, I've said this before.

206
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,603
My college fund was me
parking cars at 16.

207
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,706
{\an5}I'm not gonna pay for you
to cut in the front of the line.

208
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,982
If you want something in life,
you have to earn it.

209
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,752
That's the way it is,
that's the way life is.

210
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,736
Still beating those drums,
eh, Billy?

211
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,530
She needs to learn
how to follow through.

212
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,115
And you know I'm right.

213
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,951
In all these years, not once.

214
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,457
Hello! Mami!

215
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,128
Oh, my God.
We missed you so much.

216
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,754
I missed you, mami.

217
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,966
I'm so happy. Welcome.

218
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,635
Thank you, Mom.

219
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,728
Oh, my beautiful princess.

220
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,315
Hey, cuz.

221
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,402
Papi?

222
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,699
Dad?

223
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,274
Tell 'em.

224
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
Right here,
right on top of my head.

225
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,152
What?

226
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,530
You lost me.

227
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,781
Stop.

228
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,410
No.

229
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,833
Familia,
I hate to interrupt you,

230
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,835
but I've got something
I'd like to say.

231
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,713
{\an5}Yes. There's something
that we wanna say, Ingrid and I.

232
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:28,557
That we wanna propose a toast
to Sofia.

233
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,018
Since the first moment
you started to speak,

234
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,145
we knew that
you were an old soul.

235
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,566
{\an5}And that you were kind and you were
very self-aware and very disciplined.

236
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,235
And that discipline helped you

237
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,403
not only in college,
but also on the tennis court.

238
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,571
Yeah.

239
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,074
And also at law school at NYU.

240
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:50,996
{\an5}That discipline also helped you pass the
bar in New York and pass the bar in Florida.

241
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,415
And now you have
two competing job offers.

242
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,334
We're gonna throw
the New York one away,

243
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,420
and you're gonna come down
to Florida, and...

244
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,467
Oh, Corita.

245
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,594
My other darling.

246
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,098
{\an5}Since you were a little girl, you always
wanted to play dress-up and design dresses.

247
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,933
Apparently
not quinceañera dresses...

248
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,811
I guess, but dresses
that fit your style

249
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,188
and your mood
on a particular day.

250
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,527
That's very nice, okay.

251
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,195
To Sofi and Cori.

252
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,279
Cora.

253
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,783
All right, great toast.
Okay, so I...

254
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,451
I also have something to say.

255
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,619
Of course.

256
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,912
You all know me.

257
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,457
I have no life.
All I do is work.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,877
I mean, 100-hour weeks,
weekends by my computer...

259
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,589
but then there was this guy...

260
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,092
and we spent long hours
together.

261
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,803
We worked
on the same case and...

262
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:48,887
Oh, hell with it.

263
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,640
- I'm engaged.
- What?

264
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
Oh, my...

265
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,977
Congratulations.

266
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,729
Thank you.

267
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,272
Look, mami.

268
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,650
It's beautiful, mi amor.
So fast.

269
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,569
Look at it.
Isn't it beautiful?

270
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,738
- What's happening?
- Guys, thank you!

271
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,489
Oh.

272
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,368
{\an5}Oh, if only my Luisito would
be alive to see it. He was a saint.

273
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,703
Yes, I know.

274
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,788
Oh, my God.
This is gonna be so much fun.

275
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,708
{\an5}Okay, okay, okay.
One second. One second. One second.

276
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,293
Just one second.

277
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,253
Just one second.

278
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,757
Who is he?

279
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Like, who is he?

280
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,676
What does he do?

281
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,136
When did you decide this?

282
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,139
Who is he?

283
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,932
His name is Adán.
He's from Mexico.

284
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,020
And he's smart and he's sweet
and he listens

285
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,857
{\an5}and he's constantly trying to surprise
me, but he does this thing where he...

286
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,526
he bites his lip every time
he's trying to hide something.

287
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
And it's so cute.

288
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,572
And he's opened my eyes
to so much.

289
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,950
He's taken me camping
and surfing.

290
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,327
I meditate.

291
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,037
He's even got me doing yoga.

292
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,872
Yoga, camping, and surfing.

293
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,750
So when I found out
that I was going to Mexico...

294
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,002
I couldn't leave him behind.

295
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,380
So... I proposed.

296
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,631
You proposed?

297
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,924
- Hold on.
- Exactly.

298
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,427
- You proposed?
- Yes.

299
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,595
You proposed to him?

300
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
He didn't propose to you?

301
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,681
Can you do that?

302
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
- Of course.
- Yes.

303
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,519
I mean, you can do that,
but does anyone do that?

304
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,145
- She did.
- I did.

305
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,189
- That's my girl.
- Wait... Okay.

306
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,902
{\an5}What about waiting until you have
achieved some of your career goals?

307
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,029
Papi, I've already achieved
career goals.

308
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,700
I'll always keep growing,
and he's who I wanna grow with.

309
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,868
And I felt it the second
I met him.

310
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,039
{\an5}We shared an Uber one day
and we had the most incredible conversation

311
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,583
but for some reason
we didn't exchange numbers.

312
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,087
{\an5}I don't know why,
and I almost always regretted it.

313
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,590
But then a whole year later,
I run into him at work.

314
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,928
{\an5}It turns out that we worked
in the same building the entire time.

315
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,930
- It's a sign.
- Yes.

316
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,765
Yeah, it's a sign.

317
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,643
{\an5}Two weeks later our firms
partner up on the same class-action case...

318
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,104
and we end up on the same team.

319
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,733
I just looked at him
and I said to myself,

320
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,152
"Oh, my God.
I'm gonna marry this man."

321
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,445
And I am.

322
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,029
- Kismet.
- It's kismet.

323
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,615
- Well...
- How romantic.

324
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,783
Very romantic.

325
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,745
- He's from Mexico?
- Yes.

326
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,954
And you're going to Mexico?

327
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,831
Yes.

328
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,625
Are you moving to Mexico?

329
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,335
Papi. Yes.

330
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,137
I need to get some air.

331
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,972
- Papi, papi, come on.
- Billy.

332
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,766
Papi.

333
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,393
{\an5}Now you know how Luisito felt
when you asked for Ingrid's hand.

334
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,978
Oh, my God, mami.

335
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,647
What a moment, mi amor.

336
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,108
I have one more thing to say.

337
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,192
What is it?

338
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,028
Cora.

339
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,988
Yes.

340
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,865
Would you be my maid of honor?

341
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,867
Yes. Of course. Yeah. I mean...

342
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,452
- Yes?
- Of course.

343
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,207
You two are so cute.

344
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,730
- That's cute.
- Wait, what was that?

345
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,920
Is that your dad's car?

346
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,588
What?

347
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,507
No, it's el Porschecito.
That's him.

348
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,008
Another tantrum.

349
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,344
Well, nobody's perfect, okay?

350
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,470
I got this.

351
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,721
He's gone insane.

352
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,889
No, no, no. It's okay.

353
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,224
Let him go.

354
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,389
Really?

355
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,059
{\an5}I give you the biggest news
of my life, and you just pick up and leave?

356
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,061
I went outside,
I got some air...

357
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,230
and then the guys called.
I forgot I had a game...

358
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,481
Okay, can we...

359
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,234
...so I came to play this game.

360
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,444
{\an5}Look at this hand,
a beautiful hand. I'll go...

361
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,737
Can we talk?

362
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,533
Long live the bride!

363
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,660
And you told them?

364
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,080
{\an5}I told them you were going to
Mexico and that I was gonna miss you.

365
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,124
What do you mean, Mexico?

366
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,476
- All right, Dad. Come on.
- México.

367
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,127
Let's go home.
Adán's on his way.

368
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,229
{\an5}No, no.
We just started a game here. Have a seat.

369
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,588
Oh, for the love of God.

370
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,755
How much for your seat?

371
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,258
50 dollars.

372
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,676
Pay up.

373
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,970
This will be interesting.

374
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,179
Okay. Vaya.

375
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,347
You wanted to play?

376
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
Go!

377
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,939
Yeah. Why Mexico?

378
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,566
Dad.

379
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,318
Julio Cesar Chavez was Mexican.

380
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,861
And Maromero Paez is too.

381
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,988
No Maromero Paez
is Chicano, not Mexican.

382
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,198
Because there is a job
that matters to me there.

383
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,909
And that's where Adán is from.

384
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,452
That's why I'm going to Mexico.

385
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,495
But you were gonna be
Florida's governor one day.

386
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,706
What are you talking about?

387
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,851
{\an5}Talking about that you need to grow up
a little bit more before you get married.

388
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,936
{\an5}I'm concerned you're gonna
pass on all these opportunities

389
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,271
because you got married
too early.

390
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,755
Play!

391
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,214
Tell me about it!

392
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,009
Marriage is already hard.
Why make it harder?

393
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,846
In my house we only allow
Cubans, Christians or Cohorts.

394
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,557
Your daughters sound like
very lucky ladies.

395
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,185
Dad, look at you and Mom.

396
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,145
You got married young...

397
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,940
{\an5}and you started from nothing,
and now you get to enjoy it together.

398
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,319
Pass! Now I'm playing against

399
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,321
two enemies and a traitor.

400
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,964
And you've spent
the whole game passing.

401
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,659
You passed on four,
you passed on two.

402
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,953
Here's the four/two!

403
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,079
Now, can we go?

404
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,629
Pleasure doing business.

405
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,089
Let's go.

406
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,091
Billy! One last game!

407
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,592
She's the boss!

408
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,677
Sofi!

409
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,096
Sofi!

410
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,139
He still has to ask me
for your hand in marriage.

411
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,474
Ay, Dad.

412
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,562
Hi, quelite.

413
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,942
Way to dodge a bullet, big guy.

414
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,860
Did I have a choice?

415
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,822
{\an5}Oh, we're supposed to play the
perfect family until Sofi gets married?

416
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,824
Or we could say...

417
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,469
{\an5}"Sorry to spoil your happiness,
but we're getting a divorce. Mazel tov."

418
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,036
Mami, papi...

419
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,831
this is Adán Castillo.

420
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,166
This is my mom, Ingrid Herrera.

421
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,711
Mrs. Herrera, such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

422
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,214
Please call me Ingrid
and give me a hug, mijo.

423
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,637
And this is my dad,
Guillermo Herrera.

424
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,015
Mr. Herrera,
such a pleasure, sir.

425
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,224
Likewise.

426
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,813
Sofi told me
you have a beautiful garden

427
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,566
so this is my contribution
to the family tree.

428
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,152
How thoughtful.

429
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,821
{\an5}You know what, let's find a
place where it's gonna be happy.

430
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
- Okay.
- Follow me.

431
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,990
So sweet.

432
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,078
You are so sweet.

433
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm glad you liked it.

434
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,165
I love it. Thank you.

435
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,541
That was very thoughtful.

436
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,169
Thank you, Guillermo.

437
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,757
Wow, this house
has so much hearth, you know?

438
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,924
Hearth?

439
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,135
Yeah. It feels like a home.

440
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,680
Good word.

441
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,450
I built this house
when nobody would hire me

442
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,310
{\an5}so I hired myself
and I slowly built it into this.

443
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,605
Wow.

444
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,107
You're talking about the house,
he's talking about the home.

445
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,114
He'll soften up.
He's just a little nervous.

446
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,116
Yeah, so am I.

447
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,328
{\an5}Oh, look at the girls when they
were little. They were so perfect.

448
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,455
Oh, my God.

449
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,832
- Quelite, look at your hair.
- My babies.

450
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,417
Oh. Stop, Mom.

451
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,501
What?

452
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,421
You love me way too much. God.

453
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,964
What is that, "quelite"?

454
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,050
{\an5}- Yeah, I was wondering too. What is it?
- Oh, oh.

455
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,052
Go.

456
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,304
So when all the summer
associates would have lunch,

457
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:13,809
{\an5}Adán kept whipping out this Tupperware
full of these, like, weird vegetable stews.

458
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,685
And, by the way,
he's an amazing cook.

459
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,480
And all of us were like,
"Ew, what are you eating?"

460
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,940
- You remember that?
- Yeah, yeah.

461
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,316
And I said, "quelites."

462
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,151
So they started calling me
quelite.

463
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,986
But then Sofi tried them,
loved them

464
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,531
{\an5}- and I started calling her quelite.
- Me quelites.

465
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,032
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Get it?

466
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,534
I love it. I love it.

467
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,344
Well, I guess the stories
behind the nicknames

468
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,596
are never as good
as the nicknames themselves.

469
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,060
Would you like a drink?

470
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,204
- No, thank you.
- I'm good.

471
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,228
I'm okay.

472
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,439
Come to my office.

473
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,984
- Come on.
- Yeah.

474
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,243
You're coming too?

475
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,830
Are you implying we shouldn't?

476
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,541
No, no.

477
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,841
I feel like I'm in trouble.

478
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,551
- Yeah.
- So,

479
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,763
you said you found
a law firm in Mexico?

480
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,015
Yes.

481
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,683
International one?

482
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,977
Yes. Well,
actually it's a non-profit.

483
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,606
- A non-profit?
- Yeah.

484
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,734
{\an5}It gives aid to refugees
coming into the U.S. from Mexico.

485
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,360
How is the money in that?

486
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,238
Well, the money is decent.

487
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,199
Decent?

488
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,702
So, how do you propose
to support my daughter?

489
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,537
Wait.

490
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,917
{\an5}He's not here to support me,
Dad. We're supporting each other.

491
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,086
And we're not making decisions
based on money.

492
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,631
{\an5}I wish I didn't have
to make decisions based on money.

493
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,760
Right.

494
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,905
{\an5}Anyway, Mr. Herrera, I know I was
supposed to ask for your blessing...

495
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,198
before marrying your daughter...

496
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,264
Blessing. Permission.

497
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,599
One of those.

498
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,268
But she beat you to the punch.

499
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,812
{\an5}- Yeah. She gave me a pretty good punch too.
- Yep.

500
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,940
That I did.

501
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,818
{\an5}We start in September, so things have
been pretty crazy, as you can imagine.

502
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,988
{\an5}That's why I didn't have a
chance to come to Miami until now

503
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,698
to tell you both personally

504
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,661
that you have truly raised
the best daughter in the world.

505
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
She inspires me every day
to be a better man.

506
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,500
I wanna learn from her,
I wanna be like her...

507
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,086
So nothing would make me happier

508
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,755
than to have your blessing
to marry your daughter, sir.

509
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,549
Yeah.

510
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,051
But a non-profit...

511
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,136
- Billy!
- Papi!

512
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,893
Of course you have my blessing.

513
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,613
{\an5}- Did you say you start working in September?
- Yeah.

514
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,323
- That's in two months.
- Yep.

515
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,284
When did you plan
on getting married?

516
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,827
August.

517
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,721
{\an5}We wanna squeeze
in the honeymoon before going to Mexico.

518
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,331
{\an5}Of course.
But don't you think that's a little crazy?

519
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,625
{\an5}How are we gonna
pull together a wedding in one month?

520
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,876
Yes, that's too rushed.

521
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,586
Why don't you wait a year?
Or two.

522
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,356
You know, get to know
each other a little bit.

523
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,008
No. We want to start
our lives together.

524
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,385
I understand,
but that's a bit tight.

525
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,012
It's gonna drive up the cost.

526
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,555
That's the least of our worries.

527
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,057
Well, papi, we don't want
some big, fancy wedding.

528
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,642
We want something simple and...

529
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,518
Intimate.

530
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,601
And intimate.

531
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,229
And we wanna pay for it.

532
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,856
Two lawyers
who are out of college

533
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,358
working for a non-profit
are gonna pay for the wedding.

534
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm the father of the bride,

535
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,546
the father of the bride
will be paying for the wedding.

536
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,006
If I could just
explain the situation...

537
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,906
There's nothing to explain.

538
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,218
{\an5}I am the father of the bride,
and I will be paying for the wedding.

539
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,578
{\an5}And I'm gonna
be walking my daughter down the aisle.

540
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,504
{\an5}Sir, thank you so much for a great
night. You have an amazing daughter.

541
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,108
- I'm a very lucky man.
- Yes, you are.

542
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,173
Nine a.m.?

543
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,675
- Bright and early.
- Perfect.

544
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,218
I can't wait.

545
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,779
{\an5}- Let's go.
- Where do you think you're going?

546
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,138
With Adán.

547
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,599
No, no, no. I don't know.
Hey, hey, hey, hold on.

548
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,392
I don't know what you guys do
in New York.

549
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,454
Whatever you do in New York
stays in New York. In Miami...

550
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,565
{\an5}In Miami, in this century,
you can sleep with your fiancé, Billy.

551
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,568
Good night.
Have a wonderful night.

552
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,819
Thank you, Mom.

553
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,446
Be well.

554
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,299
{\an5}- Adán, quickly flee while you still can.
- I love you, Dad.

555
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,908
Go, go, go.

556
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,469
{\an5}- Come on.
- Are you sure your dad's fine with this?

557
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,495
No, trust me.
Trust me.

558
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,996
I know my dad.

559
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,007
I don't see
what she sees in him...

560
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,219
with his fake bohemian,
vegetarian soft voice.

561
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,389
"I wanna learn from her.
I want to be like her."

562
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,182
Seriously? Grow a pair.

563
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,935
{\an5}And, "We're not gonna
make our choices based on money"?

564
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,038
You know what that means?
We're gonna be supporting them.

565
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,648
Well, fortunately
you love to work hard.

566
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,811
So money won't be an issue.

567
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,859
She is gonna eat him alive.

568
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,152
He's nothing like us.

569
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,779
Maybe that's the point.

570
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,657
Mm mm.

571
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,160
Really?

572
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,287
I need my space.

573
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,289
You expect me
to sleep on the couch.

574
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,250
Only until the wedding's over.

575
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,127
Then you can get your own place.

576
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,094
Sweet dreams.

577
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,689
Billy.

578
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,274
What a day.

579
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,700
Dad, where are you?

580
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,789
Hello?

581
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,755
Dad, where are you?

582
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,174
He's probably hiding.

583
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,930
Dad!

584
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,391
Hey! Hey. Look at this.

585
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,727
I had a rush of inspiration

586
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,689
and I wanted to capture it
before it escaped me.

587
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,400
How are you? Hi.

588
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,860
- You good?
- Good.

589
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,237
You're gonna wanna get changed.

590
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,322
The wedding planner's here
in 20 minutes.

591
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,783
Wedding planner?
What wedding planner?

592
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,493
We didn't have
a wedding planner.

593
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,080
Why do we need
a wedding planner?

594
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,375
{\an5}Because we have one month to plan a
wedding, and who's gonna do it? You?

595
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,460
- You.
- Don't look at me.

596
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,711
So, who is this person?

597
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,213
Her name's Natalie Vance.

598
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,216
She has a beautiful Instagram.
Very professional.

599
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,967
And she is highly recommended.

600
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,678
{\an5}Natalie Vance with a beautiful
Instagram. Great credentials.

601
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,429
She ever done a wedding?

602
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,849
{\an5}Well, she used to work
with Becky Weisz, so she's done many.

603
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,185
Oh. Very impressed.
Coffee?

604
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,604
I'm so sorry. Do you have tea
by any chance?

605
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,730
Tea?

606
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,440
I'll get that.

607
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
She's here.

608
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,615
Hi. Is this
the Herrera residence?

609
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,616
Herrera.

610
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,701
Herrera residence?

611
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,123
La familia.

612
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,375
And the bride.

613
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,294
Oh, my God,
you're literally gorgeous.

614
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,838
And a lawyer? It's not fair.

615
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,258
{\an5}Thank you so much
for doing this. You are saving our lives.

616
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,278
{\an5}All right.
So, we have a month to secure a venue...

617
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,596
catering, dresses,
send out invitations,

618
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,306
make a registry,
and design a website.

619
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,682
Ooh, refill.

620
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,893
So, what are we thinking
about theme?

621
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,104
- A theme?
- What do you mean, theme?

622
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,148
- Theme?
- I didn't think about a theme.

623
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,482
Okay.
What do we want?

624
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,484
Big wedding? Small? Day? Night?

625
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,569
- Night.
- Big.

626
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,738
- Day.
- Small.

627
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:51,034
{\an5}We were thinking maybe
just like a small ceremony, very intimate.

628
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,037
Maybe like a sunset ceremony
by the beach would be nice.

629
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,246
Or at a barn.

630
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,624
- Rustic.
- Like mason jars and burlap.

631
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,584
A barn? A beach?

632
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,086
Whatever happened to a priest
and a church?

633
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,339
Yes. You know,
the wedding party.

634
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,965
Your train down the aisle.

635
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,717
- Tuxes. Ice sculptures.
- Gala.

636
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,886
Just give me one second.

637
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,971
We don't want
a Catholic wedding.

638
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,158
{\an5}What are you talking about,
you don't want to have a Catholic wedding?

639
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,683
Who's gonna officiate then?

640
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,685
{\an5}My guide Monica
from the Zen Center, New York.

641
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,354
So, a yoga class
instead of a wedding?

642
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,189
Quiet.

643
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,525
{\an5}Okay, all this is lovely,
but we need to think of a theme.

644
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:29,238
We were thinking, "Old Miami."
You know, tradish but fresh.

645
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,782
- Kind of old school.
- New school.

646
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,494
{\an5}- Cigars.
- Old cars, like, Cuba, who is she?

647
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,829
- Salsa. Salsa music.
- Salsa dancing.

648
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,289
- Salsa verde.
- Salsa roja.

649
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,373
Salsa...

650
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,125
Picante.

651
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,003
{\an5}Don't you have some, like,
presentation or something to show us?

652
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,630
Yes, papi.

653
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,465
Kyler, Wi-Fi.

654
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,133
TV. Thanks, girl.

655
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,593
Yes, girl.

656
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,178
Can't wait.

657
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:56,808
Okay. First pitch.
Flamencos and flamingos.

658
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,976
How are these two ideas
even related?

659
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,412
- Well, it's a Latinks wedding.
- Latinx.

660
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,522
A Latinx wedding in Miami.

661
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,524
First of all,
I don't know what Latinx means.

662
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,526
Second of all,
flamenco is from Spain,

663
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,611
and they're from Mexico,
we're from Cuba

664
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,114
so how do these ideas connect?

665
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,407
Teachable moment.

666
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,617
Thank you for holding me
accountable.

667
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,452
This is the work.

668
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,912
This is why we march.

669
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,914
Kyler, skip the slide
about the queso fountains.

670
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:23,376
{\an5}The point is
that this is not cultural appropriation...

671
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,585
rather cultural...

672
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,587
- celebration. Right?
- Celebration.

673
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,924
A celebration is fine,
but not a Broadway production.

674
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,175
Do you have a business card?

675
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,135
No.

676
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,469
Where are your offices?

677
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,432
{\an5}I thought
you said she had experience.

678
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,891
She came highly recommended.

679
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,268
Okay, boomer.

680
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,270
Sorry that I don't have
little businessman cards

681
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,439
that pillage and plunder
our mother earth.

682
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,274
You're from a different
generation, right?

683
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,443
When you were born,
babies smoked cigarettes,

684
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,944
and the milkman delivered milk

685
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,238
and, like, World War II
had just happened.

686
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,615
But times have changed,
and there is nothing

687
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,492
that I can't do with this phone.

688
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,161
The point is,
I'm not a wedding planner.

689
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,164
I'm more than a wedding planner.

690
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,916
I get that you guys wanna
be a little different, right?

691
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,253
Bohemian and kinda have,
like, Tulum vibes.

692
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,589
While you wanna be
like a Tommy Bahama guy, right?

693
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,633
{\an5}You're like, smoking a Cuban
with your buddies and your clientele

694
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,137
{\an5}and just have this, like,
earthy billionaire-style wedding.

695
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,805
I got you. Okay?

696
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,141
My job is to be
your financial advisor,

697
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,143
family therapist, and stylist.

698
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,978
Your job is to enjoy the event.

699
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,980
So give me a guest list
and a deposit.

700
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,609
Do you have a layaway plan?

701
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,986
"Layaway plan."

702
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,947
I love dad jokes. So random.

703
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,532
Okay. Let's forget the theme...

704
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,993
and in the meantime,
let's go find us a venue.

705
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,411
You want a venue?

706
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,164
I got a phone too.

707
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,290
Aquí.

708
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,341
Thank you.

709
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,386
Really? The Biltmore?

710
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,138
Creature of habit, your father.

711
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,681
I was
on the remodeling committee.

712
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,017
We know, Dad.
You tell us every time we come.

713
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,310
All right. Let's go.

714
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,853
Good to see you.

715
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,148
Hey! What do you think?
Look at this place. Amazing.

716
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,608
Amazing. Look.

717
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,027
- Hey, Colin.
- Mr. Herrera.

718
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,029
Hi. Good to see you.

719
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,407
{\an5}Will you let Michelle know that
her favorite architect is here to see her?

720
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,575
How are you? Good?

721
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,208
So do you prefer
the green lentil

722
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,126
or the butternut squash soup?

723
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,462
Butternut squash.

724
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,841
Delicious, huh?
Butternut squash, right?

725
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,762
Okay.

726
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,098
Here's the idea.

727
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,599
We got an orchestra right here.

728
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,851
Bang! Orchestra.

729
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,020
Dance floor.

730
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,982
And then we're over here,
family table.

731
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,900
Family table. Long family.

732
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,610
One set of tables here.

733
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,114
Herreras. Castillos. Wedding.

734
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,700
Biltmore. Splendor.

735
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,743
Are you gonna have
Los Inmortales?

736
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,079
Course we're gonna
have Inmortales.

737
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,890
{\an5}Tío Walter and the Inmortales breaking
out the classics. Everybody's happy.

738
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,416
Wait, Dad.
You know I love Tío Walter,

739
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,668
and no offense
to Los Inmortales...

740
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,338
{\an5}but there's not only Cubans at this
wedding, there's also Adán's family,

741
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,924
our friends,
and we don't want an orchestra.

742
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,759
We want a DJ.

743
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,719
A DJ?

744
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,262
Yeah, a DJ.

745
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,016
And this room is too big
for 50 guests.

746
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,393
Fifty guests? Try 50 cousins.

747
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,770
Plus, we have friends,
my clients.

748
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,274
{\an5}Dad, I don't wanna get married
with 200 strangers I haven't seen in, what,

749
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,442
ten years?

750
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,003
Plus, I barely know
half your cousins.

751
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,945
I barely know half my cousins.

752
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,948
{\an5}What better situation than to
reconnect with them at a family wedding?

753
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,384
Let me just get one thing
straight.

754
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,161
This is our wedding, Dad.

755
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,288
Well, yes and no.

756
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,664
Yes and no?

757
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,333
Yes and no.

758
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,935
Your name is on the invitation,
but my name is on the checks.

759
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,629
Okay. So, because
your name's on the check,

760
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,130
you get to call all the shots?

761
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,299
Yes. Traditionally
that's the way it works.

762
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,092
{\an5}The one with the gold makes the rules.

763
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,386
Sofi, please.
I just want to give you away

764
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,865
{\an5}in front of my community,
my friends. This is important to me.

765
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,307
Did you just say,
"Give me away"?

766
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,035
Dad, I'm not something
you could just sell off.

767
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,310
Let's stop this, okay?

768
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,746
I didn't come across
the Atlantic Ocean

769
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,396
to sleep on Tío Walter's floor

770
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,916
{\an5}to put myself through
school, to build the firm

771
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,858
so I can afford something
like this...

772
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,920
for you to stand there
and tell me I can't celebrate

773
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,404
this extraordinary moment
with our family, our friends.

774
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,615
Dad, Dad, Dad.
This is about us.

775
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,408
Okay. I'm gonna interject.

776
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,732
The other day, I was listening
to this incredible podcast

777
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,080
with Drake talking
about the immigrant experience.

778
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,957
- Did you guys hear this?
- No.

779
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,268
{\an5}Anyway, I know that he is
Canadian and you guys are Latinx...

780
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,877
but it got me thinking
about immigrants.

781
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,836
Exiles.

782
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,505
Exiles. I'm so sorry.

783
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,465
The point is,
it's always the same, right?

784
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,735
{\an5}The parents wanna preserve
their traditions and their kids don't.

785
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,885
Tale as old as time.

786
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,512
And I relate, you know.

787
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,139
{\an5}I wanted a Sex and the City
theme for my bat mitzvah

788
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,463
and my parents wouldn't let me.

789
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,850
I'm a Charlotte.

790
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,602
I'm a Samantha.

791
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,997
{\an5}And you, missy, need to be
a little Carrie in this narrative

792
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,192
{\an5}while Mr. Big over here needs to stop
mansplaining how to throw a wedding.

793
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,486
Okay, papi. Check it.

794
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,488
It's a collab, right?

795
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,008
{\an5}You gotta be happy, you gotta be
happy. And we're gonna make it work.

796
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,410
Deal? Let's go find
a wedding dress.

797
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,379
{\an5}Okay, guys,
the appointment is in 15 minutes.

798
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,843
Am I paying for the dress
or the rent?

799
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,014
Meringue...

800
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,223
cake...

801
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,850
boring...

802
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,977
too bridal.

803
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,730
Excuse me?

804
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,357
Hi. What other designers
do you carry?

805
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,901
I'm afraid we don't
have anything for you here.

806
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,903
I think you might be
in the wrong store.

807
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,655
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

808
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,043
I'm just messing with ya.
I don't work here.

809
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,327
My God,
I can't take you anywhere.

810
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,371
Cora, this is Vanessa,
Adán's cousin.

811
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,915
Also a very good friend of mine
from New York.

812
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,543
Hi.

813
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,545
All right, fam,
here is the scoop.

814
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,422
We won't have time
to customize a dress,

815
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,632
so we're gonna have to
alter one that's off the rack.

816
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,344
Daddy, what is the budget
that we're working with?

817
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,180
Budget?

818
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,683
Whatever she wants.

819
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,602
I love that, that's beautiful

820
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,038
but keep in mind that
you never wanna

821
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,622
put a bride in a dress
she can't afford.

822
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:22,610
So, prices usually range
from about here...

823
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,694
to here.

824
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,196
So, where do we land?

825
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,242
Well, how about there?

826
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,161
Okay.

827
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,002
Get me Esé Azénabor,
Vera Wang, and Zuhair Marad.

828
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,505
Fun.

829
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,257
I mean, this just...

830
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,802
This whole thing is just not...

831
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,804
It's just not me.
It's not me.

832
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,014
It's just so heavy.

833
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,682
Try the Vera Wang.

834
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,975
No.

835
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,602
Plus, Dad would kill me.

836
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,145
Please.

837
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,956
You could ask for a fitting
with the Vera Wang herself

838
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,232
and he would still cave.

839
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,150
That's not true.

840
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,821
What happened with Ophelia's?

841
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,325
You know, I just don't think
I'm built to have a boss.

842
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:15,162
So, I'm gonna start
my own thing.

843
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,707
{\an5}Don't you think you need
a little experience for that, Cora?

844
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,210
Like what? College?

845
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,004
Like college. Yes.

846
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,258
You know, not everyone
has to follow the rules, Sof.

847
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,386
Okay.

848
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,851
Tía Pili could have made
her dress, you know.

849
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,602
She made your dress.

850
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,062
Yes, she did.

851
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,357
And I looked like an extra
in a Pat Benatar video.

852
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,443
{\an5}And I looked
like a maître d' from Versailles.

853
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,570
Yes, you did.

854
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,156
- Here she comes.
- Oh.

855
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,032
I can't wait!

856
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,701
I know, I know.

857
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,452
{\an5}Okay, what happened?

858
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,787
I don't know, I just wasn't...

859
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,497
I wasn't feeling it.

860
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,582
Now what?

861
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,210
Y ah or a, I was thinking that...

862
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,295
Cora...

863
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,715
why don't you make
my wedding dress?

864
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,175
What?

865
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,986
- You're a designer?
- She's a very good designer.

866
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,053
No. Not yet.

867
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,638
You said you wanted a break.

868
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
This is your break.

869
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,100
Yeah, but I don't
have the money,

870
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,465
I don't have the materials,
and we're running out of time.

871
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,229
Yeah, see...

872
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,814
You know.

873
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,333
{\an5}Isn't it a little bit of pressure
with the time we have

874
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,585
for her to do all these dresses?

875
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,860
I'll tell you what...

876
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,820
instead of being, like,
here, you know...

877
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,322
we can be, like, here.

878
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,491
Well, let's give all that
to Cora.

879
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,577
- Yes!
- Yes. Cora!

880
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,162
Do my bridesmaids' dresses
as well.

881
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,787
Oh, no.

882
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,999
That's five plus one. That's...

883
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,375
Six dresses.

884
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,419
Piece of cake.

885
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,926
There goes your commission.

886
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,856
What have I done?

887
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,097
I come bearing wine
and bridesmaids.

888
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,265
Oh.

889
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,309
Hi.

890
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,486
{\an5}Hey, Justin, please take this
to the patio. Please. Thank you.

891
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,827
Come in. It's open.

892
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,953
Adán.

893
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,289
Mr. Herrera.

894
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,748
Welcome. Come in.

895
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,083
We're watching the fight.

896
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,334
How are you?

897
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,418
Good, good, good.

898
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,004
Did your parents come here too?

899
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,797
No, no, no, they landed.

900
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,775
{\an5}I just wanted to come
real quick to talk to you about something

901
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,819
{\an5}- before they got here.
- Great, perfect. I wanna talk to you too.

902
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,261
Let's have a drink.

903
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,013
At-00 a.m.?

904
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,432
It's never too early to toast
Adán and Sofi.

905
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,060
To Adán and Sofi.

906
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,144
Salud.

907
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,294
Sir, I just wanted
to get something off my chest.

908
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,362
You know, I came
to this country with nothing.

909
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,090
I worked hard,
I put myself through school,

910
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,033
I built my own company,
and with that effort,

911
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,452
I was able to build this house.

912
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
And you, if you work very hard,

913
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,706
one day, you will also be able
to build a house like this.

914
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,417
And about that,
you know, I'm kind of in a...

915
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,046
The thing is this,
that my daughter, Sofi...

916
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,465
she's used
to a certain lifestyle.

917
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,550
And, you know, and I know
you wanna make her happy.

918
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,653
- Right? That's all you want.
- Yes, and I'm so happy

919
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,905
{\an5}- that you and I are talking about it.
- You have so much potential

920
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,392
{\an5}to do that. But that non-profit
situation is just not gonna cut it...

921
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,770
because, at the end of the day,
we as men...

922
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,981
we get judged by our ability
to provide.

923
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,901
- And, you know, I...
- Because it's all about...

924
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,029
Yeah, and I feel uncomfortable
having this conversation.

925
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,573
{\an5}- I don't really know how to say it, but...
- Hey, hey. Hey.

926
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,992
Look at me.
There's no shame in it.

927
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
If you ever need anything,

928
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,912
- you come to me.
- Yeah.

929
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,247
And you see, my father...

930
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,832
Dude! Dude! What a cross!

931
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,837
Get up you bum!

932
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,756
You see that?
He ain't gettin' up.

933
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,300
Poor guy.

934
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,470
Poor guy?

935
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,193
{\an5}- Okay.
- I just feel sorry for someone...

936
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,349
{\an5}who has no choice
but to fight for money, you know?

937
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,434
Would you like me
to change the channel?

938
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,687
{\an5}- No, no, no, sir, this is your house. Please.
- No, no, no.

939
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,648
What sport would you prefer
to watch?

940
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,483
I don't really watch sports.

941
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,235
- You don't watch sports?
- No.

942
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,694
You play sports?

943
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:58,862
I like hiking.

944
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,447
Hiking's not a sport.

945
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,116
Your father never taught you
any sports?

946
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,426
He never took you to any games?

947
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,285
No, he did.
He has a soccer team

948
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,305
{\an5}and we had to go watch 'em
play every week until I got tired of it.

949
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,372
Hello, men.

950
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,727
{\an5}- Adán, your parents will be here soon, right?
- "Has a soccer team"?

951
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,837
{\an5}- Yeah.
- I need to warm up the fricassee.

952
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,463
Let me help you.

953
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,464
What's up with that glass jaw?

954
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,548
I know.

955
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:19,883
He's out.

956
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,087
He got him right in the bun.

957
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,761
Yeah.

958
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,572
{\an5}- Yep, that's them. Let me go get 'em.
- They're here?

959
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,140
They're here.

960
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,543
{\an5}- Adán, wait. I gotta ask you a question.
- Are you coming?

961
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,104
- Let's go.
- Hey.

962
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,315
What did you do to your hair?

963
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,153
{\an5}In case you hadn't realized, our
daughter's getting married in two weeks.

964
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,116
You look very nice.

965
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,199
Mm.

966
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,163
Nice of you to notice,
Guillermo. Come on.

967
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,832
Hernán.

968
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,167
Behave.

969
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,255
Hey!

970
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:02,509
Mr. Herrera, this is my father,
Hernán Castillo.

971
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:08,682
Give me a hug, in-law!

972
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,559
A moment ago we were nothing.

973
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,936
...and now we're family.

974
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,981
That's true.

975
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,524
- Ingrid, right?
- Yes!

976
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,444
You're just as beautiful
as your daughter.

977
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,527
Oh.

978
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,533
Hi.

979
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,160
Hi, I'm Julieta,
nice to meet you.

980
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,454
Hi, Julieta, hi.
You must be Adán's sister.

981
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,788
Guillermo Herrera.

982
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:32,872
Well...

983
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,958
I'm actually Hernán's wife.

984
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,251
Nice to meet you.

985
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,217
And actually...

986
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,178
this is my mother, Marcel a.

987
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,347
The former Mrs. Castillo.

988
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,099
I'm gonna show you something.

989
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,602
This is little Hernáncito.

990
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,103
- Look at how cute he...
- Adorable.

991
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,773
This is Adán's baby brother.
How cute is he.

992
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,441
I wanna show you something.

993
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,943
You're not gonna believe it.

994
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,236
You're not.

995
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,737
I'm gonna show you.

996
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,340
- Just wait, wait, wait.
- You better take the baby.

997
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,244
- You take the baby. Yeah.
- I'm gonna show you.

998
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,285
I got his birthday tattooed.

999
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,579
Beautiful.

1000
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,039
- Beautiful.
- Lovely.

1001
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,083
And I'm gonna put yours
and your brother's, okay?

1002
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,668
Ingrid.

1003
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,811
{\an5}- Show me your beautiful home, please.
- Absolutely.

1004
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:19,836
- Come on.
- Yes.

1005
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,088
- Yes.
- Thank you, sweetie.

1006
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,133
How was your trip? Was it good?

1007
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,094
Good drinks.
You know, champagne...

1008
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,095
Yeah.

1009
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,555
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1010
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,558
Does he own a soccer team?

1011
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,351
Yeah.

1012
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,771
{\an5}Don't you have to be
a multi-millionaire to own a soccer team?

1013
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,982
You know how in Mexico,
there's two beer companies?

1014
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,149
I'm aware.

1015
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,609
He owns one of them.

1016
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,280
When were you gonna tell me
this?

1017
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,739
Oh, I tried.

1018
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,575
But you didn't let us speak.

1019
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,085
- Working pro bono, huh?
- Oh, boy.

1020
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,522
{\an5}If I had a private plane,
I'd be making houses for the homeless.

1021
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,465
{\an5}You know what's gonna happen?
Our grandson's gonna grow up to be a brat.

1022
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,403
Because of course,
she's gonna have a boy.

1023
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,845
You know what I mean.

1024
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,406
I just hope that Sofi
finally wakes up after this

1025
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,765
before Adán trades her
in for a new model

1026
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,560
{\an5}you know, like father,
like son, the Castillo tradition.

1027
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,770
Look at the age
on this poor girl.

1028
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,982
That's not gonna happen.

1029
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,736
{\an5}You know, I heard from Sofi
that Hernán took his grandfather's brewery

1030
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,696
and made it into
the biggest one in Mexico.

1031
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,782
{\an5}So it's not like
he didn't do something to get here.

1032
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,244
Sofi told you this?

1033
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,662
Yes.

1034
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,206
You know, she's not just
daddy's little girl, right?

1035
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,296
Showtime, baby. Come on.

1036
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,886
Thank you.

1037
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,097
Oh, uh.
Sir, I'm allergic to shrimp.

1038
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,516
{\an5}- Then let's get that away from her. Billy.
- Please, sir.

1039
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,601
Excuse me?

1040
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,562
How did you two meet?

1041
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,523
I was his healer. Yeah.

1042
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,442
{\an5}So that's what they call them...

1043
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,612
Ladies, please.

1044
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,405
{\an5}How are the wedding arrangements going?

1045
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,615
Have you found a church?

1046
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,450
Yeah, well, about that...

1047
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,094
No, no, they don't want
a Catholic wedding.

1048
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,536
- No?
- No.

1049
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,373
I'm sorry, I'm just curious,
but do you speak Spanish?

1050
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,583
Of course we do.

1051
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,960
So why are we speaking English?

1052
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,421
Well, because we're
in the United States.

1053
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,132
We got here very young
and we had to learn English.

1054
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:34,763
{\an5}We spoke Spanish at home. But everyone
spoke English at school and the streets,

1055
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,392
so it was hard to preserve it.

1056
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,935
Of course.

1057
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,605
Oh, my God!
I need to burp the baby.

1058
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,858
{\an5}She has been like that
since she become a mom.

1059
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,777
- The death of the maiden.
- Exactly.

1060
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,237
Time to get a new toy.

1061
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,488
Okay.

1062
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,824
Where do you want
to hold the reception?

1063
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,160
Well, actually, we haven't
found a place yet.

1064
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,621
We're looking
for something special.

1065
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,557
{\an5}Well, actually,
we have found something special.

1066
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,375
It's called
the Biltmore Hotel...

1067
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,269
{\an5}and it's the place that
I was on the remodeling committee.

1068
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,796
But apparently my daughter
doesn't find it unique enough.

1069
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,089
Dad...

1070
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,842
No, I mean, we were married
in a bingo hall.

1071
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,761
{\an5}But my daughter, I guess,
has now become bored with the Biltmore.

1072
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,304
Dad, I'm not...

1073
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,849
I'm not bored by the Biltmore.

1074
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,935
{\an5}It's just that
it's a little too fancy for us...

1075
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,812
and like we've said before,

1076
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,106
we want something smaller and,

1077
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,108
- And intimate.
- And intimate.

1078
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,736
Maybe, like, by the ocean,
or here.

1079
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,487
- Yes.
- Sofi, no.

1080
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,156
That would never work.

1081
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,949
This house is way too small.

1082
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,451
- Small?
- Pa.

1083
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,162
Well, I wouldn't really
consider this house small.

1084
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,038
I don't mean small
like "small."

1085
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,875
{\an5}I mean small like,
my guest list alone is five hundred people.

1086
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,626
- Five hundred?
- And we haven't...

1087
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,297
{\an5}even counted your mother's
and stepmother's guests, you know.

1088
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,840
Pa, this is our wedding

1089
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,469
and you have to be respectful
of our choices. Right?

1090
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,680
{\an5}These kids.
They spend four years in America

1091
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,557
and suddenly they are gringos.

1092
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,975
What do you expect, mijo?

1093
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,978
That I'm gonna be a guest
at my own son's wedding?

1094
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,313
Yes.

1095
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,582
I think five hundred guests
is a bit much.

1096
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,006
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, it's big.

1097
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,276
You should see
the weddings in México.

1098
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,986
Amazing.

1099
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,781
{\an5}Yeah, well,
we're not in México. We're here in Miami...

1100
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,344
and the costs here
are much different.

1101
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,409
Don't worry about the money,
consuegro.

1102
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,495
How many guests
were you thinking?

1103
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,955
I'll cover the rest.

1104
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,332
- You'll cover the rest?
- Yes.

1105
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,042
Breathe.

1106
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,725
I don't want to burden you
with my needs.

1107
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,379
Well, no, okay, and I'm sorry,
I appreciate the gesture

1108
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,006
but I am the father of the bride

1109
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,942
and the father of the bride
pays for the wedding.

1110
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,135
I don't care
about those old traditions.

1111
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,471
Yes, but I do care
about those old traditions

1112
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,349
{\an5}and that's the way
it's going to be done, thank you.

1113
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,894
Fine.

1114
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,314
But then, let me throw
a little engagement party

1115
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,857
for the families to meet.

1116
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,251
I have a boat here,
in the marina.

1117
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,694
- We can do it here.
- Sounds fantastic.

1118
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,071
- Perfect.
- Thank you, Hernán.

1119
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,364
- Thank you.
- For the wedding.

1120
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,365
- Yes.
- To the wedding.

1121
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,448
To the wedding.

1122
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,491
Cheers.

1123
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,505
Consuegro, I don't care
about the old traditions.

1124
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,465
I pay for the rest.
Come to my boat.

1125
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,133
We could all get tattoos.

1126
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,136
{\an5}You know, at least
he's trying to be gracious and kind.

1127
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,556
{\an5}And I'm not?
I invited 'em to the house, didn't I?

1128
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,974
What am I supposed to do?

1129
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,475
Take 'em skydiving?

1130
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,768
- Oh, boy.
- Anyway...

1131
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,228
we should go
over the ground rules,

1132
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,230
so nobody suspects
we're getting divorced.

1133
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,899
Good call.

1134
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,276
Can we hold hands?

1135
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,361
We can.

1136
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,864
Can we dance?

1137
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,116
If necessary.

1138
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,620
- How about a kiss?
- Absolutely not.

1139
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,581
No.

1140
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,748
So, what can we do?

1141
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,542
How about the usual?

1142
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,961
{\an5}We get to the party
as a couple, we say hello to everybody,

1143
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,547
then you ignore me
for the rest of the party.

1144
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,507
No one will suspect a thing.

1145
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,267
Tío, this is an intimate party,
not a fishing trip.

1146
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
I want to make them ceviche.

1147
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,813
Oh, my God.

1148
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,607
How rich is this guy?

1149
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,610
That's his boat?

1150
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,194
Good thing it was intimate.

1151
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,281
Hey, consuegros!

1152
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,284
Grab some champagne
and come aboard!

1153
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,120
What is he, a Bond villain?

1154
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,706
Whoever he is,
he's my new best friend.

1155
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,637
Look! Ozuna!

1156
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,768
Thank you, my friend.

1157
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,397
Ozuna!

1158
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:46,866
Michael Mann and Don Johnson
came every Saturday

1159
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,370
{\an5}to eat at my restaurant
when they were shooting Miami Vice.

1160
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,999
My husband ran the place,
and I was the cook.

1161
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,209
Amazing. And then
what happened?

1162
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:59,129
Luisito died,
and we had to close the place.

1163
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,506
He was a saint.

1164
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,841
I'm so sorry.

1165
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,009
No, no, it's fine.

1166
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,844
- As I was saying...
- Ma, Ma...

1167
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,303
prima Yolanda's looking for you.

1168
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,639
Something about the flan
being better than yours.

1169
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,558
She doesn't even know
how to beat eggs.

1170
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,476
That flan is from a bakery.

1171
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,621
I thought you needed a break.

1172
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,064
- No, she's lovely.
- She is.

1173
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,984
I can see where you guys
get your spark from.

1174
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,402
Oh, thank you.

1175
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,114
Adán said that you were
an interior decorator?

1176
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,907
- He did?
- Yes.

1177
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,662
Well, it was a while ago,
but I did some things.

1178
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,082
Well, I just bought
a hotel chain.

1179
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,169
Maybe you can help me
to remodel it.

1180
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,421
Really?

1181
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,715
I have to warn you.
I don't come cheap.

1182
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,176
Nor should you.
Come on, let's go dance.

1183
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,927
Let's do it.

1184
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,355
Cora tells me that...

1185
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,358
{\an5}Los Inmortales
won't be playing at Sofi's wedding.

1186
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,696
Times change, I guess.

1187
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,365
No priest, no church.

1188
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,785
Wow.

1189
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,289
Tío, I can't keep fighting Sofi
on everything.

1190
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,791
I get it.

1191
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,920
But if we don't preserve
our tradition, who will, son?

1192
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,004
Who will?

1193
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,881
Hold this.

1194
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,800
There is Ozuna.

1195
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,052
Ozuna!

1196
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,137
Ever hear of the I mm or tales?

1197
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,306
Come with me.

1198
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,643
Excuse me, sir,
does it have shrimp?

1199
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,280
So, how's the father
of the bride?

1200
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,116
A son is a son
until he takes a wife,

1201
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,243
but a daughter's a daughter
all her life.

1202
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,494
A little old-fashioned.

1203
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,954
Classic never dies.

1204
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,664
Touché.

1205
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,750
{\an5}Anyway, I'm going to need you
to docu-sign this here and here.

1206
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,461
Mariachis?

1207
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,090
A hundred pounds of carne a sad a
made with wagyu beef?

1208
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,343
{\an5}Floridian wagyu
can be a bit chewy, so we're importing it.

1209
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,387
Of course. Imported.
Who authorized this?

1210
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,389
Um, Hernán.

1211
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,515
Oh, Hernán.

1212
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,978
You have ten thousand dollars
in fireworks. Who is he?

1213
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,104
The Great Gatsby?

1214
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,522
I don't know who that is, but...

1215
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,190
A thousand guests?

1216
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,067
A thousand guests!

1217
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,277
Well, that went well.

1218
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,903
Excuse me,
I need to talk to you.

1219
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,322
Billy, meet my mom.

1220
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:36,035
{\an5}You raised an angel,
such a beautiful thing.

1221
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,370
Thank you, love.

1222
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,539
Okay. We are here, join me.

1223
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,874
I have a surprise.

1224
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,667
- Another one?
- Yes.

1225
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,918
- Great.
- Natalie!

1226
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,880
Where is... Natalie, join us.
Come on.

1227
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,559
Wow.

1228
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,896
Wow.

1229
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,441
I just bought a pied-à-terre.
Come on.

1230
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,650
- You bought this?
- What?

1231
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,235
It's more like I traded it in.

1232
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,529
A friend of mine
who could not repay a loan

1233
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,031
from our bank said to me...

1234
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,366
"Take my house in Miami."
And I said to him, "No..."

1235
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,555
{\an5}But you always need a house
whenever you want to come and visit.

1236
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,247
So I said, "Why not?"

1237
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,541
It is beautiful.
Spectacular.

1238
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,585
But I want to change the color.

1239
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,089
I also like Spanish architecture

1240
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,467
so I thought you'd like it.

1241
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,885
No, Billy?

1242
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,094
It's Italian.

1243
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,304
Billy...

1244
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,972
Be good.

1245
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,558
That is not working,
the fountain.

1246
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,644
Please call Pancho to fix it,
okay?

1247
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,978
Thank you, love.

1248
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,939
Hernán, this is such
a beautiful home.

1249
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,942
{\an5}I agree. It would make a great
spot for a wedding, don't you think?

1250
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,944
Yeah. I mean,
we just want to get married.

1251
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,779
You wanted an outdoor wedding.

1252
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,132
{\an5}What better way to break
in the new place than doing it here, right?

1253
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,116
What do you say, Natalie?

1254
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,952
But we can't even find
enough salad forks.

1255
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,245
Suck it, Kyler.

1256
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,456
Yes, we can!

1257
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,084
No, we can't.

1258
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,461
- I'm sorry?
- I said...

1259
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:09,754
{\an8} No, we can't.

1260
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,214
You don't get to waltz in here

1261
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,657
and impose your will
on the wedding

1262
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,467
that I'm throwing
for my daughter.

1263
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,760
What I am imposing?

1264
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,470
Ten thousand dollars
in fireworks,

1265
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:20,181
{\an5}ten crates of tequila
from Guadalajara, mariachis,

1266
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,808
a hundred platters
of carne a sad a.

1267
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,434
I offered to pay for them.

1268
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,645
Am I not supposed
to have my traditions

1269
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,815
at my own son's wedding
just because you don't approve?

1270
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,275
Traditions?

1271
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,193
What part of México
does wagyu beef come from?

1272
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,820
It's a modern spin.

1273
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,073
Yeah? At 150 bucks a pop.
And then you hit on my wife.

1274
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,157
- Dad!
- What?

1275
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,826
Billy, not now. No.

1276
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,953
I think you should
take a step back, pal.

1277
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,663
No, you take a step back,
my friend.

1278
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,165
I didn't come across the ocean
with two cents in my pocket...

1279
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,250
You came by plane.

1280
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,668
Yeah. But a lot of us didn't.

1281
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,071
And we didn't come
to this country

1282
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,754
so some aging hipster
in a yacht...

1283
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,090
{\an5}could come in and impose
a thousand-person wedding on us.

1284
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,342
{\an5}Speak to me in Spanish,
you Napoleonic Cuban!

1285
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,903
{\an5}I'll talk to you in Spanish, you clown!

1286
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,095
What about you, whitexican?

1287
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,498
Who are you calling "Cuba no,"
eh?

1288
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,182
No.

1289
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,351
You tacky whitexican.

1290
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,521
So are you, bro!
So are you!

1291
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,618
What the hell is wrong
with you crazies?

1292
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,037
Shut up!

1293
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,289
What is all this Sharks
versus Jets shit?

1294
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,541
We're all Sharks here.

1295
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,376
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

1296
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,920
{\an5}You're taking a day
that's supposed to be all about our kids

1297
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,673
and making it all about you.

1298
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,884
How could you embarrass
our family like this?

1299
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,469
This house is beautiful.

1300
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,054
And it's what
our daughter wants.

1301
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,014
No. That's not what I want.

1302
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,266
{\an5}So the one with the gold makes the rules?

1303
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,493
{\an5}Yes, the one with the gold makes the rules.

1304
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,894
He offered to pay, Billy.

1305
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,705
Yeah? Well, I'm the father
of the bride, not him.

1306
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,272
And I call the shots, not you.

1307
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,083
And I don't approve of weddings
with no shoes.

1308
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,109
And I don't approve of weddings
with Zen priests.

1309
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,254
{\an5}And I don't approve
of a wedding with a thousand guests.

1310
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,781
And I don't approve my girl
marrying that boy.

1311
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,865
Dad!

1312
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,086
You're just the father
of the bride.

1313
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,548
You don't get to approve
who I marry.

1314
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,425
So in two weeks,

1315
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,469
I'm gonna walk down that aisle

1316
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,429
and I'm gonna marry that man...

1317
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,931
whether you're next to me
or not.

1318
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,808
And if you don't wanna
be there, Dad...

1319
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,810
that's on you.

1320
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,649
I'm so sorry.

1321
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,738
You went too far.

1322
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,119
Shit.

1323
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,778
Okay, come on.

1324
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,156
{\an5}You don't need
to keep pretending. Just answer him.

1325
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,407
Answer who?

1326
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,884
David. The guy
who keeps texting you.

1327
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,952
Oh, please. You're pathetic.

1328
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,287
- I'm pathetic?
- Yes.

1329
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,955
Who is it?
And why do you keep hiding?

1330
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:33,499
- I'm not hiding.
- Go on, just answer him.

1331
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,002
- Oh. You want me to answer him?
- Yes.

1332
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,006
Okay. Fine.

1333
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,591
"Hi, David.

1334
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,427
"Can't talk right now.

1335
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,012
"But when can we finally meet

1336
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,514
to discuss divorce proceedings

1337
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,018
"because I can't take this
one more second.

1338
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,144
"Thank you."

1339
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,937
- Send.
- Who's David?

1340
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,814
My lawyer.

1341
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,625
You know, today was supposed
to be fun.

1342
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,377
But you ruined it for everyone.

1343
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,046
And why?

1344
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,299
{\an5}Maybe because things
weren't being done to your standards.

1345
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:27,261
{\an5}Who made you
the standard bearer of everything?

1346
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,388
I thought you would have
gotten the message by now

1347
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,766
but it's clear that that's not
gonna happen.

1348
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,684
I'm done.

1349
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,013
I'm not a bridesmaid,
that's for sure.

1350
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,824
{\an5}I thought maybe you're her
friend from college or something.

1351
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,809
{\an5}- I don't know. I mean, you look good.
- Okay.

1352
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,313
Do we love it?

1353
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,666
- You look amazing.
- Oh, my God!

1354
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,316
That is gorgeous.

1355
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,443
- Cora, it's beautiful.
- Cora, seriously.

1356
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,487
- You did an amazing job.
- Oh, my God.

1357
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,742
It's okay.

1358
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,953
Don't worry. It'll be done
by the wedding.

1359
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,014
Some people actually like
for their sleeves to fall off.

1360
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,123
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1361
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,791
- Yeah.
- Trendy.

1362
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:39,875
Can I try mine on?

1363
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,168
I need two more days.

1364
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,087
Two more days?
The wedding's in four.

1365
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,756
{\an5}- No. We're running a little behind.
- A little?

1366
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,025
Don't start with me, Sofi, okay?

1367
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,801
You're gonna make me nervous.

1368
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,720
I'm gonna make you nervous?

1369
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,763
- Is that my wedding dress?
- Yeah.

1370
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,307
I based my design off of it.

1371
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,475
With the shoulder pads.

1372
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,643
Yeah.

1373
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,727
Try it on.

1374
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,980
Yes.
Yes, Mom. Yes, please.

1375
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,274
It's Sofi's moment, not mine.

1376
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,525
No, Mom, no. Don't be silly.

1377
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,319
- We'll get violent.
- You have to.

1378
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,486
- Really?
- Yes, you can.

1379
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,880
- Come on.
- I'll help you put it on.

1380
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,740
I don't think
I'm gonna fit into this.

1381
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,533
{\an5}Try it on! Try it on! Try it on!

1382
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,868
Okay, okay, okay.

1383
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,329
Well, you can always
not close the zipper.

1384
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,622
Wait, wait, wait.

1385
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,332
- Okay. Okay.
- After all these years.

1386
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,726
I've never been so scared
putting on a dress.

1387
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,376
- Okay. Here we go.
- Oh, my Lord.

1388
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,087
{\an5}- I really should have gotten the Vaseline.
- Yeah.

1389
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,214
You gotta grease me up.

1390
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,342
{\an5}Mom, be careful you almost fell!

1391
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,801
You're gonna knock me over.

1392
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,887
- Okay, hold it.
- Okay. Okay.

1393
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,180
Okay.

1394
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,182
- Whoa! Oh, my...
- There we go. There we go.

1395
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,809
I feel really bad for her.
Like...

1396
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,395
Hi.

1397
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,359
Am I interrupting?

1398
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,364
I got snacks.

1399
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,075
From Vicky's.

1400
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,203
Okay.

1401
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,415
Put it over here
and I'm on my way.

1402
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,429
I'm sorry.

1403
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,600
Still mad at you.

1404
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,018
You know.

1405
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,334
Cora made this?

1406
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,837
Yeah.

1407
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,047
She's good.

1408
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,052
She's a mess, but she's good.

1409
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,141
Ta da!

1410
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,101
Oh, my God!

1411
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,644
- Gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

1412
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,771
- We need to take some pictures.
- Oh, my God.

1413
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:13,946
Today is your day.

1414
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,948
No, Mom. No.
We can share it.

1415
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,067
What is up, my Mexican brother?

1416
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,903
Are you ready to see
the real Miami?

1417
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:54,904
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1418
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,530
Can I get a hell yeah?

1419
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,115
Hell yeah.

1420
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,202
Hey, it's not your funeral.
Tonight is your night.

1421
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,411
Hell yeah.

1422
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,338
Where's your dad?
He's not coming?

1423
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,592
He wasn't feeling well.

1424
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,072
Hey, what is this, a funeral?
Come on, move over, move over.

1425
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:22,097
Let's go.

1426
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,272
You beautiful thing!

1427
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,482
Wow.

1428
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,193
I love you, my darling!
Oh, my God.

1429
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,694
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

1430
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,865
Oye, hey, where's the bachelor?

1431
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,578
No, no, no.

1432
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,414
Somebody call 911.
The party police is here.

1433
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,041
Acting like a dead fly, huh?

1434
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,543
{\an8}Guys.

1435
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,103
{\an8}- It's not so easy, bro.
- No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

1436
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,546
- Hey.
- Good girl.

1437
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,398
- Hey. Hey. No, no, no. Hey.
- Watch the loafers!

1438
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,882
Hey, hey, hey.

1439
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,110
Billy's around. Billy's around.
Come on. Billy's around.

1440
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:00,386
It's your turn to get down.

1441
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:05,140
No. You're gonna have
to go through him.

1442
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,436
Amor, how are you?

1443
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,188
How's the bachelor party?

1444
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,190
{\an5}- I can't hear you. How's dinner?
- It was good.

1445
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,693
We tried this new restaurant
by Coconut Grove

1446
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,444
but I think we're gonna call it
a night.

1447
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,071
Yeah. Same here.

1448
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,049
{\an5}We're just gonna grab
a couple beers and head home.

1449
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,700
You don't have to pretend.

1450
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,983
{\an5}I don't like
the whole exploiting women for money thing.

1451
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,662
You know that. The...

1452
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,865
Then why did you have Junior
plan your bachelor party?

1453
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,088
Amor, gotta go. Love you.

1454
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,566
Let's get you laid, abuela.

1455
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,154
Thank you.

1456
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,089
Let's dance.

1457
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,966
I don't think I should.

1458
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,053
It's our children's wedding!

1459
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,304
That's true.

1460
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,556
Your daughter, my son,
our children!

1461
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,849
Okay.

1462
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,025
Uh...

1463
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,821
The things I said...

1464
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,826
to you and about you
the other day at the island

1465
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,370
was inexcusable.

1466
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,164
Billy...

1467
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,541
My dad gets under my skin
all the time.

1468
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,227
- That's very kind of you.
- I understand.

1469
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,671
That's very kind of you,
but you deserve an explanation.

1470
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,050
I haven't been myself lately
because...

1471
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,225
Ingrid and I are getting
a divorce.

1472
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:15,729
Billy...

1473
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,899
I'm so sorry. I...

1474
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,819
We were gonna break the news
to Sofi the other night...

1475
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:25,864
but then she announced
her engagement to you

1476
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,533
so you can understand how I felt

1477
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,776
{\an5}when I learned
that her new boyfriend was gonna take...

1478
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,331
Take my girl away
from me to Mexico.

1479
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:39,336
My whole family's falling apart.

1480
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,802
{\an5}So I'm sorry for taking it out
on you. I know it's not your fault.

1481
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:50,347
Although at the end
of the day...

1482
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,392
of course it is.

1483
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,647
Just to set the record
straight...

1484
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,400
it wasn't my idea
to go back to Mexico.

1485
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:03,652
What do you mean?

1486
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,446
Well, I love New York.

1487
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,948
No one knew who I was.
I could be myself.

1488
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,951
{\an5}And when I met Sofi,
I knew she liked me for who I was.

1489
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,038
So why are you going
back to Mexico?

1490
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,665
She found a job that mattered
to her there.

1491
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,670
So you're following her back
to your country?

1492
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,963
Yeah.

1493
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,089
Ironically.

1494
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,717
Yeah.

1495
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,260
What about you?

1496
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,180
New York, your career?
Your own plans?

1497
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:34,641
{\an5}My plans are to figure
out a life next to your daughter.

1498
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,103
And when she saw
all the immigrants

1499
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,148
stuck at the Mexican border,
you know...

1500
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,984
{\an5}she told me
how much you guys struggled to get here.

1501
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,987
And she felt like she had to do
something about it.

1502
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,948
So I just chose to join her.

1503
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,955
I'm gonna tell Sofi
about the divorce

1504
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,516
after you come back
from the honeymoon.

1505
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,626
So I'm gonna need you
to keep this quiet.

1506
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,646
{\an5}- Billy...
- Listen, I know it's a tall order.

1507
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,632
I just want you to understand
that...

1508
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:11,804
{\an5}Well, I didn't want you to get
married without knowing that I approve.

1509
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,140
So you approve
of this marriage, then?

1510
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,478
Of course I do.

1511
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,820
I'm sorry.
Did you need some privacy?

1512
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,489
- No, we're all done here.
- Yeah.

1513
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,032
Come on, papi.

1514
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,204
What's the matter with you?
You have a heart condition.

1515
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:39,248
I can die doing what I love.

1516
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,459
Okay, great. One last kiss.
Let's go.

1517
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,836
Come on. I'm taking you home.

1518
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,879
- Wait, no...
- Yeah. All right. Here we go.

1519
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,756
See you later, alligator.

1520
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,030
I feel like I've gotten
a lot of pressure from you.

1521
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:55,806
- Shots. Let's go!
- Okay.

1522
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:58,934
{\an5}It's the first time
that I go out since Hernáncito was born.

1523
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,686
I don't wanna go.

1524
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,188
I'll look after Hernáncito
if you wanna sleep in.

1525
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,731
- Yeah.
- Did you pump milk?

1526
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:05,983
Yes.

1527
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,418
It's in the fridge.
Would you do that?

1528
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:08,735
- Yes. I will.
- Yes.

1529
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,195
Gracias.

1530
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,281
You know, I thought
you hated each other.

1531
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,867
No. We just like to make
Hernán think

1532
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,869
that we're fighting over him.

1533
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,831
This is truly an evolved state
that you two are in.

1534
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,280
{\an5}- Come on, let's go dance. Come on.
- No. That's my drink.

1535
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,264
Whoa, whoa. No.

1536
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,183
- It's your bachelorette party.
- I know.

1537
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,619
{\an5}I'm just worried
that you're gonna wake up hungover tomorrow

1538
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,562
and you have all those dresses
to finish.

1539
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,897
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Just saying.

1540
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,733
Relax. I got this.

1541
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,152
Cora, the wedding's in two days.

1542
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,947
{\an5}All I'm asking is for you to take
it just a little bit more seriously.

1543
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,782
Right. Yes. You're...

1544
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,411
Sofi, you're such a wise soul,
and I'm such a mess.

1545
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:01,830
{\an5}- You're not a mess.
- Why don't I follow your example.

1546
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,707
I'm gonna go back to work

1547
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,143
{\an5}- while everyone else is out here celebrating.
- That's not what I meant.

1548
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,128
- Have fun! Bye!
- Wait. Really?

1549
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,255
She'll forget everything
tomorrow.

1550
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,633
Good God.

1551
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:14,801
- Two more, please.
- Yes, please.

1552
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,428
And one for her.

1553
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,608
Papi.

1554
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,235
Papi, there's a storm coming.

1555
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,117
I don't think so, sweetheart.

1556
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,245
It's veering off
into the warm water.

1557
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:45,040
Yeah. But what if it doesn't?

1558
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:48,585
I mean, your whole family
has flown here.

1559
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,088
Cora's been working
on the dresses forever.

1560
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,673
We've been planning this wedding

1561
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,299
for an entire month.

1562
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,425
I mean...

1563
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,635
Do you wanna cancel it?

1564
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,512
No, no. I don't wanna...

1565
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,306
Whatever you wanna do,
I'll support you either way.

1566
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,724
I don't wanna cancel it.

1567
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,935
I'm just having, like,
a bad feeling about this.

1568
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:07,521
I don't know,
it feels like this is a sign.

1569
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,844
I mean, maybe we're rushing it.

1570
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:09,916
Maybe we're rushing all of this.

1571
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,942
Quelite, hey.

1572
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,194
It's not a sign,
and we are rushing things

1573
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,114
{\an5}precisely 'cause we wanna start
our lives together as soon as possible.

1574
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,741
- No?
- Yeah.

1575
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,326
Yeah.

1576
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,745
So we decided to get married
during storm season in Miami.

1577
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:28,250
- It's my bad.
- Kind of.

1578
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,336
Hey, we're a team.
We can get through this.

1579
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,463
Now, let's go
to this rehearsal dinner.

1580
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:39,261
One, two, three.

1581
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,679
Don't roll your eyes at me,
honey.

1582
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,514
Petals to the left
and petals to the right.

1583
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,683
My head is about to burst.

1584
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,731
It's miraculous!

1585
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,025
At what time
did you leave the club?

1586
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,651
Two in the morning.

1587
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,236
You?

1588
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,071
I left the club at six.

1589
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,380
Is it too tight?
Hey, no.

1590
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,216
Tyler. Tyler. Not that dress.
That's not your dress.

1591
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,386
This is your dress.
Go in there, put it on. And...

1592
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,972
Cora, honey. Cora, rehearsal.
Come on, let's go.

1593
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,308
Huan, please take care of her
and finish pinning her.

1594
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,809
And I gotta go.

1595
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,020
You don't pay me enough
for this madness.

1596
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,232
What are you doing?

1597
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,901
Rehearsal has started!

1598
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,652
Are you kidding me?

1599
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,697
{\an8}I want to finish
burrying the knives to prevent the storm!

1600
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,742
Mom, don't be ridiculous.

1601
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,621
Give me those knives.

1602
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,206
You see?

1603
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,797
I really like him.

1604
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,674
You two make a beautiful couple.

1605
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,469
I learned from the best.

1606
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,432
Where is Cora?

1607
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,935
- Let's go. Come on. Okay.
- Here we go.

1608
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,938
Bridesmaids. And it's one,
two. One, two.

1609
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,441
Cora, let's go. Come on.
One, two. Elegant.

1610
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,486
And now, who's gonna
give this girl away?

1611
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,697
I'd like to.

1612
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,160
Okay.

1613
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,317
{\an5}The groom's mother
just called me an everything bagel.

1614
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,487
{\an5}She says I'm everything
she ever wanted to taste in one bite.

1615
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,906
The little puppy has a bite.

1616
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,036
Out with it.

1617
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,873
I've known you for a long time.

1618
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,125
What's wrong?

1619
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,420
Come with me.

1620
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,760
What's going on?

1621
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:31,433
You know how Ingrid and I
have been going to therapy?

1622
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:32,851
Yeah.

1623
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,974
Well, it hasn't panned out,
and she wants a divorce.

1624
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,522
You're getting divorced?

1625
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,191
Cora. Cora, Cora. Don't you...

1626
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,692
No!
Mom.

1627
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:42,903
Pfft.
Are you getting divorced?

1628
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,366
What did she say?

1629
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,704
Mom?

1630
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:54,998
Billy.

1631
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:56,166
Dad?

1632
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:58,543
Cora?

1633
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:02,005
- Can someone say something?
- Girls.

1634
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:04,716
We never intended for you
to find out like this.

1635
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:06,051
Divorce?

1636
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,011
What do you mean, divorced?

1637
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:10,430
You can't get divorced.

1638
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,016
Was there someone else?

1639
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:15,227
- No!
- Mami, butt out, please.

1640
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,062
We don't get divorced.

1641
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,690
{\an5}Not even when I found out
that Luisito had a second family,

1642
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,692
- did I get divorced?
- What?

1643
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:23,902
What?

1644
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,905
I need to get out of here.

1645
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,241
Quelite, Quelite. Wait, wait,
wait. Calm down, okay?

1646
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,034
We're gonna figure this out,
I promise.

1647
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,494
How? How?

1648
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,579
{\an5}- They've been lying to us the whole time.
- No.

1649
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,624
{\an5}They didn't have a choice.
What else were they supposed to do?

1650
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,835
Did you know?

1651
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:42,462
What? No. No.

1652
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:43,981
- Oh, my God.
- No. Quelite, wait. Please.

1653
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,590
- Sofi, Sofi!
- Get off of me.

1654
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,010
It wasn't his fault.
I told him not to say anything.

1655
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,679
You told Adán, Billy?

1656
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,639
What the hell were you thinking?

1657
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:53,848
Look at us.

1658
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,892
You fighting.
You lying.

1659
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,887
I can't get married like this.

1660
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,649
- No. Amor.
- Oh, Billy.

1661
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,154
Was there shrimp in this?

1662
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,364
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

1663
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,658
You made this mess. Go fix it.

1664
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:34,889
Hey, have you seen Sofi?

1665
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:00,540
May I sit down?

1666
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,677
This is where your mom
and I got married.

1667
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:20,018
Don't worry about us.
Live your life.

1668
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,854
Because people like Adán,

1669
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,482
they don't come along
that often.

1670
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,693
How, Dad?

1671
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,281
Everyone says
that marriage is a dying thing,

1672
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,618
but you guys were
one of my few pillars of hope.

1673
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:45,085
Why are you getting a divorce?

1674
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,754
{\an5}That would be unfair
for me to answer with your mom not here

1675
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:51,049
but I will tell you
that it's not her fault.

1676
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,385
- So you wanted it?
- No.

1677
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,844
Then what happened?

1678
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:58,056
I think your mom
wanted a partner.

1679
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,517
A partner that she can enjoy
her life with.

1680
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:04,604
And I stopped being fun.

1681
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:08,066
I stopped being her accomplice.

1682
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,110
Her friend.

1683
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,947
Why don't you just start
doing it?

1684
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:16,908
I'm afraid that ship has sailed.

1685
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:19,244
Not if you don't let it.

1686
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,081
All I can tell you is that...

1687
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,208
if I would have been
more like Adán...

1688
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,378
this probably
wouldn't have happened.

1689
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:33,091
Dad, you are like Adán.

1690
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,634
- No.
- Yes.

1691
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,428
You're sensitive.

1692
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,595
You're vulnerable.

1693
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,348
You're supportive.

1694
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,308
You just don't dare to show it.

1695
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,230
That's the difference.

1696
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,362
You need to get back,

1697
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,740
because Adán is probably
losing his mind right now.

1698
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,116
Oh, God.

1699
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,752
- She'll come around.
- You think so?

1700
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,170
Absolutely.

1701
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,305
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry.

1702
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,432
- I swear...
- It's okay. It's okay.

1703
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:25,477
It's the last secret
I'll ever keep from you.

1704
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,645
Please, please, please marry me.

1705
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,189
Everything will be okay.

1706
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:31,441
I really hope so,
because you suck at lying.

1707
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:32,650
Is that a yes?

1708
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,943
It's a yes.

1709
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:42,243
The wind has risen
and we've lost power.

1710
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,954
Sergeant Cora, lock the hatch.

1711
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,331
Aye, aye, Captain.

1712
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,917
Corporal Sofi,
I need a head count.

1713
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,668
One, two, three, four.

1714
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,631
Lieutenant Herrera,
engage the cryosleep chamber.

1715
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:56,341
Engaging, sir.

1716
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,806
Help!

1717
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:03,890
Quickly!

1718
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,061
Hurry up!

1719
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:11,314
Billy!

1720
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,361
Billy, please.
Get in here quick.

1721
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,112
Hurry up!

1722
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:21,967
- Hurry up! It's stuck.
- I got it. Get out of the way.

1723
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,409
- It's stuck.
- Get out of the way.

1724
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,412
What happened?

1725
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,164
Just a shutter got stuck.

1726
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,711
We're gonna need a mop.

1727
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,637
Guess the storm sped up.

1728
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,013
We've seen worse.

1729
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,306
Yeah.

1730
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,990
Get some rest.
We got a big day tomorrow.

1731
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:52,438
Dad?

1732
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,858
Can you stay with us a while?

1733
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,071
Mom?

1734
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:12,792

Oh, my gosh!

1747
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:37,543
Cora, it's beautiful.

1748
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,796
- You like it?
- I love it.

1749
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:40,964
- Come here.
- I love it.

1750
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,715
- It's amazing.
- Oh, my God.

1751
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,468
I'm so glad you like it.

1752
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:46,970
I love it. Thank you.

1753
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,013
- Thank you so much.
- Which one's mine?

1754
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,325
{\an5}- Chelsea, this is you.
- Wow, you really are a designer.

1755
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:54,143
{\an5}And, Vanessa, I made this one for
you 'cause I know you hate dresses.

1756
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:55,311
Thanks.

1757
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:05,238
Okay, watch your step.

1758
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:06,322
Papi.

1759
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,618
I made this for you.

1760
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:13,454
It's a pearl
from Mom's wedding dress.

1761
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:23,589
Watch your step.

1762
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:27,969
Take your time.

1763
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:29,512
Okay. Thank you, mamá.

1764
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,391
- Dad, you want me...
- Let's go.

1765
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:36,352
Gotta move.

1766
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,229
Okay. I'll be right back.
I forgot to pee.

1767
01:28:38,312 --> 01:28:39,731
What?

1768
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,357
My God, it never fails.

1769
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,493
We're making good time.
You okay, baby?

1770
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,662
A little nervous, but I'm good.

1771
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:09,344
What the hell's going on?

1772
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:13,514
What are you looking at?

1773
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,059
The bridge collapsed.

1774
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,440
Get me as close to it
as possible, please.

1775
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,656
- Okay. That's...
- Oh, my God.

1776
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,366
No, no, no.
I have a wedding inside.

1777
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,635
Okay, I don't think
you understand.

1778
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:35,161
Listen to me for a second.

1779
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:37,872
Call the chief of police,
tell him that Junior Herrera...

1780
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:40,017
{\an5}- I just want you to understand something.
- Junior, take it easy.

1781
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,977
{\an5}- This is his wedding. That's his house. Okay?
- Okay. Hold on.

1782
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:43,753
Settle down, now.
Settle down.

1783
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:46,631
{\an5}Officer, I understand
that the bridge might be compromised

1784
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:47,965
but we need to get across.

1785
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,133
It's not safe to cross.

1786
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,052
A portion of the bridge
collapsed

1787
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,696
{\an5}- in last night's storm.
- We have a wedding on the other side.

1788
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,181
I understand,
but it is not safe to cross.

1789
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:58,309
{\an5}My life's work is in there.
Please, you need to let me go through.

1790
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,478
{\an5}- Bridge collapsed in last night's storm.
- Kyler.

1791
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,331
{\an5}- No one can cross. It's very dangerous.
- What happened?

1792
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,356
Give us your worst.

1793
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,733
Hey, Natalie.

1794
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:09,445
{\an5}There are a couple more palm
fronds than we were bargaining for

1795
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,947
- What?
- ...and their flowers...

1796
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:12,532
are not really looking
very good.

1797
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,326
No, no. But can we have
the wedding there?

1798
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:18,746
The wedding's not happening
here.

1799
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,290
We can't use
the venue. It's done.

1800
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:22,542
What are you talking about?

1801
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,252
It's over. It's done.

1802
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:27,380
{\an5}The tent collapsed.
The wedding's over. I'm so sorry.

1803
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:28,589
She's right.

1804
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:30,842
It's over.

1805
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,553
We can get married some
other time. Some other place.

1806
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:35,012
Wait a second. Sofi.

1807
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,182
We just had a bridge collapse.
We had a storm.

1808
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,017
I mean, how many more signs
do we want?

1809
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,687
Okay. Don't panic, okay?
I got this.

1810
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,189
Let me call the Biltmore,
see if we can get in there.

1811
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,400
I'm done. I'm done.

1812
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:49,652
Give me a second.

1813
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:53,698
We'll get married another time.

1814
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,451
- When?
- I don't know.

1815
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:00,621
Biltmore Hotel.
How can I help you?

1816
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,876
Hello?

1817
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:07,545
Hello?

1818
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:08,880
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

1819
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,632
You never wanted a wedding
in a hotel.

1820
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,594
You wanted something unique,
something special.

1821
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,513
You wanted a beach or a barn.

1822
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:18,848
What about...

1823
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,266
What about our home?

1824
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,730
You never wanted a wedding
with 800 strangers.

1825
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:29,150
Right?

1826
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,611
So, this is your day.

1827
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,531
Take it as an opportunity

1828
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,617
to have the wedding
you always wanted.

1829
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:41,704
Let's have it at our home.

1830
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,082
Our home.

1831
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,421
- Let's do it! Let's do it!
- Yes!

1832
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:53,049
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

1833
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,843
Junior! Get Junior Jr.
And a text chain.

1834
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,803
Get everybody to bring
something by-00.

1835
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,514
{\an5}- I can't go back to dog walking.
- Hey.

1836
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:03,226
Oh. Pull yourself together.
What's the matter with you?

1837
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,186
You've done this
a million times.

1838
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:06,604
I'm not a wedding planner.

1839
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:07,831
What do you mean,
you're not a wedding planner?

1840
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:09,190
- I'm a fraud.
- What?

1841
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:10,733
You're more
than a wedding planner.

1842
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:12,902
I only interned for Becky Weisz
for three months.

1843
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:16,614
{\an5}And by "interned,"
I mean, I picked her kid up from school.

1844
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:17,990
I picked up the wrong kid.

1845
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,409
They sent out an Amber Alert,
okay?

1846
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,954
I'm a joke.

1847
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,015
{\an5}All right. All right,
all right. Enough of that, enough of that.

1848
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:27,059
{\an5}You said yourself,
there's nothing you can't do with a phone.

1849
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,417
- Okay?
- Okay.

1850
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:29,794
You're a she-boss.

1851
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,505
We're gonna do this.
Just, what do we need?

1852
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:37,635
{\an5}I could redirect
some flower trucks to the house.

1853
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:38,761
That's something.

1854
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,513
It'll be shabby more than chic.

1855
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:42,640
But I guess we can make it work.

1856
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,141
Mami, call las tias...

1857
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,065
{\an5}- and tell them to start cooking now.
- Go! Go!

1858
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,645
Where's Tío Walter?
Tío Walter!

1859
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,147
Yeah. Say no more.
Inmortales are back.

1860
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,649
Inmortales.

1861
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,235
Kyler, it's back on!

1862
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,155
- Let's go.
- Let's move.

1863
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:01,492
- Sofi, here.
- Thank you.

1864
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,495
- Wine, wine, wine.
- Cheese, cheese.

1865
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:05,788
Thank you.
Tortillas.

1866
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,000
- Thank you, Javie.
- Go, go, go.

1867
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,043
Cora, are you getting the cakes?

1868
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,879
Uh. Yeah? Great.

1869
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:16,007
We're gonna need chips.
I almost crashed into you.

1870
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,509
It's fine!
Just basketball it.

1871
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:22,054
{\an5}Hey, everybody.
Thanks for coming. Thanks for the support.

1872
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:24,265
We're gonna turn this house
into a wedding venue.

1873
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,494
Okay. So we're gonna need
to pool from the neighbors

1874
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:29,413
as many tables, chairs, plates,
and silverware as we can.

1875
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,277
Yeah, and, Antonio,
if you have any complaints,

1876
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,815
- just share that.
- Wait, no, no, no.

1877
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:34,818
I have an Uber code.
No one's bringing their car.

1878
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:36,694
What is that?

1879
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,195
The pig.

1880
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,656
Okay. Well, bring el cochino
to the back.

1881
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,283
Excuse us. Excuse us.

1882
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:43,802
- Come on, move it or lose it.
- Watch it. Coming through.

1883
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:45,137
- I'm sorry. Is that the cake?
- Careful.

1884
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,079
- Yep.
- Unfortunately.

1885
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:50,124
Could it match any less?
Jesus.

1886
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,667
Three-for-one.

1887
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,437
{\an5}JoJo Siwa called.
She wants her wedding cake back.

1888
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:56,547
I got you. Here we go.
Nice and easy. Come through.

1889
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:58,341
Okay.
Hi, kids.

1890
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:00,968
{\an5}Okay. We're gonna take
all the petals and put them in the bowl.

1891
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,470
Good. Just like that.
In the bowl.

1892
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:04,722
Great. In the bowl. Good.

1893
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:09,477
Okay. Ingrid,
I'm gonna set up the backyard,

1894
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,312
you look after the food.

1895
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:12,998
{\an5}Okay. You know they're gonna
destroy the whole house, right?

1896
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,857
We'll remodel it later.

1897
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:18,736
{\an5}200 people in four hours? Impossible!

1898
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:20,821
Ladies! How can we help?

1899
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,199
What can you make in four hours?

1900
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:24,200
Mole.

1901
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:25,910
Yeah. Get in here. Sold.

1902
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,578
Mole and ropa vieja?

1903
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:28,788
Who the hell cares?

1904
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,581
- Marcel a, do you cook?
- Sure, I do.

1905
01:34:30,664 --> 01:34:32,249
Where's an apron?

1906
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,493
{\an5}- In the drawer.
- Line the table up on the back patio.

1907
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,462
Careful.

1908
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:39,673
Has anyone heard
from the Zen guide?

1909
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,485
{\an5}- Help us out here, guys. We have this...
- Here. Hold the end.

1910
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,094
- Right here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1911
01:34:44,553 --> 01:34:46,847
Send every case of champagne
you've got.

1912
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,850
And ten boxes of the best
Mexican cigars. Okay?

1913
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:52,478
Mexican cigars?
I can't wait.

1914
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,273
Oye, where's Julieta?

1915
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,525
She's sick from the shrimp.

1916
01:34:57,608 --> 01:34:59,902
Time's running out. Let's go.

1917
01:34:59,985 --> 01:35:01,237
Oh, my God. What happened?

1918
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,863
The bridge collapsed,
so I swam here.

1919
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,132
Well, don't make this about you.

1920
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:05,408
- I'm sorry.
- Kyler!

1921
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:06,760
- I'm sorry. Yes, you're right.
- Hurry!

1922
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:07,827
I need your help.

1923
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,120
We got this.

1924
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,206
Here you go.

1925
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:16,168
Junior? How's that pig?

1926
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,379
{\an5}- He's seen better days.
- Good.

1927
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:27,930
Tío, where are the rest
of Inmortales?

1928
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:29,306
They passed away.

1929
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:33,144
Play louder. Over here.

1930
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:34,645
Oye. Junior Jr.

1931
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:37,021
Put that down.

1932
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,442
And help me with the lechón.

1933
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:40,985
It's hot. Be careful. Ready?

1934
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,153
Okay.

1935
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:46,240
Watch my loafers.

1936
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:50,202
{\an5}- Is this all you got? Such a small pig?
- Yes, Chi Chi.

1937
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,055
I hope you threw
some sour orange juice on it.

1938
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,849
{\an5}- Yes, Chi Chi. Yes.
- I could have cooked it.

1939
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,541
Is the Herrera wedding here?

1940
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:56,834
Yes, the wedding is here.

1941
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:57,835
{\an8}- Billy.
- Sí.

1942
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:58,918
Where do we put them?

1943
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:02,673
Hey, I got an idea.

1944
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:03,799
This way, gentlemen.

1945
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:05,217
{\an8}Okay. Come on. Come on.

1946
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:14,643
All the way up!

1947
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,061
- Papi.
- Ready?

1948
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,396
Yes. And you?

1949
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:19,607
No.

1950
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:22,943
Watch your dress.

1951
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,069
Yeah.

1952
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,407
Okay.

1953
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,169
Let's go!

1954
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:54,558
What is she doing here?

1955
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,062
{\an5}Adán's Zen teacher
couldn't make it because of the storm,

1956
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,356
so Natalie's officiating.

1957
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:02,900
I guess she is more than
just a wedding planner.

1958
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:05,277
God, I hope so.

1959
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,407
- Cora? Cora. Cora!
- Cora. Cora.

1960
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,076
Come here.

1961
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,410
Look at her sleeve.

1962
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,788
- Look at her sleeve.
- Oh, my God.

1963
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:18,290
Holy shit.
Take this.

1964
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:19,875
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1965
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:22,127
Oh.

1966
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:26,465
There. Beautiful. Yes.
Great. Gorgeous.

1967
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,591
Good, thank you.

1968
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:28,818
- Looks good, looks good.
- You sure?

1969
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:30,386
Yeah.
Mamá.

1970
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:34,265
Don't worry, mi amor.
You look even more beautiful.

1971
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,267
- Help me with the veil.
- Yeah.

1972
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,359
- I'll be up front. Good luck.
- Thank you, Mom.

1973
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,154
Oye, Ingrid.

1974
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,998
No one could ever
give this girl away...

1975
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,961
but for the sake
of some old tradition,

1976
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,672
if someone's gonna have to
walk her down that aisle...

1977
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:10,175
then I want it to be
the both of us.

1978
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:15,347
Shall we?

1979
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:21,645
Yeah.

1980
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:22,730
Come.

1981
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:28,277
Damn you, Billy.

1982
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:05,022
Hola.

1983
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,524
Bonjour.

1984
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,361
Bienvenidos a this wedding.

1985
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:14,365
I would like you all
to use your mind's eye

1986
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:17,785
and visualize what this wedding
could have been.

1987
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:22,206
Custom crystal chandeliers,

1988
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:25,042
synchronized flamingos
dancing in a fountain

1989
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:29,254
and a build-your-own
blini-blintz bar that was

1990
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,174
truly so beautiful.

1991
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:37,388
But things don't always go
as planned...

1992
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,224
in life, or in love.

1993
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:45,646
And sometimes, when your plans
crumble and crash...

1994
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:48,232
life surprises you...

1995
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:51,568
and gives you a moment
more perfect...

1996
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,612
than one that
you could ever imagine.

1997
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:57,866
So, trust, surrender...

1998
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:02,204
and a little love from your fam
is truly all that you need.

1999
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,374
And now...

2000
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:09,253
{\an5}do you, Sofi Herrera Castillo,
take this man to be your wedded husband?

2001
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,172
I do.

2002
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,425
And do you,
Adán Castillo Herrera...

2003
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,927
take this woman
to be your wedded wife?

2004
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,010
I do.

2005
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:21,432
He took your last name?

2006
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,892
And now, under the eye of God,

2007
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:26,437
and surrounded
by your loving family...

2008
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,564
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

2009
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,315
You may now kiss the bride.

2010
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,083
Cuban?

2011
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,251
Pre-Castro.

2012
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:43,680
It's good.

2013
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:50,562
You know, Billy...

2014
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,148
every summer my buddies and I

2015
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,902
take a big fishing trip
in the Sea of Cortez.

2016
01:41:58,403 --> 01:42:01,240
You know, cigars,
tequila, mezcal.

2017
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:04,785
I think you'd enjoy it.

2018
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,122
Plus, Adán doesn't like fishing.

2019
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:10,999
Or boxing.

2020
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:12,125
Soccer.

2021
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,293
Or baseball.

2022
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:14,962
Or strippers.

2023
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,757
Where did I go wrong
with that kid?

2024
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,635
To be perfectly honest...

2025
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,388
I can't think of a place.

2026
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:49,288
I'd like to propose a toast.

2027
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,792
Not yet, I have a lot of things
to say.

2028
01:42:57,129 --> 01:43:00,591
I came to this country
with nothing.

2029
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:05,762
On a raft...

2030
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,099
in the middle of a hurricane,
surrounded by sharks.

2031
01:43:09,182 --> 01:43:11,727
Oh.

2032
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:16,523
All kidding aside,
to my beautiful Sofi.

2033
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,067
When you told me
that you were moving to Mexico,

2034
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:21,987
I feared that all our efforts
coming into this country

2035
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:26,116
{\an5}to wanting to strive
and to do better were gonna disappear.

2036
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:28,911
That our family traditions
were gonna disappear.

2037
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,289
Things have been coming at me...

2038
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,083
very fast...

2039
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,336
and it's been a struggle
for me to keep up.

2040
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:41,632
{\an5}But when I realized the kind
of life that you wanted to build...

2041
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:45,385
{\an5}I started to learn that
it's time for me to let go of my past

2042
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:49,222
and embrace the future.

2043
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:54,645
{\an5}And that fills me with so much
excitement and joy and pride...

2044
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:57,022
for the kind of person
you wanna be.

2045
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:01,485
To Adán.

2046
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:04,363
{\an5}You came to my house
and you said, "I wanna be like Sofi."

2047
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:06,740
And now,
I just wanna be like you.

2048
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:12,496
I'm blessed to have you
in my life.

2049
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:19,419
And to my dear Ingrid.

2050
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,466
I shouldn't have taken
this long to say this...

2051
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:27,469
{\an5}but you know how proud I am
of all the houses that I've built...

2052
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:29,554
but the only one
that truly matters...

2053
01:44:32,015 --> 01:44:34,351
is the home that you have built.

2054
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:36,812
And I thank you for that.

2055
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,649
And I love you madly.

2056
01:44:44,277 --> 01:44:48,615
So, I humbly ask for all of you
to forgive...

2057
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:51,284
this stubborn, old...

2058
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:55,622
proud Cuban man...

2059
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:59,710
for taking so long
to realize these simple things.

2060
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:02,713
Let's raise a glass
to Adán and Sofi...

2061
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:06,008
wish 'em the best of luck
and much love.

2062
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,384
To the bride and groom.

2063
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,928
To the bride and groom.

2064
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:38,999
- Having eyes.
- To having eyes.

2065
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:42,753
- Oh, my gosh, here he is.
- How you doing, girls?

2066
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,713
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good.

2067
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:46,882
- Nice speech.
- You liked it?

2068
01:45:46,965 --> 01:45:51,219
{\an5}I thought the speech was a little
corny. Get over yourself, dude.

2069
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:52,804
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2070
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:54,681
I like her.

2071
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:58,351
Hey.

2072
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:02,898
You've always had your way
of doing things...

2073
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:04,483
and I've always had mine.

2074
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:07,444
But after seeing
how you designed

2075
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,112
these dresses for this wedding,

2076
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,239
if you wanna
start your own business...

2077
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:13,450
I got your back.

2078
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:18,580
Thank you, papi.

2079
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,291
Whoo!

2080
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,501
And I'm very proud of you.

2081
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:23,794
Proud of you too.

2082
01:47:38,785 --> 01:47:40,495
You got your unique wedding.

2083
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:43,123
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

2084
01:47:50,672 --> 01:47:53,258
I see you chose our song
for your dance.

2085
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:56,803
Yes.

2086
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,181
Except, I didn't choose it
for us.

2087
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,568
Bravo!

2088
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:32,088
Where are we, Billy?

2089
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,632
What are we doing?

2090
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:37,969
Let's go to Greece.

2091
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:40,096
What?

2092
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:43,600
Well, if you're gonna dump me,
why not go out with a bang?

2093
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:44,976
Oh.

2094
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:46,770
True.

2095
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:56,613
So, what are the ground rules?

2096
01:48:57,739 --> 01:48:58,782
Hm.

2097
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,701
Can we hold hands?

2098
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:04,746
Yes.

2099
01:49:04,829 --> 01:49:06,039
Can we dance?

2100
01:49:07,582 --> 01:49:08,833
I think we're doing that.

2101
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:10,043
Can we kiss?

2102
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:03,596
