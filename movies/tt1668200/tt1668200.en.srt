00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:29,999
Vichy was the first marshal
Ptain offered peace in 1942.

3
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:35,551
"France's agrees, let us not fail,"
said the head of state. And so it was.

4
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:42,708
Her name was Sarah.

5
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,497
Stop, Sarah Stop.

6
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,622
I'm gonna get you.

7
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,126
Daddy?

8
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:20,250
Where are you going?
- Stay here.

9
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,455
Open up, it's the police.

10
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:30,255
My husband is not home.
- Police. Open up.

11
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,247
Open up, ma'am.

12
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,582
We will kick the door in.

13
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,835
<i>July 16, 1942</i>

14
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,245
Mrs. Starzinski?
- I do not know where my husband is.

15
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:52,376
Come with us.
Take enough things for three days.

16
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,376
Where are we going?
- Bring blankets, food...

17
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:58,331
and your paperwork.

18
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:02,122
Can my doll come along?
- Only the most necessary.

19
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,500
Wait...

20
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:08,746
Michel... is that your son?
- Yes.

21
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,628
But the children too?

22
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:14,165
Where is he?

23
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,622
He's not home.

24
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:24,833
Take me with you, and not the children.
Please.

25
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,086
I beg you!

26
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:37,170
What is it?

27
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:46,168
You must hide.
- I do not want to.

28
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,293
Like yesterday, as a game.
- Okay.

29
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,367
Go ahead.

30
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,161
Where are your son and your husband?
Cooperate.

31
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,037
I really do not know.

32
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,209
You stay right here.

33
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,454
You promise?
I will come back later.

34
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,836
I swear that I do not know.

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,999
I do not know.
- They are out of town.

36
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,959
My brother was sick.

37
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,950
Fresh air is good, "Papa said.

38
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,246
Give me the keys to your house.

39
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,083
Do you know where the man and the boy are?
- The man I have not seen for a while.

40
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:08,999
And the boy...

41
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,750
I saw him recently.
Maybe he's in the basement.

42
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,743
Look in there.

43
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,833
The baby can not sleep from the heat.

44
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,873
The basement is the coolest
place to sleep.

45
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,364
May I go now?
- We'll be back.

46
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:41,491
But when you see them...

47
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,787
Daddy.

48
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,291
Do not cry, girl. Do not cry.

49
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,579
Sarah, are you there?

50
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,873
<i>Paris 2009</i>

51
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,954
It smells mame.

52
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:31,293
The first time she stood there.

53
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,046
I wanted to prove...

54
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,247
that "early American"...

55
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,710
deserved his little-loved son.

56
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,708
Mom, she is still alive.

57
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:46,786
Brand new. We can so.

58
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:52,694
If you want an open kitchen,
we get away this wall.

59
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:57,489
Is it not a bearing wall?
- Then we place a lintel. Ready.

60
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:59,744
You are the architect.

61
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:05,616
So, should you be interested:
This is your room.

62
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:11,782
Oh yeah? How many square feet?
- Not much. But this wall is going away.

63
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,490
Then you have two windows.
Is that right, princess?

64
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,868
Have you heard the story
of this apartment?

65
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:27,704
Previously hired my grandparents,
only this part.

66
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:33,662
In the 50s they could buy it and
later merge with these houses.

67
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,074
The Marais was a popular
neighborhood.

68
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,491
Here my father slept at your age.

69
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,704
So your grandfather.

70
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,285
Hewas also a child.

71
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:49,489
Some people keep their lives private.

72
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,588
That is our rich competitors.

73
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,959
And it is us.

74
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,251
Nothing to be convulsed with laughter.

75
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:09,753
- Times are tough.
- That's why...

76
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:13,418
we will imagine an ideal society...

77
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,086
a utopia for the 21st century.

78
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,291
An article on cosmetic surgery?

79
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,464
The naked woman can boost sales.

80
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,589
Let us focus on...

81
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:26,461
what the future holds good.

82
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:30,333
Biotechnology, space race.

83
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,509
- Positive thinking.
- From an old pessimist.

84
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,084
As you see.

85
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,374
People need to breathe.

86
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:39,790
I'm not that old.

87
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,920
Then the Middle East for Obama.

88
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,420
I leave that to the London office.

89
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,917
What else? Ah yes...

90
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:52,881
The daughter of deported...

91
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,131
...against the state and the SNCF.

92
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,800
She won?

93
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,466
Yes. Chirac's speech at the Vel d'Hiv...

94
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,379
- Has borne fruit.
- On what?

95
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,503
Het Vel d'Hiv.

96
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,587
How do you spell that?

97
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,583
<i>- You're kidding.
- What happened?</i>

98
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,042
In July 1942...

99
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,335
16 and July 17, 1942...

100
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,459
13,000 Jews were arrested.

101
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,419
Especially women and children.

102
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,792
8000 have been parked in the Velodrome.

103
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,338
A horror.

104
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,792
The Superdome in New Orleans...

105
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,760
- A thousand times worse.
- At least.

106
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,958
Afterwards, they were sent
in the camps.

107
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,010
You're well informed.

108
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,376
Time Magazine...

109
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:42,296
I was entitled to half a sheet.

110
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,965
So now I want 10 pages.

111
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:48,794
Ten? I can not, Julia.

112
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,298
Our readers love the story.

113
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:53,716
Most are unaware of this history.

114
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,918
Young apologize.

115
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:03,426
So an old indoor velodrome?

116
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,343
Very beautiful. Where is it?

117
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,124
- Shaved 50 years ago.
- Photos?

118
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,838
Not precisely.

119
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:12,211
10,000 people crammed...

120
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:14,633
no bed, no toilets and little water.

121
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,132
- And not an image.
- There is one.

122
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:20,842
Buses in front of the entrance. That's it.

123
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,428
It's weird.

124
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,760
The Nazis filmed everything.

125
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:27,215
It is well known.

126
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,174
Mike...

127
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,751
There were the French.

128
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,773
I do not understand.
Why is he still inside?

129
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:46,565
He is safe.
- In the closet?

130
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,486
It happened so fast.

131
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:15,149
We must go get back, he is still there.
- You do not understand.

132
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,021
It's your own fault, big nose.

133
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,111
Shut up, crazy woman.
Soon we return.

134
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:36,563
No, old fart, we are French.

135
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,769
Come on.

136
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:06,482
I repeat: It is forbidden
to run on the track.

137
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:10,731
Children, do not play on the track

138
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,817
Dad, I need the toilet.

139
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,445
Do you know where
the toilets are?

140
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:35,270
The toilets?
- They are already clogged.

141
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,935
And can we get water?

142
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,353
It's suffocating in here.

143
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,445
Sir?

144
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:01,984
My mother, brother and I
wanted to go to free South.

145
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,938
Just when the suitcases were
packed, the police came.

146
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:10,693
I guess my mother
and brother escaped.

147
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,478
I have to save myself.

148
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:23,934
Had you had not heard the rumors?
- Yes.

149
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:27,400
We heard rumors all
week, every day.

150
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:30,481
But they take only men.

151
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,899
The kids do
not go to camps?

152
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,268
This is crazy... I must get out?

153
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:55,811
Mom, we need to go get Michael.
- He should have come.

154
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,726
Let me through.
Calm down, ma'am.

155
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:10,066
Think only of your family,
and yourself.

156
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:20,393
There are men who help some escape.
- I have not given it any thought.

157
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,190
One officer said this morning that
I had to take the bus left.

158
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,273
The other goes to Drancy camp.
- It never works.

159
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,098
To try to escape.
How?

160
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,692
Please let my brother out.

161
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,229
Stop.

162
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:42,809
We never should have come here.

163
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,394
Give it here.

164
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,899
My name is Anna.

165
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,898
Sister.

166
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,482
What is it, ma'am?

167
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:21,313
I'm coughing up blood.

168
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:25,015
Is it serious?
There are very few doctors.

169
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,931
Come on. I will take care of you.

170
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,604
Wait.

171
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:56,973
I need to talk to her.
My son is locked up at home.

172
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,144
Calm down and go back.

173
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,560
Please go pick up my son.

174
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:06,015
36 rue de Saintonge, three high.

175
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:23,055
See? Why have you not
given the key to her?

176
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:27,266
Why do you have him locked up?
You know what you did?

177
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,931
You realize that?

178
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:33,388
You realize that?

179
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,811
A street like others.

180
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:03,854
No trace of the past.

181
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,894
There is a plaque, bld. Grenelle...

182
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:09,311
and a statue quai de Grenelle.

183
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,733
But the entrance to the Vel d'Hiv was good here?

184
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,884
Ministry of Interior

185
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:25,768
I never want to talk about.
- I understand.

186
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,970
The entrance to the cycling
stadium right opposite.

187
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,469
You heard everything.

188
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:41,138
After two days we had the windows
shut day and night.

189
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:43,641
Due to the noise?

190
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:48,346
The stench. You get the idea.

191
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:58,682
Neighbors tried to figure out what was happening?
To understand?

192
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,435
Understand?

193
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,424
Later it was easier.

194
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,389
There were so many stories
about Jews around.

195
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,257
What could we do?

196
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,142
Call the police?

197
00:19:58,392 --> 00:20:01,176
Rivka Starzinski.

198
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,635
Vladislav Starzinski.

199
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,766
Sarah Starzinski.

200
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,386
Wake up. Come on.

201
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,724
We go.

202
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:20,723
Are we going home?

203
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,963
Mom, I do not feel good.

204
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:41,298
Got a headache?

205
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:47,055
My god, where are we going?

206
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,963
To Pitchipoi, they say.
- No, to Beaune-la-Rolande.

207
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,223
From camp Pithiviers you
seem to be released.

208
00:20:55,433 --> 00:21:01,299
Believe what you want, but I think
we go to Germany or Poland.

209
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:07,513
Wherever we go, it's like
where we come from.

210
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,005
You see this ring?

211
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,889
There's poison in it.

212
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:17,632
No one determines when to die.

213
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:22,211
Nobody.

214
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,845
Good Day, Mrs. Tzac.

215
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:52,132
Not "Mrs. Tzac. She calls
herself rather Jarmond.

216
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:55,044
That's her maiden name.

217
00:21:55,722 --> 00:22:02,050
Ms. Jarmond. She loves her American
name. An American habit.

218
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:06,838
Ms. Jarmond s American.
- You are in a good mood.

219
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:10,054
Anyway, I am Mrs Tzac.

220
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:13,512
Good day, ladies.
- I will get this for you

221
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:16,507
How thoughtful of you.

222
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:23,175
How's that loser of a husband of yours?
I never see him.

223
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:26,220
He's busy.
But he thinks a lot to you

224
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,340
Yes, yes...
How are you? You look tired.

225
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:36,172
Do you? No, I'm fine.
I just had a tough interview.

226
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,670
And the apartment?
- We were there the day before yesterday.

227
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:43,961
You do not demolish the lot?
Be aware...

228
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,513
that we have lived there for over sixty years.
A whole human life.

229
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,386
Sixty years?

230
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:58,712
Yes, sixty years.
But at the outset,

231
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,178
In the war you thought: Something
is better than nothing.

232
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:07,381
You lived there since the war?
- Yes, in August '42.

233
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,588
What a misery. We were first
with his Driene in my room...

234
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:15,470
above the shop in the
rue de Turenne.

235
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,758
Edouard was nine.

236
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:26,045
When our friend said that a nearby
two-room house was vacant...

237
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:32,465
Why was that released?
- Baby... I know not.

238
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,213
Will you give me a
glass of water?

239
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:45,510
What is it? You look so pale.

240
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:48,836
I stood up too fast. I'm dizzy.

241
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,588
Say, you're not pregnant?

242
00:23:53,594 --> 00:23:58,298
You know how hard I tried to get pregnant.
So in this age...

243
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:01,841
I feel such a thing.
You're pregnant.

244
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:51,089
Hi, it's me.
- Are you home?

245
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,081
No, in the house in the Marais.
- Will you work?

246
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,584
How can that be?
- There is none.

247
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,248
Did you know that your grandparents
lived here since the war?

248
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,003
Yes. Why?

249
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,997
Just like that. Tell me later.

250
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,880
Dear Bertrand, do you want me
tonight as a dinner treat?

251
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,457
Most willingly.
Would arrange it in nine hours?

252
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,132
Fine.

253
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:47,916
Transit camp of Beau
e-la-Rolande July 1942

254
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:58,373
Men left, women and
children right.

255
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,797
Please, sir...
- Keep moving.

256
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:13,540
Is there a doctor? My daughter is sick.
- No, continue.

257
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:01,587
My daughter has a fever.
Who can help?

258
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:05,956
Please? Is there a doctor?

259
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:17,623
Mom?

260
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:21,663
How long are we here?
- I do not know, Sarah.

261
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,413
And Dad? When will we see him again?

262
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:31,825
Soon, dear.

263
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:35,879
Soon.

264
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,618
Sorry it is not easy with the Chinese contract.
- Are they signed?

265
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:00,164
Not yet.

266
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:05,330
I get no kiss?
- Of course.

267
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:15,161
Do you want a drink?
- No, I'm fine.

268
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:21,332
What is going on here?
- This is our table.

269
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:27,743
My god.
- What?

270
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:32,916
Nothing. I thought for a
moment I forgot our anniversary.

271
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,876
Why are you so tense?
Relax.

272
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,539
Too much stress.
You have to scare me, Julia.

273
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:46,621
You want to take off?
- I expect news from the Chinese.

274
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,703
Bertrand...

275
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:55,495
I have great news.

276
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:06,999
I was expecting a little
more enthusiasm.

277
00:29:10,335 --> 00:29:15,075
I do not want to be an old father.
- Since when do you consider yourself old?

278
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:18,161
Yes, I am getting old.
Faster than you.

279
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,039
It is risky for the child.

280
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:33,955
Ok... Our life has changed,
So I will listen adolescence.

281
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:38,540
The new house, I've worked hard.
Time to slow down.

282
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,696
If that's your answer, I take a taxi.

283
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:51,530
Should I, after all IVF treatments
and two miscarriages...

284
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,907
Abort this child?

285
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,781
I've had six years of peace.

286
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,449
The doctors had a
miracle happen.

287
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,621
Is it no wonder then?

288
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,995
Hurry.

289
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,661
We have to go get Michael.

290
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,657
I promised.

291
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,407
Small children right, large
left with their mother.

292
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:55,369
Back to your mother.

293
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:21,661
Listen.

294
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,743
Women and children
over twelve...

295
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:28,820
leave the camp first.

296
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:33,821
Younger children join their
families in one week.

297
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:39,111
The men have left.
They will see you again soon.

298
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,987
Cooperate and you'll be fine.

299
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,073
Back the hell up.

300
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,616
I love you with all my heart.

301
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:42,569
May God protect you.

302
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,772
Some of the 11,000 children deported
from the Vel d'Hiv.

303
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:45,397
With my work I read the figures
and statistics...

304
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,610
a face to all those individuals,
their tangible existence.

305
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:56,362
Gruesome. In every picture
I think of my own daughter.

306
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:02,944
Unfortunately, those who studied
here, do not remain unscathed.

307
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:04,532
Is that true for you?

308
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:11,321
This work is undoubtedly
necessary and cathartic.

309
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:16,278
Sorry, forgot to turn it off.

310
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:20,188
My father.
- Take, if it is important.

311
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:22,197
Later I'll call back.

312
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:26,025
Okay, ma'am?

313
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,608
When many Jews lived
in the Marais?

314
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:38,730
Yes, it was a Jewish neighborhood,
like Belleville. - Why?

315
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:42,604
No, just...

316
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:46,981
My husband and I are moving into
an apartment soon...

317
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:51,068
that his family owns in
the rue de Saintonge.

318
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:57,150
I just found out they were
moved in August 1942.

319
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:03,856
They are decent people.
It must be coincidence.

320
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:08,529
Would you like me to figure it out?
Everything is on the computer.

321
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,856
During the war the
people needed to survive.

322
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,986
To my mind...

323
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:29,898
What number in the rue de Saintonge?
- 36.

324
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,942
Three families were
living there.

325
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,356
Which floor?

326
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:38,731
That song my mother sang to me when
I was sick and could not sleep.

327
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:42,192
You have slept for three
days and talked.

328
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:46,776
You mentioned a key and Michel.
I did not get it.

329
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:51,644
Looking for this?

330
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:57,392
I must find my brother. Come on.

331
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:00,644
Want to escape?
- I saw a woman who did it.

332
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:03,854
When it is light is easier.

333
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,023
Careful, you are still sick.

334
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,317
Escape never works.

335
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:20,603
There are no more grownups.

336
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,726
What happened?
- Do not you remember?

337
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:27,972
Yes.

338
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,980
Here, take this.

339
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:48,396
What the hell?

340
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:17,976
Where the women gave us food,
There is a hole in the barbed wire.

341
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:22,062
Would you like to escape?
- No, at night it is too quiet.

342
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,232
They spotlight.
During the day it is easier...

343
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:32,981
that noise and crying children.
If it is just as warm tomorrow...

344
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:35,063
The gendarmes will
seek the shade.

345
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:38,805
We need to sweaters to find out.

346
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:43,063
That we attract each other.
- It's been so hot.

347
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:46,095
Then we do not hurt the wire.

348
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:51,564
I think your brother has done
the same thing as us.

349
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:56,471
He has certainly escaped.
- I'm sure not.

350
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:01,517
Why?
- Because he had to promise me.

351
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:28,766
Come quickly.

352
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,475
Where you going?
- Get away, you.

353
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:02,469
Let me go.
My brother is alone in Paris.

354
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:09,886
I got it locked up when
we were arrested.

355
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:13,020
He's waiting for me.
- It is too late.

356
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:16,596
It is no different.
You must stay here.

357
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:20,222
Escape is forbidden.
- Jacques...

358
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:26,265
How do you know my name?
- I picked it up.

359
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:28,429
And that apple, I will
never forget.

360
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:34,014
My name is Sarah,
Sarah Starzinski.

361
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:46,893
Quickly then.

362
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,764
Get out.

363
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:59,554
Okay?

364
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,218
What it smells nice.

365
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:07,676
We must get rid of these stars.

366
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:28,220
Look at that. Come on.

367
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:28,134
Look, a village.
- I do not feel good.

368
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:30,091
Come quick.

369
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,682
Come on.
- I feel really sick.

370
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:52,591
Maybe we can ride.
What are you doing?

371
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,012
I'm not going to make it.

372
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,596
There is light.

373
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,425
Jules. Look.

374
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:31,504
Nothing but water. She is sick.

375
00:45:32,306 --> 00:45:34,759
Get away.
We do not want problems.

376
00:45:44,597 --> 00:45:47,216
Get out, I said.

377
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:52,462
Some watchdog?

378
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,157
It is not dangerous to your age?

379
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:57,075
I will do an amniocentesis.

380
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,832
You can have a miscarriage.

381
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:01,116
Or be mowed down by a bus.

382
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,790
Why are you doing this?

383
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,076
You have suffered enough.

384
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,540
Because I feel it.

385
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,619
And if Bertrand supports me, that's okay.

386
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,622
Yes, if you support...

387
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:16,786
It does not tell him anything, dirty diapers...

388
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:19,121
and sleepless nights.

389
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,240
You're too old.

390
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:25,322
Thank you. It helps a lot.

391
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,541
Then this story apartment?

392
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,907
They have stolen?

393
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,703
No, like the Marais...

394
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,707
the Lower East Side.

395
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:41,998
Jewish immigrants were renting.

396
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,533
Bertrand thinks what?

397
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,406
I have not had the courage to tell him.

398
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:50,786
You are New Yorker and a fighter.

399
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:52,873
25 years in France 
will not change anything.

400
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,083
Do what you gotta do.

401
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:56,667
Easy to say.

402
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:59,496
Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski.

403
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,494
Executed at Auschwitz in 1942.

404
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,499
Not Sarah or Michael...

405
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,542
on any list of prisoners...

406
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,908
Poland or Drancy.

407
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:12,209
They had to flee.

408
00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:14,911
You're a stubborn.

409
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:16,703
You would not do?

410
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:19,075
They can be anywhere.

411
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,704
They may be alive.

412
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,953
You want them to make room?

413
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:25,579
Why not?

414
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:32,033
Do not wake the sleeping cat.

415
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:38,328
My stepfather.

416
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:45,615
I'm sure they knew it.

417
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:47,709
They told you that?

418
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:51,998
I do not know how to ask them.

419
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,580
It's very simple:

420
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:57,411
Call them and ask them.

421
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:14,750
You are quiet this morning.

422
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,507
As we sat inside.
- She's sick.

423
00:48:30,717 --> 00:48:34,130
Should the doctor come?
- Doctor Thvenin is on holiday.

424
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:39,248
His replacement is close with the Germans.
We wait a moment.

425
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:43,082
But I have to go to Paris.
- How so?

426
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:53,959
He'll probably have
escaped, baby.

427
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,919
No, he would wait.
I have to go there.

428
00:48:58,592 --> 00:49:01,376
Those I will burn.
That's smarter.

429
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:05,505
You get clothes from Nicolas.
- Who is that?

430
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:08,963
My grandson. He is of your age.

431
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:13,461
With your hair under a
cap you're just a boy.

432
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:16,541
And Paris?

433
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:25,668
What would you think of warm
milk and some sandwiches?

434
00:49:35,883 --> 00:49:38,039
What's your name, baby?

435
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:43,542
Michle.

436
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,089
He's waiting for me.

437
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:12,248
Go ahead, Michl. Just relax.

438
00:50:27,256 --> 00:50:30,503
She is really sick.
- Then they go to the doctor.

439
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,962
Now she sleeps. We wait.

440
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:40,331
Help.

441
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:47,418
Give me the sheet.

442
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:49,831
The doctor should be here.

443
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,371
She's dieing.

444
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,337
Lieutenant, the child is sick.

445
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:07,375
Better if she dies.

446
00:51:10,046 --> 00:51:15,166
But she is Jewish, huh?
- Little did I know. I could not...

447
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,169
Leave her beside the road.

448
00:51:20,046 --> 00:51:24,953
Two children escaped.
Have you seen the other one?

449
00:51:25,171 --> 00:51:27,375
No, only this girl.

450
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:46,918
You know that you are playing with
fire if you hide that child.

451
00:51:47,129 --> 00:51:50,743
Then we do not let
the doctor come?

452
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:55,251
Look around if you think we lie.

453
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:03,825
Do you think we are that stupid?
Go ahead, have a look.

454
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:06,368
Waste of time.

455
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:30,037
She's dead. Diphtheria.

456
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:35,284
I could not do anything.
I put her in the car.

457
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:45,243
Come tomorrow and make a statement at the
Kommandantur, sir Dufaure.

458
00:52:45,585 --> 00:52:47,575
It will go now.

459
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,364
Heil Hitler.

460
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:08,160
Get the other girl.
One dead child is enough.

461
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,284
My real name is Sarah.

462
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,247
Sarah Starzinski.

463
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:40,290
Edouard, the wrong day?
- Bye, honey.

464
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:45,491
That's what I said yesterday
al Normally he should be.

465
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:49,200
I'm not the only one
who gets confused.

466
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:54,616
You never reacts, Julia.
I have three times left a message.

467
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:59,040
Sorry, it was very busy.
But I just wanted to call back.

468
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,162
Why do I run away?

469
00:54:14,124 --> 00:54:18,616
I know your mom and questions
about Bertrand 's apartment.

470
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:26,821
Let's go outside.
- What do you carry in your pocket?

471
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,991
Please?

472
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,114
We getsome fresh air.

473
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,495
We will be back.

474
00:54:42,332 --> 00:54:45,448
In my car we can talk quietly.

475
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,288
Here.

476
00:55:48,163 --> 00:55:51,529
You do not worry, boy.

477
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:54,780
You will also soon
be a proud soldier?

478
00:55:55,996 --> 00:56:00,037
Allow me, madam.
- It's a nice kid.

479
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:02,908
You do not have much luggage.

480
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:07,535
You are clearly not in
the black market.

481
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,703
Identity Papers.

482
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:14,287
Excuse me.

483
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,698
And the boy?
- The bottom of the envelope.

484
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,488
Problems?

485
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,946
No, it's okay.

486
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:05,034
Bertrand I have spoken. He said
you write an article about...

487
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:08,616
About the raid.

488
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,743
Where is your interest
in the apartment?

489
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:20,275
I thought she was bedridden.

490
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:26,196
You think someone is
good to know...

491
00:57:26,786 --> 00:57:28,611
Not so suspicious, say.

492
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:33,984
And please do not interfere with
things that do not pertain to you

493
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:43,070
Does the name Starzinski
mean anything to you?

494
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:53,650
The family had nothing to
do with their arrest.

495
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:57,110
Are you sure?

496
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:03,568
Yes, but only my father
and I were informed.

497
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:05,899
What do you mean?

498
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:11,273
They must not know. Clear?

499
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:13,150
She was not home that day.

500
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:15,401
What day?

501
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,107
The day the girl came back.

502
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:35,609
I opened the door.

503
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,064
Stop, you do not know
who you will find.

504
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:42,941
I see you above.

505
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:56,196
All the houses are already full.
Look across the street.

506
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:59,359
We need to see three high.

507
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:01,896
To Tzac?

508
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:03,278
Michel?

509
00:59:08,824 --> 00:59:10,400
Who's there?

510
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,906
Wait, Sarah.

511
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,314
Where is my brother Michael?

512
00:59:21,198 --> 00:59:22,691
Your brother?

513
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:28,072
Daddy?

514
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,861
What is that noise?

515
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:58,071
I'm so sorry.

516
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:11,399
My father would take
care of everything.

517
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:16,070
But I believe that the couple
took the body.

518
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,485
I do not remember.

519
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:23,150
And Mom?
- She was in the shop.

520
01:00:23,656 --> 01:00:25,528
She could not know.

521
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:28,737
That you had not noticed...

522
01:00:29,905 --> 01:00:33,981
When we moved into the house,
it smelled awful.

523
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:36,945
In the kitchen was a dead cat.

524
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:41,195
There were only a few pieces of
furniture, there had been looting.

525
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,479
It was wartime.

526
01:00:44,071 --> 01:00:46,773
We had cleaned everything.

527
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:50,444
But the smell lingered.

528
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:55,857
My father thought that a dead
bird was lying in the gutter.

529
01:00:56,071 --> 01:00:58,109
We did close the window, but...

530
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,234
It only got worse.

531
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:09,812
We could not find key of the closet
and did not force the door.

532
01:01:11,904 --> 01:01:14,060
And when the girl arrived...

533
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:18,193
on the afternoon of
the second day.

534
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:23,687
How is Sarah, did she also perish?

535
01:01:24,987 --> 01:01:30,356
Until his death, my father
never mentioned her name.

536
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:33,267
She was part of the secret.

537
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:38,184
When I asked him how
she was...

538
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,732
He said to keep my mouth shut.

539
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:46,979
Do you know?

540
01:01:50,028 --> 01:01:51,983
Do you know where she is?

541
01:01:57,153 --> 01:02:02,651
I do not know. But I do know
that they were not deported.

542
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:09,815
When my father passed away...

543
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:17,599
I heard from the notary about
some personal documents.

544
01:02:21,568 --> 01:02:25,183
They are located at the bank.
I never dared to look.

545
01:02:32,693 --> 01:02:35,525
I would like to see them?

546
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:31,564
Is anyone?

547
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:36,312
What do you think?

548
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:39,097
Nice.
- Yeah, huh?

549
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:47,266
Only I do not know whether
I can live here soon.

550
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,475
There is nothing I can imagine.

551
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:53,226
It's perfect for three of us.

552
01:03:53,524 --> 01:03:56,013
Three of us?
- Yes.

553
01:03:57,149 --> 01:03:58,856
Come...

554
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:11,973
Not too much.

555
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:23,267
Why did you not tell me the truth?
- How so?

556
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:27,432
So.

557
01:04:51,814 --> 01:04:53,141
Sorry.

558
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,809
Do not you feel that it is wrong?

559
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:07,304
What is it?
- You're so bland.

560
01:05:07,522 --> 01:05:10,520
But you want me to
have an abortion.

561
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:15,020
You have not one once asked what the doctor said.
It leaves you cold.

562
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:18,061
What you've already created:

563
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:21,061
You go to China.

564
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:24,847
We talked about it.

565
01:05:25,063 --> 01:05:28,096
It is better. We get a new life.

566
01:05:28,313 --> 01:05:32,010
Yes, about one week sign you
a mega contract.

567
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,599
The next 150 years
no money worries.

568
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:38,889
A great daughter, 'n beautiful
apartment of arrested Jews.

569
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:43,428
Never mind.
- What did you say?

570
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:48,469
Nothing. I have a long day
behind me. I'm going home.

571
01:05:48,688 --> 01:05:52,551
Julia, what did you just say?
- I had to keep my mouth shut.

572
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,223
Ask your father.

573
01:06:55,853 --> 01:07:00,889
What did you think?
- I heard it today, just like you.

574
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:08,049
Why did you manage it like you did?

575
01:07:10,018 --> 01:07:11,843
To protect you.

576
01:07:13,518 --> 01:07:14,975
I think...

577
01:07:17,018 --> 01:07:20,348
Did you tell your sisters?
- How can I keep it to myself?

578
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,100
For Mom.

579
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:25,429
Who has lived there
all her life.

580
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,017
Your wife.

581
01:07:43,475 --> 01:07:47,304
Do you know where Bertrand?
- He's here.

582
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:49,673
I regret enormously.

583
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:54,674
So he will not talk to me.
- He's old enough.

584
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:00,722
Why are you calling him?

585
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:06,139
It's late.
- It was your father.

586
01:08:08,142 --> 01:08:11,887
How could he do it.

587
01:08:17,099 --> 01:08:21,045
Thank you.
- My pleasure. Good night.

588
01:08:32,058 --> 01:08:36,762
Sir. I would like to
thank on behalf of Sarah.

589
01:08:36,974 --> 01:08:42,805
We still have the 100 francs
you send each month for her

590
01:08:43,308 --> 01:08:48,297
even if you did not think she knew.
Hopefully you will understand.

591
01:08:50,557 --> 01:08:53,424
Last week we harvested
the wheat.

592
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:57,592
However serious, Sarah
did her share.

593
01:08:57,807 --> 01:08:59,881
She never complains.

594
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:06,467
I saw the last two times
you sent 120 francs.

595
01:09:06,932 --> 01:09:10,629
Now that the war is over, we can
buy her beautiful clothes.

596
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:16,920
I enclose a photograph of her with
my grandsons Nicolas and Edgar.

597
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:20,133
Beautiful girl, right?

598
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:43,632
Sarah.

599
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,714
Be careful that you
do not catch cold.

600
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:50,053
Do not worry.

601
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:57,885
What are you doing?

602
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,675
Sir. Sarah is doing well.

603
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:13,836
We went to the beaches
in Normandy

604
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:17,088
For the first time she
has seen the sea.

605
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,133
She's grown up.

606
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:25,842
Her character is changing.

607
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:29,513
She is quiet but reckless.

608
01:10:31,638 --> 01:10:34,387
Other shores attract her.

609
01:10:40,845 --> 01:10:45,917
These dark days are a
stain on our history.

610
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:49,459
74 trains...

611
01:10:50,054 --> 01:10:52,459
going to Auschwitz.

612
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:56,844
76,000 French Jews deported...

613
01:10:57,345 --> 01:10:59,253
never returned.

614
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,548
The insane, criminal policies
of the occupying forces...

615
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,795
was, as we all know...

616
01:11:09,054 --> 01:11:14,884
actively supported by residents
of France, the French state.

617
01:11:16,508 --> 01:11:19,043
We will put the video online.

618
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:23,255
Nice speech,
that person will return.

619
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:26,879
His words made noise at the time.

620
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:29,461
Your article is amazing, Julia.

621
01:11:29,675 --> 01:11:33,835
Say that it happened right in Paris.

622
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:36,880
It is to vomit.

623
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,256
What would you have done?

624
01:11:40,841 --> 01:11:42,499
How?

625
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,091
How do you know...

626
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,125
what you have done?

627
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:50,748
I watched it on TV...

628
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:53,634
as civilian casualties in Iraq.

629
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,418
Please, Mike.

630
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:02,123
Oh, thank you for calling back.

631
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:06,917
I am looking for Edgar
Nicolas or Dufaure.

632
01:12:07,301 --> 01:12:08,794
Or family.

633
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:13,051
- What it makes?
- No idea.

634
01:12:13,086 --> 01:12:14,674
Or distant relatives?

635
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,379
Thanks for calling back, ma'am.

636
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,212
Mom? Who's that?

637
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:30,335
I try to find it.
I'll tell you.

638
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:33,917
You'd think if it was serious?

639
01:12:35,635 --> 01:12:38,337
Of course, my angel.

640
01:12:39,261 --> 01:12:41,168
Do not worry.

641
01:12:47,342 --> 01:12:52,213
Good morning, Mme Tzac. You should
take this pill. Are you sober?

642
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:54,879
Fine. I'll be back.

643
01:12:55,384 --> 01:13:00,420
Oh, you did not fill
in "Contact.

644
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:06,750
Is that mandatory?
- Yes, we need a name.

645
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,798
Sorry.

646
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,917
Sorry.

647
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:38,039
Julia is with me.

648
01:13:38,673 --> 01:13:42,121
I wish I could be with you.
Thinking of you.

649
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:44,959
I hope it went well.

650
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:49,961
I am very aware that
we are currently...

651
01:13:50,298 --> 01:13:54,209
going through a difficult phase.
But it will be over.

652
01:13:54,423 --> 01:13:57,919
I love you. Kiss's.

653
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:01,626
I found your message last night.

654
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:08,003
I'm Nathalie Dufaure.
My father was Nicolas Dufaure.

655
01:14:08,548 --> 01:14:15,079
I do not know what you're looking for.
But you can reach me at this number.

656
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:16,838
Happy days.

657
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:23,161
An abortion?
- Yes, but they did not seem sure.

658
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:31,712
I have two hours with you.
- What is this, Mrs. Tzac?

659
01:14:32,547 --> 01:14:37,251
Yes, for the church.
If I can not find it, I call u.

660
01:14:37,464 --> 01:14:39,585
Thanks. See you later.

661
01:14:39,797 --> 01:14:42,203
You may have to lie
down to think.

662
01:14:42,422 --> 01:14:49,414
I have thought enough.
This is a waste of your time.

663
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:53,535
I regret enormously. Goodbye.

664
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,911
You see, this could not miss.

665
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:17,333
Nathalie.

666
01:15:19,338 --> 01:15:21,329
Can I leave the car here?

667
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,294
Shall we?

668
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:35,035
When my grandfather heard that you wanted
to talk about Sarah, he began to shine.

669
01:15:35,754 --> 01:15:41,169
He thought you had news about
her, or maybe her daughter.

670
01:15:41,712 --> 01:15:45,575
He has not heard from her
in over fifty years

671
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:09,790
forgive me i love you

672
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:44,663
It was in May 1953.

673
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:49,746
She left without giving
an address.

674
01:16:54,085 --> 01:16:56,999
My grandfather had it
the worst with it.

675
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:04,912
But he did not blame her. That's
what he told me on his deathbed.

676
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:10,333
He knew it would happen.

677
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,241
She has never given a life farming?
Any idea where they can be?

678
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:26,074
This is the only life
farming, in 1955.

679
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:33,323
Just to let you know that it went well
with her, without further explanation.

680
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:35,200
Can I?
- Of course.

681
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,124
Sarah and Richard Rain Ferd...

682
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,998
Brooklyn.

683
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:53,994
She went to America.

684
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:25,850
You're there. I tried
to join you.

685
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:29,563
I cut my phone.

686
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,928
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.

687
01:18:32,147 --> 01:18:34,849
Bertrand phoned.
He is worried.

688
01:18:35,064 --> 01:18:36,343
What is it?

689
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:40,931
You did?

690
01:18:44,272 --> 01:18:46,228
You have to talk to him.

691
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,478
We miss them too.

692
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:59,351
- I should come more often.
- Yes.

693
01:19:05,732 --> 01:19:08,101
So you found?

694
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:11,854
An idiot would have found on the Internet.

695
01:19:12,065 --> 01:19:14,305
There are five Rainsferd in Brooklyn.

696
01:19:14,523 --> 01:19:16,728
To you find the right one.

697
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:22,186
What are you gonna find?

698
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:23,939
I do not know.

699
01:19:25,357 --> 01:19:26,600
Someone.

700
01:19:42,566 --> 01:19:45,137
I am looking for Sarah or Richard Rainsferd.

701
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:47,016
Not know.

702
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:49,608
Thank you.

703
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:12,311
I am looking for Richard
and Sarah Rainsferd.

704
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:14,682
No Richard or Sarah here.

705
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,436
And in your family?

706
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,771
No, I'm sorry.

707
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:02,776
Sorry, you are
Richard Rainsferd?

708
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:04,889
Bob Rainsferd.

709
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,938
Do you know Sarah or Richard?

710
01:21:10,236 --> 01:21:11,433
No, sorry.

711
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:14,140
Thank you.

712
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:34,473
Now, we'll...

713
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:53,683
You want?

714
01:21:53,904 --> 01:21:56,736
I am looking for Ms. Rainsferd, but...

715
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,268
My mother is out.
You're a friend?

716
01:21:59,779 --> 01:22:03,310
No, I know people
his family.

717
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:08,144
- In Europe?
- Yes, Europe.

718
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,020
You live in Manhattan?

719
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:12,857
In Paris. But I grew up here.

720
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:16,768
Paris is the most beautiful
city in the world.

721
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:19,441
- Your mother said that?
- She speaks of Rome.

722
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:23,195
Excuse me.

723
01:22:28,905 --> 01:22:31,025
We'll be there all day.

724
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:37,646
The nurse from my father.

725
01:22:37,947 --> 01:22:39,903
It will not be long.

726
01:22:40,114 --> 01:22:42,021
Is he ill? Sorry.

727
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:44,608
Mom is very strong.

728
01:22:44,822 --> 01:22:47,524
She cheers up everyone.

729
01:22:49,781 --> 01:22:53,193
It's her. I'll help.

730
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:34,025
That was in 1966.

731
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:52,363
Surely a tire that exploded.

732
01:24:52,576 --> 01:24:56,784
The truck driver said
she swerved...

733
01:24:56,993 --> 01:24:59,446
and he could not avoid it.

734
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:07,773
I met Richard two years later.

735
01:25:08,785 --> 01:25:12,364
At first he did not remarry.

736
01:25:12,578 --> 01:25:13,905
It was as if...

737
01:25:14,661 --> 01:25:19,283
he wanted to be the husband of Sarah.

738
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:22,445
But years have passed...

739
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:25,196
and he eventually changed his mind.

740
01:25:25,826 --> 01:25:27,284
And that's it.

741
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:29,944
Their son lives in Italy.

742
01:25:31,869 --> 01:25:33,031
A son?

743
01:25:33,537 --> 01:25:35,492
William, my half-brother.

744
01:25:37,703 --> 01:25:39,658
He was nine years...

745
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:42,817
when Sarah had her accident.

746
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:47,366
Then, it was difficult.

747
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:50,453
But I like high
my own son.

748
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:53,446
I taught him to love Italy...

749
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:56,445
to eat pasta.

750
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:59,693
And he met a woman...

751
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,154
the village where I was born.

752
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,911
He never returned.

753
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:09,030
He lives in Florence now.

754
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:13,569
It did him good from here...

755
01:26:13,787 --> 01:26:16,904
and rebuild his life in Europe.

756
01:26:19,329 --> 01:26:22,280
It is the nurse. I go there.

757
01:26:36,956 --> 01:26:39,574
Can I see your husband?

758
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:45,826
I do not know if it
a good idea...

759
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:49,903
to revisit all those things.

760
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,155
He is very ill.

761
01:26:52,664 --> 01:26:54,950
I understand.

762
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:57,119
And his son?

763
01:26:58,831 --> 01:27:03,038
Mom, answer me.
You have a lover?

764
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:06,198
Of course not.

765
01:27:06,414 --> 01:27:07,990
But you'll leave Dad.

766
01:27:10,039 --> 01:27:13,321
I never said that.
He told you that?

767
01:27:13,539 --> 01:27:15,944
No, but why...

768
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,783
you're gone suddenly
Florence?

769
01:27:19,373 --> 01:27:20,914
My darling...

770
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:23,825
It's much more complicated.

771
01:27:25,414 --> 01:27:27,451
I go tomorrow...

772
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:29,288
and we'll talk.

773
01:27:29,498 --> 01:27:32,781
And the baby...
You should have told me.

774
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,039
That concerns me too.

775
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,915
I know, I'm sorry.

776
01:27:41,207 --> 01:27:44,454
- You do not want this baby?
- I say that.

777
01:27:44,832 --> 01:27:47,581
I wish I had
a little brother.

778
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:50,575
Or sister.

779
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,537
But I will not change
its layers.

780
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:58,073
I love you, choupinette.

781
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,766
Are you Julia?

782
01:28:21,732 --> 01:28:23,687
I did not know you spoke French.

783
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:28,186
As a child I spoke French
with my mother.

784
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:32,138
But I think what my French...
rusty?

785
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:39,366
What do you drink?

786
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:41,621
Water, it will be perfect.

787
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:43,908
You want dinner?

788
01:28:44,334 --> 01:28:46,371
Just drink something.

789
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,950
Water and a glass of Brunello.

790
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:55,874
You are a journalist. I investigated.

791
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:00,245
And write on
Tuscan cuisine.

792
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:03,998
My book is responsible for...

793
01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:07,201
those extra pounds that I can not lose.

794
01:29:07,418 --> 01:29:09,160
What can I do for you?

795
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,949
You're too young...

796
01:29:12,168 --> 01:29:14,123
to have known my mother.

797
01:29:19,544 --> 01:29:21,618
I am family Tיzac.

798
01:29:23,793 --> 01:29:26,542
- Who?
- The Tיzac.

799
01:29:26,836 --> 01:29:28,826
Sorry, I do not say anything.

800
01:29:35,419 --> 01:29:37,291
They have taken...

801
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:39,742
Apartment rue de Saintonge...

802
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:41,916
after the family
Your mother...

803
01:29:47,587 --> 01:29:51,746
My stepfather,
Edward Tיzac was there...

804
01:29:52,169 --> 01:29:54,207
when they found your uncle Michael.

805
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:58,701
I have no uncle.

806
01:29:59,711 --> 01:30:01,500
The brother of your mother.

807
01:30:01,712 --> 01:30:03,619
She had no brother.

808
01:30:03,837 --> 01:30:06,076
Rue de Saintonge tells me nothing.

809
01:30:06,294 --> 01:30:10,039
Maybe you
the wrong person.

810
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:12,125
Your mother's name Sarah?

811
01:30:12,337 --> 01:30:14,956
Yes, Sarah Rainsferd.

812
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:17,125
And before that Sarah Dufaure.

813
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:20,251
And Starzynski, it means nothing to you?

814
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:23,495
Starzynski? No.

815
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:28,372
You made this trip for nothing.

816
01:30:28,795 --> 01:30:30,371
Sorry.

817
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,753
There must be another Sarah.

818
01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:39,790
What did you tell the son of...

819
01:30:40,005 --> 01:30:41,746
You recognize?

820
01:30:57,171 --> 01:31:00,169
It is impossible. Not...

821
01:31:07,422 --> 01:31:10,705
There is a little resemblance, but...

822
01:31:14,381 --> 01:31:16,122
This is not my mother.

823
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:18,831
Are you sure?

824
01:31:19,464 --> 01:31:21,869
Yes, I'm sure.

825
01:31:22,464 --> 01:31:24,620
My mother was not...

826
01:31:25,464 --> 01:31:27,336
Jewish.

827
01:31:29,672 --> 01:31:33,583
You want what?
You came to say...

828
01:31:33,798 --> 01:31:35,754
that my mother had another name?

829
01:31:35,965 --> 01:31:39,710
She was a victim
of this tragedy?

830
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,914
Sorry. I'm
Did you know.

831
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:50,878
It's madness.
My mother was French.

832
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,958
Sarah Dufaure.
She had no brother.

833
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:58,749
She never lived in Paris.

834
01:31:58,965 --> 01:32:01,251
- You're wrong.
- Let me...

835
01:32:01,466 --> 01:32:02,923
tell you everything.

836
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:05,503
No, I do not know.

837
01:32:05,715 --> 01:32:07,505
This is important.

838
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:09,709
Let me be clear.

839
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:12,591
I do not want to talk about that.

840
01:32:13,507 --> 01:32:15,793
And I do not want to see you again.

841
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:18,840
Please do not call me.

842
01:32:19,674 --> 01:32:21,546
Enjoy your stay in Florence.

843
01:32:25,849 --> 01:32:29,215
Ridiculous to just disappear.

844
01:32:29,433 --> 01:32:33,379
New York, Italy...
What did you find with this guy?

845
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:40,513
By now you know the whole family.
Even mom, the poor man is 95.

846
01:32:40,724 --> 01:32:43,722
Suddenly so concerned about Mom?
- Stop it.

847
01:32:43,932 --> 01:32:46,681
The family's honor
is saved anyway?

848
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:51,049
You can start at the apartment to live.
But do not count on me.

849
01:32:51,848 --> 01:32:56,671
We're going to sell it.
Everyone is finished.

850
01:32:56,890 --> 01:33:00,635
Family decision.
There goes my childhood.

851
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,595
I wanted to know the truth.
- The truth?

852
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:13,219
Typically for journalists:
The truth.

853
01:33:13,432 --> 01:33:18,219
And what brings us this beautiful truth?
We are happy, happy guy.

854
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:21,678
Everybody happy now
the truth is known.

855
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,674
The truth is often a high price.

856
01:33:30,889 --> 01:33:33,129
Ok. And now?

857
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,262
I do not know.

858
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:51,135
But everything in me wants
to keep this child.

859
01:33:55,971 --> 01:34:00,344
Can you understand that everything
in the child does not want me?

860
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,301
Yes, I understand.

861
01:34:20,096 --> 01:34:23,094
We always wanted to
have a second child.

862
01:34:41,429 --> 01:34:44,261
- Hello, Dad.
- William...

863
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,887
You should not be
with your family?

864
01:34:50,888 --> 01:34:54,585
No, my place is here.

865
01:34:56,762 --> 01:34:59,464
You saw this reporter, right?

866
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,960
One that tells the story silly.

867
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,003
Sit down, William.

868
01:35:11,222 --> 01:35:14,339
- I'll help you.
- Sit down.

869
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:23,512
You mean all this is true?

870
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:26,506
Yes?

871
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:34,878
I remember...

872
01:35:36,472 --> 01:35:39,803
the first time I saw your mother.

873
01:35:41,097 --> 01:35:44,179
It was in a dance hall in Manhattan.

874
01:35:45,347 --> 01:35:47,883
I noticed two things.

875
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:51,259
The first...

876
01:35:52,472 --> 01:35:56,051
It was the most beautiful woman...

877
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:59,295
I had never seen.

878
01:36:28,307 --> 01:36:29,930
The second...

879
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:34,013
Behind his smile...

880
01:36:35,349 --> 01:36:37,470
she seemed to hide something.

881
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:48,048
We spent a good time.

882
01:36:51,475 --> 01:36:53,513
But I guess...

883
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:57,889
she felt uncomfortable.

884
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,800
It was the saddest person...

885
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:07,386
I had never met.

886
01:37:16,184 --> 01:37:18,886
I tried to erase this sadness.

887
01:37:19,101 --> 01:37:22,135
But it was impossible.

888
01:37:25,226 --> 01:37:27,300
It was not an accident.

889
01:37:32,893 --> 01:37:34,599
His accident...

890
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,640
was not an accident.

891
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:47,929
You mean she killed herself?

892
01:37:53,978 --> 01:37:56,680
- Papa!
- Listen...

893
01:37:57,101 --> 01:38:00,930
She was increasingly depressed.

894
01:38:01,519 --> 01:38:03,806
All drugs, alcohol...

895
01:38:08,353 --> 01:38:11,137
As if she had a shadow in her...

896
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:13,888
who never stopped growing.

897
01:38:15,311 --> 01:38:16,768
You want some?

898
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:23,932
- You do not say anything?
- No. Continues.

899
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:34,639
We had terrible fights...

900
01:38:35,144 --> 01:38:36,969
about your identity.

901
01:38:37,562 --> 01:38:39,387
What you had...

902
01:38:39,604 --> 01:38:41,678
or ought not to know.

903
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,303
It was agreed on anything.

904
01:38:47,687 --> 01:38:49,808
She had taken precautions.

905
01:38:50,021 --> 01:38:52,225
Just after you were born...

906
01:38:52,687 --> 01:38:54,144
she left the hospital...

907
01:38:55,395 --> 01:38:57,386
for you to be baptized at the church.

908
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:02,309
I left work for the ceremony.

909
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:06,103
For her, if you were Jewish...

910
01:39:06,313 --> 01:39:08,103
your life was in danger.

911
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:13,187
It's...

912
01:39:13,896 --> 01:39:16,515
irrational, of course...

913
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,101
Everything is there.

914
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:25,429
What's this?

915
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:28,887
We never talked about...

916
01:39:29,105 --> 01:39:32,719
but she wanted this.

917
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:40,308
Why do not you tell me?

918
01:39:41,022 --> 01:39:43,345
Why you waited...

919
01:39:43,564 --> 01:39:46,562
I have fifty?

920
01:39:49,856 --> 01:39:51,811
I had no strength.

921
01:39:57,106 --> 01:40:00,601
My whole life is a lie.

922
01:40:02,315 --> 01:40:04,306
William, my boy...

923
01:40:05,647 --> 01:40:08,811
You are what happened to me better.

924
01:40:13,647 --> 01:40:16,515
We are all products of our history.

925
01:40:16,732 --> 01:40:19,018
Yours is in these pages.

926
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:35,805
Go, my son. Do not be afraid.

927
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:11,139
What is it?

928
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:13,865
Can you see me like this?
- Yes. And you?

929
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:16,750
Two years later

930
01:41:16,959 --> 01:41:18,416
I see nothing.

931
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,621
I do not understand.
I hear you, but you do not see.

932
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:27,621
This does work?
- Yes, because I can see you, Dad.

933
01:41:27,834 --> 01:41:30,120
You've done something wrong.

934
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,206
Let's see, you know...

935
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,406
Yes, now I see you.

936
01:41:37,667 --> 01:41:40,831
Is your gothic look over?

937
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,617
Young men prefer to see me?

938
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:47,282
What will your mother think?
- Keep her out.

939
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:52,163
Is the little girl around?
- Yes, I will get her.

940
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:57,081
Who's that behind you?

941
01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:59,697
Way, the camera films.

942
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:03,539
But who is it?
- A friend.

943
01:42:03,749 --> 01:42:06,783
Youth is not sexually
transmitted, though.

944
01:42:06,999 --> 01:42:08,741
Very funny.

945
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:12,076
Say, are you doing well in school?

946
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:17,241
I mean better.
- Dad, I want to go back to Paris.

947
01:42:18,248 --> 01:42:20,819
I miss you.
I amtired of this country

948
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,081
No, dear.
That's because you're 14.

949
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:27,779
Is your mom home?
- Why?

950
01:42:27,998 --> 01:42:33,698
There is a call from an American,
seeking his mother's past.

951
01:42:34,082 --> 01:42:35,195
William?

952
01:43:07,154 --> 01:43:08,694
Julia?

953
01:43:15,112 --> 01:43:16,356
Sorry.

954
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:19,319
Even in France, we shake hands.

955
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:23,393
- What's your name, princess?
- Lucy.

956
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:28,071
Nice to meet you, Lucy.

957
01:43:29,613 --> 01:43:31,769
It's a tourist trap.

958
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:34,276
But I had often
here with my mother.

959
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:37,145
The sight fascinated her.

960
01:43:38,947 --> 01:43:40,440
So...

961
01:43:41,946 --> 01:43:44,399
You live here long?

962
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,235
About a year.

963
01:43:49,572 --> 01:43:51,812
You are left?

964
01:43:55,114 --> 01:43:59,108
Sorry, I did not want to be indiscreet.

965
01:43:59,947 --> 01:44:02,898
- You've chosen?
- A hot chocolate.

966
01:44:05,864 --> 01:44:08,648
The Dufaure have kept everything.

967
01:44:11,072 --> 01:44:12,944
It's incredible.

968
01:44:13,156 --> 01:44:15,146
They have been so happy...

969
01:44:15,365 --> 01:44:16,906
...meet you.

970
01:44:17,365 --> 01:44:19,356
Was mutual.

971
01:44:21,573 --> 01:44:24,488
I realized with these books...

972
01:44:24,698 --> 01:44:27,068
I did not know my mother.

973
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:29,734
I knew his face...

974
01:44:29,948 --> 01:44:32,354
...her smile, her perfume.

975
01:44:33,948 --> 01:44:36,271
But I knew nothing of her.

976
01:44:36,698 --> 01:44:39,649
His doubts, his fears, his dreams.

977
01:44:41,157 --> 01:44:44,522
And here I am: 40 years later...

978
01:44:44,741 --> 01:44:46,815
trying to make his acquaintance.

979
01:44:50,949 --> 01:44:52,940
Thank you for coming.

980
01:44:53,491 --> 01:44:56,323
After Italy, I was very depressed.

981
01:44:56,991 --> 01:44:59,562
It was a selfish...

982
01:44:59,783 --> 01:45:01,904
pry into the lives of others...

983
01:45:02,116 --> 01:45:03,858
to stir memories...

984
01:45:04,074 --> 01:45:05,982
and even judge people.

985
01:45:06,866 --> 01:45:08,656
By what right?

986
01:45:09,408 --> 01:45:11,778
So: Thank you.

987
01:45:12,699 --> 01:45:15,235
No, I thank you.

988
01:45:17,116 --> 01:45:21,323
Thanks to you, my father died in peace.

989
01:45:26,617 --> 01:45:29,698
- And now?
- I do not know.

990
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:35,319
Weird, I needed to come back.

991
01:45:35,534 --> 01:45:38,283
But I feel like a stranger.

992
01:45:39,035 --> 01:45:42,198
France influenced me the most
I thought.

993
01:45:43,367 --> 01:45:45,405
Perhaps I will return to Paris.

994
01:45:45,993 --> 01:45:48,564
My eldest daughter does not like it here.

995
01:45:48,784 --> 01:45:50,324
And I want the little...

996
01:45:50,534 --> 01:45:53,153
way his father when he sees fit.

997
01:45:55,368 --> 01:45:57,939
She is adorable,

998
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,984
your little Lucy.

999
01:46:00,493 --> 01:46:02,365
Lucy is the name of the giraffe.

1000
01:46:05,035 --> 01:46:06,942
Her name then how?

1001
01:46:11,368 --> 01:46:12,742
Sarah.

1002
01:46:32,161 --> 01:46:33,618
Excuse me.

1003
01:46:34,618 --> 01:46:37,107
It is I who am sorry.

1004
01:46:38,203 --> 01:46:39,779
Thank you.

1005
01:46:40,305 --> 01:47:40,733
