00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,522
<i>I was working in my office
on 138th Street.</i>

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,113
<i>Mostly fixing up banged-up guys,
like myself, from the Great War.</i>

4
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,990
See? Beautiful.

5
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>All from injuries
the world was happy to forget.</i>

6
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>Fixing faces, lifting
spirits, singing songs.</i>

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,920
<i>Peanuts</i>

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>I left my eye in France.</i>

9
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>And I was constantly on probation
with the medical board...</i>

10
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>for trying to make new medicines.</i>

11
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,891
<i>I mean, we needed medicines
that didn't exist yet...</i>

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,145
<i>just to get through the day,
with the pain and the nerves.</i>

13
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,898
I hope this is a better pill.
That's all I'm saying.

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,065
I hope you're right.

15
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>Some worked better than others.</i>

16
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,572
This is my second of the day.

17
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,159
And I feel great.

18
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,369
Victor, you wanna try one?

19
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,622
Yeah. I'll try the new one next week.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,208
All right. That gives you zing.

21
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,336
Put your pants on, Burt.
I repaired 'em for you.

22
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,045
Are you all right?

23
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:13,342
<i>Because of my war injuries,
I had a back brace I hated.</i>

24
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,427
They're gonna put you away...

25
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,846
- if they don't close this place down.
- That's not helpful, Shirley.

26
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,890
Experimental medicine.

27
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,684
- You look good. How's the infection?
- All right.

28
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,437
Good, good, good.
And I got the message.

29
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,939
No need to pay yet.

30
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,398
Burt, you got messages.

31
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,817
Your parents called.
They can't make the holiday.

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,237
Herb Getz called about the ear drops.

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,698
And Harold Woodman called.
Meet him at this address.

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,992
Walk right in. Urgent.

35
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,046
<i>I worked with an attorney...</i>

36
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,174
<i>my best friend from the
war, Harold Woodman.</i>

37
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,345
- Hey, Burt.
- What is going on? What is this place?

38
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,472
- It's a very important case.
- Yeah?

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,015
- Pays very handsomely.
- Nice.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
We have a lot of back bills.

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,435
People depend on us, our business.

42
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,397
Most importantly,
it's very meaningful to both you and I.

43
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,857
Meaningful how?

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,359
- You care about the annual gala, don't you?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,113
And you always say it's important
for us vets to have reunions...

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,656
- to be remembered.
- It is.

47
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,451
And you say it's great medicine for us to
get together and sing. Don't you say that?

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,911
Where's this going?

49
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,163
It's going to a particular procedure...

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,250
and I know how you prefer
some procedures over others.

51
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,044
Just tell me what it is.
What kind of procedure?

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,547
What are you doing with these flowers?

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,966
Dinner date with Beatrice.

54
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,302
- Dinner date with Beatrice?
- Yes.

55
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,888
- So disappointing.
- She's my wife.

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,140
Is he all right to perform the procedure?

57
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,353
Yes. He is. It's okay.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,646
- He's not gonna do it.
- He's gonna do it.

59
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,939
- Calm down.
- Who is this?

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,942
This is Liz Meekins, Burt.

61
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,278
Meekins? As in, relation to...

62
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,073
He's my father.
I know you admire him very much.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,826
- Oh, my God. Yes.
- We both did. Do.

64
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,244
I really do.

65
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,373
That's why he's gonna speak
at our reunion this year.

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,334
Very nice to meet you.

67
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,420
- Are we meeting your father here?
- Let her finish, Burt.

68
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,382
My father came back yesterday on a boat.

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,802
Okay. He goes to Europe on business, right?

70
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,013
Did he catch a bug or something?
I'll look at him. Where is he?

71
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,223
You should see him.

72
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,016
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

73
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,769
This place is gorgeous. Look at it.

74
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,687
So, where is...

75
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,941
the good General "Quiet and Still" Bill?

76
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,739
Excuse me.

77
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,659
My allergies are terrible today.

78
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,953
I wake up, it's in my sinus...

79
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,913
and it's the whole day.

80
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,582
I don't know what you're doing,
and I don't wanna know what you're doing.

81
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,213
You have two hours
until the embalmer comes.

82
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,259
What happened?
He was gonna speak at the gala.

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,136
You will help me, won't you?

84
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,305
I'm not buying
that he died of natural causes.

85
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,099
He was a very healthy man.

86
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,352
No one in my family agrees with me.
They're all wrong. They're all liars.

87
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,062
I want an autopsy.

88
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,274
That's correct. It is your right.
Your father died intestate.

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,234
You're the next of kin. I read the papers.

90
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,237
I hate autopsies, Harold. You know that.

91
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,197
We have to do it, Burt.

92
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,617
Bill "Quiet and Still" Meekins
is the reason we met.

93
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,160
He formed our regiment.

94
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,748
How did a man like this end up dead?
You're telling me it's suspicious?

95
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,876
Yes, I'm telling you it's suspicious.

96
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,628
Will you please sing with me?

97
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,922
He said that you used to sing with him
when you were at war.

98
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,382
He enjoyed it so much.

99
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,636
<i>-Precious memories
-Memories</i>

100
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,141
<i>Unseen angels</i>

101
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:55,522
<i>Sent from somewhere to my soul</i>

102
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,399
Hurry up.

103
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,612
You only have two hours
to do whatever it is you're gonna do.

104
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,447
All right. You have to do the autopsy...

105
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,782
and immediately after,
meet me at Minters Restaurant.

106
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,950
I need to know what you find.

107
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,995
- Why did she say two hours?
- Because we're in the mortician.

108
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,580
They're gonna put him in the ground.

109
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,083
Minters Restaurant, after 5:00.

110
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,711
- You've gotta get him out of here.
- Yeah, we should get going, Burt.

111
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,173
Harold? I don't know
what you think you're doin'.

112
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,300
Liz, excuse me. Hello.

113
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,428
You got a dead white man in a box.

114
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,597
Not even a casket.

115
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,185
Important man, in a pine box of old wood.

116
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,270
Doesn't even have a top on it.

117
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,064
His daughter's cryin'.

118
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,358
Who do you think
is gonna get in trouble here?

119
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,901
- The Black man, that's who.
- Milton.

120
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,780
Right now we need to get him, our leader,
who founded our regiment...

121
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,698
into the truck.

122
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,450
Do the autopsy.

123
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,371
Meet me at Minters Restaurant
immediately after.

124
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,539
- Got it.
- I need to know.

125
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,082
- I need to know what you found.
- Okay.

126
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,584
- Minters Restaurant at 5:00.
- Milton. Milton.

127
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,671
- Please be careful.
- It's got a bum wheel.

128
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,756
- That's not careful.
- Milton.

129
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,052
- This is why you'll never drive my car.
- The embalmer is coming for this.

130
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,514
You better be here. Two hours.

131
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,767
You remember Burt, don't you?

132
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,645
- Of course.
- Irma St. Clair.

133
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,814
- Hello, Burt.
- Hello, Irma.

134
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,568
Don't be nervous.
I do at least two autopsies a month.

135
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,362
I've done two autopsies my whole life.

136
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,490
One to prove I didn't leave a clamp
on someone's small intestine...

137
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,451
the other to remove a clamp I did leave
on someone's small intestine.

138
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,122
Now we know you're good
with small intestines, Burt. Thank you.

139
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,252
You and Burt should get coffee
sometimes, Irma.

140
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,838
Maybe you and Irma
should get coffee sometime.

141
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,214
We're friends, Milton.

142
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,008
You know, Irma...

143
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,468
his wife wouldn't stand up for him
to her family.

144
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,180
They haven't lived together in over a year.

145
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,348
That is my situation. Not now.

146
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,766
I just wanna see you happy.

147
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,727
Dead man makes you realize...

148
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,105
time is short and love is real,
if you know what it is.

149
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,945
- What's going on here?
- Autopsy. Paperwork.

150
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,284
The police are waiting
for this body to return to the mortuary.

151
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,413
The sooner we start, the sooner he's out.

152
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,082
These two men need to leave immediately.

153
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,585
They're veterans. They
served their country.

154
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,712
- Go wait at McGee's.
- We'll be downstairs at McGee's.

155
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,047
At McGee's.

156
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,925
Irma's Portuguese. That's different.

157
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,058
I didn't know you were Portuguese.

158
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,809
I'm not.

159
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,522
Do you wanna start this or shall I?

160
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,733
Just emotional because I knew him.

161
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,321
- You can just sign this if you want.
- No, no, no.

162
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,782
- That's what Harold needs.
- I can help.

163
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,535
He was such a kind man.

164
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,913
There we go.

165
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,709
Oh, God.

166
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,467
Didn't ask how you were doing.

167
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,595
My man left.

168
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,182
This kind of thing happens every day.

169
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,518
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,811
It's fine.

171
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,815
True love is based on choice, not need.

172
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,650
Do you need your wife...

173
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,194
or do you choose your wife?

174
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,571
Well, can't it be both?

175
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,240
No. The second one is
the one that truly matters.

176
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,033
At the end of the day, it is.

177
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,369
Choice matters over need.

178
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,622
I don't like to be alone.

179
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,083
That sounds like "need."

180
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,753
I'm opening up the stomach. Look at that.

181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,340
Oh, yeah. That's an unusual color.

182
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,343
- Something...
- Yeah.

183
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,597
Given to him over a period of time.

184
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,098
It's hard to tell how long.

185
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,936
He just got back from Europe.

186
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,648
I'll close him up
and take more blood samples.

187
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,066
I'll have more news for you tomorrow.

188
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,611
- I take it you're still at the same office?
- Yeah.

189
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,657
Harold says you deserve
a better circumstance...

190
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,743
but you allowed yourself to be corrupted.

191
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,912
He says you followed the wrong God home.

192
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,706
What? "Corrupted"?

193
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,334
"Followed the wrong God home"?
Why doesn't he say that to me?

194
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,586
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

195
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,798
Maybe you spent enthusiasms and urgencies
you didn't know you were wasting...

196
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,300
until it was too late.

197
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,136
You ended up without a chair
by the time the music ends...

198
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,096
even in your own home.

199
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,933
We need this room.

200
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,185
That's perfect, 'cause
we were just leaving.

201
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,605
Liz said to meet her after 5:00 at Minters.

202
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,358
Right. But I wanna talk to you about Irma.

203
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,153
The reason I pushed that, Burt,
is because I wanna see you happy.

204
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,321
And I'm your friend.

205
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,573
My friend who thinks
I'm corrupted somehow...

206
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,117
yet doesn't have the guts or decency
to tell it to my face.

207
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,203
You don't wanna hear that to your face.

208
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,791
You've got flowers for your wife who
won't let you live in your own apartment.

209
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,627
Explain the word "corrupted"...

210
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,255
or the term "following the wrong God home."

211
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,673
It's your in-laws, Burt.

212
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,051
They hate that we work together,
let alone that we're friends.

213
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,679
Well, I don't listen to any of that
Park Avenue garbage from them.

214
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,222
Yes, you do. You care a little bit.

215
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,850
And all it takes is a little bit, Burt.
Then they got you.

216
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,062
Like that drop of blood from the cut you got
from the war before I stabbed that German.

217
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,982
Those cuts clouded your eye,
and guess what...

218
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,483
you lost the eye forever.

219
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,032
Welcome to Minters, gentlemen.
Table for two?

220
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,453
We're actually meeting someone,
a tall woman, blonde...

221
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,039
- serious face.
- Yes. Right this way.

222
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,044
Wait. She was here.
I don't know what happened.

223
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,630
- She was...
- Right here.

224
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,883
- Miss Meekins.
- There she goes, pal.

225
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,217
Miss... Wait. Miss Meekins.

226
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,054
Miss Meekins. Miss Meekins.

227
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,682
We did what you asked.
We found something suspicious...

228
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,351
- just like you thought.
- I can't do it. I'm sorry.

229
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,314
- What...
- I spoke to a personal friend, Mr. Voze.

230
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,357
He said I have to be careful.

231
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,943
- Who? Did he scare you?
- He said it was dangerous.

232
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,820
- Wait. Miss Meekins, wait a second.
- I just need to drop it.

233
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,071
Come off the street. Come on.

234
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,364
- You knew my father.
- Yes, yes.

235
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,908
- And you knew my father.
- We did. We loved your father.

236
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,075
- And you know what he used to say is...
- Yes.

237
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,162
He used to say you can't run from fear.
You can't let fear chase you around.

238
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,289
I know that I seem afraid...

239
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,250
and I shouldn't be because Mr. Voze,
he was just cautioning me.

240
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,377
He wasn't... He meant well.

241
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,712
He's a friend of the family.

242
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,880
What did you find?

243
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,674
We believe that he
might have been poisoned.

244
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,134
Do you know why?

245
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,844
Is somebody watching me? I can't...

246
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,680
- It's okay.
- I don't know if I can talk about this.

247
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,976
They have interests in an alliance,
and he knew that.

248
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,479
But he wasn't gonna go along with it.

249
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,315
He knew something. He
saw something terrible.

250
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,650
He did.

251
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,527
And they knew he was gonna tell.

252
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,778
Tell what? What did he see?

253
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,946
It's dangerous.

254
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,072
I think that...

255
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,616
Miss Meekins!

256
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,159
Oh, my God! Miss Meekins!

257
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,622
These two, they did it. Right there.

258
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,582
- Miss Meekins!
- She's dead.

259
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,252
They did it. Right there.

260
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,545
- You're lying!
- These two right there. They did.

261
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,462
These two guys. Right there.

262
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,839
- No! You did it! You pushed her!
- They killed that woman.

263
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:17,965
I saw you push her!

264
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,633
- They killed her!
- I saw you, sir!

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,801
- They did it.
- I saw it.

266
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,469
I'm an attorney. This is a doctor.

267
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,304
- Them two. I saw 'em do it.
- She hired us. This is our client.

268
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,223
- Look what he's got in his hand.
- He's got her purse!

269
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,684
- He's got her purse.
- You killed her and took her purse!

270
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,727
No. I saw you. You pushed her.

271
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,812
I'm an attorney...

272
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,313
No, no, no! He's...

273
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,023
Get off!

274
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,150
Citizen's arrest! Citizen's arrest!

275
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,152
We'll make a citizen's arrest!

276
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,739
Shoot 'em!

277
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,616
Get them! Those two, right there!

278
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,951
Stop!

279
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,286
Stop!

280
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,789
Cowards!

281
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,252
That poor girl. Oh, God.

282
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,545
Come on. Let's go.

283
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,796
Behind those cars!

284
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,601
- That's the man.
- You're not driving. I'm driving.

285
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,644
- We talked about this. Stay organized.
- That's him.

286
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,147
We're an organization. Stay organized.

287
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,442
They won't get away.
We'll keep an eye out for 'em right here.

288
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,569
How the hell did they follow us over here?

289
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,535
Come on, come on.

290
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,954
God, this brace.

291
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,122
Hey, hey!

292
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Hey!

293
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,170
I think they're still watching us.

294
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,755
You think?

295
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,673
I think so.

296
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,594
<i>Holy shit. What fresh hell is this?</i>

297
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:50,182
<i>You don't get here
without things starting a long time ago.</i>

298
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,816
You want me to go to our favorite tree...

299
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,281
and get bark in the Argonne Forest...

300
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,701
where they are blowing people up?

301
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,622
It will be honorable, glorious.
Good for the family.

302
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,670
But it's good, Burt. It's good.

303
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,091
You'll fit in better
when you have more medals.

304
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,801
You'll fit in on Park Avenue.

305
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,345
People respect military service.

306
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,888
I could be killed.

307
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,392
We cannot think that way.
Of course you won't be killed.

308
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,312
<i>Ah, Beatrice.</i>

309
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:44,361
I didn't come all the way over here
to be talked to like a damn dog.

310
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,071
It's a crime against the flag.

311
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,991
I don't think they have
the ability to possess...

312
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,244
the admiration or the confidence
to wear the uniform.

313
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,620
Who are we talking about?

314
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,708
One of these crackers get in my way,
I'mma shoot 'em in the back.

315
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,002
Well, we know you even like this even more.

316
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,837
I was done talking to you.

317
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,464
- You'll never be done talking to me.
- That's enough, Sergeant.

318
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,675
Yes, sir, General Meekins.

319
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,219
You don't need to be involved anymore.
Attitude doesn't help.

320
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,723
That's why I wanted to bring you on
as a medical officer, Bernstein.

321
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,433
Berendsen, sir.

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,476
I'm sorry. This is Mr. Woodman.

323
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,229
Got a situation here that
I thought you might be able to help with.

324
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,856
What situation, sir?

325
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,859
Mr. Woodman, why don't you tell him
why you're here in the stockade.

326
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,444
Why are we in a stockade?

327
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,070
Insubordination.

328
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,405
Were you insubordinate?

329
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,781
- Yes.
- Why?

330
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,826
They gave us Jim Crow officers
like that knucklehead.

331
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,914
But we refuse to continue till they've
replaced him with somebody good.

332
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,707
Someone decent and respectful.

333
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,418
Is that supposed to be me, sir?

334
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,836
That is you, Berendsen.

335
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,089
<i>I mean, the people you meet
in these circumstances...</i>

336
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,925
<i>of tremendous stress...</i>

337
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,511
<i>are bonded to you for life.</i>

338
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,639
Are you the kind of doctor
that's gonna leave me bleeding out...

339
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,016
and I'll have to shoot in the back?
Because let me tell you...

340
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,685
the officers that they had...

341
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,646
they didn't care whether we lived or died.

342
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,773
I am not gonna let anybody bleed out...

343
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,900
and I do not wanna get shot in the back.

344
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,152
I am the son of a mechanic from Elmira.

345
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,570
I am married.
I'm half Catholic, half Jewish.

346
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,406
I'm a doctor.
I have a practice on Park Avenue.

347
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,618
And I think that my in-laws sent me here
to get rid of me.

348
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,373
Well, that all sounds pretty good,
except that...

349
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,460
in-laws part,
but maybe that's why I can trust you.

350
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,383
So, we'll make a pact.

351
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,637
You see to it that we won't die.

352
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,722
And I'll make sure...

353
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,016
you won't get killed.

354
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,603
We'll look out for each other.

355
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,648
Harold Thaddeus Woodman.

356
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,191
Bertram Berendsen.

357
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,569
- Welcome to the 369.
- Thank you.

358
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,405
Finally, that's what I've been looking for.
Just some respect.

359
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,700
Now let's go deal with
this unfortunate uniform situation.

360
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,619
Yeah, let's go deal with this uniform shit.

361
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,163
Welcome to my army.

362
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,541
Why are we wearing French uniforms?

363
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,794
The American soldiers,
they don't wanna be seen with us.

364
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,755
It's disgraceful.
I fought to create this regiment...

365
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,883
in the spirit of kindness and unity.

366
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,011
Hope to see you on the other side
of the Argonne in good shape.

367
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,637
God be with you.

368
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,729
<i>I saved Harold.</i>

369
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,439
<i>He saved me.</i>

370
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,901
<i>And there was this French lady
saving both of us.</i>

371
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,125
Give me the rest...

372
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,752
Do not throw that away.

373
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:47,920
Why do you want to keep it?

374
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:48,837
It's unsanitary.

375
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,130
It's none of your business.

376
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,926
Get out of here!

377
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,345
Get out of here.

378
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,668
Stop this atrocity!

379
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:28,919
It's indecent...

380
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:29,711
...criminal...

381
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:30,921
...and you are blaspheming...

382
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,548
...by keeping this bloody metal!

383
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,841
She's blaspheming?

384
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,467
I'm blaspheming?

385
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,513
The metal was obscene when it went in.

386
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,474
I redeem it when I take it out.

387
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,935
You prefer to keep it all hidden.

388
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,688
It insults God...

389
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,981
...and the families
of the dead and the wounded.

390
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,607
No, she's right.

391
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,985
No, she's right.

392
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,696
She can keep this bloody metal.

393
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,200
- She's right.
- You see?

395
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,539
Take it easy, Harold.

396
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,544
How dare you!

397
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,920
Oh, my God!

398
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,592
I don't know what is happening.

399
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,189
Mr. Woodman,
I believe I owe you my gratitude.

400
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:31,982
You speak English?

401
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,109
- Yes.
- I thought you were French.

402
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,611
I'm Valerie Bandenberg.

403
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,406
- You're not French?
- No.

404
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,992
May I buy you a drink?

405
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,411
Yes. We can do that here?

406
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,705
- I can.
- We can drink here?

407
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:47,873
Harold!

408
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,125
- What the hell are you doing?
- Young man!

409
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,669
- Where you goin'?
- Oh, he's in safe hands with me.

410
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,839
If those Mississippi crackers
could see you now...

411
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,799
What happened to the pact?

412
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,177
I lost an eye here.

413
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,067
A woman who smokes a pipe.

414
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,238
Are you intimidated?

415
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,448
A little bit right now.

416
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,957
<i>When you see someone...</i>

417
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,501
<i>and you really see them...</i>

418
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,339
<i>you see the kid that used to be them.</i>

419
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,261
<i>You see the part of them that's vulnerable.</i>

420
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,641
<i>Harold and I had that kind of
seeing each other right from the start.</i>

421
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,728
Well, now that the war is over...

422
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,984
I just want to be a person. You know?

423
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,610
I just want to walk around...

424
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,571
free...

425
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,990
as a person.

426
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,909
Just living my life.

427
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,161
Here in Europe.

428
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,123
That's the ticket.
Just live and be free.

429
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,959
I highly recommend it.
I've walked around Europe.

430
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,879
It's done wonders for me.

431
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,089
<i>Without even too many words...</i>

432
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,050
<i>I mean,
she's looking right into your soul.</i>

433
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,553
You wear it well.

434
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,598
<i>Both our lives were in the balance...</i>

435
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,641
<i>before God. Right there.</i>

436
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,315
Can I ask you something?

437
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,029
What do you do with the bloody shrapnel
that you take from our bodies?

438
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:46,158
I can't give you that for nothing.
You have to trade me something.

439
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,868
You don't get that for free.

440
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:49,745
Trade you?

441
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,623
Okay. What does it cost?

442
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,000
Something beautiful.

443
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,794
Something to live for.

444
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,839
I'm looking at that right now.

445
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,017
I already gave you pieces of metal shrapnel
from my body.

446
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,395
You know, actually, I took a lot more metal
from your friend's body.

447
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,231
What's his name?

448
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,650
His name is Burt Berendsen.

449
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,817
Oh, boy.

450
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,987
And he is hobbling along here...

451
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,949
remembering something
about a friendship pact.

452
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,368
Do you remember that?
Remember me? Here I am.

453
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,536
- Good to see you, Burt.
- Hello.

454
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,079
My apologies, Burt Berendsen.

455
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,582
Never again shall I
pour two without a third.

456
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,875
- Hey, Burt, you gotta help me...
- Very good.

457
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,711
...trade something beautiful,
and in return, she's gonna show us...

458
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,339
what she does with all the metal
she took from our bodies.

459
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,633
Her name is Valerie.

460
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,802
What do you do with all that shrapnel,
Valerie?

461
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,763
If you want to know,
you have to trade me something.

462
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,557
- She told me the same thing.
- I got nothing.

463
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,100
Nonsense song.

464
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,769
That's a good idea.
How about that?

465
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,230
What's a nonsense song?

466
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,108
All right.

467
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,445
The red sun.

468
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,032
Some grapefruit.

469
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,868
The handkerchief.

470
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,620
The red sun...

471
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:17,249
...some grapefruit...

472
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,919
...the handkerchief...

473
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,089
...when you call.

474
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,928
To see a face...

475
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,471
...whose?

476
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,308
My name...

477
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,977
...my own name.

478
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,898
It's vivid, the moment...

479
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,816
...to love, to be.

480
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:43,817
You got it.

481
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,694
The beach is warm...

482
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,154
The sky is cold...

483
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,864
Death is real...

484
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,449
...when we're dying.

485
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,202
But the sky...

486
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:58,457
...is warm with friends.

487
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,967
I've taken all these pieces
out of people's bodies.

488
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,637
Look. This is more primitive, this stuff.

489
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,597
Look, I'm having a tea party.

490
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,434
This is made out of gun
powder. And shrapnel.

491
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,895
The height of civilization.

492
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,819
Welcome to my world.

493
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,821
Oh, I'm doing my makeup.

494
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,783
Oh, do I only have half a face?
How did that happen?

495
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,660
<i>As long as I have my lipstick.</i>

496
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,454
Pretty.

497
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,040
<i>You got to know what you love.</i>

498
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,459
<i>And you got to get a real kick out of it...</i>

499
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,169
<i>or there's too much damn trouble in it...</i>

500
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:48,257
<i>to spoil this affair of living
from beginning to end, if you let it.</i>

501
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,635
<i>Why not live it for the beautiful things...</i>

502
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,887
<i>even if you were a bit broke?</i>

503
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,393
What will my Beatrice think about
the missing eye business...

504
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,436
and the scars,
and the scars on my back and everything?

505
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,522
Can we do anything about that, Valerie?

506
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,899
I know benefactors
in a hospital in Amsterdam.

507
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,026
They'll give you a new eye.

508
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,570
Amsterdam?

509
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,072
When I was first going through France
a couple of years ago...

510
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,533
okay, things were a little more difficult.
I had to stab a guy.

511
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,994
- I had to hit a lady with a brick one time.
- What?

512
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,370
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's a long story.

513
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,664
But with you two, it will be a cakewalk.

514
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,293
And besides, I'm far better
at forging documents now.

515
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,254
Come on, Burt. Let's go to Amsterdam.

516
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,463
Okay.

517
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:58,660
There you are.

518
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,749
Paul Canterbury. Canterbury Glass.
London, England.

519
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,503
We make the finest prosthetic glass,
industrial glass, top-secret glass...

520
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,089
military glass, every kind of glass
except window glass...

521
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,509
Unless, of course, it's bulletproof.

522
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,971
Have no fear. A friend of Miss Valerie
is a friend of Paul Canterbury...

523
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,600
who offers you a lifetime supply
of Canterbury glass eyes.

524
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,018
Not too bad.

525
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,686
As you can see,
I've got the same injury as you.

526
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:29,233
Or perhaps you can't see due to
the fine craftsmanship of Canterbury Glass.

527
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,402
Let me see. I believe you are a...

528
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:36,073
Yes, a dark hazel-green. Am I correct, sir?

529
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,324
You're correct.

530
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,910
Huzzah. This is my American colleague,
Henry Norcross.

531
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,371
How do you do?
We've been friends of Valerie's family...

532
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,706
through international business
for many years.

533
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,834
We've kept her safe on her adventure...

534
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,003
and in return, she's helped serve
the good of the world.

535
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,464
How did she do that exactly?

536
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,092
By attending various
dinners and functions...

537
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,386
and telling us what she's learned
about banks...

538
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,388
and troop movement, so on and so forth.

539
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:00,722
You're spies.

540
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,683
No. No, sir.

541
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,810
He works for a glass company...

542
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,062
and I work for
the Department of the Treasury.

543
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,777
{\an8}They're old friends. They've helped me out,
and I've helped them out.

544
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,237
Now I think they'll help you out.

545
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,531
Even Paul and I have found...

546
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,950
some time to do a little birding here.
We're avid birders.

547
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,994
- Yes. It's an exquisite hobby, really.
- Yes.

548
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,581
- This is the African grey crowned crane.
- Yep.

549
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,834
These are extinct.

550
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,919
Yes, we have the last two.

551
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,630
- The Nicobar pigeon.
- Yes.

552
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,507
They were alive at one point.

553
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,384
And this is the North American pheasant.

554
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,844
It's a North American pheasant...

555
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,388
which I like to call
the peasant of pheasants.

556
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,016
They're so common, you see.
But they are beautiful.

557
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,018
- Yes.
- The plumage is really outstanding.

558
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,271
So, you know,
we're happy to pay for the faces...

559
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,149
whatever cosmetic healing you might need.

560
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,318
- Top-shelf, nothing but the best.
- Yes, yes.

561
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,571
As well as a good life here in Amsterdam,
where you deserve a rest...

562
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,115
and some freedom
after what you've been through.

563
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,702
We'll come a-calling
sometime in the future...

564
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,621
when we need you good
people to help us out.

565
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,457
- Yes.
- Because there will come a time...

566
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,001
to say "enough" to these madmen...

567
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:14,588
who create this war
we cannot make any sense of.

568
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,174
Well, how could this monstrosity
repeat itself?

569
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,968
- It's supposed to be the war to end all wars.
- Right.

570
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:23,680
Because the dream repeats itself
since it forgets itself.

571
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,683
That's why it repeats itself.

572
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,937
This is the good part.
But the bad part will come again one day.

573
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,397
But for now, this is the good part...

574
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,525
in Amsterdam.

575
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,072
These are the lights right here.
They can be a little tricky.

576
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,658
You gotta go up, down, up, down, up.

577
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,701
They'll flicker for a little bit. See?

578
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,873
I mean, it's a big place. Paul and Henry
organized it for me, but it's a wreck.

579
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,834
<i>- She was right. This was the good part.
</i>- And this tap...

580
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,418
<i>- It was fantastic.
</i>- I mean, don't let it scare you.

581
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,795
When you use the water...

582
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,840
<i>- The world was suddenly our oyster...
</i>- ...it will do that.

583
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,341
<i>...and it was glorious.</i>

584
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,009
That's normal.

585
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,688
<i>Yeah. Amsterdam is in the heart...</i>

586
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,356
<i>and was there all along.</i>

587
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,399
Go on!

588
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,652
Paul, show them the sand dance!

589
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:21,655
<i>The sand dance.</i>

590
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,449
<i>The crazy British Empire sand dance.</i>

591
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,801
<i>She was brilliant and nuts.</i>

592
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:44,887
<i>But she was our kind of nuts.</i>

593
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,932
<i>And so the pact now had three.</i>

594
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,896
<i>I stayed in Amsterdam for a while...</i>

595
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,023
<i>because it was glorious there.</i>

596
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,734
<i>He was steady and strong.</i>

597
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,819
<i>She was bold and luminous.</i>

598
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,822
<i>It was what the French call
a</i> coup de foudre.

599
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:05,282
<i>Love at first sight.</i>

600
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,034
<i>She made her art.</i>

601
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,288
<i>I was their best friend...</i>

602
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,915
<i>with my new eye.</i>

603
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,668
<i>- We helped vets passing through town.
</i>- Okay. That works.

604
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,299
<i>We went dancing all the time.</i>

605
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,010
<i>It was magnificent.</i>

606
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,596
<i>These tango parlors...</i>

607
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,558
<i>you really feel like you're flying.</i>

608
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,404
- You can't go.
- It's terrible over there right now.

609
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,865
- What are you talking about?
- I have to see my wife.

610
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,494
Burt, I have a very bad feeling about this.

611
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,746
I think it's a bad omen if you leave.

612
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:54,873
Please don't go.

613
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,627
I became a doctor on Park Avenue.

614
00:31:58,794 --> 00:31:59,795
- Park Avenue.
- I'm married.

615
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,880
We can figure it out, right?

616
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,634
I know a thing or two about Park Avenue.

617
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,220
Please don't go.

618
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,139
Valerie.

619
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,687
Let's be realistic.
This can't last forever.

620
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,730
How are we supposed to live?

621
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,566
<i>I missed Beatrice...</i>

622
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,652
<i>even though she and her family
sent me off to war.</i>

623
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:24,945
<i>Serve your country.</i>

624
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,824
<i>When I first met her,
I was at a charity event at medical school.</i>

625
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,493
And I see this woman,
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

626
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,829
Oh, my God. You should've seen her.
And we danced all night.

627
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:36,373
We were giddy. We were laughing.
We were in love.

628
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,210
I had no idea that she was the daughter
of the guy who gave me the scholarship.

629
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,839
In his eyes, this half Jew, he was like...

630
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,009
"You can have the scholarship,
but my daughter...

631
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,220
- "off-limits."
- Sounds bad.

632
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,974
You can choose your friends.
You can't choose your family.

633
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,477
And I choose you. And this...

634
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,148
I'm getting embarrassed,
because you might not feel the same way.

635
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,733
But this relationship...

636
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,862
probably the most
important thing in my life.

637
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,617
- Yeah.
- We do agree. So stay.

638
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,660
But I can't quit Beatrice.

639
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,371
I love her.

640
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,917
<i>Sure, they say you'll have medals.</i>

641
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,252
<i>You'll fit in on Park Avenue.</i>

642
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,714
<i>Well, this was the hero's
welcome I received.</i>

643
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:29,259
No, I've told you before,
you cannot treat these patients here.

644
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:30,719
It's just completely inappropriate.

645
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:34,848
The only reason I know these patients
is because you made me go to war.

646
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,267
You understand,
this does not happen on Park Avenue.

647
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,186
And you've been taking too much morphine.

648
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,688
You stay away from my daughter.
You are blacklisted.

649
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,983
Go. Leave. You must leave.
You must leave here.

650
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:48,028
Don't go to the apartment.
I'll send you clothes.

651
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:51,198
Bertram, stay! I'm sorry.

652
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,247
Hey, hey, hey.

653
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,374
<i>How can I not help the veterans?</i>

654
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,417
Hey.

655
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:07,631
<i>I had relocated my practice
to an alley off Great Jones Street.</i>

656
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,261
<i>It got a little out of control
with the pain medicine.</i>

657
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,514
<i>And I was given an enforced rest...</i>

658
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,431
<i>courtesy of the State of New York.</i>

659
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,725
Come on, buddy.

660
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,228
<i>Wrote my friends to help get me out.</i>

661
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,813
<i>Had no idea what it would do to them.</i>

662
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,192
If your family has the kind of influence
that can help Burt get out of jail...

663
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,610
I think you should do it.

664
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,487
I mean, the pact is the pact, Valerie.

665
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:35,033
I told you I ran away from something,
didn't I?

666
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,451
That's all you need to know.

667
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,913
But, yes, my family
could possibly help him.

668
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,708
But if I contact them,
they'll know where I am.

669
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,458
And if they know where I am...

670
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,754
they will find a way
to possibly drag me back.

671
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,299
And they're very persuasive.

672
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,509
All he was doing was
trying to help the regiment.

673
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,679
I hear those guys have
it rough back at home.

674
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,475
I think we both knew
where this was headed anyway.

675
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,436
- Yeah.
- What do you mean by that?

676
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,980
Well, I mean, we only exist in Amsterdam.

677
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:08,150
You know, and you've spoken a lot about...

678
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,986
the things that you plan on doing
back in America.

679
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:12,362
Maybe it's time.

680
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,782
I said I wanted to become a lawyer.

681
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,578
To fight for people.
People like those soldiers back at home.

682
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,997
I wanted to fight for people like that
who couldn't fight back...

683
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,458
who couldn't fight for themselves,
to use the law.

684
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,212
You also said that
you wanna live in Amsterdam with me.

685
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:30,672
Yes.

686
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,800
I wanna do both.
I wanna go back home and fight.

687
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,847
And I wanna stay here with you.
And I wanna live. I wanna truly live.

688
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,517
How do you have both those things?

689
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:45,979
There's a way.

690
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,732
But right now we have to help Burt.

691
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,825
What will happen to us? I love you.

692
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:06,959
We gotta help Burt.

693
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,003
Okay.

694
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,174
Get dressed.

695
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,232
<i>She vanished, one day soon after...</i>

696
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,861
<i>without a word to Harold, except a note.</i>

697
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,699
<i>I was suddenly released from jail.</i>

698
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,909
<i>Never heard from her.</i>

699
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,704
<i>Harold came back to New York.
Got his law degree.</i>

700
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:44,872
You have a claim.

701
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,957
<i>We worked together over ten years.</i>

702
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,751
The good doctor and I
will take good care of you.

703
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,880
<i>All kinds of trouble
we got people out of...</i>

704
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,215
<i>until the Meekins case.</i>

705
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:01,096
<i>This was trouble
that now we were in, ourselves.</i>

706
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:04,474
<i>And we may very well not survive.</i>

707
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,644
Oh, my God. That poor girl.

708
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,021
I can't bear this.

709
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,065
Something is very wrong, Harold.

710
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:16,904
What's that thing that
you always say to me?

711
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,698
We'll fight through it.

712
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,701
We'll find a way, no matter what.

713
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,539
Thank you. I need that.

714
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,502
Where you going?

715
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,546
It's safer if we can get off the street.

716
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,882
Oh, I know where we are.

717
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,885
I know where we are. Not that woman, Burt.

718
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,848
The lights are off. Is
it a surprise dinner?

719
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,560
She knows people from Liz Meekins's world.

720
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:52,231
The place looks the same.
Smells of mothballs, like your marriage.

721
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:53,899
Thanks, pal.

722
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:56,068
What are friends for if not honesty?

723
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,111
That burns. How we looking?

724
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:01,823
Good?

725
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,701
Help me.

726
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:07,704
- Is that straight?
- Yeah.

727
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:11,667
Oh, I see. You're really putting it on nice
for her, huh?

728
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,835
Bertram?

729
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,963
- Sit down. Relax.
- Hey, Burt, don't be too long.

730
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,132
- Do me a favor. Try to be optimistic.
- Bertram? Bertram?

731
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,470
Oh, look at you.

732
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:29,768
There is no dinner. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

733
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,229
Why did you invite me?

734
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,773
Because it was... I had
a moment of weakness.

735
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:39,278
That's what we've become?
A moment of weakness?

736
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:41,405
And my father can't even know
that I'm doing this...

737
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,949
because he'll take away
all kinds of privileges.

738
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,495
What's wrong here?

739
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:51,874
Do you remember when
we would have nights...

740
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,961
just Emily Dickinson poetry,
and singing together...

741
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:58,964
and just staring at each other?
What happened?

742
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,549
I remember, yeah.

743
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,176
That's why I love you.

744
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,013
Did you fall?

745
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,849
Did you hurt your back?
Let me take a look at it.

746
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,394
My back has been killing me all day.

747
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,439
- This is not the right time.
- Just a glimpse. Come on.

748
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,452
You were once so beautiful.

749
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,662
Oh, for God's sakes.

750
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:35,042
And now you're just hideous and grotesque.

751
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,253
You're so ugly and deformed.

752
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,130
It's so hard to look at you.

753
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,050
And you wear a corset like a woman.

754
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,511
- You're helpless.
- Beatrice...

755
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:48,347
I can't do this anymore.

756
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:52,351
This deviance that you've come to have
about my scars.

757
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,229
Do you choose me...

758
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,980
or do you need me?

759
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,025
What kind of a question is that?

760
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,153
I was talking to someone today...

761
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:08,825
and they said that
love is choosing someone...

762
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:13,163
not needing them for some other reason.

763
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:17,668
Did you need me when we met,
or did you choose me as a person?

764
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:21,547
Was it the people around me?
The prestige of my family in medicine...

765
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,299
when you were a scholarship student
from Upstate New York?

766
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,802
Or did you choose me?

767
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:29,721
Just me?

768
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,477
I asked Burt the exact same question
just a little while ago.

769
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:38,605
Harold Woodman.
Why do you have a woman's purse?

770
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,984
Bill Meekins's daughter, Liz...

771
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,362
was pushed under a truck tonight.

772
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:47,406
What, are you serious?

773
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:49,533
She hired me because
we were close to her father.

774
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,993
That's why she trusted us.

775
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,162
Somehow, they think that we did it.

776
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,832
And we need somebody. We need something.

777
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,293
We need someone to help us.

778
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,378
What about the name "Rose"?

779
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,256
That's the last thing Liz Meekins said
before she died...

780
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:06,091
that a Mr. Rose could help her.

781
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,261
Liz would never have known a Rose.
That's a Jewish name.

782
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,680
Oh. Thank you, Beatrice.

783
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,891
You're only half.
Harold, you misheard.

784
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,058
Why?

785
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,269
Because it has to be "Voze" with a "V."

786
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,479
That's a prominent family
in the <i>Social Register.</i>

787
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,275
The Vozes are at the top of it.

788
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,861
Burt, this is what I'm talking about.

789
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,614
This is your world that
we're in trouble in, not mine.

790
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,120
What's that?

791
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,750
- How dare you come in here?
- The door was unlocked.

792
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,586
- This is still your listed address, right?
- Apparently so.

793
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:44,505
Detective Getweiler,
what brings you here at this hour?

794
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,797
You need more pills, Lem?

795
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,509
I know you have the same brace as I do...

796
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,260
not like Mr. Hiltz.

797
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,430
Your flat arches stopped the Germans
from seeing you in the Rhineland.

798
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,599
You know why I'm here, Burt.

799
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:59,019
You and Woodman fled the scene after you
pushed the Meekins woman under a truck.

800
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,064
Why would you possibly think that was us?

801
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,066
Well, there's not too many people
that fit the description of...

802
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,653
a doctor looking for his eye on the ground
with his Black attorney.

803
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,739
The woman who died hired Harold...

804
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,741
to look into her father's death.

805
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,536
I did an autopsy on him this afternoon.

806
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,664
He was the general
of the regiment we served in, Lem.

807
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,625
Witnesses say you pushed her.

808
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,961
No, we had to get out
of there. It was chaos.

809
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,004
A fight broke out.
The killer pointed at us.

810
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,756
He's very good at being a criminal.

811
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,634
Well, I know one thing.
I need to give my captain answers.

812
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,220
And at the moment,
you two are the suspects.

813
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,933
Can you prove you have
an employment contract with Liz Meekins?

814
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,935
That she hired you to be her attorney?

815
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,270
Absolutely. I can get that to you.

816
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,689
Plus, I can get you
the preliminary autopsy report...

817
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,858
and the Bill Meekins estate papers.

818
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,068
- Good.
- No, we gotta take you in...

819
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,570
Get your hands off of me.

820
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:50,821
Hiltz, Hiltz.

821
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,282
I'm a part of the Bar Association.
Don't touch me.

822
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:57,202
I don't even like that
this man is a lawyer.

823
00:42:58,745 --> 00:42:59,997
Columbia Law School.

824
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,001
Maybe those flat-ass arches of yours
make that hard for you to comprehend.

825
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:06,753
Don't talk to me about my flat arches.
I'll crack your head right...

826
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,839
Hiltz, no, you won't. Knock it off!

827
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,051
What if we got someone to vouch for us?
Someone from the <i>Social Register?</i>

828
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,180
Would that get your captain's attention?

829
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:18,432
Someone like...

830
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,351
Mr. Voze, who knew Bill Meekins.

831
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,187
Bertram...

832
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,897
Beatrice.

833
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:28,400
My family are long-standing members
of the state medical board.

834
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,028
And I can attest to the fact that
both of these men...

835
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:34,489
are horrible liars, to each other,
let alone to the police.

836
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:38,202
If you take them in
before giving them the chance...

837
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,747
to give you everything that they've offered,
I'm afraid it might cost you your job.

838
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,082
My father has a lot
of friends at City Hall.

839
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,509
Get us everything you promised.

840
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:56,637
Understand, you and me...

841
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,305
we got something in common.

842
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,933
We served, not like this guy.

843
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,936
What about the missing purse?
Where did that go?

844
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,939
This could be evidence.

845
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,524
- What are you doing with that? Put that down.
- Put that back.

846
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,025
- What's in here? What's this?
- Put it down.

847
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,401
- I'm just saying...
- Put that back.

848
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:18,033
- I'm sorry. I was being careful.
- What is the matter with you?

849
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,578
He's learning, Burt.
He can be a good detective.

850
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,123
And when you spoke to Voze,
you let me know right away.

851
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,084
I'm not gonna wait that long.
You hear me, Burt?

852
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:28,752
- Yes.
- I'll give you a few days.

853
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:31,171
- But if I have to, I'll bring you in myself.
- I understand.

854
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,173
- And I need some pills too.
- I got it.

855
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,175
I'll be seeing you in your office
pretty soon.

856
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,219
- Yes.
- But it's a bad situation.

857
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,137
It's very bad.

858
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,853
Well, that was exciting.

859
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,272
Go and get your things,
but don't get killed on the way home.

860
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,953
Committee of the Five, stay alive.

861
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,830
Keep your mouth shut.

862
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,332
<i>Why not just drive up and shoot us?</i>

863
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,502
Committee of the Five, always alive!

864
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,463
<i>What else did this guy have in mind for us?</i>

865
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,715
We're everywhere.

866
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:26,310
So now we have to lie
to get into this guy's house.

867
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:31,273
Doesn't matter how.
We are gonna see Mr. Voze.

868
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,401
What is this charity?

869
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,070
Okay, that's the Episcopal one.
The door opens and you say?

870
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,238
I say, "Hello..."

871
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:42,618
My name is Dr. Burt Berendsen.
This is Harold Woodman, Esquire...

872
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:43,952
Medal of Honor recipient.

873
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,539
It's the <i>Croix de Guerre,
</i>not the Medal of Honor, and you know that.

874
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:50,000
<i>Croix de Guerre,</i> yes. Sorry.

875
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:01,178
We know how the Episcopalians
love Mr. Voze.

876
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,138
He'll be sorry to have missed you.
He's not in.

877
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:04,973
Well, when do you think he'll be back?

878
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,310
I don't know. But perhaps
you could leave that letter with me?

879
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,063
We need to hand this directly to Mr. Voze.

880
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,649
On orders from the Bishop.

881
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,859
Right. Well, then, you can leave a card.

882
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,736
I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen.

883
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,405
However, do you mind?

884
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,908
I'm looking at this cabinet...

885
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:26,370
and I couldn't help but recognize...

886
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:28,622
these crafts.

887
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,749
Are these made in a hospital, over here?

888
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,627
- See? Yes.
- Looks like the works of veterans. Yes.

889
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,462
- All by veterans.
- Right.

890
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:37,130
Mr. Voze's primary charity.

891
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:41,051
- They send them all the time as thanks.
- That is very kind.

892
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:43,929
- And we, in fact, are veterans...
- Libby...

893
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:45,138
can I have the remedy, please?

894
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,766
I've got that numbness in my hands,
and the chills in the nerves...

895
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,226
and shooting pains.

896
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,520
- Please?
- Valerie, please go into your room...

897
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,105
or go back upstairs.

898
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,315
Can't you see we have company present?

899
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:00,904
What are you doing here?

900
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,325
What are you doing here?

901
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,661
No. Don't talk to her. She's not well.

902
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,663
Valerie, don't talk to these men.

903
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,458
I'm not a hemophiliac, Libby.
I can talk to people.

904
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,003
Yes, you're not a hemophiliac,
but you are epileptic...

905
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,046
and you have a nervous disorder. No!

906
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,924
- We talked about the doll.
- I'll bite your ears off.

907
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,760
No! I told you not to
do that with the doll.

908
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,637
Mrs. Moran!
Carlton...

909
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,931
- Carlton!
- You know that disturbs me, Valerie.

910
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,766
How dare you!
Carlton!

911
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:30,934
Carlton.

912
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,269
Valerie, honestly.

913
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,230
We spoke about leaving me alone with her.

914
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:37,149
Come in here. We can talk in here.

915
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,935
How is this coincidence even possible?

916
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:14,895
Because it's not a coincidence.

917
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,774
I told Liz Meekins to hire you two.

918
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:21,360
What do you mean,
you told Liz Meekins to hire us?

919
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,570
She's a friend of mine.
She needed someone she could trust.

920
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,531
Someone outside our social circle.

921
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,658
This is so strange.

922
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:31,870
I never really told you my real last name.
Bandenberg was a traveling name.

923
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:35,165
But that was our deal in Amsterdam.
Nothing about the past.

924
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:39,044
Right?

925
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,129
You live in New Jersey? This whole time?

926
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,758
- Yeah.
- This is a big house.

927
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,927
- This is how you live?
- Yeah.

928
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,599
No letter.

929
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:56,937
- Not a phone call.
- I was embarrassed.

930
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,649
This is not who I once was.
It's not who you met in Amsterdam.

931
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,613
What's wrong with your balance?

932
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,241
I have a nerve disorder.

933
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:13,328
- You never had that before.
- No, she never had that before.

934
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,458
We are here for a reason.

935
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,794
Harold, let's not forget,
it's pretty urgent.

936
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:22,462
Valerie...

937
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,464
do you know Tom Voze?

938
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:25,966
Of course I know Tom.

939
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,676
We're in a lot of trouble, Valerie.

940
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,303
We need him to vouch for us.

941
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,055
He's a good guy, but I don't
know if he's gonna vouch for you.

942
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:35,767
He avoids controversy. He doesn't
like that. He's easily intimidated.

943
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:38,187
- Is he your husband?
- Carlton's on his way!

944
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,564
No, he's not my husband.
He's married to the woman out there...

945
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:42,941
screaming to have you kicked out right now.
He's my brother.

946
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,235
After everything we had in Amsterdam...

947
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,446
turns out Burt and I have no idea
who you are.

948
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,034
You know exactly who I am.
I know exactly who you are.

949
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,454
All three of us. Burt too.

950
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,248
We know each other the way it counts.

951
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,543
And if you two still have an arrangement,
then I'm still part of it.

952
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,961
Maybe not after 12 years.

953
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:05,047
Yes, after 12 years. Yes.

954
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:09,009
Because I ended up here.
And I came back because of you and you.

955
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,473
That's true.

956
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,728
I told you when you left Amsterdam,
something bad would happen.

957
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,689
I said it would be the bad part
of the dream. Did I not say that?

958
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:24,942
- It's true.
- And here we are.

959
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:28,946
Valerie, Carlton's on
his way. Open the door.

960
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:30,364
We can get out of it.

961
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:35,786
Well, it's different here,
so I don't know about that.

962
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:37,955
Carlton is coming, Valerie.

963
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,250
- I have a feeling this is Carlton.
- Oh, no.

964
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,085
No. Oh, no, no, no.

965
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,172
- Carlton. Carlton. Please.
- Wait. Wait...

966
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:56,056
Valerie, do you see what happens?
How do you possibly know any of these men?

967
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:03,981
There he is. The brandy, Mrs. Moran.

968
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,071
No, thank you. I don't drink.

969
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,949
Well, I don't think I trust a man
who doesn't like a drink...

970
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,993
especially at a time like this.

971
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,204
Where is my eye, Harold?

972
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,915
- Right here.
- Thanks.

973
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:26,670
I never expected two decorated soldiers
to get knocked out in my own home.

974
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:28,797
No, just one, sir.

975
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,926
Oh, that's right, Mr. Woodman.
You were too fast for Carlton.

976
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,928
I was.

977
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,723
They started talking to Valerie,
and she's not well.

978
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,226
And please, darling girl, stop crying.

979
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:46,064
It's only natural for her to cry, Libby.
She just found out her friend is dead.

980
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,193
We couldn't keep it from her for forever.

981
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:52,446
I'm not so ill that I can't talk to people.

982
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,616
You leave me here with this invalid
when you know very well that I think...

983
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:56,783
- she should be hospitalized.
- Libby.

984
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,786
- It's for her own good. I can't handle...
- If you ever say that to me again...

985
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,705
- It will be a better place for you.
- ...I'll put you in a hospital.

986
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:03,665
- I'll send you to a witch trial.
- Ladies, please.

987
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:06,001
Ladies. Stop.

988
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:11,632
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
had to raise my voice.

989
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:15,969
She was talking to these men
like she knows them. That terrified me.

990
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,557
Do you know one another?

991
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:21,725
- Yes.
- No.

992
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,603
- Yes.
- We do, indeed.

993
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,021
Europe.

994
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:27,189
From Amsterdam.

995
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:28,273
The hospital.

996
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,609
They said they were from
the Episcopal charities.

997
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:32,861
Is there any truth to that at all?

998
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:34,446
- Absolutely.
- In part.

999
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:35,614
In part?

1000
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,824
Hey, the gala is coming up.

1001
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:41,370
Mostly a veteran event.
But there might be Episcopalians there.

1002
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:44,206
And Bill Meekins was our featured speaker.

1003
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,334
But we find ourselves
in this terrible situation...

1004
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,963
where we're accused of killing Liz Meekins,
which is not true in any way.

1005
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:52,506
Liz mentioned the name "Voze"...

1006
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,800
and so we thought
you might know who was after her...

1007
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,176
and can help clear our names.

1008
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,470
We're veterans. We're respectable.

1009
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,639
We wouldn't be involved in any of this...

1010
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,100
except to help.

1011
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,604
Bill Meekins was a graham cracker of a man.

1012
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,607
Not a mean bone in his body.

1013
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:13,026
Then why did I have to help her?

1014
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:16,697
Why did I have to encourage her to go
around everyone we know and hire these two?

1015
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,282
I did help her, darling.

1016
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,535
I told her to come to me before it got bad.

1017
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,370
Now look what happened.

1018
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:28,292
Yes. Look what you did, Valerie.
I'm sorry, it's unfortunate...

1019
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,545
- but you shouldn't have gotten involved.
- It's not her fault.

1020
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:33,589
- It's not her fault.
- Tom.

1021
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,007
- How is this not her fault?
- It's not...

1022
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,593
- Some things are her fault.
- Tom. Tom.

1023
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:39,303
Oh, Tom.

1024
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,054
She's sick.

1025
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,477
We can find who killed Bill Meekins.

1026
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:50,564
It's probably the same people
who killed his daughter.

1027
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,191
We're looking into it.

1028
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:55,944
And that information will clear our names.

1029
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:59,281
Now, the autopsy indicated
that he was possibly poisoned...

1030
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,992
by too many medicines
while he was in Europe.

1031
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,578
Do you know who he was traveling with,
who sent him?

1032
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:08,582
I can help you find out,
but I can't get personally involved.

1033
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:09,750
You're a coward, Tom.

1034
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,710
Don't you dare call him a coward.

1035
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:14,046
You know that's what he was called
by those prep-school kids.

1036
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,340
It's cruel, Valerie, and you know that.

1037
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:19,968
They want me to get involved
in all these committees, clubs.

1038
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,137
Do you know what I do instead?

1039
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,599
I'm a bird watcher.

1040
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:27,851
That's what I do.

1041
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,853
It must be good, get you outside.

1042
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,439
You're a bird watcher.
He's ridiculous.

1043
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:36,360
He's no more ridiculous than you are
with your movies, razor blades, teacups...

1044
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:39,446
the horrid things you make.
Honestly, Valerie, they're demented.

1045
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:40,656
Excuse me.

1046
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,408
You said that you could help us find...

1047
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,411
who traveled with him to Europe.
Who would know?

1048
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:51,917
Gil Dillenbeck would know. Do you know him?

1049
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,336
The whole country knows him.

1050
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:57,172
He's the most decorated
Marine in US history.

1051
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,132
- Yeah.
- Yes, he is.

1052
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,719
Dillenbeck was friends with Meekins.
They were both generals.

1053
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,513
I never got involved in the military.

1054
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,890
I just ran the family's textile company.

1055
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,519
Dillenbeck can tell you
who was traveling with Meekins.

1056
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,187
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

1057
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:15,190
And I don't have access
to that kind of information myself.

1058
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,694
- Okay, okay. We met him twice.
- Yeah.

1059
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:21,196
Took a picture with him once in Belgium
and another...

1060
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,531
- D.C.
- ...at the Bonus Army march...

1061
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,533
- in summer '32.
- Right.

1062
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,577
- We still have those pictures, Mr. Voze.
- Yeah. Right.

1063
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:29,121
He's very particular
about who he'll speak to.

1064
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,833
If you've met him,
and you're soldiers he respects...

1065
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,002
your chances are far better than mine.

1066
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:37,087
Yeah, he distrusts people of means.

1067
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:41,258
If you meet him, please do let us know.
I would love to shake his hand.

1068
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:45,929
Libby saw Dillenbeck in the newsreel,
and she has a crush on him.

1069
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:49,349
- Don't be ridiculous, Valerie.
- You have talked about that newsreel.

1070
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:50,601
He's a very impressive man.

1071
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,145
- And I happen to like that newsreel.
- Yes, he is.

1072
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:55,439
- Don't play it. Don't play it, Tom.
- Oh, we should play it before they go.

1073
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:56,690
Valerie...

1074
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:58,942
Gil Dillenbeck is perhaps the one hope
your friends have...

1075
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,319
of getting out of all this trouble.

1076
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,159
Would you like to see the newsreel?

1077
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,287
Oh, good.

1078
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:15,292
<i>The veterans who marched last summer
for benefits...</i>

1079
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,253
<i>remain under the leadership of
General Gil Dillenbeck.</i>

1080
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,631
<i>The veterans' benefits are still unpaid...</i>

1081
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:23,133
<i>though the brave general
remains their spokesperson.</i>

1082
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:27,387
<i>Look, look, it makes me so damn mad.</i>

1083
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,973
<i>A whole lot of people
speak of you as tramps.</i>

1084
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,518
<i>"Tramps! You men are tramps."</i>

1085
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:35,437
<i>Who are these people
who dare call you that?</i>

1086
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:36,688
<i>You're soldiers.</i>

1087
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:39,650
<i>You sacrificed your lives, your limbs.</i>

1088
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,611
<i>You've suffered that for your country.</i>

1089
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,825
<i>The government burned them
out of the nation's capital.</i>

1090
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,161
<i>Veterans never got one benefit.</i>

1091
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,789
<i>Who in the hell has done all the bleeding
for this country...</i>

1092
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:56,166
<i>and for this law,
and this Constitution anyhow...</i>

1093
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,001
<i>but you fellows?</i>

1094
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,711
Tom, it ruined the newsreel.

1095
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,839
I'm so sorry, darling. I will replace that.

1096
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,382
Libby's precious newsreel.

1097
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:06,009
We were there.
We took pictures with the general.

1098
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:08,595
Such a handsome man. Such a strong man.

1099
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,098
Now that is true character in a man.

1100
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:14,101
Tom is also of excellent character.
And, yes...

1101
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:17,604
he prefers birding to politics.
But it's meaningful.

1102
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:19,565
You said you'd come back.

1103
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:22,818
Why? So you could leave me?

1104
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,571
I didn't know if I was
a fleeting adventure...

1105
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,574
or if you even thought about me
at all, Valerie.

1106
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,910
I never thought of anyone else. Not really.

1107
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,288
What about you?

1108
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,583
No. Not really.

1109
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:39,918
Really?

1110
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:42,087
Yes.

1111
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,966
And what did you mean, "embarrassed"?
What did you mean by that?

1112
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:49,178
Embarrassed to contact me all these years?

1113
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:53,432
Just seeing me like this.
It's not who I was in Amsterdam.

1114
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,102
And for what? For what?
We can't be together in this country.

1115
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,194
You see that garden?

1116
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,281
I spend at least an
hour out there every day.

1117
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:10,449
That's great.

1118
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:14,661
See a rose-breasted grosbeak...

1119
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:16,455
a dark-eyed junco...

1120
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,874
reminds me of God's green earth.

1121
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,753
Yeah, I don't know those birds.

1122
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,589
There's this man from England...

1123
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:29,343
who has violated
every sacred rule of birding...

1124
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:34,640
by going into 24 nests
of a near-extinct species of bird...

1125
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,518
to take 24 eggs.

1126
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,270
All for one man's selfish glorification...

1127
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:43,982
to get his name in a bird book
for some meaningless discovery.

1128
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,404
And that is the type of person, I think,
who very likely...

1129
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,157
did something awful
to Bill Meekins and his daughter.

1130
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:55,994
I'm trying to follow you here, sir.
You're saying that man, the bird thing...

1131
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,789
England, the nest, and the book...

1132
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:01,792
that he killed Bill Meekins?

1133
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,920
I'm trying to make a point. Yeah?

1134
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,797
That type of man.

1135
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:11,093
Okay. I'm still not certain.
What do you mean?

1136
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,304
Dr. Berendsen, you
seem like a good person...

1137
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,849
with your medicines and your veterans.

1138
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:20,602
You shouldn't be hindered.
You should be helped.

1139
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,355
- But I'm only one person.
- Sir...

1140
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:27,317
we didn't do anything,
and we need the police to know that.

1141
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,154
Maybe Dillenbeck.

1142
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,286
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

1143
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:39,621
Can you come back tomorrow?
The house will be empty.

1144
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:42,416
They'll be at the other house
for one of Libby's culture talks, please.

1145
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:45,836
Shush.

1146
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,589
What do you mean, "shush"?
What are you guys doing?

1147
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:51,758
I've been discussing crimes
of the bird society of England.

1148
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,677
Your brother's a little kooky.

1149
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,222
Burt, I don't know what's happening, but
it's far beyond Meekins and his daughter.

1150
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:59,808
And I don't trust my
medications now either.

1151
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:04,438
We just have to get Dillenbeck. That's it.

1152
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:05,981
Great, take me with you.

1153
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:08,567
- Valerie.
- I can come. I can help.

1154
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,653
- She can. It's true.
- Burt.

1155
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,405
The three of us, we were inseparable.

1156
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:16,783
We did things, we got things done,
and most of all, we lived.

1157
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,411
- Harold?
- I have to get out of here...

1158
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:20,996
- please!
- She's right.

1159
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:23,665
- Burt. She could help us.
- I can help.

1160
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:24,833
Valerie?

1161
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,503
What are you doing?
It's time to get your friends to the door.

1162
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,505
Dr. Malin's coming.

1163
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,677
Thank you for coming.
Sorry for the trouble.

1164
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:38,430
Thank you. This turned out very helpful.

1165
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:39,890
Looking forward to this.

1166
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:42,726
Please say goodbye to Carlton for me.

1167
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,356
Thank you. Talk to you soon.

1168
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:54,446
Valerie?

1169
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,075
Dr. Malin will be here with the remedies
you asked for, remember?

1170
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,413
Are you Dr. Malin?

1171
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,665
Yes. Yes, I am.

1172
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,918
I'm a doctor. If you
don't mind my asking...

1173
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:10,504
in your professional opinion,
what is her condition?

1174
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,590
Hereditary nervous disorder.

1175
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:17,719
Affects her blood pressure,
her balance, her nerves and movement.

1176
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:20,264
No, she never had that before, Doctor.

1177
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,558
It advances with age.

1178
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:25,435
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1179
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:32,734
My God.

1180
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:34,278
I can't believe we saw Valerie.

1181
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,655
- First thing tomorrow...
- She looks great.

1182
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,449
- First thing...
- Such bad luck, she got that ailment.

1183
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:42,578
...we go to Dillenbeck's,
and we hope we get in.

1184
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,163
Dillenbeck said no, Burt.

1185
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,458
Dillenbeck said no? What do you mean,
he said no? Did you talk to him?

1186
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,837
I talked to his wife. She said no.
They get too many visitors.

1187
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:54,047
We have to keep trying.

1188
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:58,886
Did you send the photographs
of when we met him?

1189
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:02,389
No, because you have to bring
the pictures yourself.

1190
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:05,434
All right, where is Harold?
He was supposed to take me to Dillenbeck's.

1191
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:08,187
- He was meant to be here hours ago.
- I don't know.

1192
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,982
But the police are here,
and they wanna talk to you.

1193
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,987
Okay. All right, everything all at once.

1194
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,323
Irma St. Clair is waiting, also.

1195
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,867
God! All right.

1196
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,454
<i>Peanuts</i>

1197
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:26,538
Not now. Not now.

1198
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,877
- Are you sure this is safe, Valerie?
- Come on. Yes, it's safe. It's fine.

1199
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:34,630
They're at the other house.
They'll be there all day.

1200
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,718
Remember this?

1201
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,262
You look perfect.

1202
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,931
That's you.

1203
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:49,645
That's you.

1204
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,074
- Amsterdam.
- Say, "Amsterdam."

1205
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:03,992
Amsterdam.

1206
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,995
Amsterdam.

1207
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:10,082
- This pill has gotta be better.
- Of course.

1208
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,793
Morty, it's for the pain and the nerves.

1209
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:16,338
Detective Getweiler, you want the medicine.

1210
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,215
- Let me do that for ya. Come on.
- This hip is killing me.

1211
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:21,635
No, no, no. Come on. Come
on. Give it to me. Give that to me.

1212
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:24,054
Oh, my hip is killing me.

1213
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:26,974
There you go.

1214
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,976
- So painful.
- Please, please, please.

1215
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,144
Let me do that next time.
What are friends for?

1216
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:34,189
I think there will be no next time.
Listen to me.

1217
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,400
We might have to close down your office.

1218
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:39,361
Lem, close down the office?

1219
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:41,238
Yeah, close down your office, yeah.

1220
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:42,614
We need hard evidence.

1221
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,242
Detective Hiltz, look,
you don't understand.

1222
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:47,244
Me and Lem, this and this.

1223
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,872
- Tell him, Lem.
- Exactly, we got metal in our blood...

1224
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,374
in our brain. Imagine that.

1225
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,084
You have flat arches.

1226
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,879
You couldn't serve. We understand.

1227
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:59,214
- You're still our chief suspects.
- Why?

1228
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:02,467
Why? You know, you know we didn't do this.

1229
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:03,844
No, everyone says you did it.

1230
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:07,014
Everyone says? Every... There was one man.

1231
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,307
- Yeah.
- He did it.

1232
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:10,934
Now my captain needs to know why you did...

1233
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:12,644
that hush-hush autopsy on the father.

1234
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,605
There was nothing hush-hush about it.

1235
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:18,233
Liz Meekins authorized
it. Completely legal.

1236
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,693
Harold can verify that.

1237
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,028
Let's see the autopsy results.

1238
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,279
Yes, let me get the autopsy...

1239
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:23,947
- from Irma St. Clair right in here.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

1240
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:27,201
Overseas, I understand that
they have medicines for strength.

1241
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,203
Do you got anything here for strength?

1242
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,871
- What?
- Power? Power.

1243
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,748
- Can I get the autopsy report...
- Yeah, but...

1244
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:34,041
- ...from Irma St. Clair...
- Hiltz, wait.

1245
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,667
...one of the best autopsy nurses
in the city?

1246
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:36,919
Yes, thank you.

1247
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,046
Optimism.

1248
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,383
I understand we both had
a very unusual time...

1249
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,968
since last we saw each other.

1250
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:48,805
What happened?
Why is your coat over your shoulder?

1251
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:50,849
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1252
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:53,769
I was filing the autopsy results
when this red-faced man...

1253
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:55,854
- with an angry face...
- Oh, God.

1254
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:57,940
- ...and this other man...
- What happened?

1255
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:01,318
They threw me down, they broke my wrist...

1256
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,988
and they took the autopsy results.
They took everything.

1257
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,782
- But it wasn't...
- That's not well done.

1258
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:07,991
- I know.
- That is angulated.

1259
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:10,744
That needs to be reset,
or else that is gonna be very bad.

1260
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,706
- Can I? Let me take your coat.
- Okay. Let me sit down. Thank you.

1261
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:16,291
Are you all right?

1262
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,673
No, this is not a good job.

1263
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,466
That's it. Hold on. Two more.

1264
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:28,345
One time, you were telling me
whether you like the Spanish melody...

1265
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,722
- What?
- ...or was it classical?

1266
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:31,890
Classical...

1267
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,769
That's it. That's it.

1268
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:37,896
All done. It's okay.

1269
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,399
It's okay. All right now.

1270
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:42,734
- Okay?
- Yes.

1271
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:44,736
That's it. I gotta get a sling.

1272
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:47,030
- Just keep that supported.
- Yes.

1273
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,075
I'm so sorry that
you got mixed up in all this.

1274
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:53,495
I'm an autopsy nurse.
I get mixed up in all sorts of things.

1275
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:56,081
Besides, brought me closer to you and to...

1276
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,460
They're waiting for us.

1277
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:03,589
Let them wait.

1278
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,391
Why is he playing music?

1279
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:17,895
He likes music. I don't know
why he's playing it now.

1280
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,814
Do you like this music?

1281
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:24,359
Me? I don't know.

1282
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:11,740
Beatrice.

1283
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:14,910
What are you doing here?

1284
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:16,495
Who is this woman?

1285
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:21,041
This is Irma. We work together.

1286
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:26,922
She's an autopsy nurse.

1287
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:28,006
Don't give me that.

1288
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:30,050
Come home.

1289
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,553
I'll defy my family so we can be together.

1290
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:33,929
Is this real?

1291
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:38,308
Why are you here now, of all times?
Like, you never come here.

1292
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:42,229
'Cause Shirley's on my side, and she calls
me and tells me when to protect my husband.

1293
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:46,775
My father controls your medical license.
You know that.

1294
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:49,611
Can you get your parents to put their names
on the committee...

1295
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:53,615
for the gala for the veterans,
so we can get respect and dignity...

1296
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:59,079
and you can tell your parents that
Tom Voze might get involved?

1297
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:02,332
Well, yes. But how will you get him?
You won't get him.

1298
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:03,792
I already met him.

1299
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,086
I introduced you.

1300
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:10,007
Well, you didn't introduce us.
You told us about him...

1301
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:13,093
and then me and Harold, we met him.

1302
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,387
Really sorry, Burt.

1303
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,473
I think you should think
about who you are...

1304
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,267
and what you want to be.

1305
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:34,156
Shirley. Not helpful.

1306
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:35,948
We need a sling!

1307
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:37,283
Where are the autopsy results?

1308
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:41,412
She was rolled, Lem,
quite possibly by the same man...

1309
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,457
- who pushed Liz Meekins.
- I got the sling.

1310
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:46,292
- I can give you a description. He was...
- You mean, they're stolen?

1311
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,669
Yes, they were stolen.

1312
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:49,671
So, what about the results?

1313
01:08:49,837 --> 01:08:51,715
I can tell you the
results. I remember them.

1314
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:55,093
I found mercury, luminol,
and somnifene in his stomach...

1315
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,136
and they were in high amounts.

1316
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,973
I believe they were given to him
the last week of his life.

1317
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,143
Last week, which means
probably on the boat.

1318
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,437
So, we don't have anything
to give our captain, right?

1319
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,941
She just gave you the evidence.

1320
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:11,443
I can give you an affidavit.
I do them all the time.

1321
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,611
I'm bonded by the city.

1322
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:13,819
How about that? Right?

1323
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:15,072
- I mean, we are doing...
- And certified.

1324
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:16,657
Yes. We're doing your job for you.

1325
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:19,618
What about the dead daughter?
Throw this guy in jail.

1326
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:21,495
- Let me handle this. Let me handle this.
- Lem. Lem, Lem.

1327
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:24,331
- What's this degenerate tea set?
- Please do not touch that.

1328
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:26,457
- That is art.
- You gotta get rid of this. It's obscene.

1329
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,751
- That's art.
- No, that's not art.

1330
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:30,671
Art is beautiful, lovely, evokes thoughts.

1331
01:09:30,837 --> 01:09:32,214
That's what that is.

1332
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:33,715
- That's what that is?
- Yes.

1333
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:36,009
Why would you take a tea set,
a lovely tea set...

1334
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:37,928
and turn it into an instrument of violence?

1335
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:39,720
- That's a good question.
- It makes no sense.

1336
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:42,765
Perhaps, Lem, the question of the century.

1337
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,229
- Don't think about it too much. Lem.
- Burt.

1338
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:49,481
Lem, where is the camaraderie?

1339
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,692
We were in the Argonne. Let's live.

1340
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:55,779
New pill. Remember this.

1341
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,699
- You owe me.
- Okay.

1342
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,284
But you owe me too.

1343
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,121
Get me Harold's contract with Liz Meekins.

1344
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:05,455
I will.

1345
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:08,083
Truth is possible.

1346
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,669
And I think that love, maybe...

1347
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:12,838
is even possible.

1348
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,507
And this pill is working.

1349
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,721
Truth, love, what?

1350
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,684
Harold has the car. I only got one eye.

1351
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:27,769
- They don't let me drive.
- We'll find them.

1352
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:28,937
It's okay.

1353
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:31,273
<i>Lady of Spain, I adore you</i>

1354
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,901
<i>Right from the night I first saw you</i>

1355
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:37,196
<i>My heart has been yearning for you</i>

1356
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:40,449
<i>What else could any heart do?</i>

1357
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:42,159
<i>Lady of Spain, I love you</i>

1358
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:43,952
Oh, my God.

1359
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,079
This sounds terrific.
Larry.

1360
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:48,624
- It's not canceled, right?
- It's not canceled, is it?

1361
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,250
- Definitely not canceled.
- Thank you.

1362
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,961
The reunion is a gem,
and you're gonna sing.

1363
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:55,130
We are going to perform!

1364
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:59,009
- You be careful.
- You be careful.

1365
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:01,178
Milton!

1366
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:05,432
Harold was supposed to be
at my office hours ago.

1367
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,518
You okay? You don't look good.

1368
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:09,770
Things have gotten more complicated,
haven't they?

1369
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,440
You know, my grandfather
shot a guy in the face.

1370
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:15,150
And he got shot in the face.

1371
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:18,654
Separate occasions. Separate occasions.
Not the same guy.

1372
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,197
And it all worked out.

1373
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:22,324
- Good.
- Let's go.

1374
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:25,536
Dr. Burt. Burt. I got a pinched nerve.

1375
01:11:25,702 --> 01:11:28,247
No, I don't know what to do with that yet.

1376
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,749
We can be right there. Okay, good.

1377
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,254
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

1378
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,714
We went on a drive
and found out a lot of things.

1379
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:40,425
Well, you're not supposed to
go for a drive...

1380
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:43,595
when you're supposed
to meet Gil Dillenbeck.

1381
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:47,140
And the police are waiting on papers
that you promised them.

1382
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:50,143
Did someone slap you, Burt?
'Cause you have a red mark on your face.

1383
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:54,439
I fell, I got slapped, I got...
Carlton punched me.

1384
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:55,774
Yeah, I was there for that one.

1385
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:57,693
We got roughed up too.

1386
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,236
We were in quite a situation.

1387
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:01,947
Please, not now. In the car.

1388
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,992
Milton, get these to Detective Getweiler.
All right?

1389
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,828
This is Liz Meekins's employment contract.

1390
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:12,875
Did I mention that I predicted
extreme trouble from a white man in a box?

1391
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:16,628
Then added to by a white woman...

1392
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,298
under a truck.

1393
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:20,632
The point, Milton?

1394
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:24,344
You know, I'd rather be on trial
for killin' five white men...

1395
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,054
than one white woman.

1396
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:30,726
'Cause this can lead to one Black man
or more dead in a box.

1397
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:32,853
Please, let's get going.

1398
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,064
We should've left for
Dillenbeck's hours ago.

1399
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:40,694
That's the only hope that we have to
get out of this situation with the police.

1400
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:42,112
Why are we stopping here?

1401
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:44,573
This is not Bucks County.
This is not even out of the city.

1402
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,825
We're making a quick stop at the Waldorf.

1403
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,369
- Is Dillenbeck at the Waldorf?
- We're not here to see Dillenbeck.

1404
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:52,080
What are you talking about?
What are we doing here? Harold, Valerie!

1405
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,041
Unbelievable!

1406
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,375
Welcome to the Waldorf Astoria, sir.

1407
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:57,461
- How long will...
- We're not staying at the Waldorf.

1408
01:12:57,628 --> 01:12:59,505
We had one thing to do today, Harold.

1409
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,715
One thing. Try to talk to Gil Dillenbeck.

1410
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,468
- And maybe have an event with a modicum...
- This is my situation...

1411
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:06,220
- ...of dignity and...
- ...from my past that we saw today.

1412
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:08,430
And it's my peace of mind
that's been twisted, Burt.

1413
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:11,016
Dillenbeck can't help us until we know
what's really going on.

1414
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:14,645
- Well, what is going on?
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

1415
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:16,021
- Give me the keys. Give me the keys.
- Absolutely not.

1416
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,231
- Give me the keys.
- You're not driving.

1417
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:19,399
You can't drive, you one-eyed nut.

1418
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,319
Harold, this is not smart.

1419
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:26,865
<i>At least, just tell me
who we're seeing here.</i>

1420
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:28,951
Paul Canterbury.

1421
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:31,620
Paul Canterbury?

1422
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:33,413
- Yeah. Yeah.
- The glass-eye guy?

1423
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,832
From Amsterdam. The benefactor?

1424
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,543
She still talks to them, Burt.

1425
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:43,423
- Hello, Paul.
- Oh, Valerie, how are you?

1426
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,009
There you are.
Harold.

1427
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:48,178
Paul Canterbury.

1428
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:50,055
Berendsen, how are you?

1429
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:54,268
Here you go. Dark hazel green.

1430
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,770
Box of six.

1431
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:58,730
Very kind of you. Thank you.

1432
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:02,901
It's teatime.

1433
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:06,321
Is it just me who fancies claret?

1434
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:09,157
I like to have it going in one hand
and tea in the other.

1435
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:12,870
We're in a bit of a predicament, Paul.
Thank you for taking the time to see us.

1436
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,205
Valerie, we're prepared...

1437
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:18,333
to do anything we must as gentlemen.

1438
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,376
You bounder!

1439
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,420
You cheat! You disgust me!

1440
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:23,380
History will redeem me.

1441
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:24,590
Like hell it will.

1442
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:27,050
Sorry, everyone.

1443
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:31,305
It's all right. Drinks on me. Literally.

1444
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:34,975
Hello.
This way, please.

1445
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:40,230
You remember Henry Norcross?
He's the American...

1446
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:41,773
Federal employee they don't need...

1447
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,026
to talk about,
or I trust they wouldn't be here.

1448
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:47,404
What does all of this have to do with...

1449
01:14:47,571 --> 01:14:50,032
a "glass business" in England...

1450
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:52,951
and financing in Washington?

1451
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,495
Well, they overlap.
Lots of things overlap, Berendsen.

1452
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:57,831
The whole world overlaps in its most...

1453
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:00,125
treacherous way if you pay attention.

1454
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,295
And hello, Burt, Harold, Valerie.

1455
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:05,047
- Hello, Henry.
- You're looking good, Henry.

1456
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:08,008
It's good to see you too
as we gather here once more...

1457
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,469
on the right side of history. Huh?

1458
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:13,597
Paul, I understand you had
a drink thrown in your face...

1459
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,766
- in the tea court just now.
- Yes.

1460
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:17,976
Just some old business from England, Henry.

1461
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,395
No, no, no. A drink in your face
is a drink in my face.

1462
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:23,148
I'd like to hear about it, please.
Then we'll get on to new business.

1463
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:26,860
It was someone from the
Ornithological Society of Great Britain.

1464
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:29,613
- One of those rotten bastards, huh?
- Yeah.

1465
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:34,076
What?

1466
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:37,704
I was told a story about a misdeed...

1467
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,498
in the bird society of England.

1468
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,335
And I'm starting to wonder
if that story is about you.

1469
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:46,088
Our discovery was hardly trivial.

1470
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:49,716
Yes, we proved that the cuckoo lacks
the capacity, the civility...

1471
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,553
- the character to build its own nest.
- Wow.

1472
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,597
How is that possibly significant...

1473
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:58,767
or interesting to anybody or anything?

1474
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:01,353
Because it shows that the cuckoo
is a parasitic bird.

1475
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,064
It tricks better birds who build nests.

1476
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:08,360
Cuckoo destroys the host's eggs,
and then destroys the nest itself.

1477
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:11,405
Berendsen, the cuckoo doesn't give a damn.
Okay?

1478
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:15,868
I'd say it's a profound statement on the
parasitic destructive behavior of nature...

1479
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,661
- including humans.
- Hear, hear.

1480
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:20,581
That is especially true
after what we saw today.

1481
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,542
Burt, it's the story about
what happened to us. Listen up.

1482
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:25,169
We have been trying to tell you, Burt.

1483
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:27,504
And I think Paul and Henry
should hear this too.

1484
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:30,007
But we ended up
at a very strange clinic today...

1485
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:31,466
and we found this.

1486
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:35,345
Those symbols were everywhere.

1487
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:37,764
Have you seen it before?

1488
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:39,308
The Committee of the Five.

1489
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,520
I went to see Valerie as we'd arranged...

1490
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:46,273
but then we noticed
somebody was watching us.

1491
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,108
<i>Someone was watching
us through the curtains.</i>

1492
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,528
That's the man who pushed Liz Meekins.

1493
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:54,239
And he must've got bored waiting
because he started to leave...

1494
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:57,868
and then we decided to follow him.
And he led us to Rockland County.

1495
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,829
<i>To an unmarked brick building.</i>

1496
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:11,465
<i>They assumed that we were patients
for a procedure.</i>

1497
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:13,175
<i>To be sterilized.</i>

1498
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,219
<i>A forced sterilization clinic.</i>

1499
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:16,720
<i>Then I saw the man.</i>

1500
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:19,640
<i>This red-faced man.
The man who pushed Liz Meekins.</i>

1501
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:21,350
<i>He looked right at me, and he said...</i>

1502
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,936
This is your moment
to end your inferiority.

1503
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:25,729
You're gonna have that procedure.

1504
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,194
Don't move!

1505
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,614
Shit.

1506
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:39,451
Somebody call the captain!

1507
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,080
- Come on.
- Stop those people!

1508
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:44,998
- Help! We need help!
- Call the captain!

1509
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,418
<i>Well, when Valerie's
gun finally went off...</i>

1510
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:49,962
it hit a glass, and we got out of there...

1511
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:51,839
- and headed back to the city.
- My God.

1512
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:54,716
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

1513
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,470
But if you didn't get
the red-faced killer's identification...

1514
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:00,347
then it's of no help, whatsoever.

1515
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:03,308
What are you talking about, Burt?
It has everything to do with everything.

1516
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:04,768
Today, that what happened, has to...

1517
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:07,187
- How?
- It starts with me. Well, it starts with me.

1518
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,440
I told some friends in Long view, Texas...

1519
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:12,568
not to visit this very horrifying clinic...

1520
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:14,444
a lot like the one we saw today.

1521
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:19,032
A mob. A mob of white men chased me.
They harassed me. They tried to kill me.

1522
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,160
They were unsuccessful.
They were very unsuccessful.

1523
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:24,621
I left Long view, Texas,
and I never looked back.

1524
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:30,043
It's not just about you and Texas,
nor today in Rockland.

1525
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:35,007
There is an organization
that wishes to do this all over the world.

1526
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,593
What does it mean?

1527
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,847
It means there's a cabal in this country
tied to another in Germany...

1528
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,974
who supports these clinics...

1529
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,560
who want to rule the world.

1530
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:49,897
Rule the world?

1531
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,191
Exactly correct.

1532
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:55,569
Who's in the cabal?

1533
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,487
Maybe who...

1534
01:18:57,654 --> 01:19:00,991
is the wrong question to ask.
Instead ask why.

1535
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,494
Go see Dillenbeck.

1536
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:08,373
Ask him why his fellow, General Meekins,
was murdered.

1537
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,003
Dillenbeck, he's been leading
on this cabal...

1538
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,964
to find out who they are, what they plan.

1539
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:19,593
Committee of the Five.

1540
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,513
The organization named <i>Der Fünf.</i>

1541
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:25,807
Committee of the Five.
Trying to figure out who they are.

1542
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:27,226
Committee of the Five.

1543
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:28,602
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1544
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:32,231
I think it would be wonderful if Dillenbeck
was the speaker at your reunion.

1545
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:36,902
Seems your event's becoming
rather important, Berendsen.

1546
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:40,155
If you can get Dillenbeck to speak...

1547
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:43,825
perhaps it might attract
more influential members of the cabal.

1548
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:47,746
Yeah, the killer from the street
or the higher-ups paying for it all.

1549
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,039
Wait, wait, wait.

1550
01:19:49,623 --> 01:19:53,001
No. I don't want our event...

1551
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:55,379
Harold's and my event...

1552
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:58,966
to be used like this by anybody.

1553
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,843
Used? No.

1554
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,888
Think of it as protecting what you love.

1555
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:06,139
Okay?

1556
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:10,394
We told you in Amsterdam we'd
come a-calling, and here we are.

1557
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,354
And here you are.

1558
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,441
Well, we done here?

1559
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:19,528
Or you wanna talk more about birds?

1560
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,281
You know, a lot of people assume
that it's about...

1561
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,825
the tranquility or the
communion with nature.

1562
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,536
But I find bird-watching so fascinating...

1563
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:30,414
because it forces you to decide...

1564
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:32,749
what you are looking at.

1565
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:36,712
I am honing my art of discernment.

1566
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,547
And I want you to trust me...

1567
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,091
that I believe now is
the time to intervene.

1568
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,927
We get Gil Dillenbeck to be
the speaker at this event...

1569
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:47,347
he will be the magnet that draws
all the nails out of the wood...

1570
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:50,225
and brings this house of treachery...

1571
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,895
down to the ground.
So what do you say, Burt? Please.

1572
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,940
Please try, Burt.

1573
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:04,907
I don't like to say, "I told you so,"
but this is all turning out to be...

1574
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,075
a lot larger than any of us imagined.

1575
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,327
Yeah.

1576
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,579
If the gala is used by Paul...

1577
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:12,456
- Are you okay?
- You good?

1578
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:14,583
Fine. It comes and goes. I'm fine.

1579
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,751
Yeah?

1580
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,795
You feel fine, then all of a sudden...

1581
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:20,923
vertigo, you get dizzy...

1582
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:22,299
It comes and goes.

1583
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:24,801
First, they told me that I had epilepsy.

1584
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:27,304
I'd never had a seizure,
but they said I had epilepsy...

1585
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:29,097
and the seizures would come
sooner or later.

1586
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,892
But that could be avoided
if I took medication.

1587
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,352
And so I did.

1588
01:21:33,977 --> 01:21:36,021
And then I started having other symptoms,
more symptoms...

1589
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,690
and they said, "That's hereditary.
That's from your mother's side."

1590
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:41,235
So they gave me new medications,
and I kept taking that.

1591
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,153
And now years and years have gone by...

1592
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,571
and I'm barely leaving the house...

1593
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:48,283
and I feel like I'm a patient,
and I can't live...

1594
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,118
and I'm starting to question all of it.

1595
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:18,939
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. No, don't touch me. Don't hold me.

1596
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,275
I'm fine. I can do this, and I just need...

1597
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:23,443
I just need a minute here to rest, just...

1598
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:26,864
- Oh, God. You good?
- Bitch.

1599
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,031
- Valerie.
- Oh, yes.

1600
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,908
I'm fine.

1601
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:33,537
Look, I'm doing stairs.
I can go up stairs with no vertigo.

1602
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,499
No vertigo. I'm fine. I can run.

1603
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,626
- Oh, my... Valerie!
- Valerie!

1604
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,920
- Collect that drunk woman and go!
- We know the general.

1605
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:43,088
- We have pictures.
- I'm all right, damn it.

1606
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:45,424
There, I don't want the pictures.

1607
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,301
- Go, now!
- I'm a doctor.

1608
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:48,594
- Go now.
- And I am a veteran.

1609
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,803
- You're gonna need a doctor...
- Thank you.

1610
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,096
...when I'm through with you.

1611
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:52,931
- Breathe. Just breathe.
- Now, go or I'm gonna call the police.

1612
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:54,183
- Just a few minutes...
- No, I've got it. I do.

1613
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:55,309
- ...of your husband's time.
- No.

1614
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:56,768
I have to fight through these symptoms...

1615
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:57,769
- at some point.
- There goes...

1616
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:01,064
- I'm not getting depressed about it.
- ...our one chance to clear our names.

1617
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:03,609
You have to change your medicine
and your doctor.

1618
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:07,571
Son of a bitch.
I was fine.

1619
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:10,824
Maybe it's time for me to leave anyway.

1620
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,117
What do you mean, leave?

1621
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:13,535
Well, even if we solve Meekins...

1622
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,996
out of the three of us,
I'm the one that's going to jail.

1623
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,123
- The system's rigged.
- Harold.

1624
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:21,668
I told you from the get-go,
this job was a bad idea.

1625
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:26,423
Milton told you this job was a bad idea...

1626
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:30,844
but she had to get us hired.

1627
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,638
Oh, "she"? "She had to get..."

1628
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:36,266
"She" also got you out of jail,
which you seem to forget a lot.

1629
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,393
You can't turn your backs on me now.

1630
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,687
You broke the pact, remember?

1631
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,981
I broke the pact? When?

1632
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:45,150
We told you not to leave, Burt.

1633
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:50,364
At least you found love,
even if you can't get it.

1634
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:53,534
I've never been lucky enough
to even know what the hell it is.

1635
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,787
And that's a terrible affliction
I don't wish on anyone.

1636
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:59,831
I wish I never did find it.

1637
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,334
Because it hurts too much.

1638
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,046
Wait!

1639
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,715
The general wants to meet you.

1640
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,427
Don't screw this up.

1641
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:13,846
- Straighten up.
- Come on!

1642
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,264
Help me walk.

1643
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:19,101
- I'm sorry about the misunderstanding before.
- Never mind. Never mind.

1644
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:22,104
We get so many uninvited guests here.

1645
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:24,731
- Of course.
- People we don't want to see.

1646
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,525
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1647
01:24:26,692 --> 01:24:28,026
I'm not drunk.

1648
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:31,530
Young lady, what is wrong with you?
Are you all right?

1649
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:34,616
It's a touch of vertigo and
a couple of other... I'm coming off...

1650
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:37,035
- some medication at the moment.
- I had vertigo once...

1651
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:40,706
and the world just keeps moving.
I'd offer you a drink...

1652
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:43,625
- but we don't keep alcohol in the house.
- Oh, that's fine.

1653
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,506
You can put your hat and coats over there.

1654
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:53,760
- You're going up this way.
- Are we jumping ahead of another visitor?

1655
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:57,431
Oh, Mr. Maguire comes every month
to discuss something...

1656
01:24:57,598 --> 01:25:00,350
my husband can never get
a clear answer about.

1657
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:01,852
Right, Mr. Maguire?

1658
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:06,982
What do I know?

1659
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:09,359
I'm just trying to make bouillabaisse...

1660
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:12,321
because the general had it once in France.

1661
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:17,201
General? Your visitors are here.

1662
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:19,369
You call your husband "General"?

1663
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:21,455
Only on the weekdays.

1664
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,957
What do you call him on weekends?

1665
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:27,211
That's a very personal question.

1666
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,755
- Were you taught no manners?
- Don't blame me for getting us kicked out.

1667
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:32,007
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Are you nervous?

1668
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:35,344
She's pulling everybody's leg
half the time. That's why I love her.

1669
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:37,221
What an honor, sir.

1670
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:40,891
Was it the pictures that made you
change your mind about seeing us?

1671
01:25:41,058 --> 01:25:44,144
How can I know this is you, really,
in the picture?

1672
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,771
Yes, sir.

1673
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:49,691
So, well, I'm the doctor.
She's the nurse. He's the attorney.

1674
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:51,276
We all met in Belgium...

1675
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:54,446
which, if you recall,
is where we met for the first time.

1676
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,824
As well as Washington, last summer,
at the B.E.F. March.

1677
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:02,454
I'll tell you one thing
that I can remember quite clearly.

1678
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:04,831
You did something that...

1679
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:09,086
You sang a song, I believe.

1680
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:13,257
- Which one, sir?
- Well, that's for you to remember.

1681
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:16,885
I met thousands of people.
You just met me twice.

1682
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:19,012
So, you should remember the song.

1683
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:22,724
I'd like you to sing it now,
then I'll know it's you.

1684
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:24,643
Sing a song.

1685
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:25,727
<i>Did you ever see a dream...</i>

1686
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:26,812
<i>- Dream walking?
- Walking?</i>

1687
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:28,230
<i>Well, I did</i>

1688
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,064
Yes...

1689
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:30,107
<i>Did you ever hear a dream...</i>

1690
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:31,149
<i>Talking?</i>

1691
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:31,984
See... Right.

1692
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,068
<i>Then I did</i>

1693
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,028
No, no. That's not it.

1694
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:38,240
Was it in French?

1695
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:40,284
I'll know it when I hear it.

1696
01:27:05,267 --> 01:27:08,228
Yes. That was it.

1697
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:09,479
That's right.

1698
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:12,482
We made it up.
Well, it's not supposed to make sense.

1699
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:14,902
It's just a nonsense song.

1700
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:16,737
But it makes us feel good.

1701
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:18,614
- And you're the doctor?
- That's right, sir.

1702
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,159
And you evacuated 4,000 men in one day.

1703
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:23,535
You're very famous.

1704
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,037
Different doctor.

1705
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:29,625
That's the social guy from San Francisco.

1706
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:31,418
Story of my life.

1707
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:33,712
Not you?

1708
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:37,049
Burt and I did evacuate a couple of
thousand men in one day, though, sir.

1709
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:41,011
And you, sir, you stabbed 30 Germans
with your knife...

1710
01:27:41,178 --> 01:27:43,013
and they called you "Black Death"?

1711
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:46,808
No, sir, that was Black Death Henry
Johnson. But I did get 12 of 'em...

1712
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,310
before they gave me this.

1713
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:50,604
I also saved a lot of lives.

1714
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:52,231
- You did?
- Yeah.

1715
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:55,275
Well, that's something to be proud of.

1716
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:58,570
It's shameful they made you wear
those French uniforms.

1717
01:27:58,737 --> 01:28:00,280
You should wear your own country's uniform.

1718
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:03,116
From your mouth to God's ears, sir.
Thank you.

1719
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,036
So, General?

1720
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:09,164
Bill Meekins.

1721
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:12,209
Well, Bill Meekins was a friend of mine...

1722
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:15,754
and it's a tragedy what happened to him
and his daughter.

1723
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,965
And it's a disgrace that no one cares.

1724
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:19,883
- We care.
- Indeed.

1725
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:22,886
The late Elizabeth Meekins
hired us, actually.

1726
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,304
She hired you? Why?

1727
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,349
She didn't believe that her father
died of natural causes.

1728
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:28,892
On his way back from Europe.

1729
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:32,563
The last time I spoke to my friend,
he called me from Rome.

1730
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:34,606
Called me from the hotel.

1731
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:37,568
Told me of something monstrous
that he had seen.

1732
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,028
Disturbed him greatly.

1733
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:43,657
That was why Bill was killed.

1734
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:51,206
You see the man
downstairs when you came in?

1735
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:53,166
Every couple of weeks...

1736
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,961
he comes and he brings...
Did you see a bag?

1737
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:59,756
A bag of money he offers to me.

1738
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:01,383
Money for what?

1739
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,553
To give a speech.

1740
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,973
He won't tell me who's
behind him. I ask him.

1741
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,476
And say, "Who's this from?"
And he doesn't give me an answer.

1742
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:13,270
They're paying you to be their mouthpiece.

1743
01:29:13,437 --> 01:29:14,521
That's right, exactly.

1744
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:17,524
And they know the veterans will follow.

1745
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,234
The Committee of the Five.

1746
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:23,155
Well, somebody is trying to do something
dark and treacherous.

1747
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:27,242
Come here.

1748
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,828
Ask him if he'll speak at the gala.

1749
01:29:29,995 --> 01:29:32,456
Push it further. Like Henry said.

1750
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:36,293
Sir, if these guys are meeting you...

1751
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:40,380
and you wanna find
out who's behind it all...

1752
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:42,299
why not go further...

1753
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:46,094
and lead them to our reunion gala event?

1754
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:49,264
They might show themselves in some fashion.

1755
01:29:56,313 --> 01:29:59,274
Maguire, can you tell me,
why do you come every month?

1756
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:02,110
Well, General, I can't speak about it
in front of other people.

1757
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:04,780
Well, why not? I mean,
you say there's nothing to hide.

1758
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:06,823
And it's in the name of a good cause.

1759
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:09,159
Well, yes, sir.
But not everyone understands it.

1760
01:30:09,326 --> 01:30:11,995
What I don't understand is
who or what you represent.

1761
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:14,039
Can you tell me?

1762
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:19,211
Well, I'm not at liberty to say
who I represent, sir.

1763
01:30:19,378 --> 01:30:20,921
But they are very important people...

1764
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:22,798
and they have
a very important organization...

1765
01:30:22,965 --> 01:30:24,758
that's gonna change everything
for the better.

1766
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:27,928
The purpose, as I've told you, sir...

1767
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:31,139
is to lead this nation properly
in this time of economic crisis.

1768
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:33,225
There's a cripple in the White House.

1769
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,144
Roosevelt is weak.
We'd like you to speak...

1770
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:38,981
on behalf of the veterans
and new leadership.

1771
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:41,108
Well, that's what
elections are for, Maguire.

1772
01:30:41,275 --> 01:30:43,193
Don't you believe in the Constitution?

1773
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,072
Of course, but we feel that
action is urgently needed now.

1774
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,658
From a retired general before the election?

1775
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:51,326
Do you want me to be a dictator?

1776
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:53,495
Is that what your big sponsors want?

1777
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:59,251
A dictator?
No, it doesn't have to be said like that.

1778
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:02,337
Okay, chancellor?
Does that make it better?

1779
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:04,214
It still violates the Constitution.

1780
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,842
They did this with veterans
in Germany and Italy.

1781
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,177
Very successful.

1782
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:15,100
18,000, sir,
from the Committee of the Five.

1783
01:31:15,267 --> 01:31:16,476
- Committee for a Sound Dollar.
- From who?

1784
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:17,644
Committee of the Five?

1785
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,563
Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1786
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,152
The nation needs your leadership.

1787
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:27,154
Do you see where I'm going, sir?

1788
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:31,825
Mr. Maguire...

1789
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:34,786
I've changed my mind.
I've decided I will do the speech.

1790
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,538
This is very exciting.

1791
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:40,167
I'll choose the event.
I'm most comfortable...

1792
01:31:40,334 --> 01:31:42,419
speaking with the veterans
Bill Meekins knew...

1793
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:45,005
from the regiment he created.
I'll speak at their reunion.

1794
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:47,716
- Of course, but...
- Because I want to see...

1795
01:31:47,883 --> 01:31:49,968
the men who put the money in that bag.

1796
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:52,930
And I wanna look them in the eye,
and I wanna shake their hand.

1797
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,933
Given that we're partners now,
I can guarantee that...

1798
01:31:56,099 --> 01:31:59,311
you will meet the distinguished gentlemen
on the Committee for a Sound Dollar.

1799
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,396
They will be there to
meet you personally...

1800
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,565
although we might need to be
in a private room.

1801
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:06,235
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1802
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:09,196
This is wonderful. This is the speech.

1803
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:12,616
- Mr. Maguire, take that bag.
- Yes, sir.

1804
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:15,452
So, you still won't tell me...

1805
01:32:16,078 --> 01:32:17,371
who they are.

1806
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:18,914
Is that true?

1807
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:21,500
At the event, sir.

1808
01:32:24,962 --> 01:32:26,296
Whoever offers me more money...

1809
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:28,924
and tells me what to say
and what not to say in my speech...

1810
01:32:29,091 --> 01:32:31,969
very likely killed Bill Meekins
and his daughter.

1811
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:34,054
And is behind all this.

1812
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:36,723
<i>And so, two soldiers and a nurse...</i>

1813
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,475
<i>found ourselves in league...</i>

1814
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:42,104
<i>with the great honorable,
decorated General Dillenbeck.</i>

1815
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:46,149
General, you should really speak
to Tom Voze, Valerie's brother.

1816
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:53,198
<i>Production Room 7, please.</i>

1817
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,659
<i>Production Room 7, mechanic needed.</i>

1818
01:32:58,245 --> 01:32:59,246
Never saw that.

1819
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:01,874
Maybe it's modern art.

1820
01:33:02,666 --> 01:33:04,877
Kinda wanna go over there
and take a look at it.

1821
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:08,297
I would like to try again in Amsterdam.

1822
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:10,632
You would?

1823
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:12,718
Yes.

1824
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:15,804
Well, let's hope this goes well.

1825
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:17,598
Mr. Voze.

1826
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:18,891
- Burt.
- May I call you Tom?

1827
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:20,601
- Of course.
- Mrs. Voze.

1828
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:23,395
Let me introduce you to General Dillenbeck.

1829
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:24,605
General.

1830
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:27,858
General Dillenbeck,
it is such a pleasure to meet you.

1831
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:31,737
I think you are a man of such honor
and strength, and such a...

1832
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:34,323
Such a...

1833
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:37,743
Truly just so dignified and wonderful...

1834
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,454
and I truly believe
everything that you say.

1835
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:43,665
Libby.

1836
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:45,959
Such a...

1837
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,003
Such a...

1838
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:49,922
strong...

1839
01:33:51,048 --> 01:33:52,174
She's so excited.

1840
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:54,968
Very excited. Inappropriately excited.

1841
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:58,013
Have you ever broadcast live on the radio?

1842
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,432
The gala? No, never.

1843
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:02,643
Well, can you imagine?

1844
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,355
Think of...

1845
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:10,317
your veteran friends in Cheboygan,
Michigan, or Carbondale, Illinois...

1846
01:34:10,484 --> 01:34:12,069
sitting at home...

1847
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:15,739
listening to the radio,
hearing your songs, Burt.

1848
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:18,742
- Wow.
- And your speech, General.

1849
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,538
The speech Maguire gave me?

1850
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:26,208
No. No, no. Your speech.

1851
01:34:27,209 --> 01:34:28,752
The speech you want to give.

1852
01:34:29,962 --> 01:34:31,588
I don't know who Maguire is.

1853
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:35,217
But I want you to speak from your heart
to vindicate Bill Meekins.

1854
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:37,678
And all those...

1855
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:41,306
- voiceless veterans who've been abandoned.
- Yes.

1856
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:44,852
You lead the way. And the rotten apples...

1857
01:34:45,018 --> 01:34:48,438
whatever they did to Bill Meekins,
will reveal themselves.

1858
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:53,193
I'll give the speech my way.
I wanna tell the truth.

1859
01:34:55,112 --> 01:34:58,782
<i>The trick was to let the Committee of Five
and Maguire think...</i>

1860
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:02,870
<i>the general would give their speech...</i>

1861
01:35:03,829 --> 01:35:09,001
<i>for new leadership in the White House.
Immediately. No election.</i>

1862
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:11,920
<i>Conning the veterans into supporting it.</i>

1863
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,716
<i>And Tom, as promised...</i>

1864
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:18,760
<i>had gotten us off the
hook with the police...</i>

1865
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:22,222
<i>who now, to our great surprise,
were together with us...</i>

1866
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:24,850
<i>united in this plan to stop it.</i>

1867
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:28,478
<i>And we all supported the general.</i>

1868
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:32,566
<i>He was using himself as bait.</i>

1869
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:43,785
<i>Good evening, America.</i>

1870
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:45,954
<i>This is Wilkin Hartsdale
broadcasting to you...</i>

1871
01:35:46,121 --> 01:35:48,916
<i>live from the annual Veterans Reunion Gala.</i>

1872
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:55,756
Paul, Henry. He's here for you.
He has questions.

1873
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:59,051
Norcross, Canterbury.

1874
01:36:00,344 --> 01:36:02,179
I've never seen...

1875
01:36:02,346 --> 01:36:05,766
such a big picture
of George Washington.

1876
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:08,685
Let me ask a very simple question.
Whose side are you guys on?

1877
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:10,479
We're on your side, of course.

1878
01:36:10,646 --> 01:36:13,023
Same God, different church.

1879
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:16,193
Same lady, different dress.
We're on the exact same side.

1880
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:20,155
Do me a favor.
Explain this to me very carefully...

1881
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:22,950
'cause I'm about to do something
that could cost me my life.

1882
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:24,660
The trick with all this is, is to wait...

1883
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:26,537
till the absolute very last second...

1884
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:30,165
to expose as much of the criminality
as we are able to capture.

1885
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:31,333
At my expense?

1886
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,001
- No, sir, never at your expense.
- No, God. No, no, sir.

1887
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:34,169
- Never at your expense, please.
- No, sir.

1888
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:36,463
There's a lot of people I care about
here tonight.

1889
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,507
Trust our powers of discernment, General.

1890
01:36:38,674 --> 01:36:42,344
Yes, the cuckoo is in the nest,
and the cuckoo is about to be trapped.

1891
01:36:44,263 --> 01:36:45,889
Cuckoo?

1892
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:50,769
And please, let us have our gala.

1893
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:52,813
Let us celebrate our lives.

1894
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,482
Get the son of a bitch
who killed Meekins...

1895
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:58,443
and those bastards
who wanna hijack our government.

1896
01:36:58,610 --> 01:36:59,820
Yes?

1897
01:37:02,155 --> 01:37:04,616
I hope this son-of-a-bitch thing works.

1898
01:37:06,285 --> 01:37:07,369
Or else we're fucked.

1899
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:10,873
<i>Welcome to the 14th annual gala...</i>

1900
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:13,584
<i>for the 369th, 42nd, and the 33rd...</i>

1901
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,919
<i>New York regiments.</i>

1902
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:02,549
<i>This evening's entertainment continues
with Dr. Berendsen, the medical officer...</i>

1903
01:38:02,633 --> 01:38:03,842
<i>Peanuts</i>

1904
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:07,137
- This looks promising.
- Very promising, Henry.

1905
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:11,016
<i>Peanuts</i>

1906
01:38:11,183 --> 01:38:13,727
<i>If you haven't got bananas, don't be blue</i>

1907
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:16,605
<i>Peanuts in a little bag are calling you</i>

1908
01:38:17,606 --> 01:38:19,942
<i>Don't waste them No tummy ache</i>

1909
01:38:20,108 --> 01:38:22,277
<i>You'll taste them When you awake</i>

1910
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:23,737
<i>Peanuts</i>

1911
01:38:23,904 --> 01:38:25,614
I mean, he is good.

1912
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:28,784
- He's a little bit flat.
- Well, you do it.

1913
01:38:28,951 --> 01:38:31,453
<i>Peanuts</i>

1914
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:34,873
Yeah, bravo!

1915
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,709
<i>Thank you, Wayne Katowski...</i>

1916
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,087
<i>and Victor Barnes!</i>

1917
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,005
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1918
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:49,012
Yes, Burt!

1919
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:52,891
- So, there's Detective Getweiler.
- Yeah.

1920
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:55,686
Harold. And Dillenbeck's right there.

1921
01:38:58,188 --> 01:38:59,439
What's your name?

1922
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:01,483
<i>Dr. Berendsen says he believes...</i>

1923
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:05,028
<i>music is medicine for each and every one
of these wounded veterans.</i>

1924
01:39:05,195 --> 01:39:06,738
Fred!
Larry!

1925
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:08,657
- What's your name?
- Alfred, sir.

1926
01:39:08,824 --> 01:39:10,617
Is that the Vandenheuvels?

1927
01:39:10,784 --> 01:39:14,371
<i>- In just a moment, music will continue.
</i>- Yes.

1928
01:39:14,538 --> 01:39:17,875
That's Dr. Vandenheuvel and his wife,
and that's Beatrice over there too.

1929
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,751
<i>Coming up later on in the program...</i>

1930
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:21,378
We're very proud of you.

1931
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:24,381
Wow! What a difference...

1932
01:39:24,548 --> 01:39:28,177
a day makes.
Should I move my shaving kit back in?

1933
01:39:28,343 --> 01:39:31,471
- That Hebrew sense of humor.
- Father.

1934
01:39:31,638 --> 01:39:34,808
I think it's time that the medical board
reassessed your situation, son.

1935
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:36,935
I can make that happen. I'd be happy to.

1936
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:39,897
Did you hear that?

1937
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:42,733
It's a perfect evening!
This is happening, finally.

1938
01:39:45,277 --> 01:39:50,032
It would mean so much if you would
introduce us to General Dillenbeck.

1939
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:53,285
It means so much to you,
or it means so much to your family?

1940
01:39:55,329 --> 01:39:57,247
We're so very proud of Bertram.

1941
01:39:57,414 --> 01:39:58,874
It's quite the coup
he's been able to pull off.

1942
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,834
Very proud.

1943
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,419
Oh, have you met the general?

1944
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:05,547
He truly is the most wonderful specimen
of a man. Clammy, already.

1945
01:40:05,714 --> 01:40:08,592
- Truly clammy.
- She never gets that clammy for me.

1946
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:10,385
- Perhaps I should travel more on business.
- Oh, Tom.

1947
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:15,933
I wanna tell you what a fine veteran he is
and a wonderful doctor.

1948
01:40:16,099 --> 01:40:17,434
And he deserves love.

1949
01:40:20,187 --> 01:40:21,522
Thank you, sir.

1950
01:40:21,688 --> 01:40:22,731
Hi, Burt.

1951
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:23,899
- Hi.
- Valerie.

1952
01:40:24,066 --> 01:40:26,944
<i>Please, darling,
could you stop filming people?</i>

1953
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:29,112
We're documenting the night, Libby.

1954
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:31,281
It could be a historical event, you know.

1955
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:34,117
Yes, but some people appreciate
their privacy.

1956
01:40:35,577 --> 01:40:37,454
<i>- You don't mind, do you, General?
- No, no.</i>

1957
01:40:37,621 --> 01:40:39,122
<i>- Burt?
- We should go see those guys.</i>

1958
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:41,375
<i>- All right?
- Yes. Yes, we should.</i>

1959
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,502
Valerie and her home movies.

1960
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:44,920
It's art.

1961
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:50,092
Beatrice, will you dance with me?

1962
01:40:51,385 --> 01:40:52,594
My darling.

1963
01:40:54,888 --> 01:40:57,099
My darling.

1964
01:40:58,225 --> 01:41:01,144
That is Cornelius Vanderbilt.

1965
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:04,773
- Mother?
- Yes, darling.

1966
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,817
Mother, that is Cornelius Vanderbilt...

1967
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:11,029
and he's standing right next to Alice
Marble. She might win the US Open.

1968
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:12,322
My parents have to meet them.

1969
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:14,449
They've wanted to meet Alice Marble
the whole time.

1970
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,995
Can you just wait for two seconds
and we'll come back?

1971
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:20,622
Did you hear what Father said
about you moving in?

1972
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:23,166
- Isn't that exciting?
- No, thank you.

1973
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:26,461
What? What do you mean?

1974
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:27,838
No, thank you.

1975
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:31,508
What does "No, thank you" mean?

1976
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,846
I've waited too long for the wrong thing.

1977
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:40,517
It turned into something very different...

1978
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:42,603
than it ever once could be.

1979
01:41:45,647 --> 01:41:48,150
I think terrible things
might happen to you.

1980
01:41:49,776 --> 01:41:51,987
What a thing to say to anyone...

1981
01:41:53,488 --> 01:41:55,115
let alone your beloved.

1982
01:42:01,788 --> 01:42:05,125
Mother, there's Cornelius Vanderbilt
and Alice Marble. Let's go meet them.

1983
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:22,142
It's okay, Burt.

1984
01:42:23,268 --> 01:42:24,686
Yeah, you still have us.

1985
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:28,857
Thank God. I'm running out of people, fast.

1986
01:42:29,566 --> 01:42:30,859
Some important men who...

1987
01:42:31,026 --> 01:42:33,028
I believe you wanted to meet.

1988
01:42:33,195 --> 01:42:34,905
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yes, I would like to meet them.

1989
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:37,533
Berendsen, we can meet these people
that we talked about.

1990
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:39,451
Valerie, you looked so lovely dancing.

1991
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:41,328
Maybe you should stay
here with your friends.

1992
01:42:41,787 --> 01:42:43,956
There's Tom Voze talking to the general.

1993
01:42:44,122 --> 01:42:45,457
Oh, yes.

1994
01:42:45,624 --> 01:42:48,335
I spent my whole life
avoiding these people.

1995
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:49,837
I feel the exact same way, General.

1996
01:42:50,003 --> 01:42:52,673
These might be some of the better ones
worth giving a chance.

1997
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:00,639
General Dillenbeck...

1998
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:03,684
this is Mr. Nevins
of Nevins Telecommunications.

1999
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:05,894
Mr. Belport, Belport Chemicals...

2000
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:08,105
Mr. Jeffers of Jeffers Newschain.

2001
01:43:13,318 --> 01:43:16,363
We wanted to have Mr. Tomlinson,
legendary auto inventor...

2002
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:20,242
but he couldn't be here tonight.
He has a fantastic operation in Munich.

2003
01:43:21,743 --> 01:43:23,453
Gil, may I call you Gil?

2004
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:25,455
No. You can call me General.

2005
01:43:25,622 --> 01:43:26,874
He prefers General.

2006
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,418
Gil, I understand. We understand.

2007
01:43:29,585 --> 01:43:31,086
He prefers to be called General.

2008
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:33,922
How's it going, Gil? I'm Andrew Nevins.
You can call me Andy.

2009
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:37,259
Well, I'll call you Andy.
You call me General.

2010
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:40,888
I'm here to reckon
for the death of my friend Bill Meekins.

2011
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:42,431
Oh, who's that?

2012
01:43:42,598 --> 01:43:45,851
Bill Meekins? We're honoring him tonight.

2013
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:47,728
Ran the bond exchange.

2014
01:43:47,895 --> 01:43:49,980
Of course, I'm terribly sorry
about what happened.

2015
01:43:50,147 --> 01:43:52,065
- I almost forgot.
- Tragedy with the daughter.

2016
01:43:52,232 --> 01:43:53,817
Terrible tragedy.

2017
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:58,030
I look forward to speaking with you tonight
about business opportunities overseas.

2018
01:43:58,197 --> 01:44:01,241
Our plant in Munich is
getting fantastic returns...

2019
01:44:01,408 --> 01:44:03,160
because of strong leadership.

2020
01:44:03,327 --> 01:44:05,329
Knowing how to get things done.

2021
01:44:05,495 --> 01:44:06,955
Let's have a toast.

2022
01:44:07,956 --> 01:44:10,876
Yes, all right. Good. We are the three.

2023
01:44:11,043 --> 01:44:13,420
Tom, you could be the fourth,
like we're playing golf.

2024
01:44:13,587 --> 01:44:17,549
And for good luck,
we need a proper fifth. General?

2025
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,721
Won't you please step in?

2026
01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:26,850
To the general.

2027
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:28,018
- The general.
- To the general.

2028
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:29,186
To General.

2029
01:44:34,691 --> 01:44:37,653
<i>Talk about following the wrong God home.</i>

2030
01:44:38,362 --> 01:44:40,989
<i>What's more un-American
than a dictatorship...</i>

2031
01:44:41,156 --> 01:44:43,325
<i>built by American business?</i>

2032
01:44:43,492 --> 01:44:45,994
There are two properties, General,
if you should ever want to use them.

2033
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:47,371
You or your family.

2034
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:50,582
Pioneer Point in Maryland,
the home state of Belport Chemicals.

2035
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:53,752
A great retreat for you or the veterans.

2036
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:56,588
And another one out in East Hampton.
You and your family might like it.

2037
01:44:56,797 --> 01:45:00,968
I'll think about it, though the wife and I
enjoy a little place on the Jersey Shore.

2038
01:45:01,134 --> 01:45:03,762
Maybe you need a larger
imagination, General.

2039
01:45:05,097 --> 01:45:07,266
That's how we all ended up here.

2040
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:11,186
Never mind these men, General.
They think they own the world.

2041
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:13,063
It's time to be getting
on with your speech.

2042
01:45:14,815 --> 01:45:16,650
We're looking forward to your speech.

2043
01:45:35,127 --> 01:45:38,922
<i>And now, a featured star
of the 369th, Auggie...</i>

2044
01:45:39,089 --> 01:45:40,424
<i>on the glasses.</i>

2045
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:48,557
{\an8}What is that?

2046
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:52,936
This is one of the finest innovations
from Zurich.

2047
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:55,647
Removes all pain, all anxiety.

2048
01:45:58,734 --> 01:46:01,737
All needless thoughts that occupy the mind.

2049
01:46:09,453 --> 01:46:10,996
My back is killing me.

2050
01:46:11,163 --> 01:46:14,541
Normally, guys like me,
we have to turn to booze...

2051
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:17,211
and morphine,
and that can lead to addiction...

2052
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:18,837
Oh, that's fast.

2053
01:46:19,004 --> 01:46:22,591
That is advanced.
Oh, that is tremendous energy.

2054
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:25,761
- I feel no pain.
- It's good, isn't it?

2055
01:46:25,928 --> 01:46:27,012
That is good.

2056
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,306
There's more where this came from, Burt.

2057
01:46:29,473 --> 01:46:33,602
I wanna know more about this.
I would love to have the chemical compound.

2058
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:36,313
When I get together with my sisters
at the Vril Society...

2059
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,651
we hold a séance where we let our hair
down, and it acts as a kind of antenna.

2060
01:46:40,817 --> 01:46:42,945
It allows us to communicate
with the greater race.

2061
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:46,532
Honestly, they come from a
different galaxy. It's truly fascinating.

2062
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:51,912
<i>And now, the Hinson Brothers.</i>

2063
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:59,044
<i>Lady of Spain, I adore you</i>

2064
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:02,881
<i>Right from the night I first saw you</i>

2065
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:05,759
I wanted to say, for your speech tonight,
General, some friendly advice.

2066
01:47:05,926 --> 01:47:08,554
Oh, please, please, please,
don't give him any friendly advice.

2067
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,098
Oh, yeah, well, what's the friendly advice?

2068
01:47:12,558 --> 01:47:15,435
Tonight, people will be listening to you
on the radio.

2069
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:20,107
You'll never have a bigger audience with
more excited attention from everyone.

2070
01:47:20,274 --> 01:47:23,068
They'll be looking to you for inspiration.

2071
01:47:23,735 --> 01:47:26,321
Remember the veterans who
have bled and died on our behalf...

2072
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:29,324
and remember Bill Meekins...

2073
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:31,952
and honor him respectfully.

2074
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:34,037
If you improvise
and get lost in the woods...

2075
01:47:34,204 --> 01:47:37,207
of some complicated criminal situation
over Meekins's death...

2076
01:47:37,374 --> 01:47:41,295
it will reflect badly on you,
and we don't want that for you, General.

2077
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:45,424
The general was very clear about
that he was gonna...

2078
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:48,594
honor Bill Meekins and tell the truth.

2079
01:47:49,845 --> 01:47:53,599
Well, that's exactly what I mean.
Focus on the good qualities Meekins had.

2080
01:47:53,765 --> 01:47:55,851
His quietness and his kindness.

2081
01:47:56,018 --> 01:47:58,896
That's what I intend to do in my own way.

2082
01:48:06,403 --> 01:48:08,363
- What is that?
- Feel this.

2083
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:09,948
This is walrus.

2084
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:12,993
Oh, that is soft.

2085
01:48:14,411 --> 01:48:15,913
A walrus was killed for this?

2086
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:20,167
No, sir, he died of old age.
He lived a long, happy life...

2087
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,503
because he made smart choices.

2088
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:26,715
It's a contribution for your foundation.

2089
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:29,218
I don't have a foundation.

2090
01:48:29,384 --> 01:48:31,637
Well, maybe you should start one.
I can help you.

2091
01:48:31,803 --> 01:48:33,889
$36,000, General.

2092
01:48:34,056 --> 01:48:37,184
Think of everything you can do with
Dr. Berendsen and his medical innovations.

2093
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:40,729
So much to be accomplished.
You have to take the money.

2094
01:48:40,896 --> 01:48:42,523
What do you mean, I have to take it?

2095
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:46,443
Listen to me. Someone, not me...

2096
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:49,780
they will take your face and your name...

2097
01:48:49,947 --> 01:48:53,825
put it in the <i>New York Times,
</i>and wipe their dog's ass with it.

2098
01:48:54,868 --> 01:48:57,704
Think of everything
you've accomplished in your life.

2099
01:48:57,871 --> 01:48:59,998
It'll be forgotten, erased.

2100
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:05,295
You'll be treated like an old kook
and buried by history.

2101
01:49:05,462 --> 01:49:09,925
That's what they can do.
Make the right speech.

2102
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:14,555
Or they'll turn you into a martyr
and say an anarchist did it.

2103
01:49:15,597 --> 01:49:17,766
Don't make the mistake like Bill Meekins.

2104
01:49:17,933 --> 01:49:20,352
That was a tragic theft of a life.

2105
01:49:20,519 --> 01:49:23,272
<i>Lady of Spain, I love you</i>

2106
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:28,193
<i>That was the Hinson Brothers.</i>

2107
01:49:29,152 --> 01:49:32,281
<i>The Hinson Brothers, they were great.
Don't you agree? Yes.</i>

2108
01:49:32,447 --> 01:49:35,659
<i>Hinson Brothers. Doing "Lady of Spain."</i>

2109
01:49:35,826 --> 01:49:38,787
<i>Yeah, "Lady of Spain."
I met a lady of Spain once...</i>

2110
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:42,249
<i>and she turned me into
a gentleman of pain. Yes.</i>

2111
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:45,335
<i>Now, the gentleman I'm about
to bring out right now...</i>

2112
01:49:45,502 --> 01:49:47,588
<i>is a doctor of our regiment...</i>

2113
01:49:47,754 --> 01:49:50,799
<i>and a man I like to call "friend."</i>

2114
01:49:50,966 --> 01:49:54,219
<i>Please welcome Burt Berendsen.
Come on, Burt.</i>

2115
01:49:55,053 --> 01:49:58,390
<i>Time to give your speech, Burt. Burt?</i>

2116
01:49:59,266 --> 01:50:01,435
<i>Dr. Burt Berendsen.</i>

2117
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:09,526
<i>My name is Burt Berendsen.
Most of you know me.</i>

2118
01:50:09,693 --> 01:50:13,864
<i>I am the son of a mechanic from Elmira.</i>

2119
01:50:14,281 --> 01:50:15,866
<i>As a child...</i>

2120
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:20,287
<i>we love the world, naturally.</i>

2121
01:50:21,455 --> 01:50:24,875
<i>And we hope the world loves us.</i>

2122
01:50:26,627 --> 01:50:29,671
<i>As my friend Harold said sometimes...</i>

2123
01:50:29,838 --> 01:50:33,258
<i>I might have followed the wrong God home.</i>

2124
01:50:33,425 --> 01:50:34,927
<i>Well, not this man.</i>

2125
01:50:36,512 --> 01:50:39,932
<i>He always followed the right God home.</i>

2126
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:48,023
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2127
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:51,318
- Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!
- Dillenbeck!

2128
01:50:51,693 --> 01:50:53,612
Dillenbeck! Dillenbeck!

2129
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:07,292
Listen to those Bund bastards.

2130
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:11,046
Shower of bleeders, rotters.

2131
01:51:11,213 --> 01:51:14,633
<i>If you people shouting at me in German
had any courage...</i>

2132
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,218
<i>you would behave with dignity.</i>

2133
01:51:22,891 --> 01:51:24,810
Yes! General Dillenbeck!

2134
01:51:27,813 --> 01:51:31,233
<i>I fought in five wars on three continents.</i>

2135
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,069
<i>People shot at me my whole life.
My whole life.</i>

2136
01:51:34,236 --> 01:51:38,490
<i>I know fear, and I know facing fear.
But the one thing I truly detest...</i>

2137
01:51:39,074 --> 01:51:42,536
<i>the one thing I truly, truly detest...</i>

2138
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:44,705
<i>is cruelty.</i>

2139
01:51:46,582 --> 01:51:50,210
<i>I've been offered money
to become the self-appointed leader...</i>

2140
01:51:51,712 --> 01:51:54,256
<i>of the veterans, veterans like you...</i>

2141
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:58,552
<i>to be put in the White House
without an election...</i>

2142
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:03,265
<i>as some sort of advisor
by popular demand...</i>

2143
01:52:03,432 --> 01:52:04,641
<i>of you.</i>

2144
01:52:05,726 --> 01:52:09,313
<i>These same people want me to emulate...</i>

2145
01:52:09,479 --> 01:52:12,774
<i>a certain European leader named Mussolini.</i>

2146
01:52:15,152 --> 01:52:19,406
<i>They think he's the type of leader
that this country needs.</i>

2147
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:21,325
<i>The type of leader...</i>

2148
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:25,621
<i>who ran over a child
and never stopped his car.</i>

2149
01:52:27,873 --> 01:52:31,001
<i>The type of leader whose excuse was...</i>

2150
01:52:31,168 --> 01:52:34,087
<i>"What's one person
in the affairs of the state?"</i>

2151
01:52:36,798 --> 01:52:40,260
<i>General Bill Meekins was in that car.</i>

2152
01:52:40,427 --> 01:52:41,970
<i>He was a friend of mine.</i>

2153
01:52:42,137 --> 01:52:43,639
<i>He was a good person.</i>

2154
01:52:44,473 --> 01:52:46,767
<i>But when he told that story...</i>

2155
01:52:46,934 --> 01:52:50,395
<i>when he intended to tell it again
here on this stage...</i>

2156
01:52:50,562 --> 01:52:54,525
<i>he became another person
whose life was worth nothing...</i>

2157
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:57,152
<i>in the affairs of the state.</i>

2158
01:52:57,653 --> 01:52:59,279
<i>He was murdered.</i>

2159
01:52:59,821 --> 01:53:02,115
<i>Yes, he was murdered and dishonored...</i>

2160
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:07,162
<i>as I might be murdered or dishonored
for telling that story here tonight.</i>

2161
01:53:09,248 --> 01:53:11,625
<i>What kind of country does this become
when that happens?</i>

2162
01:53:13,377 --> 01:53:16,004
<i>I became a Marine
to serve the Constitution...</i>

2163
01:53:16,171 --> 01:53:19,842
<i>which intends for us all to be equal
in the brotherhood of mankind.</i>

2164
01:53:20,008 --> 01:53:23,804
<i>But what good is it when powerful people...</i>

2165
01:53:23,971 --> 01:53:27,140
<i>make exceptions for the people
who stand in their way?</i>

2166
01:53:27,975 --> 01:53:29,977
<i>Some people of influence and power...</i>

2167
01:53:30,143 --> 01:53:32,521
<i>like it when regular folks
are fired up by hatred...</i>

2168
01:53:32,688 --> 01:53:36,191
<i>because it distracts us
from the fairness and kindness.</i>

2169
01:53:36,817 --> 01:53:38,944
<i>They don't want us to
think about too much...</i>

2170
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:42,239
<i>just so they can get more and more
of what they already have...</i>

2171
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:44,157
<i>which is vast wealth.</i>

2172
01:53:44,908 --> 01:53:46,368
<i>This is your country.</i>

2173
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:48,704
<i>This is your country.</i>

2174
01:53:50,706 --> 01:53:52,916
<i>Don't let the big men
take it away from you.</i>

2175
01:54:01,842 --> 01:54:05,179
- Look, it's that guy.
<i>- I'm the son of a banker.</i>

2176
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:07,723
<i>I'm a Republican.</i>

2177
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,433
Where's Paul and Henry?

2178
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,518
- Not here.
<i>- I'm a conservative.</i>

2179
01:54:11,685 --> 01:54:12,936
What about the detectives?
Do you know where they are?

2180
01:54:13,103 --> 01:54:14,354
Also not here.

2181
01:54:14,563 --> 01:54:17,232
<i>That's what it's like
when people who have money...</i>

2182
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:19,943
<i>only think about wanting much more of it.</i>

2183
01:54:20,777 --> 01:54:22,821
<i>That's all that they think about.</i>

2184
01:54:22,988 --> 01:54:26,491
<i>And they forget that you are the ones
who went out...</i>

2185
01:54:26,909 --> 01:54:28,994
<i>and protected them.</i>

2186
01:54:30,204 --> 01:54:31,705
<i>You lost an eye...</i>

2187
01:54:31,872 --> 01:54:33,498
<i>or you lost your life...</i>

2188
01:54:33,665 --> 01:54:36,043
<i>and your family had to suffer...</i>

2189
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:37,711
<i>though they...</i>

2190
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:40,339
<i>were the heroes who sent you off to war.</i>

2191
01:54:42,174 --> 01:54:44,092
<i>Whoever's shooting at me is a coward.</i>

2192
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:46,261
<i>I've been shot at all over the world.</i>

2193
01:54:46,428 --> 01:54:47,554
Get his gun!

2194
01:54:49,223 --> 01:54:51,433
<i>I am not intimidated. I am not afraid.</i>

2195
01:54:52,768 --> 01:54:55,229
<i>- You all right?
</i>- Burt, are you all right?

2196
01:54:55,395 --> 01:54:56,563
Lem, I'm fine. I'm fine.

2197
01:55:07,407 --> 01:55:08,867
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

2198
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:10,702
Dillenbeck's a traitor!

2199
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:13,038
<i>- Stop that man.
</i>- Tom Voze is a great man!

2200
01:55:13,205 --> 01:55:15,499
Tom Voze is a great man! You have...

2201
01:55:19,211 --> 01:55:20,128
<i>Keep that man down.</i>

2202
01:55:20,295 --> 01:55:22,589
Sinful and legal. Ask Mr. Voze!

2203
01:55:27,219 --> 01:55:28,345
<i>My country</i>

2204
01:55:28,512 --> 01:55:32,099
<i>'Tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty</i>

2205
01:55:32,266 --> 01:55:34,726
<i>Of thee I sing</i>

2206
01:55:35,602 --> 01:55:37,604
Break it up! Break it up! Come here.

2207
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:44,069
I'm a veteran and a patriot, you fool.

2208
01:55:44,236 --> 01:55:47,072
You killed Liz Meekins, you son of a bitch.

2209
01:55:47,239 --> 01:55:49,575
And for all I know, her father too.

2210
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,286
United States Treasury! Everyone, leave!

2211
01:55:53,453 --> 01:55:55,539
- Are you okay?
- This is terrible.

2212
01:55:55,706 --> 01:55:57,457
We never meant for
anything like this to happen.

2213
01:55:57,624 --> 01:55:58,834
This is an outrage.

2214
01:55:59,001 --> 01:56:02,045
You're gonna be charged.
You're gonna be charged, Tom. You.

2215
01:56:02,212 --> 01:56:03,714
- Yes, you.
- No, sir. You are confused.

2216
01:56:03,922 --> 01:56:05,841
- No, I'm not confused.
<i>- Between my own pill...</i>

2217
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:07,509
<i>and getting shot...</i>

2218
01:56:07,676 --> 01:56:10,429
<i>these eye drops are
the only reason I'm standing...</i>

2219
01:56:10,596 --> 01:56:12,514
<i>and I feel no pain.</i>

2220
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:17,477
<i>And holy shit!
Look what's happening in this room.</i>

2221
01:56:17,644 --> 01:56:19,813
<i>- Everything.
</i>- ...gun from the Committee of the Five.

2222
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:22,608
He called you by your
name, Tom, with pride.

2223
01:56:22,774 --> 01:56:25,611
- I don't know that man.
- We just fought that man for our lives.

2224
01:56:25,777 --> 01:56:27,988
Burt and I saw him push Liz Meekins.
He's the killer.

2225
01:56:28,947 --> 01:56:30,324
There is enough evidence.

2226
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:33,368
I am sorry to say that the man
who took a shot at General Dillenbeck...

2227
01:56:33,535 --> 01:56:37,122
on that stage tonight was the
same man on the boat with Meekins...

2228
01:56:37,289 --> 01:56:40,459
on a ticket purchased by your foundation.

2229
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:43,337
- There is no need to raise your voice.
- Yours, Mr. Voze.

2230
01:56:43,504 --> 01:56:45,339
- Tom, what's happening?
- What are the charges?

2231
01:56:45,506 --> 01:56:47,716
The charges are against you
and the guests you invited.

2232
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:49,801
- The Committee of the Five.
- For what?

2233
01:56:49,968 --> 01:56:51,011
Committee of the Five.

2234
01:56:51,178 --> 01:56:53,222
Conspiracy to bribe a
United States general.

2235
01:56:53,388 --> 01:56:55,474
Attempted assassination.

2236
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:57,768
Conspiracy to overthrow the US government.

2237
01:56:57,935 --> 01:57:00,562
Trading with dictators, Italy, Germany.

2238
01:57:00,729 --> 01:57:03,065
Two murders your foundation
apparently seems to be...

2239
01:57:03,232 --> 01:57:06,151
responsible for, Meekins and his daughter.

2240
01:57:06,318 --> 01:57:07,736
Tom, did you do this?

2241
01:57:07,903 --> 01:57:08,946
I felt it was wrong...

2242
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:11,865
that Meekins died.
That was a tragic theft of a life.

2243
01:57:12,533 --> 01:57:14,326
But something had to be done...

2244
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:18,205
because he didn't see the opportunity
of the new ways to live.

2245
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:20,499
He didn't understand.
Meekins didn't understand.

2246
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:23,168
- Do you understand that?
- All right. You need to slow it down.

2247
01:57:23,794 --> 01:57:27,005
Tom, please tell me you didn't have
anything to do with my medication.

2248
01:57:27,172 --> 01:57:29,758
Tom influenced your doctor, Valerie...

2249
01:57:29,925 --> 01:57:31,760
as he had done with your mother before.

2250
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:37,975
- Is that true?
- A little.

2251
01:57:38,392 --> 01:57:41,603
- A little?
- I did it for your own good.

2252
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:44,648
- You poisoned me?
- If that's what you want to call it...

2253
01:57:44,815 --> 01:57:45,816
fine.

2254
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:49,987
I was looking after
you, your best interests.

2255
01:57:50,153 --> 01:57:52,656
You're reckless, like a child.

2256
01:57:53,365 --> 01:57:56,493
Listen to me.
You're running around all over Europe...

2257
01:57:57,077 --> 01:57:59,037
and saying bad things about the war?

2258
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:01,957
Consorting with a Black man.

2259
01:58:03,208 --> 01:58:06,253
Consorting with a man, a free man...

2260
01:58:07,045 --> 01:58:10,674
in Amsterdam, that fought for you!

2261
01:58:10,841 --> 01:58:12,926
Like the clinics, Tom?

2262
01:58:13,135 --> 01:58:14,178
What clinics?

2263
01:58:14,344 --> 01:58:15,846
Committee of the Five.

2264
01:58:16,013 --> 01:58:17,931
You know what clinics
I'm talking about, Tom.

2265
01:58:18,098 --> 01:58:19,641
Forced sterilization.

2266
01:58:19,808 --> 01:58:20,934
We'll see about that.

2267
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:23,145
We saw the Committee of the Five symbol...

2268
01:58:23,312 --> 01:58:25,314
- there.
- Stop lying!

2269
01:58:26,148 --> 01:58:29,151
<i>That Tom had an angle was no surprise,
but the horror of it...</i>

2270
01:58:29,776 --> 01:58:32,321
<i>My God. Right under Valerie's nose.</i>

2271
01:58:32,487 --> 01:58:35,490
<i>They kept her distracted
with the invented condition.</i>

2272
01:58:36,366 --> 01:58:38,994
<i>Goering, Hitler's right-hand man...</i>

2273
01:58:39,161 --> 01:58:41,121
<i>and Hitler himself.</i>

2274
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,999
<i>Most people didn't even
know who he was yet.</i>

2275
01:58:45,334 --> 01:58:48,712
<i>Tom even paid Goering to write a column
in the Jeffers papers...</i>

2276
01:58:48,879 --> 01:58:51,715
{\an8}<i>about the new Aryan government.
Whatever that was.</i>

2277
01:58:54,676 --> 01:58:58,180
{\an8}<i>Tom had just finished the topiary
with the symbol.</i>

2278
01:58:58,347 --> 01:59:00,933
<i>You couldn't see it except from above.</i>

2279
01:59:01,975 --> 01:59:05,103
<i>I mean, you gotta be some kind of
super-fanatic believer...</i>

2280
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:06,939
<i>to make your bushes like that.</i>

2281
01:59:07,105 --> 01:59:09,107
- Don't you look at me like that, Libby.
- Valerie, darling.

2282
01:59:09,566 --> 01:59:11,902
All great societies are built this way.

2283
01:59:12,528 --> 01:59:14,696
You live in a dream world
with your strange sculptures.

2284
01:59:14,863 --> 01:59:17,950
And that's fine. You can have that.
But it won't make the world go round.

2285
01:59:18,116 --> 01:59:22,663
I'm very happy to be unimportant and
live in a place that has love and beauty.

2286
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:24,623
Art and love...

2287
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:27,000
that's what makes the life worth living...

2288
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:31,755
while you're building this big, gigantic,
terrifying future.

2289
01:59:32,506 --> 01:59:34,466
What a waste of your imagination.

2290
01:59:34,633 --> 01:59:37,010
I made plenty, for us...

2291
01:59:37,177 --> 01:59:38,637
rebuilding Germany.

2292
01:59:39,304 --> 01:59:42,057
I wanted to stand with
the strongest leaders in the world.

2293
01:59:42,724 --> 01:59:45,143
But I'm also happy to
go to war against them.

2294
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:48,605
<i>Another war? But we just did all that.</i>

2295
01:59:49,898 --> 01:59:51,316
<i>You mean to tell me...</i>

2296
01:59:51,483 --> 01:59:54,194
<i>these rich guys will support dictators...</i>

2297
01:59:54,361 --> 01:59:55,904
<i>or fight them?</i>

2298
01:59:56,071 --> 01:59:59,074
<i>They believe in nothing but making money.</i>

2299
01:59:59,241 --> 02:00:01,285
<i>And that's why Meekins was killed...</i>

2300
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:05,873
<i>because he wouldn't go along with that
or support it? Insanity!</i>

2301
02:00:06,498 --> 02:00:08,792
<i>And we have walked right into it.</i>

2302
02:00:08,959 --> 02:00:10,627
No. Oh, no, no, no.

2303
02:00:11,628 --> 02:00:15,215
<i>Tom quickly saw us as his best chance
to get the general.</i>

2304
02:00:15,799 --> 02:00:18,844
If you got someone like Gil Dillenbeck
involved with your event...

2305
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:20,429
it would help me to get involved.

2306
02:00:20,596 --> 02:00:22,681
So, you need someone? You always...
He always needs someone...

2307
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:25,434
- Valerie, would you give it a rest?
- ...in front of him.

2308
02:00:25,767 --> 02:00:28,437
You thought you'd use these men to get me.

2309
02:00:28,604 --> 02:00:30,981
But I used them and their event...

2310
02:00:31,148 --> 02:00:34,526
to reveal you and stop your plan
for at least a decade.

2311
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:37,154
Maybe two or three more, hopefully.

2312
02:00:38,155 --> 02:00:40,282
<i>We did stop the plot.</i>

2313
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:42,910
<i>This is true.</i>

2314
02:00:45,245 --> 02:00:47,289
<i>The Committee of the Five...</i>

2315
02:00:47,456 --> 02:00:49,041
<i>didn't get their American dictator.</i>

2316
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:51,460
<i>I appeared before
the congressional committee...</i>

2317
02:00:51,627 --> 02:00:54,171
<i>the highest representation
of the American people...</i>

2318
02:00:54,338 --> 02:00:55,964
<i>under subpoena to tell what I knew of...</i>

2319
02:00:56,131 --> 02:00:58,217
<i>The general testified to Congress...</i>

2320
02:00:58,383 --> 02:01:01,136
<i>and they agreed he was right.</i>

2321
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:04,473
<i>What do powerful people want?</i>

2322
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,433
<i>Is it never enough?</i>

2323
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:08,894
<i>They do the craziest things.</i>

2324
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,444
Oh, my God! What's the matter with you?

2325
02:01:17,611 --> 02:01:19,988
- What the hell did you do?
- Oh, my God! Valerie, what have you done?

2326
02:01:20,155 --> 02:01:21,698
What's the matter with
you? What did you do?

2327
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:24,159
We had everything we needed to prosecute...

2328
02:01:24,326 --> 02:01:25,786
and now it's all out the window!

2329
02:01:25,953 --> 02:01:27,246
It's a huge problem now.

2330
02:01:27,412 --> 02:01:28,497
Yes, well done.

2331
02:01:28,705 --> 02:01:32,292
Tom, my face. She ruined my face!

2332
02:01:33,418 --> 02:01:36,296
I couldn't help it. They're so awful.

2333
02:01:36,463 --> 02:01:37,881
Woman, have you lost your mind?

2334
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,675
- I told you she was trouble.
- Yeah, that was...

2335
02:01:39,842 --> 02:01:41,844
- rather stupid, Valerie.
- You could go to jail, Valerie.

2336
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:43,637
Tell them the truth, Harold.

2337
02:01:47,099 --> 02:01:49,893
Are you all right, Valerie? You're shaking.

2338
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:54,773
Oh, I'm fine. I was just thinking about
shooting Tom and Libby in the face.

2339
02:01:55,524 --> 02:01:57,401
I won't do it. Don't worry.

2340
02:01:57,568 --> 02:01:58,986
Well, that's a good decision. Thank God.

2341
02:01:59,152 --> 02:02:01,280
Yes, it would've bollocksed everything.
We'd have no case.

2342
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:04,491
<i>You have to stand up
to them, as we had done.</i>

2343
02:02:04,658 --> 02:02:07,160
<i>And you have to live your truth.</i>

2344
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,081
I love Harold.

2345
02:02:11,248 --> 02:02:13,750
He's given me
the greatest happiness of my life...

2346
02:02:13,917 --> 02:02:15,294
as has Burt.

2347
02:02:27,264 --> 02:02:29,558
<i>There it is. Look at that.</i>

2348
02:02:30,184 --> 02:02:33,395
<i>That's how you face such a world.</i>

2349
02:02:33,562 --> 02:02:37,024
<i>You must have love in your heart
for your life.</i>

2350
02:02:38,066 --> 02:02:40,986
<i>It is love versus hate.</i>

2351
02:02:41,653 --> 02:02:44,448
<i>I love my life and the people in it.</i>

2352
02:02:45,949 --> 02:02:47,659
<i>Even Beatrice.</i>

2353
02:02:47,826 --> 02:02:50,996
<i>And clear, not Portuguese,
I'm-in-love-with-her Irma.</i>

2354
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:52,414
<i>Milton.</i>

2355
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:55,167
<i>Shirley at the office with Morty.</i>

2356
02:02:55,959 --> 02:02:58,420
<i>The tapestry. Everything in it.</i>

2357
02:02:59,213 --> 02:03:00,964
<i>Even my glass eye.</i>

2358
02:03:01,131 --> 02:03:02,174
<i>Dillenbeck's dog...</i>

2359
02:03:02,341 --> 02:03:04,426
<i>and the bouillabaisse
we didn't get to have.</i>

2360
02:03:05,594 --> 02:03:09,306
<i>Each one of us is given a tapestry,
our own opera.</i>

2361
02:03:09,473 --> 02:03:11,350
<i>This person and this person.</i>

2362
02:03:11,517 --> 02:03:12,935
<i>Thinking about it.</i>

2363
02:03:14,311 --> 02:03:18,357
<i>Love is not enough.
You got to fight to protect kindness.</i>

2364
02:03:19,233 --> 02:03:21,860
<i>You get attached to people and things.</i>

2365
02:03:23,028 --> 02:03:26,949
<i>And they might just break your heart.
But that's being alive.</i>

2366
02:03:28,784 --> 02:03:32,496
<i>My back brace that I so disliked
had saved me from this bullet.</i>

2367
02:03:32,663 --> 02:03:34,122
You lucky bastard.

2368
02:03:34,289 --> 02:03:35,499
<i>And we three...</i>

2369
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:38,252
<i>- had helped stop this terrible plot.
</i>- I can't believe that.

2370
02:03:38,418 --> 02:03:42,798
<i>Burt Berendsen, Harold Woodman,
and Valerie Voze.</i>

2371
02:03:43,382 --> 02:03:45,050
Jerks, Nevins...

2372
02:03:45,217 --> 02:03:49,429
<i>Tom would not stay arrested long.
Those people never do.</i>

2373
02:03:49,596 --> 02:03:51,598
Talk to my lawyer. You'll see.

2374
02:03:52,391 --> 02:03:55,853
<i>Committee of the Five
never faced any charges.</i>

2375
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:59,231
<i>They disappeared, as they can do.</i>

2376
02:03:59,898 --> 02:04:02,359
<i>Tom and his friends smeared the general.</i>

2377
02:04:04,069 --> 02:04:07,865
<i>It was a warning
of what they were capable of.</i>

2378
02:04:09,992 --> 02:04:13,745
<i>Maguire died mysteriously at the age of 37.</i>

2379
02:04:13,912 --> 02:04:15,622
<i>He knew too much.</i>

2380
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:17,666
<i>Valerie and Harold...</i>

2381
02:04:17,833 --> 02:04:19,918
<i>were no longer safe in this country.</i>

2382
02:04:23,422 --> 02:04:25,591
<i>Friends for life means friends for life.</i>

2383
02:04:26,925 --> 02:04:28,552
<i>You do whatever it takes.</i>

2384
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:30,929
<i>We had to get them
on a boat that very night.</i>

2385
02:04:37,519 --> 02:04:38,937
Woodman, you should...

2386
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:41,982
Thank you, Henry. I'm way ahead of you.
I made my decision.

2387
02:04:42,441 --> 02:04:43,942
Harold's coming with me.

2388
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:45,652
No, you're coming with me.

2389
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:47,487
No, you're coming with me.

2390
02:04:49,239 --> 02:04:50,782
You'll be seeing me again,
Dr. Berendsen...

2391
02:04:50,949 --> 02:04:53,869
because history repeats itself.

2392
02:04:54,036 --> 02:04:56,496
Goodbye, old friend.
We'll see you in Amsterdam.

2393
02:04:57,206 --> 02:05:00,375
- Oh, no. You're not going to Amsterdam.
- What?

2394
02:05:00,542 --> 02:05:04,338
It's only a matter of time
before the Gestapo kicks down your door.

2395
02:05:05,047 --> 02:05:06,715
What's the Gestapo?

2396
02:05:06,882 --> 02:05:08,383
Yeah, you don't wanna know.

2397
02:05:09,134 --> 02:05:11,553
We'll send you somewhere safer.

2398
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:13,889
Beautiful weather this time of year.

2399
02:05:14,056 --> 02:05:16,350
And the blue-headed
vireo migration to boot.

2400
02:05:16,517 --> 02:05:18,227
Yes. It's spectacular bird country.

2401
02:05:18,393 --> 02:05:19,478
- Isn't it, though?
- Really.

2402
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:20,854
- Yeah.
- I'm jealous.

2403
02:05:21,939 --> 02:05:25,275
- Burt.
- Burt, why don't you come with us?

2404
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:28,654
I choose to stay.

2405
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:31,323
Who knows? Maybe I'll find a new life...

2406
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:33,784
- and a new love.
- I hope so.

2407
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:38,247
Because when it comes to love,
there's nothing quite so good as clarity.

2408
02:05:38,956 --> 02:05:39,957
I agree.

2409
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:44,419
<i>I stayed to stand up for my country
so that one day...</i>

2410
02:05:44,586 --> 02:05:47,297
<i>my best friends could come back.</i>

2411
02:05:51,009 --> 02:05:52,135
Goodbye, Burt.

2412
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:58,517
<i>Au revoir,</i> my good friend.

2413
02:06:01,812 --> 02:06:03,522
Be happy, Burt!

2414
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:08,026
- Henry. Paul. General.
- Thank you.

2415
02:06:08,193 --> 02:06:09,862
- Farewell for now.
- Milton.

2416

<i>Part of me wished I
did run with my friends.</i>

2417
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:19,288

2418
