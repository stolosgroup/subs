00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,393
<i>This is Free City.</i>

4
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:59,565
<i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i>

5
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:02,902
<i>And the people who wear
sunglasses are heroes.</i>

6
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,946
<i>They have a devil-may-care
attitude and they run this town.</i>

7
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:17,749
You are so hot.

8
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:18,785
Oh, I know.

9
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:24,589
<i>See?
That's not even his car.</i>

10
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,093
<i>Or his wife.</i>

11
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,468
<i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i>

12
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,537
<i>They go on
all sorts of missions.</i>

13
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,207
<i>They got cool hair,
cool clothes.</i>

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,611
<i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i>

15
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,648
<i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i>

16
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,550
<i>Or that nice lady.</i>

17
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:09,768
<i>See what I mean? Hero.</i>

18
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:29,155
<i>My name is Guy,
and I live in paradise.</i>

19
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,795
Good morning, Goldie.

20
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:39,966
<i>I've lived here in Free City
my whole life.</i>

21
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,567
<i>I've got a best friend,
I've got a goldfish,</i>

22
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,238
<i>and I work at the bank.</i>

23
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,806
<i>What more could a guy want?</i>

24
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,207
<i>Sunday
should be warm and sunny</i>

25
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,776
<i>with just a scattering
of drive-bys.</i>

26
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:52,211
<i>Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,</i>

27
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:54,479
<i>which will be mined and
sprayed with high-caliber fire</i>

28
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:56,082
<i>from a renegade
gunship stolen by...</i>

29
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,016
<i>And every morning,</i>

30
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,219
<i>I start my day
with the most delicious coffee</i>

31
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:02,388
<i>in the whole,
wide, whole world.</i>

32
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,090
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

33
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,557
You know it. Mmm.

34
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,527
Mmm!

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,430
That is unexpectedly hot.

36
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:11,864
Jeez, that's good.

37
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,001
It's like losing my virginity,
but in my mouth.

38
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,405
Thank you for making
this with such love.

39
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,539
You're welcome.

40
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:21,707
Officer Johnny!

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,942
Have a good one, Guy.

42
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:26,346
Don't have a good day,
have a great day!

43
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,147
Hold the fudge.

44
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:31,985
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed
up those bad boys? Today is the day.

45
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,686
- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.

46
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,728
Oh! So close.

47
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,664
Mmm! This is the greatest
cup of coffee of all time.

48
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,265
I wanna write
a song about it.

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,235
I wanna dance to
that song with my body.

50
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,870
I love my life.

51
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,438
There's something about finding
your lane and just staying in it.

52
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,974
That's why they call 'em comfort
zones, they're so damn comfortable.

53
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,609
Oh, Joe!

54
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,147
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

55
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,182
- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.

56
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:09,588
<i>In Free City,
I have everything I need.</i>

57
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,257
Don't have a good day...

58
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,592
have a great day.

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,128
Thank you.

60
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,262
Take care.

61
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,032
<i>Except one thing.</i>

62
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,467
Seem happy.

63
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,735
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy.
You gonna find someone.

64
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,271
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

65
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:28,107
Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?

66
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,641
Maybe it's not meant to be.

67
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,377
Everybody down on the ground!

68
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:41,387
- I know the woman I'm looking for.
- Oh, let me guess.

69
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,456
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor.
- Sense of humor.

70
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,824
An obsession
with feel-good diva pop.

71
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,159
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

72
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:47,994
She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.

73
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,129
And you know what?
I don't want her to.

74
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,799
Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.

75
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,434
You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.

76
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,536
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.

77
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,237
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.

78
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,507
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

79
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,310
So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

80
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,578
Of course we're going for
beers on the beach after work.

81
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,081
That makes me
so happy.

82
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,182
Me too.

83
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,626
What have you got?

84
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,964
Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?

85
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,765
You got a video
or a screen grab?

86
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,632
Nope. But I know who does.

87
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,937
Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,605
Oh, wow. Ooh,
someone wants to play.

89
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,575
Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?

90
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,210
'Cause maybe we
could meet up later.

91
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:41,180
I don't have a burning desire to
see your mum's basement, thanks.

92
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,448
Got jokes, huh?

93
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,784
Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.

94
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:49,721
Don't know how you'll get in, but if
you do, clip 56 might interest you.

95
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,923
Now, I got a question.

96
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,459
What's so special
about this video clip anyway?

97
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,829
What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.

98
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,831
Mmm, I see. Fun.
Yeah, that's fun.

99
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:03,369
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

100
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,305
But seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?

101
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,875
Those are questions.

102
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,279
Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?

103
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,447
The 2:30?

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,082
No, the 4:00.

105
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,152
The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.

106
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:21,354
I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.

107
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:22,721
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

108
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:25,458
Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

109
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,591
Give it to me!

110
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:27,960
Looks like rain.

111
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,329
Has anyone seen my cat?

112
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,001
You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,

113
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:38,204
"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."

114
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:40,940
I mean, when you put it on there,
you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

115
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,052
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

116
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,220
Love that song.

117
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,091
That's a new one.

118
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:13,206
Hey!

119
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:16,175
That's her.

120
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,742
Her who?

121
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,679
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

122
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,279
She exists.

123
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,784
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

124
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:27,153
Wait, man.
She's wearing sunglasses.

125
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,222
So?

126
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:30,423
Whatcha mean "so?"

127
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,290
So, people with sunglasses
don't talk to people like us.

128
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,594
- You know that!
- I gotta try.

129
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,196
Look, Guy! Guy!

130
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,066
Guy! What about
beers on the beach?

131
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,402
Excuse me!

132
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:48,341
Hey!

133
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,942
Hey!

134
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,856
<i>Coming soon...</i> Free City 2!

138
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:13,199
You done?

139
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:15,701
Sorry. Are you closing?

140
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,869
Yes.

141
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,671
We usually don't
put the chairs on the tables,

142
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:21,140
one-small-coffee-
over-four-hours girl.

143
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:24,844
You really like that game, huh?
My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

144
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,712
Seems like everyone's
obsessed with it.

145
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,682
Oh, <i>Free City?</i> Ah. No.

146
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,184
I, uh, have a lawsuit
against the publisher

147
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,986
and the evidence that I need
is in the game.

148
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,488
- So then I had my codes...
- Oh...

149
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,491
I wish we weren't closing so
I could hear more about this.

150
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,236
Good morning, Goldie.

151
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,044
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

152
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,147
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

153
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:07,620
Actually, I think I'd like
to try a cappuccino today.

154
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,157
Ooh. "Cappuccino."
I enjoy saying that.

155
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,759
It's like a waterfall
made of letters.

156
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:14,960
Excuse me?

157
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,196
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

158
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:20,266
- Please.
- But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

159
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,401
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.

160
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,903
Every day. Always.

161
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,138
- Well, I...
- Somebody's about to get shot.

162
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,474
Officer Johnny.

163
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:31,877
I just thought I'd try something
different today, you know?

164
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,513
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

165
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:39,185
Hi.

166
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,556
Ha! I'm just keeping
you on your toes.

167
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,859
Coffee, cream,
two sugars, please.

168
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,795
I'm joking.

169
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,797
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

170
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,331
He was just kidding!

171
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,534
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?

172
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:56,769
No way, no how.

173
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:59,405
Mmm. That's hot.

174
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:03,008
It's like Jesus
washed my tongue...

175
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,911
but right before he finished,
he finally told my dad,

176
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:08,647
"He's good enough."

177
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,551
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

178
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,586
Have a good one, Guy.

179
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,258
Cappuccino.

180
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:23,195
Don't have a good day...

181
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,031
...have a great day, I guess.

182
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:30,169
Okay. Good day to you.

183
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:33,139
Everybody down on the ground!

184
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:36,008
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

185
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,002
That's the girl.

186
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,403
We've been over this.

187
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,071
You tried to talk to her
yesterday, it didn't work.

188
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:07,740
It will never work.

189
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,041
She's wearing sunglasses.

190
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,509
We don't mess with
the sunglasses people.

191
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,578
Maybe I'll get
some sunglasses of my own.

192
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,914
What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

193
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,514
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

194
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:17,483
Hi.

195
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,651
What'd you say?

196
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,287
Hi.

197
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,790
I'm gonna need
your sunglasses.

198
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:24,925
Ooh. Ow.

199
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:26,125
I'm just gonna...

200
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,426
I'm gonna need your
sunglasses for a sec.

201
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,929
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

202
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,095
Go back to your side, man.

203
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,364
He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother...

204
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,200
Okay, just need to borrow them
for a sec, okay?

205
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,769
- Back off! I said, don't!
- Just real quick. Real quick.

206
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,538
Stop!

207
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,842
You broken or somethin'?

208
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:42,943
I'm the robber!

209
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,743
You're the guy who lies down
and takes it!

210
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:45,946
Please, just stay down!

211
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,949
I said, stay down!

212
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,316
Guy, you don't do this, man.

213
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:52,718
This isn't you.

214
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,153
You don't do this.

215
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,722
Maybe I do.

216
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:59,425
What is wrong with this...

217
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,559
stupid mission?

218
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:01,894
I told you to smoke his ass.

219
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,028
Let go!

220
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:04,865
I'll give them right back.

221
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:06,800
I said...

222
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,571
Guy?

223
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:18,911
He's just resting.

224
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,012
In pieces!

225
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,714
That man is dead!

226
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,616
He's so sleepy.

227
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,553
I'm just gonna
put your gun down...

228
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,688
right here...

229
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,757
for when you wake.

230
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,059
- Okay?
- Guy.

231
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:37,296
Guy! Where you goin'?

232
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,562
Excuse me.

233
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,565
Do you see this?

234
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:15,401
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

235
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,489
Whoo!

236
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:39,758
Oh!

237
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,160
Giddy up!

238
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,295
I feel brand new.

239
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:55,875
<i>Loser.</i>

240
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,685
What is happening?

241
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,256
So much money.

242
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,779
Hey, Mouser,
check this out.

243
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,047
What's up, Keys?

244
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,314
What am I looking at?

245
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:38,084
Okay, so this user,
he gets his glasses stolen

246
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,251
and then killed.

247
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,253
The guy was smoked
by a non-playable character.

248
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,188
An NPC? That's impossible.

249
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:44,657
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,926
Nobody can equip an NPC skin
on their avatar.

251
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,097
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass
noob and ban him for life, you're done.

252
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,265
I tried that, but I...

253
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:54,968
I can't trace him.

254
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,170
Whoever it is,
they're good.

255
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:01,540
Hmm. You gotta be better
at your job, buddy.

256
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,110
I'm pretty good.

257
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,310
I'll see you on the inside.

258
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:06,445
<i>Select your skin.</i>

259
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,480
Hey, Keys, what skin
are you going with?

260
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,349
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,

261
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:11,717
big guns, bigger mustache.

262
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,485
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel.
I like it.

263
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,587
Almost scared to ask,
but what are you going with?

264
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,324
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

265
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,893
I'm terrified.

266
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,394
Let's do this.

267
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,264
Seriously, man.

268
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:02,501
I'm just being honest, I think the
bunny suit is just a little much.

269
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,004
Excuse me?

270
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,974
Right.

271
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,375
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

272
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,913
Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

273
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:14,981
Let's go!

274
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,248
Uh-huh.
Captain Khakis.

275
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,283
- Come here. Come on, bud.
- Go, let's go.

276
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,086
- Closer.
- There he is.

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,754
Blue shirt guy.

278
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,622
Blue shirt?

279
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,324
Yes.

280
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,392
Hello, Officer.

281
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:29,394
Rabbit.

282
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,729
Nice skin.

283
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,166
Thank you. That's sweet.

284
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,500
How'd you get it?

285
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:38,071
Well, uh, mostly genetics,
I think. I'm pretty lucky.

286
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:39,839
I have naturally dewy skin.

287
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,207
Listen up, Neutrogena.

288
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,342
You know you can't go around looking
like that. The rules are clear.

289
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,609
And another thing.

290
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,146
- You can't hack the NPC avatars.
- No, sir!

291
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,379
- It screws up the mission load...
- Screws it up!

292
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:48,613
...and it makes
the game look bad.

293
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,083
- Horrible!
- Yeah.

294
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,185
I got, like, 5% of that.

295
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:53,787
Lose the skin!

296
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,887
I... Lose?

297
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,923
How am I supposed to
get rid of my skin?

298
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:57,824
Take it off, man.

299
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,391
Just take it off.
What are you doing?

300
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:00,592
- What?
- Seriously.

301
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,162
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

302
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,395
- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.

303
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,730
If you don't,
we're gonna kill you.

304
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,632
- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.

305
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:07,599
Still why?

306
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,135
Until we do
find out who you are...

307
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,736
and then we're
gonna ban you for life.

308
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,107
Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.

309
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,542
I just find the order of
those threats very confusing.

310
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,278
- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up

311
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,896
No.

312
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,373
Come on, Blue Shirt.

313
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:11,064
Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?

314
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,298
Scared me a little bit.

315
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,800
We're coming
for you, Blue Shirt!

316
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,301
Coming to get ya.

317
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,036
We're coming to get ya.

318
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,605
Wait! Wait!

319
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,041
I can explain everything.

320
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:25,878
I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.

321
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:29,048
Things that... Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

322
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,582
Except they are there.

323
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:34,720
I know that sounds crazy,
but it's true!

324
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,991
You can run, Blue Shirt,
but you cannot hide.

325
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,659
Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

326
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,862
We're apex predators.

327
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:46,732
All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.

328
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,501
Too high! Too high!

329
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,014
Oh, you wanna play,
Blue Shirt? Watch this.

330
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:05,084
I tire of these games, Keys.
It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

331
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,286
Okay, bring it.

332
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,121
Oh, it's brung.
Go, go, go, go, go.

333
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,038
I'm so, so good at this.

334
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,114
Time's up, bank teller!

335
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:58,171
Nope!

336
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:23,830
I can't die!

337
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:25,764
I'm never gonna die!

338
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,000
Whoo!

339
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,103
And that was the heartbreaking
story of Blue Shirt Guy.

340
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,304
The end.

341
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,473
- Doesn't make sense.
- What?

342
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,041
I just checked
the server stats.

343
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,275
We killed Blue Shirt and the number
of players online didn't change.

344
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,378
It's just a glitch, man.

345
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,711
- It's not a big deal.
- I know, I know.

346
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,414
It just seems like that's something
new, you know?

347
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,647
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

348
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,451
I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?

349
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:46,918
Uh-uh. No.

350
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,222
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care

351
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:52,290
or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.

352
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,294
So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.

353
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:59,832
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT
genius, indie game designer?

354
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,368
What are you doing down here
dealing with complaints?

355
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:06,571
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic
story involving failed dreams,

356
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,775
desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

357
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:11,044
You do not wanna
hear about that.

358
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,378
You're absolutely right.

359
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:16,516
That story sounds horrible and
boring and full of white privilege.

360
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,550
Don't talk to Antwan.

361
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,458
<i>We never dreamt
this would've happened.</i>

362
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,161
I mean, <i>Life Itself,</i>
it's essentially a fishbowl game.

363
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:32,031
People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.

364
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,900
It's a strictly
observational experience

365
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,769
where computer generated
characters interact and evolve.

366
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,539
I thought we'd be
lucky to give it away.

367
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:44,444
That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.

368
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,012
Uh, no, Millie
is the genius.

369
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,782
Uh, she built the AI engine
from the ground up.

370
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,184
So, to get a little personal,

371
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,386
what's the thing that
gets you up in the morning?

372
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,055
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

373
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:58,524
What's the other thing?

374
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, yeah. An insatiable
thirst for validation.

375
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,661
- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.

376
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,930
How about you?

377
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:05,531
- Code.
- Code?

378
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:06,598
- Code.
- Code, yeah.

379
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,201
Here we go.

380
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,136
'Cause it's not just zeros and
ones, it's hidden messages.

381
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,538
I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.

382
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:17,176
I just use zeros and ones instead of
words 'cause words will let you down.

383
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,781
But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

384
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:23,615
- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.

385
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:25,218
Now, I've gotta ask.

386
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,520
There is a lot of chemistry
between the two of you.

387
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:30,456
- Has this evolved into more than...
- No.

388
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,126
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.

389
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,693
- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.

390
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:36,129
And now your game is gonna
be released by Soonami,

391
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:37,797
one of the biggest publishers
in the world.

392
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,799
- <i>It's crazy, actually.</i>
- <i>It is, yeah.</i>

393
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,934
<i>It does seem a little bit like
an unlikely pairing, though.</i>

394
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:45,037
<i>Yeah, I didn't
totally get it either.</i>

395
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,772
<i>But Millie's got a real
instinct for these things...</i>

396
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:49,242
<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

397
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:52,711
<i>He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.</i>

398
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,981
<i>It's a chance for our work to
be seen by a wider audience.</i>

399
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,083
- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.

400
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,118
So we're breaking
and entering now?

401
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:02,855
How does it feel working for a
galactic black hole of frozen shit?

402
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,956
You have to leave.
I can't talk to you.

403
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,758
Aw, shame will
have that effect.

404
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,361
No, Millie. I mean
I can't talk to you.

405
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:10,863
I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects

406
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:14,666
because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

407
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,470
Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?

408
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:19,172
No, he bought it and
then he shelved it.

409
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:22,508
All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

410
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,708
How can I move on?

411
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,144
How can you?

412
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:28,147
Antwan swiped our AI engine
to use in his dumb shooter.

413
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,851
Did he, Millie?
Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

414
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:34,420
Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting

415
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:37,957
and <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular,
but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

416
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,959
Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.

417
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:42,694
- Millie, I'm...
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

418
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,363
And now he's lying about it

419
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,399
so he doesn't have to give us the credit
and the royalties that we deserve.

420
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,766
Millie...

421
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,002
I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

422
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:53,639
All I need from you
is to get me in there.

423
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,075
Millie, I care about you...

424
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,181
but you need to leave.

425
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,458
Today is gonna
be different, Goldie.

426
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:14,987
What are we lookin' at?

427
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:17,757
Who are you?

428
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,458
Okay, okay. Okay.

429
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:22,061
We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.

430
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,029
Oh, yeah.

431
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:25,798
I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

432
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,834
I waited outside
by the murder train,

433
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,369
then I followed you.

434
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,404
Shit!

435
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,187
Should I come with you?

436
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:50,589
Yes.

437
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:54,260
Holy hell, what just happened?

438
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:57,029
What just happened
is you almost blew my mission.

439
00:25:57,063 --> 00:26:00,333
No, I mean, how did we get
from there to wherever this is?

440
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:01,933
You mean the portal gun?

441
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,736
Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

442
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,971
Wow, you are a
special kind of noob.

443
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,340
Thank you. You too.

444
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:08,474
Turn around.

445
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,509
Okay.

446
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,980
Oh.

447
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:20,585
Is this the North Pole?

448
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,054
Listen, dude.

449
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,824
- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.

450
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:25,524
Props on the NPC outfit,

451
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,394
but I'm busy trying to figure
out how to steal something.

452
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:30,329
Maybe I could help you.

453
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,497
I work alone.

454
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,932
You have beautiful grenades.

455
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,935
Besides, if you want to have any
chance of making an impact here,

456
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:38,037
you need to have
a higher level than that.

457
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,905
- That's tough. No.
- No.

458
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:41,540
Higher level?

459
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:42,942
Good Lord, rook.

460
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,644
See?

461
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,646
- Oh.
- That's mine.

462
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,415
And that's yours.

463
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:53,787
Oh... What,
is one the best or the worst?

464
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,321
There is literally
nothing lower.

465
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,456
Well, how do I get
to a higher level?

466
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,425
- Really?
- Really.

467
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:03,629
- You know, get stuff.
- Yeah.

468
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,664
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Okay.

469
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:06,932
- Experience, guns...
- Yeah.

470
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,000
- Put that down.
- Uh-huh.

471
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,469
Money. This is Free City.

472
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,605
You could rob a store,
carjack someone,

473
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:15,007
punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

474
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,576
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

475
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:23,916
Hmm. I've got to admit
that is kind of refreshing.

476
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:28,120
Sometimes I forget not everyone you
meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

477
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:30,356
Thank you.

478
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:33,058
Wait. But the world
isn't that bad though, is it?

479
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:36,362
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

480
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:39,098
If you ever met the dick responsible
for this world, you'd agree.

481
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:42,968
Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

482
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,171
And he's a dick?

483
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:48,040
His name's Antwan, and yes,
he's an absolute troll.

484
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,776
Trolls exist?

485
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,379
Look, I don't know
if anybody does it,

486
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:56,382
but you could rack experience
points up by being a good guy.

487
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,451
- Like a hero.
- Ooh. Easy, tiger.

488
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:00,753
If you don't wanna shoot people,
you could steal their guns.

489
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,388
All that shit makes
your level go up.

490
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:03,824
Go be the good guy.

491
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:05,124
Okay. No, I'm gonna
be the great guy.

492
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,459
Ooh! Ooh.

493
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,829
Okay, well, enjoy your
lifetime supply of virginity.

494
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,162
Off you go.

495
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,198
Okay. Wait! How will I know
that I've leveled up enough?

496
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:15,067
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
- Whoa.

497
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,102
- Bye now.
- That's so much more than one.

498
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:18,471
- It's like 99 more...
- Bye now.

499
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,505
Okay.

500
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,444
Hi.

501
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,606
Thanks, Guy.

502
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,061
Good morning, Goldie.

503
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:51,430
Good morning, Goldie.

504
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,299
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

505
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:56,970
<i>I have three words for you.

but he's out-skilling all these players.

00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,355
<i>I don't know, but he's good.</i>

513
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:18,657
<i>Yeah, he's good.
He looks like an NPC</i>

- Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

519
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:31,972
You're
absolutely right.

520
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:37,043
Blue Shirt Guy.
Who is he or she indeed?

521
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:53,258
Whoo-hoo!

522
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:05,657
There's a worldwide craze that has
captured kids' hearts-- Blue Shirt Guy!

523
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,367
Hello, Hinata.

524
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,536
You have a great outfit.

525
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,954
Don't have a good day,

526
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,539
Have a GREAT day!

527
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,458
Crazy awesome!!!

528
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:59,993
Well, well, well. Look who decided
to come to work today, huh?

529
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:02,594
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you...

530
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:04,763
What is this shirt?

531
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,298
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?

532
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,802
And it's not tucked in.
You look sloppy.

533
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:11,670
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?

534
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,173
Or is somebody outside
pumping you up?

535
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,208
I'm sorry that I haven't
been around, Bud.

536
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,676
I've been figuring
some stuff out.

537
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,847
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.

538
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,715
Okay? You go to bed,
you wake up,

539
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,516
you get some coffee,
then you come to work.

540
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,251
And then you repeat
the same thing tomorrow.

541
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,154
- The girl.
- Oh, my God.

542
00:32:28,188 --> 00:32:29,455
I talked to her.
I talked to her.

543
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:32,158
- The one with the sunglasses?
- The sunglasses, yes!

544
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,893
I talked to one of
the sunglass people

545
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:36,796
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

546
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,297
Me.

547
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,033
Everybody
down on the ground!

548
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,500
You're so hot.

549
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,470
What if I could tell you
that you could be more?

550
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:45,939
Your life could be fuller.

551
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:48,174
That you're free to make your
own decisions. Your own choices.

552
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,241
Yo, dumbass.

553
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:50,777
We are in the middle
of something.

554
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:52,578
Uh...

555
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:55,214
- That's my gun.
- Quiet time.

556
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:58,650
These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

557
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:00,619
Come on now,
you know we don't wear sunglasses.

558
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:04,456
We do now.

559
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,093
<i>Mine now.</i>

560
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,660
Are you kidding me?

561
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,698
- Put 'em on.
- No.

562
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:14,868
Life doesn't have to be something
that just happens to us. All right?

563
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,971
Just put the glasses on
and you're gonna see.

564
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,671
You're gonna see.

565
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:23,977
Come on.

566
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,478
I can't, okay?

567
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:29,614
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:38,258
I'm keeping these,
asshole mouth.

569
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,794
Now get out of here.
Go be nicer.

570
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,862
Beat it. Go, go, go.

571
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,496
Don't walk, run.

572
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,866
And you...

573
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,001
Ugh.

574
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,735
Sorry.

575
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:53,072
Um, you could do so much
better than that guy.

576
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:56,375
You could be with,
like, a good guy.

577
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,611
Or maybe I don't have
to be with any guy.

578
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:02,248
Right? Exactly.
Most of them are awful.

579
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:04,083
- They really are.
- Terrible.

580
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,484
Yeah, do whatever
you wanna do.

581
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,359
You're my best friend, Buddy.

582
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:16,695
And you don't
have to be scared.

583
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:19,665
If you change your mind,
I'll be around.

584
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,107
Yo, Keys, our
Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

585
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,176
I know.

586
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,677
Who is this guy?

587
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,308
I'm here.

588
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,077
<i>I really appreciate
this, Keys.</i>

589
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,979
Okay. Just to be clear,

590
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:08,982
all I'm doing right now
is opening the door.

591
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:12,384
If this clip really does prove that
Antwan reused our code illegally,

592
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,618
go find it and get out.

593
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,125
Player's doing the jewelry
store mission in midtown.

594
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,726
That gives you 5 minutes.

595
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,463
<i>And go.</i>

596
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,975
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

597
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,243
<i>Really?</i>

598
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:38,644
I'm sitting on the toilet right
now, stealing user codes,

599
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,512
so I don't exactly
feel like one.

600
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:41,981
Oh, you never have.

601
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,150
Good thing I know better.

602
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,552
<i>All right. The clip you're looking
for should be on the wall to your left.</i>

603
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:49,488
- Thanks for the assist.
- <i>You got it.</i>

604
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:51,057
<i>I hope it has the proof
you're looking for.</i>

605
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,817
Keys! I need your help!

606
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,651
He's got that place
booby-trapped with spawn points.

607
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:20,954
Millie, I can't help you.

608
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,675
Blue Shirt Guy?

609
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:47,579
It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.

610
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:51,050
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.

611
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:00,026
What are you doing here?

612
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,761
I was trying to steal a video
clip, now we're trying not to die.

613
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:04,931
Who are you talking to?

614
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:10,136
You know, that player
in the NPC skin.

615
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:12,537
Millie, there are no other
players in that house.

616
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:16,042
That actually hurt my hand.

617
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,143
Get down!

618
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,895
I'm sorry!
Oh, God!

619
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:14,699
We're doing great.

620
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,447
Wow!

621
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,150
We should definitely go!

622
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:33,886
Oh, shit!

623
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:43,296
- Is that a Glock in your pocket?
- No.

624
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,263
- What?
- It's two Glocks.

625
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,631
Oh!

626
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,968
I don't suppose
this thing can fly.

627
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,236
No.

628
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:24,337
Jump.

629
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,205
Wow!

630
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:30,076
Whoa!

631
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:39,684
Oh, shit.

632
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,202
Good morning, sheeple!

633
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,837
Oh, you are fired.

634
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,273
There is some concern with the bloody
zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

635
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,041
Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

636
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:03,242
It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition...

637
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,045
Speak. Which lawsuit
are we talking about?

638
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:08,781
Millie, Millie Rusk?
No sweat.

639
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,416
That will never see
the inside of a courtroom...

640
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,618
because she's got no proof and
her ex-partner works for me.

641
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:14,686
We're golden.

642
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,222
Antwan, hey. You look great.

643
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,823
Uh, I thought you were
still at Burning Man.

644
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:20,359
Oh, does it look like
I'm still at Burning Man?

645
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:21,460
You, you, you...

646
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,596
No. So, shut your stupid,
bearded face and listen.

647
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,399
You heard about the asshole running
around in the game who looks like an NPC?

648
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:29,202
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

649
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,672
Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.

650
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:35,808
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in <i>Free City 2.</i>

651
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:39,345
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some
upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

652
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:41,414
'Roid him out. Make him
a hitman or something.

653
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:44,584
Antwan, we're already way behind
porting over the skins from <i>Free City 1.</i>

654
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:46,118
Skins?
Don't even worry about that.

655
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,954
They won't be usable
in <i>Free City 2.</i>

656
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,721
Antwan,
you told the fans...

657
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:51,557
<i>Free City 2</i> is backwards compatible.
It was in the commercial.

658
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:53,925
You said there'd be the same
characters in the sequel.

659
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,330
Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

660
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,832
Listen, Antwan, the game
is already buggier than ever.

661
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,434
I got a stack of user
complaints, like a mile high.

662
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,069
Look, I know it sucks.

663
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:07,406
But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

664
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,710
I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

665
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:12,245
What?

666
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:14,513
Make an original? Why would I do
that when I could make a sequel?

667
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:15,581
A sequel.

668
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:16,983
So we can make it better?

669
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,885
IPs and sequels,
that is the thing that people want.

670
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,153
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

671
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,722
You love Kentucky
Fried Chicken, right?

672
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,323
- Mmm-hmm.
- No.

673
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,859
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

674
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:28,894
and I know that you love
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

675
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:30,429
why would I make
another restaurant called,

676
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:32,865
uh, I don't know,
"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

677
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:34,766
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie.
- Mmm-hmm. No sense.

678
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,038
What am I gonna give you? A sequel.
Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two.

679
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:41,474
Uh, yum.
Drop the deuce on him.

680
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,776
Come on. Come here. Come here.

681
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,244
I don't want you to stress

682
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:47,313
that glorious shampoo commercial
head of yours about it.

683
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:50,783
<i>Free City 2</i> is gonna
be jumunjious.

684
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,818
That's not a word.

685
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,254
You sure you don't wanna
bump up to programming?

686
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,125
I know you got
the brains for it.

687
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,560
No thanks. I'm good
right where I am.

688
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:08,000
Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

689
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:10,503
But all good with me if I
don't have to pay you more.

690
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:12,171
Antwan out.

691
00:42:22,783 --> 00:42:24,350
Who is this guy?

692
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:33,659
Wow!

693
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,328
I took your advice.

694
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,431
I leveled up.

695
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:40,833
Impressive.

696
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,370
Why are you
doing all of this?

697
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:48,541
You know, I guess
I felt... trapped.

698
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,310
You know, in my life.

699
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,379
I just felt so...

700
00:42:53,746 --> 00:42:55,214
Stuck.

701
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,985
Yeah. And then I saw you.

702
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:03,189
Then I saw you.

703
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:05,257
Who are you?

704
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:07,093
I'm Guy.

705
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,395
No, who are you really?

706
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,262
Still Guy.

707
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:15,101
All of this,
leveling up so fast.

708
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,703
Giving this whole
world the finger.

709
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:19,038
How are you pulling this off?

710
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:22,074
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

711
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:23,943
You work at Soonami, don't you?

712
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,779
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

713
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,513
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

714
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:31,884
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

715
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,486
Yes, I work at the bank.

716
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,654
Where did you get that skin?

717
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,557
It's always
sort of been there.

718
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:40,993
Why do people keep
asking me that question?

719
00:43:41,026 --> 00:43:43,028
I don't know, why do they?

720
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:49,201
No, no.
Not doing that. I...

721
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:51,670
What's happening right now?

722
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,639
I don't know,
but I don't buy it.

723
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,007
No.

724
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,976
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

725
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,444
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

726
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:00,112
Great.

727
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:01,714
We all have
our secrets, I guess.

728
00:44:01,747 --> 00:44:03,416
Yes, we do.

729
00:44:06,152 --> 00:44:07,153
Hey.

730
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:10,556
Do you like ice cream?

731
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:13,827
I can't believe
I've never been here.

732
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,761
Well, it's sort of a secret.

733
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:19,565
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

734
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:21,300
Yeah, it makes sense.

735
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:25,070
No missions here.

736
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:28,407
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

737
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:30,042
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

738
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,210
We'll take two
of the usual, please.

739
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:32,545
You got it, Guy.

740
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:34,647
It's bubble gum flavor.

741
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,482
You think I'm
crazy, don't you?

742
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:37,584
Guy...

743
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:40,753
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

744
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:42,755
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

745
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:45,257
No! Nobody likes
bubble gum ice cream.

746
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,358
No, I do.

747
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,794
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

748
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:49,061
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

749
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:50,729
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

750
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:52,031
Mmm.

751
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,432
How good is that?

752
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:54,599
You can taste it?

753
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:58,304
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

754
00:44:58,337 --> 00:44:59,638
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

755
00:45:00,941 --> 00:45:02,776
Coffee used to be
my favorite food,

756
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,377
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

757
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,480
What?

758
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:13,118
Nothing. You're funny.

759
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:15,789
- I am?
- Yeah.

760
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:18,256
Weird funny.

761
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,893
But that's kind of my speed.

762
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,062
Weird funny, that's
totally my speed, too.

763
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,097
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

764
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,732
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

765
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,501
- Please.
- Okay.

766
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:33,239
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child...

767
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:35,809
- The cripple says to the homosexual...
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

768
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:38,010
Stop! Where did you hear that?

769
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:40,546
A robbery. The gunman
told it to the driver

770
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:43,916
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

771
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,718
Word of advice?

772
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,021
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

773
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:50,155
Trolls?

774
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:51,657
Is that a swing set?

775
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:18,317
Holy...

776
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,561
Okay,
this is too weird.

777
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:31,664
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice
cream, and now swings?

778
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:34,133
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

779
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,568
I thought the same thing.

780
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,737
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

781
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:42,141
<i>Growing up in
my family, it was...</i>

782
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,911
You don't
wanna hear this. No.

783
00:46:44,945 --> 00:46:47,079
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

784
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:48,747
Oh.

785
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:52,117
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

786
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:55,989
You had to win,
and that pressure, you know,

787
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,524
<i>it was just constant.</i>

788
00:46:58,557 --> 00:47:02,094
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing...

789
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:03,362
You know that moment,

790
00:47:03,395 --> 00:47:07,333
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

791
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,568
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

792
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:10,636
In love.

793
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,839
Free. What you said. Yeah.

794
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:17,811
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

795
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,512
You want to kiss me?

796
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:24,216
I wanna kiss you so badly.

797
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,718
You want to kiss me badly?

798
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,152
- No!
- No?

799
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:29,089
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

800
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:30,656
I mean, I'm an idiot,

801
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:32,358
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

802
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,927
No, you're not. You're not.

803
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,394
I mean, um,

804
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:38,865
uh, if you know
how to, go for it.

805
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,232
I know how.

806
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,434
Okay.

807
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,171
Here it goes.

808
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,665
That was so much
better than ice cream.

809
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:14,034
Whoa!

810
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,701
I think someone's
at the door.

811
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:16,836
I'll say.

812
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,603
Well, this was great.

813
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:21,876
- Yeah, it was.
- Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

814
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:23,843
Yes. Definitely.

815
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:25,477
Maybe in the real world.

816
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:26,913
What?

817
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,347
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

818
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,882
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

819
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:33,119
Bye, Molotov.

820
00:48:33,153 --> 00:48:37,222
Hey... my real name is Millie.

821
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:42,227
My real name
continues to be Guy.

822
00:48:48,935 --> 00:48:51,805
Millie, open up! Millie, it's
me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

823
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,907
Millie! It's me, open up!

824
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:57,309
- What?
- You were right.

825
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,344
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

826
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:02,015
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

827
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:04,717
and, Millie, it works.

828
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,452
Yeah, I know.
But we don't have proof.

829
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,520
Just forget about
that for one second.

830
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:10,790
I'm saying that
our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

831
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:13,960
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

832
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,161
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

833
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:16,930
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

834
00:49:16,963 --> 00:49:20,399
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is so
realistic and people love it so much.

835
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:22,434
And of course it doesn't
look the same.

836
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:25,404
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

837
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:28,174
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

838
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:33,046
But the underlying code in the
game is the same. Our code.

839
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,713
And Guy, I mean,
he has evolved way further

840
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:36,149
than we thought
was even possible.

841
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,450
Wait, are you talking about
the hacker in the NPC skin?

842
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:42,122
Millie, I'm talking about the
fact that Blue Shirt Guy...

843
00:49:42,155 --> 00:49:43,255
Yeah?

844
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,125
...is not a player.

845
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:48,128
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

846
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:50,362
I mean, hell,
technically, he is alive.

847
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:54,666
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

848
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,937
- No! No.
- I know.

849
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,371
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

850
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:01,007
- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.

851
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,274
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

852
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:03,709
- Holy...
- This is a good thing.

853
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:05,111
No, it's really bad.

854
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,714
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

855
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:10,883
We did it, Mills.

856
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:14,954
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

857
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:18,825
Okay? Did you know that the
NPCs have private lives?

858
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:21,060
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

859
00:50:21,094 --> 00:50:23,428
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

860
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:25,697
I can't even froth my own
oat milk in the morning.

861
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,234
And the Bombshell
character in the game

862
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:31,137
wrote a memoir that's
a searing indictment

863
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:32,839
of gender roles,
the patriarchy...

864
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:35,008
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

865
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,375
Millie, we have
to celebrate!

866
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,877
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

867
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,712
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

868
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,682
So, yeah.

869
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,720
I'm sorry, wait,
you let who kiss you?

870
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,789
Guy.

871
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,091
Guy?

872
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:56,628
The first time I kiss a
non-toxic guy in like forever

873
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:59,464
and of course
he's not even real!

874
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:00,967
Uh, there's not
a button for that.

875
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,335
Oh, he found the button.

876
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,770
- Okay.
- Yeah.

877
00:51:04,804 --> 00:51:07,339
- I am... I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

878
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:09,210
And surprisingly
curious.

879
00:51:09,242 --> 00:51:12,846
You let
an artificially intelligent

880
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:14,513
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

881
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:15,581
can you just stop
saying it like that?

882
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,682
And then you
thought that would be...

883
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:18,483
Because you have
got to meet him, Keys.

884
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,586
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

885
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,923
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

886
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:28,094
Also, Millie, food for
thought, he's like four.

887
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:30,897
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

888
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,832
Wow, you just made
that really creepy.

889
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:36,435
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or
not, when people find out about this,

890
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,238
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

891
00:51:39,272 --> 00:51:40,306
What?

892
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,241
Oh, my God,
if they see this...

893
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:43,508
- What? What is it?
- Oh!

894
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,510
Antwan. What else?

895
00:51:45,544 --> 00:51:47,981
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

896
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:50,382
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

897
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:51,918
I think he's lying
about <i>Free City 1.</i>

898
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:53,219
What are you talking about?

899
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:56,823
Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

900
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:59,259
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

901
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:00,726
<i>Free City 2</i>
is not an update...

902
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:02,295
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

903
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,963
So when <i>Free City 2</i>
launches on Monday...

904
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:07,499
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our
code, everything will be deleted.

905
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,235
He can't do that.

906
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:12,404
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

907
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:17,043
We're screwed.

908
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,611
Maybe not.

909
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:21,881
If we can find our
original build in the game,

910
00:52:21,914 --> 00:52:24,750
it'll prove that Antwan used our
code without properly licensing it.

911
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:27,220
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

912
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:28,553
We have 48 hours.

913
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:30,223
I've looked, Keys.
You know I have.

914
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,490
I know you have.

915
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,093
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

916
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:35,627
maybe he can help?

917
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,997
That would mean
I'd have to tell him.

918
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:41,100
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

919
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:44,370
His whole world's
about to end.

920
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:46,705
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

921
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,010
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

922
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:53,146
- You got it.
- Guy?

923
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:54,479
Hey! Hi!

924
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,049
Guy, we need to talk.

925
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:58,851
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

926
00:52:58,885 --> 00:52:59,919
British.

927
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:02,521
I think I know an Australian
accent when I see one.

928
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,123
I turned off
the accent filter.

929
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,758
This is me.

930
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:08,194
Good.

931
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,396
Look, I have to tell you
something really important.

932
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,730
Are you married?

933
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:12,597
No.

934
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:15,969
Oh, God.

935
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,071
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

936
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,006
Maybe not the worst thing.

937
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,506
Huh.

938
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,242
I have to show you something.

939
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,610
Okay.

940
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,851
Wow!

941
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:33,953
I always wondered
what was in here.

942
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:36,389
<i>Tune in to the Kill Cam</i>

943
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,890
<i>for more of today's highlights</i>

944
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:42,095
<i>of every bloody, bullet-ridden
corner of Free City.</i>

945
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:43,729
<i>Has anyone
seen my cat?</i>

946
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,500
Hey, that's Phyllis.
She's always losing her cats.

947
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:52,305
And there's Joe! He's
my friend, I know that guy.

948
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:54,340
I don't get it.
What is this place?

949
00:53:54,374 --> 00:53:58,978
There is no easy way to say
this, but this city is a game.

950
00:53:59,012 --> 00:54:01,513
There's no easy way to say
this, I know it's a game.

951
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:03,449
You taught me how to play it.
Boop-boop.

952
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:04,884
Yes,
you're right, I did.

953
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:08,754
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

954
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:12,225
It's a video game.
And that's all it is.

955
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:15,228
So the entire world is a game?

956
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:16,362
Yes.

957
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:18,364
And we're all just
players in the game?

958
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,664
Not exactly.

959
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,102
I'm a player.

960
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:26,772
All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

961
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,540
But you only exist here.

962
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:31,344
It's why you can
never leave Free City.

963
00:54:31,377 --> 00:54:33,279
You're what we call an NPC.

964
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,546
NPC.

965
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,616
The policeman
and the muscular bunny rabbit,

966
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,918
they called me that.
What is an NPC?

967
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,386
- <i>Let's take...</i>
- Just watch.

968
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,888
<i>...another look
at that leaderboard.</i>

969
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:43,189
<i>Everybody
get down on the ground!</i>

970
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:44,689
<i>Nobody try to be a hero.</i>

971
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:46,225
<i>This will all be over soon.</i>

972
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:47,493
I don't understand.

973
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:49,896
You're a
non-player character.

974
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:52,331
- Non...
- A background person.

975
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:55,802
Someone designed to make the
game more fun for real people.

976
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,037
Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

977
00:54:58,071 --> 00:54:59,405
I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

978
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:01,573
I just wanna fully
understand here.

979
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:04,143
So, I'm fake?

980
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:07,612
The entire world is fake?
I'm not even a main character,

981
00:55:07,646 --> 00:55:11,818
I'm just this idiot
who's in the background?

982
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,221
Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

983
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:18,590
You only think that because
it's in your programming.

984
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:26,899
Guy, I need
you to listen to me.

985
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:29,768
In two days,
the game is gonna shut down. For good.

986
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:32,505
When this sequel launches,
this whole city,

987
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,907
you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

988
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:36,409
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

989
00:55:36,442 --> 00:55:39,512
My whole life, I felt like
there had to be something more.

990
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,746
And then I saw you.

991
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:44,918
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

992
00:55:45,852 --> 00:55:48,354
And for a second,
I felt amazing.

993
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,288
- I know.
- Except you don't know.

994
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:53,226
Because we're not the same.

995
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:54,827
Isn't that what you said?
You said that.

996
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:57,130
We're not the same.

997
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:58,697
You're real.

998
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:01,134
And I'm what? I'm what?

999
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:06,172
You're not.

1000
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,310
You're not.

1001
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:15,081
Well, I may not be real,
but for a second there...

1002
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:16,983
I felt pretty alive.

1003
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:22,014
It's all a lie!

1004
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:29,355
Have the quarterly
reports on my desk by Friday.

1005
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:32,024
Quarterly reports.
My, what specific business lingo.

1006
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:34,160
Wow. Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

1007
00:57:34,193 --> 00:57:35,394
Until it crushes your soul.

1008
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:38,930
Has anyone seen my cat?
Has anyone seen my...

1009
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:40,967
Your cats?
No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

1010
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,037
But here's a revolutionary idea...
close your goddamn door.

1011
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:47,406
It's not like they're climbing
on top of one another,

1012
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,843
forming a little kitty tower,
and then jimmying the locks.

1013
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:53,179
They don't have
thumbs, Phyllis.

1014
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:55,314
No thumbs!

1015
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:59,051
Don't you get it?
Don't any of you get it?

1016
00:57:59,085 --> 00:58:03,623
None of this matters! None of it!
It's fake! We don't matter!

1017
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:06,559
That building, that's fake!
This street...

1018
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:08,127
It's fake!

1019
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,262
That car...

1020
00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:16,869
Officer Johnny!

1021
00:58:16,902 --> 00:58:18,770
Have a good one, Guy.

1022
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,180
Oh, hey, uh...

1023
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:30,916
Come in.

1024
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,328
Here you go.

1025
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:43,362
Thank you.

1026
00:58:44,463 --> 00:58:45,631
Buddy,

1027
00:58:45,665 --> 00:58:51,103
what would you do if you found
out that you weren't real?

1028
00:58:52,471 --> 00:58:53,572
What do you mean?

1029
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:55,374
Pretend with me.

1030
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:56,976
Okay, so...

1031
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:58,944
Can I pretend
I'm a ghost?

1032
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:01,480
Sure.

1033
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:04,817
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now?
Or whenever I die?

1034
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,018
Like, do I have
a funeral outfit on?

1035
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:07,753
- This is kind of funeral...
- Doesn't matter.

1036
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,155
...but even though it's a
work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

1037
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:11,190
Let's move on
from the concept, okay?

1038
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:13,726
Got it.

1039
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,862
I'm not a ghost.
I'm very disappointed,

1040
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:18,531
- but I get it.
- Yeah.

1041
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:23,135
I'm me, who I am right now,
and I'm just trying to help a friend.

1042
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,808
I say, okay, so
what if I'm not real?

1043
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,842
I'm sorry. "So what?"

1044
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:30,910
Yeah. So what?

1045
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,878
But if
you're not real,

1046
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:35,481
doesn't that mean
that nothing you do matters?

1047
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:38,517
What does that mean?
Look, brother, I am sitting here

1048
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:42,455
with my best friend, trying to
help him get through a tough time.

1049
00:59:42,488 --> 00:59:47,226
Right? And even if I'm not
real, this moment is.

1050
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:53,532
Right here, right now.
This moment is real.

1051
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:57,503
I mean, what's more real than a person
tryin' to help someone they love?

1052
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:02,508
Now, if that's not real,
I don't know what is.

1053
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:07,646
Do you know the
other security guards?

1054
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,215
I know 'em all. Why?

1055
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,616
Hey, Buddy...

1056
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,652
let's not have
a good day...

1057
01:00:14,855 --> 01:00:16,389
let's have a great day.

1058
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,125
Guy, what are
we doin' here?

1059
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,828
We're here to get a video
clip for my friend Millie.

1060
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:23,562
Does this look intimidating?

1061
01:00:23,596 --> 01:00:25,998
I don't know, Guy.
How do you hold this thing?

1062
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,876
You have
something I want.

1063
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:37,710
And you're gonna hand it over.

1064
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:41,313
How'd you get in here?

1065
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,549
Easy. I know
your security guard.

1066
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,351
Jimmy?

1067
01:00:45,384 --> 01:00:46,419
His name is Luigi.

1068
01:00:46,452 --> 01:00:48,220
So if you took some time
to learn his name...

1069
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:50,055
maybe he wouldn't
turn on you so quick.

1070
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:53,894
I need a video clip, and
you're gonna give it to me.

1071
01:00:53,925 --> 01:00:55,694
Wait a minute, are you...

1072
01:00:56,662 --> 01:00:57,864
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

1073
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,398
Yeah, maybe.

1074
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,101
Holy shit! You're Guy!
You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

1075
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:03,269
- Yeah.
- I love you.

1076
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:04,838
- You do?
- I mean...

1077
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:06,238
I'm like a fan.
You're awesome.

1078
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:07,606
You can have
anything you want.

1079
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,641
Wait, hold on one second.

1080
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:10,811
Gamers, listen up, this is
Revenjamin Buttons here.

1081
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:12,178
I'm here with Guy.

1082
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,680
The Guy, he's in my stash
house, and he's here to rob me.

1083
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,816
Can I get a little...

1084
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:19,051
- "what-what" for my followers, Guy?
- What?

1085
01:01:19,084 --> 01:01:20,787
Perfect. All right,
so what's happening is...

1086
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:22,388
Guy's looking for a clip...

1087
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:25,257
showing a walkthrough I did
to get to the secret level.

1088
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:28,593
Who are you talking to?

1089
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:31,363
I'm sorry.

1090
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:34,700
Who am I talking to?
It's just such a classic Guy line.

1091
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,768
Right?

1092
01:01:35,802 --> 01:01:38,304
You're good.
Oh, anyway...

1093
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:41,842
And you, you tried to steal it
from me with that Molotov chick.

1094
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,008
<i>Her name's Millie.</i>

1095
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:45,244
- Yeah. Wait, who?
- <i>Millie.</i>

1096
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,979
I think
it's going really well.

1097
01:01:47,012 --> 01:01:50,082
I know. This is literally the first
time I took my gun out the holster.

1098
01:01:50,115 --> 01:01:51,684
Totally. Right?

1099
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:54,887
Guy, I tried to go back through,
but the glitch is patched.

1100
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,455
And I never found it again.

1101
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:58,157
So I'm the only one that ever
saw what was on the other side.

1102
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,692
But it's all here,
check it out.

1103
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:02,428
It's pretty cool actually.
It's like a whole other world.

1104
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:04,730
- This is it? This is the game clip?
- Yeah, that's it.

1105
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,234
Can you do one,
single, just one solid for me?

1106
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,735
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay?
- Yeah.

1107
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,470
Just say my catchphrase.

1108
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:13,172
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich
all over themselves if you say it.

1109
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:15,007
I love banana
cream sandwiches.

1110
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,108
Maybe not this
banana cream sandwich.

1111
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,643
Yeah, this one.

1112
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:19,445
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just
say, "You know what time it is?"

1113
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:21,882
- You know what time it is?
- You know what time it is?

1114
01:02:21,914 --> 01:02:23,015
You know what time it is?

1115
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:24,149
You know what time it is?

1116
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:25,384
You know
what time it is?

1117
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:26,887
You know
what time it is?

1118
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,454
You know
what time it is?

1119
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:30,756
It's crime o'clock,
baby. Yeah.

1120
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,892
It's crime o'cl...

1121
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:33,225
But, no, I can't
say that. That's...

1122
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:35,327
Okay. It's all right.
I'll say it myself.

1123
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:37,329
- All right, you know what time it is?
- No.

1124
01:02:37,363 --> 01:02:39,365
It's crime o'cl...
Mom!

1125
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:40,934
Mom! Are you
serious with the...

1126
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:42,268
vacuum right now?

1127
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,470
You really have to do that here?
I'm saying my...

1128
01:02:44,503 --> 01:02:46,038
catchphrase!
Everybody's watching!

1129
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:47,273
- God!
- You're 22,

1130
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,009
living in my house,
there is no God!

1131
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,142
Sorry, Guy.

1132
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:53,312
Thank you, Mr. Buttons.
We're gonna go.

1133
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:55,114
No, no, no! No,
you gotta kill me.

1134
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,017
- I'm sorry, what?
- You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1135
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:59,385
Give it to me, Daddy.
Give it to me!

1136
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:01,654
No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1137
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:03,990
We're not gonna hurt anybody.
I'm a good guy.

1138
01:03:04,024 --> 01:03:05,524
What? What'd you say?

1139
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,395
That's deep.

1140
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:10,396
No, it's not.

1141
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:11,697
That's like I can
taste you, deep.

1142
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,634
I want your help, Buddy.
I don't have the safeword.

1143
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:16,735
I know what you want.

1144
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:17,871
I don't want that.

1145
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:18,972
Yeah, you do.

1146
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,205
That's touching.

1147
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:21,540
- They're touching.
- Yeah.

1148
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,342
I know what you want.

1149
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,710
Yes, I do.

1150
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:27,379
You want a little bit
of that <i>Free City</i> Itchy Kitty.

1151
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:29,214
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

1152
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:31,183
<i>The way you move,
it's almost dirty.</i>

1153
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:32,518
What about a little
Thanos Glove...

1154
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:36,322
into a little bit
of Thanos Snap?

1155
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,256
- Oh. That looked like it hurt.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1156
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,525
A little Sunday Drive.

1157
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:41,293
You have
a beautiful home.

1158
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:44,697
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man?
- Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1159
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,333
Come on, give me one snake!
Just come on, man.

1160
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:49,435
Mom!
Do not touch that sock!

1161
01:03:49,468 --> 01:03:51,269
I swear to God,
if you touch that sock...

1162
01:03:51,303 --> 01:03:53,405
you will be in therapy
for the rest of your life!

1163
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:56,810
No! That's my special sock!
Put it down!

1164
01:04:01,848 --> 01:04:03,616
<i>Millie, please.</i>

1165
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:06,086
Please wake up from
your standing coma.

1166
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:08,520
Look, I know this world
is just a game to you

1167
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,656
and you can come
and go, but to me...

1168
01:04:10,689 --> 01:04:13,291
this place, these people,
that's all I have.

1169
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:15,461
And if I can help you save it,
I wanna do that...

1170
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:18,098
but you gotta wake up, please.

1171
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:19,933
Millie, I'm sorry
for running away.

1172
01:04:19,966 --> 01:04:21,700
Guy?

1173
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,904
Oh, that's so scary!
It's just terrifying.

1174
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:26,138
I know, I know.

1175
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:27,841
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1176
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:30,342
Look, you may have started out living
in the background, but so did I.

1177
01:04:30,376 --> 01:04:32,378
We're done with that.

1178
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:35,214
I got you a present.

1179
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:37,650
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1180
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:39,819
What?

1181
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:51,230
<i>They say over a
billion NPCs are killed every year.</i>

1182
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:55,869
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie,
that's at least 50% my fault.</i>

1183
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:59,405
I used to shoot
all the secondary characters

1184
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,141
when I was bored, you know?

1185
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:04,543
And then, I'd
teabag 'em a little bit.

1186
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:07,446
<i>Who the hell even knows
who this Blue Shirt Guy is?</i>

1187
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:09,481
<i>But I'll tell you this,
he's got me thinkin'</i>

1188
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:11,216
<i>about NPCs and
how I play the game.</i>

1189
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:15,521
<i>The game wasn't even made for someone
like this, for a player to be a good guy.</i>

1190
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:17,690
<i>He's also a really cute guy.</i>

1191
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:19,725
<i>And not just the face, you know,
like the whole thing.</i>

1192
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:21,760
<i>And, honestly,
it's got me realizing...</i>

1193
01:05:21,795 --> 01:05:24,496
<i>maybe we've been thinking about
NPCs wrong this whole time.</i>

1194
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,532
<i>I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?</i>

1195
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:28,434
<i>Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.</i>

1196
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,870
<i>He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?</i>

1197
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:33,106
<i>Like, he reminds us
of what's possible.</i>

1198
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,506
<i>Also, he's like crazy hot.</i>

1199
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,643
<i>Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.</i>

1200
01:05:37,676 --> 01:05:39,179
<i>We should all be
more like Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

1201
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:40,512
Maybe we just
stop the killing.

1202
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:43,083
He's dead! You hear me?

1203
01:05:43,116 --> 01:05:44,683
The guy, put him up here.

1204
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:47,219
Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.

1205
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:50,990
Make me see him. There he is.

1206
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:53,559
Yes. There he is,
the little do-gooder.

1207
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:55,095
I thought
you liked Blue Shirt.

1208
01:05:55,128 --> 01:05:56,863
Don't say words to me!

1209
01:05:56,896 --> 01:06:00,133
People are so busy watching this
loser on Twitch and YouTube.

1210
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,266
You know what
they're not doing, guys?

1211
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,634
Buying <i>Free City 2.</i>

1212
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,871
- Pre-sales are down 16%.
- 60.

1213
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:06,638
60. That's bad.

1214
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,374
Oh, we are 48 hours
from launch.

1215
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:11,710
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1216
01:06:11,744 --> 01:06:14,948
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass
and ball cancer at the same time!

1217
01:06:15,782 --> 01:06:18,283
Inoperable!

1218
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:19,651
You know,
this whole good guy routine...

1219
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:22,621
it is a bad influence,
and is bad for the franchise.

1220
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:25,224
I want him gone.
I don't care who it is, boot him.

1221
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:26,458
You can't.

1222
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:28,194
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1223
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,594
You can't.

1224
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:30,696
Why not?

1225
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:33,432
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan.
He's an NPC.

1226
01:06:33,465 --> 01:06:35,300
You're tryin' to tell me
that all this shit

1227
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:37,469
about a self-aware
NPC is real?

1228
01:06:37,503 --> 01:06:40,773
Yeah. I don't know how or
why, but he's real.

1229
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,843
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1230
01:06:46,311 --> 01:06:48,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1231
01:06:48,413 --> 01:06:50,716
What to do? What to do?
Got it.

1232
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:53,787
And kip-up!

1233
01:06:57,322 --> 01:06:58,757
So we can't kick him
out of the game.

1234
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,928
How do we reset his AI?
Ideas, people. Come on.

1235
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:03,595
Hit me. Ideas.

1236
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:05,265
You could
just reboot the server.

1237
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,331
Keep talking.

1238
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:07,867
If we reboot the server...

1239
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,137
then he's just gonna revert back
to a regular non-player guy.

1240
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:13,305
- Solution.
- Antwan.

1241
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:14,773
Antwan, you're talking
about terminating...

1242
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:16,575
the first confirmed
artificially intelligent

1243
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:17,743
life-form right now, okay?

1244
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:19,545
Honey, honey.
Shush.

1245
01:07:20,312 --> 01:07:21,747
He's losing me money.

1246
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:25,251
So, I don't care if he's
Arnold-Frickin'- Schwarzen-Vader.

1247
01:07:25,285 --> 01:07:26,786
Terminate him. Reboot.

1248
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,788
- On it.
- You can't do that.

1249
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:29,823
Reboot!

1250
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:42,534
<i>Order
up and drown your bloodlust...</i>

1251
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:45,238
<i>with a tall glass
of murder juice.</i>

1252
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,339
<i>Here's this week's highlights.</i>

1253
01:07:47,372 --> 01:07:49,641
He's very expressive
with his body.

1254
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:50,609
Clearly.

1255
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:51,845
<i>What is that?</i>

1256
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:53,378
<i>It's a whole new
world over there.</i>

1257
01:07:53,412 --> 01:07:54,981
<i>Some kinda paradise and shit.</i>

1258
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:56,415
Oh, my God, that's it.

1259
01:07:56,448 --> 01:08:00,887
It's our original build and that build
is proof our code is in the game.

1260
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,222
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

1261
01:08:03,256 --> 01:08:04,824
I've seen this place.

1262
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:06,159
What?

1263
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,166
Yeah.

1264
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,068
What do you mean? How could you
have possibly seen it?

1265
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:21,506
Millie? Millie?

1266
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,754
We're dark.
<i>Free City</i> is offline.

1267
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:18,398
What is happening?

1268
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,770
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

1269
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:27,140
No, no, no.

1270
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:47,160
It's okay. Come on.

1271
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,700
Come on.

1272
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,236
Come on, come on, come on.

1273
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:04,243
Good morning, Goldie.

1274
01:10:08,714 --> 01:10:11,417
<i>Front of warm, dry gunfire...</i>

1275
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:13,353
<i>mixed with late
afternoon stabbings...</i>

1276
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:15,221
<i>could leave you in the streets
wet with the blood of innocents...</i>

1277
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,123
<i>by early Tuesday night.</i>

1278
01:10:17,156 --> 01:10:20,126
What really is the difference between
a light roast and a dark roast?

1279
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,693
Nobody knows.

1280
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,495
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1281
01:10:23,528 --> 01:10:24,730
Guy, can we talk?

1282
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:26,065
How does the sunglass girl
know your name?

1283
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:26,933
I don't know. Keep walking.

1284
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:28,533
Come on, Guy!
You know me.

1285
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:30,569
You know this.

1286
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,472
You said this clip showed
a place you'd seen before.

1287
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:34,207
I need to know where.

1288
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,075
The data's been erased,
but it's in your head.

1289
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:39,711
Please try to remember.
This is really important.

1290
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:43,216
Please, Guy, think.
The ice cream, the swings?

1291
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:44,716
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1292
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,718
At Free City Harbor Park,
there's a great swing set there.

1293
01:10:46,752 --> 01:10:48,054
- Have you been?
- Yes.

1294
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:49,455
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1295
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:52,358
OMG, I love
bubble gum ice cream!

1296
01:10:52,392 --> 01:10:53,826
He loves the
bubble gum ice cream.

1297
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,029
Yes, I know. We had it
together, remember?

1298
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,698
Please, Guy,
you're all I've got.

1299
01:11:03,668 --> 01:11:07,407
I'm sorry, lady. I think
you have the wrong guy.

1300
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,043
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1301
01:11:24,023 --> 01:11:25,058
Hello?

1302
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:26,793
<i>I might've found something.</i>

1303
01:11:26,826 --> 01:11:29,561
I've been going through Guy's code
and there is something there...

1304
01:11:29,594 --> 01:11:31,663
even now, after the wipe.

1305
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:33,332
What's the point?

1306
01:11:33,366 --> 01:11:35,634
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle.
We can't replicate that.

1307
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,303
<i>I tried, okay?
You were right, it's over.</i>

1308
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:40,106
No, Millie, Millie,
you're not listening to me, all right?

1309
01:11:40,139 --> 01:11:43,142
A reboot, it doesn't
erase his AI coding...

1310
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,411
you literally would have to
destroy the servers to do that.

1311
01:11:45,445 --> 01:11:48,047
<i>His AI is still there,
it just needs to be accessed.</i>

1312
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:50,383
I've seen him, Keys.
He's forgotten everything.

1313
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,651
Just look at the
trace log I sent you.

1314
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,353
<i>It'll explain everything.</i>

1315
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,668
<i>Now, from the beginning...</i>

1316
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,505
<i>Guy's behavior is much more
complex than it should be,</i>

1317
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:14,507
<i>thanks to our code.</i>

1318
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:18,144
<i>But he's still stuck in Free City.
He's still stuck in this life, this loop.</i>

1319
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:22,248
<i>And then, something changes.
He comes to life. Why?</i>

1320
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,550
<i>And then I remembered.</i>

1321
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:27,854
<i>One of the characters from</i> Life Itself
<i>was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.</i>

1322
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:31,991
And he was someone who was designed
to never meet the right person.

1323
01:12:32,024 --> 01:12:34,327
It was essentially the building
blocks of the character.

1324
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,662
But he never stopped hoping that he
would meet "the girl of his dreams."

1325
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:40,664
<i>So I had to base this girl
off of someone...</i>

1326
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:44,270
<i>and who better than the person that
I was sitting next to every day?</i>

1327
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:45,404
<i>You.</i>

1328
01:12:45,438 --> 01:12:47,006
But then, one day...

1329
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:49,641
<i>he meets you in</i> Free City,
<i>and once he sees you...</i>

1330
01:12:49,674 --> 01:12:51,110
<i>he can never be the same.</i>

1331
01:12:51,144 --> 01:12:55,047
<i>He was supposed to feel doomed,
but instead, he feels alive...</i>

1332
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:57,984
<i>until eventually, he is alive.</i>

1333
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:01,220
<i>You changed him, Millie.</i>

1334
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:05,791
You changed his code.
And I think you can do it again.

1335
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:08,194
<i>You brought him
to life, Millie.</i>

1336
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:11,230
<i>You brought him to life.</i>

1337
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:13,765
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person...</i>

1338
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:16,869
Don't have a good day...

1339
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:19,105
have a great day.

1340
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:20,573
Thank you.

1341
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,108
Take care.

1342
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:23,775
Everybody down on the ground!

1343
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,345
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

1344
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:27,446
Okay.

1345
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,115
Everybody
except you.

1346
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,420
Door, door, door. I got it.

1347
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,754
Please,
I have a goldfish.

1348
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,123
Look, I don't have long.

1349
01:13:37,156 --> 01:13:39,225
I just took you hostage,
so there are three badges on me.

1350
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:41,127
Badges? Is that like a
Girl Scout thing? What is that?

1351
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,361
There is something
inside you, Guy.

1352
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:43,728
What? I don't want
anything inside of me.

1353
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:45,231
They stuck you
in that bank and...

1354
01:13:45,263 --> 01:13:46,399
- expected you to just follow the rules...
- I love the bank.

1355
01:13:46,432 --> 01:13:47,567
...and do the same
thing every day.

1356
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,634
You are so much
more than that.

1357
01:13:48,668 --> 01:13:49,768
I don't wanna be
more than that.

1358
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,437
No, and I need you
to remember it.

1359
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,705
Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?

1360
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:55,007
Put these on.

1361
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,342
I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.

1362
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:58,743
True. The choice is totally yours.

1363
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:00,580
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1364
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:07,285
What is that?

1365
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,322
What are these?
Trick glasses or something?

1366
01:14:09,355 --> 01:14:10,223
Listen carefully.

1367
01:14:10,256 --> 01:14:13,159
In 24 hours, this world,
everyone you know,

1368
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:15,661
it's all gonna
disappear for good.

1369
01:14:15,695 --> 01:14:17,163
Can you please
just let me go?

1370
01:14:17,196 --> 01:14:18,831
I mean, I haven't really
even seen your face.

1371
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:20,166
I mean, I've seen
the general area,

1372
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,933
but I'm not really good
with descriptive words.

1373
01:14:21,968 --> 01:14:23,502
Not really good
with words in general.

1374
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:26,239
- Screw it.
- What? Oh!

1375
01:15:04,277 --> 01:15:05,378
I remember.

1376
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:08,414
Welcome back.

1377
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,417
No. I remember everything.

1378
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:13,919
Come with me.

1379
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:17,189
I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.

1380
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:22,194
Do you see that?

1381
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:23,796
Right there.

1382
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:25,831
Oh, my God.

1383
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:28,567
Oh, my God!

1384
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:32,238
Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible...

1385
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:35,441
but he forgot to scrub
the reflections.

1386
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:38,311
It's still out there, Guy.
We just can't see it.

1387
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:40,179
If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.

1388
01:15:40,212 --> 01:15:43,281
You can't go past
the water line. I tried.

1389
01:15:43,316 --> 01:15:45,318
We need help.

1390
01:15:45,351 --> 01:15:47,420
Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight

1391
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:49,755
in the one place no one
can even get to.

1392
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,090
<i>I can't even believe</i>

1393
01:15:51,123 --> 01:15:51,923
<i>he's smart enough
to be this diabolical.</i>

1394
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:53,459
Keys, I need you to focus.

1395
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:57,163
Okay. So, the reflection shows the
build past the southern horizon.

1396
01:15:57,196 --> 01:15:59,365
But the game physics won't
allow you past the beach.

1397
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:02,101
But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?

1398
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:03,502
<i>We're gonna
need a bridge.</i>

1399
01:16:03,536 --> 01:16:05,705
You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.

1400
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:07,106
And, Millie?

1401
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:08,809
<i>Be careful.</i>

1402
01:16:08,841 --> 01:16:10,676
Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

1403
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,646
He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1404
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,214
You're right.

1405
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:18,117
<i>Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see...</i>

1406
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,685
<i>well, I have an idea.</i>

1407
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:21,520
<i>What if he has
nothing to throw?</i>

1408
01:16:23,222 --> 01:16:26,125
Everyone! Gather around!

1409
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,161
Thank you for coming.

1410
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,297
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1411
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,932
Hi, Guy.

1412
01:16:33,466 --> 01:16:35,134
Hi.

1413
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:38,170
What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.

1414
01:16:38,904 --> 01:16:40,406
Really hard to understand.

1415
01:16:42,108 --> 01:16:45,411
But, are you sick
of living in the background?

1416
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,481
Aren't you sick
of being shot at?

1417
01:16:48,514 --> 01:16:49,548
Enough.

1418
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:51,117
- Taken hostage?
- No more.

1419
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,485
- Run over?
- We done with that.

1420
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:54,887
Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?

1421
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,522
We are tired of being stabbed!

1422
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:57,791
- Buddy!
- Sorry.

1423
01:16:57,824 --> 01:16:59,458
What are you
trying to say, Guy?

1424
01:16:59,492 --> 01:17:02,728
I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.

1425
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:03,896
Things can be different.

1426
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:05,164
Different how?

1427
01:17:05,197 --> 01:17:08,901
- For starters, you can put your arms down.
- Yeah.

1428
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,406
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1429
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:14,974
Keep pushing. There you go.

1430
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,041
Breathe through it.
There you go.

1431
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,176
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1432
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:18,812
No, not gonna happen.
Nope.

1433
01:17:18,845 --> 01:17:20,179
That feels unnatural.

1434
01:17:20,212 --> 01:17:22,481
I mean, what about when
someone runs in with a gun?

1435
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:24,885
Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.

1436
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:29,790
Except, what if the guy
with the gun doesn't come?

1437
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:31,289
- What?
- What?

1438
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:32,758
There's always
a guy with a gun.

1439
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:34,660
So many guys with guns.

1440
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:38,297
People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?

1441
01:17:39,598 --> 01:17:41,267
What if we can change it?

1442
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:46,505
Millie! How many times a day are
the banks robbed in your world?

1443
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:47,740
Hardly ever, Guy.

1444
01:17:47,773 --> 01:17:49,941
What about corpses, Millie?

1445
01:17:49,975 --> 01:17:51,076
- What?
- You see a lot of those?

1446
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,678
How many an hour?

1447
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:54,146
None per hour, Guy.

1448
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,015
What about gun violence?

1449
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,716
See a lot of gun violence
in your world?

1450
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,287
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.

1451
01:18:03,022 --> 01:18:04,123
I didn't see that coming.

1452
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:06,492
It's true. It really sucks.

1453
01:18:06,525 --> 01:18:11,096
The point is, we don't have to
be spectators to our own lives.

1454
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:13,632
We can be whatever we want.

1455
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:15,401
We can't all be you, Guy.

1456
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:16,635
That's not true.

1457
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:21,273
What's inside of me
is inside of you, too.

1458
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:22,541
What?

1459
01:18:22,575 --> 01:18:25,244
It's inside of each and
every one of you. You're growing.

1460
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:28,681
I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make...

1461
01:18:28,714 --> 01:18:29,748
A cappuccino.

1462
01:18:29,783 --> 01:18:31,616
A goddamn difference
in the world.

1463
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:32,885
Much, much better.

1464
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:33,986
And a green tea boba.

1465
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:35,789
- Holy shit!
- That's right!

1466
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:37,255
You go, girl.

1467
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:38,457
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1468
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:40,292
If I could just make it out
past that water...

1469
01:18:40,326 --> 01:18:42,428
there's a world out there
where we can be free.

1470
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:44,563
Where we get to decide
who we wanna be.

1471
01:18:44,597 --> 01:18:47,166
Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.

1472
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,068
We have to fight together.

1473
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:51,203
Yeah!

1474
01:18:51,237 --> 01:18:53,772
You guys have always done
what's expected of you.

1475
01:18:53,807 --> 01:18:55,474
But that shit ends today.

1476
01:18:55,508 --> 01:18:56,909
Yeah!

1477
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:58,744
I don't even know
what's happening right now!

1478
01:18:58,778 --> 01:18:59,813
But I love it!

1479
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:02,748
I love it!

1480
01:19:03,884 --> 01:19:05,050
I love it!

1481
01:19:05,084 --> 01:19:06,853
I love it, too!
Come on, guys, get in here!

1482
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:10,022
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!

1483
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:17,964
Everybody get
down on the ground!

1484
01:19:23,003 --> 01:19:24,236
Hello?

1485
01:19:25,704 --> 01:19:27,640
Where the hell is everybody?

1486
01:19:28,507 --> 01:19:30,075
Hello?

1487
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:42,521
Where are all the NPCs?

1488
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:54,000
<i>Look, I've been playing</i>
Free City <i>for, like, three years now.</i>

1489
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:56,201
<i>I've never seen
anything like this.</i>

1490
01:19:56,235 --> 01:19:59,705
<i>Up until recently, I don't even know if
I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.</i>

1491
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:02,809
<i>And I don't know if this is
just some whack Reddit theory...</i>

1492
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:06,846
<i>but some people are saying that
Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.</i>

1493
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:09,748
- <i>That he's actual AI.</i>
- <i>AI?</i>

1494
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:13,251
<i>Actual AI. You know, alive.</i>

1495
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:15,588
<i>It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.</i>

1496
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,623
<i>Antwan, if you're watching
this, please fix the game.</i>

1497
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:21,193
- <i>And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.</i>
- Oh, my God. My God!

1498
01:20:21,226 --> 01:20:22,695
Antwan,
you should see this.

1499
01:20:24,798 --> 01:20:28,233
<i>And you, you tried to steal
it from me with that Molotov chick.</i>

1500
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:29,501
- <i>Her name's Millie.</i>
- <i>Who?</i>

1501
01:20:29,535 --> 01:20:30,502
<i>Millie.</i>

1502
01:20:30,536 --> 01:20:33,606
Got her. Got her!
Got you! Got you!

1503
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:36,375
Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.

1504
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:38,143
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1505
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:39,813
Yes, there he is.

1506
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:43,549
He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.

1507
01:20:44,216 --> 01:20:47,020
AKA Millie Rusk.

1508
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,754
Millie Rusk? Isn't that
Keys' old partner?

1509
01:20:48,788 --> 01:20:49,990
Yeah.

1510
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:52,124
Also the one who's trying to hit
me with this bogus lawsuit...

1511
01:20:52,157 --> 01:20:54,693
'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1512
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:56,128
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1513
01:20:56,161 --> 01:21:00,366
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I
can, but her account's spoofed.

1514
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:01,667
This woman is exceptional.

1515
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,135
Then kill her in the game.

1516
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:05,839
"What?" Yes,
I said that. Kill her.

1517
01:21:05,872 --> 01:21:09,642
Throw everything at them,
all right? Five badges, G.

1518
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:11,310
Yeah, just one problem.

1519
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:12,846
We don't have anything.

1520
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:14,047
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

1521
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,581
We don't have any defenses.

1522
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:19,184
We don't have police,
military, no nothing.

1523
01:21:19,218 --> 01:21:20,954
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1524
01:21:20,987 --> 01:21:24,690
It's like every
NPC went on strike.

1525
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:28,727
Got a tall, half-caf,
double foam oat milk,

1526
01:21:28,761 --> 01:21:30,262
matcha latte with cinnamon!

1527
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:31,798
- That's me.
- Hey.

1528
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:33,265
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1529
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:34,366
Cheers.

1530
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:38,838
Go get 'em, Guy!

1531
01:21:40,406 --> 01:21:42,675
It's like a digital walkout.

1532
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:44,778
No, it's not.

1533
01:21:44,811 --> 01:21:46,846
They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.

1534
01:21:46,879 --> 01:21:49,214
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.

1535
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:51,283
Turn off respawn,
kill them dead, now.

1536
01:21:51,316 --> 01:21:53,886
But that means any players
who die will be done for good.

1537
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,354
They'll freak out.

1538
01:21:57,356 --> 01:21:59,725
I don't care.

1539
01:21:59,758 --> 01:22:04,329
Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?

1540
01:22:04,363 --> 01:22:05,464
Are you looking
for some sort of banter thing

1541
01:22:05,497 --> 01:22:06,632
'cause you think
we're friends now...

1542
01:22:06,665 --> 01:22:08,200
and we're in some sort
of gang together?

1543
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:10,268
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

1544
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,336
Cool, we're a team.

1545
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,404
We should come up

1546
01:22:12,438 --> 01:22:13,605
- with a catchphrase, okay?
- All right.

1547
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:15,374
- On three. One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

1548
01:22:15,407 --> 01:22:17,509
Get back to work!

1549
01:22:18,111 --> 01:22:19,611
Someone find me Keys!

1550
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:26,853
All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!

1551
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,793
Okay, that's not good.

1552
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:37,130
He knows where we're going.

1553
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:45,138
All right, I got him.
I got him. Don't worry.

1554
01:22:45,171 --> 01:22:47,006
Want some four wheels
to the face?

1555
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,574
Take that. Boom!

1556
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:54,646
Rabbit's coming for you.
Apex predator.

1557
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:57,349
Whoa!

1558
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,960
Here we go.
Y'all watching this?

1559
01:23:06,993 --> 01:23:08,260
I'm about to end this fool.

1560
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,765
Come on, come on, come on.

1561
01:23:12,799 --> 01:23:14,901
Keys, if you're there,
a little help, please.

1562
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:30,216
God! Okay, who did that?
Who is doing that?

1563
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:34,220
Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!

1564
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:39,793
Come on!

1565
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:44,998
Go, go, go!

1566
01:24:00,612 --> 01:24:02,849
I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.

1567
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:04,184
Oh, sounds like you've
done everything possible.

1568
01:24:04,217 --> 01:24:05,317
Time to give up?
You wanna give up?

1569
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,318
No, I'm sensing you
want me to keep looking.

1570
01:24:06,351 --> 01:24:07,586
- Go.
- I'll be back.

1571
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:10,622
I have no idea where
these fools are running to.

1572
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:14,227
I do. Southern shore.
Hitman's Beach.

1573
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,628
Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.

1574
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:19,531
Game physics won't even let
you get past the shoreline.

1575
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:23,335
Unless there is
something out there.

1576
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:26,338
Antwan, is there
something there?

1577
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:29,775
Screw it. Art nerds.

1578
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:31,144
Time for Dude.

1579
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:32,312
We're still working on him.

1580
01:24:32,344 --> 01:24:34,746
I worked on him myself.
He's perfect.

1581
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,850
Drop in Dude now.

1582
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,650
Just do it. He's got,
like, half a brain...

1583
01:24:38,684 --> 01:24:42,055
he's barely written,
but sure, start the upload.

1584
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:50,762
What are we
supposed to do now?

1585
01:24:50,797 --> 01:24:54,000
Now Keys
finds us a bridge.

1586
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:57,103
Come to collect those
knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

1587
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,672
You've been helping Millie
Rusk this whole time.

1588
01:25:00,706 --> 01:25:02,275
She's looking for your build.

1589
01:25:02,308 --> 01:25:04,077
What build, Antwan?

1590
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:05,845
It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?

1591
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:07,246
And if you didn't
use our code...

1592
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,549
then how can our original
build be in the game, right?

1593
01:25:10,582 --> 01:25:12,684
Or am I missing something?

1594
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:15,587
Leave us.

1595
01:25:18,858 --> 01:25:22,527
Okay, Keys,
let's have a real talk.

1596
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:25,464
If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.

1597
01:25:25,497 --> 01:25:26,933
Antwan, you don't know
it would've failed.

1598
01:25:26,966 --> 01:25:28,134
Yeah, I do know.

1599
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:31,004
I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.

1600
01:25:31,037 --> 01:25:34,841
Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?

1601
01:25:34,874 --> 01:25:37,509
What matters more
than numbers? Money?

1602
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,380
Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.

1603
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:41,981
Nothing matters
more than numbers!

1604
01:25:42,015 --> 01:25:43,415
You should be thanking me!

1605
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:44,716
I should be thanking you?

1606
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,886
What about the profits
that you got from our work?

1607
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,055
You chose your side,
little Padawan.

1608
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:52,959
And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.

1609
01:25:52,992 --> 01:25:53,993
You get me, bro?

1610
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:58,197
Yeah, I get you...
bro.

1611
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:00,766
Which leads me to this.

1612
01:26:15,982 --> 01:26:17,183
Thanks, Keys.

1613
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,890
What the hell was that?

1614
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:26,625
Hey, Antwan,
things are getting hectic.

1615
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:32,531
Oh, I thought you were
smarter than this, Keys.

1616
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:34,766
You're obviously fired,
you know that.

1617
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:38,037
And you, what is she still
doing in the game, man?

1618
01:26:38,071 --> 01:26:38,972
Boot everyone.

1619
01:26:39,005 --> 01:26:41,374
Hold up. You want me
to boot all the players?

1620
01:26:41,407 --> 01:26:43,309
Boot them out
of the game, now!

1621
01:26:43,343 --> 01:26:45,078
Cancel every player account!

1622
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:46,779
And where the hell is Dude?

1623
01:26:46,813 --> 01:26:49,782
Security! Kick this punk out.

1624
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,621
Guy!

1625
01:26:56,655 --> 01:26:58,523
- Millie!
- They're taking me out.

1626
01:26:58,557 --> 01:26:59,993
What's happening?

1627
01:27:00,026 --> 01:27:00,960
It's on you now.
Everybody's watching.

1628
01:27:00,994 --> 01:27:02,028
You gotta keep going.

1629
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:04,563
Wait, wait, wait!
Will I see you again?

1630
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:06,232
You will if you make it
across that bridge.

1631
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,533
Show the whole world our build.
That's the proof.

1632
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:11,037
You do that, Antwan is done.

1633
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,071
I'll make it.

1634
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:17,176
I'll make it.

1635
01:27:18,311 --> 01:27:19,511
What the hell?

1636
01:27:21,147 --> 01:27:22,748
What's going on?

1637
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:06,625
All right, let's all remember this
moment, before we were fired.

1638
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,428
Oh!

1639
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:09,862
Wow.

1640
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:16,102
Catchphrase.

1641
01:28:16,135 --> 01:28:17,769
<i>Catchphrase?</i>

1642
01:28:17,804 --> 01:28:19,338
What? I haven't had time
to think one up yet.

1643
01:28:19,372 --> 01:28:23,176
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase
is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1644
01:28:27,346 --> 01:28:28,713
Whoa.

1645
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:32,919
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1646
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,300
Oh, no, no, no.

1647
01:28:51,603 --> 01:28:54,874
Guy, I came to save you.

1648
01:28:56,775 --> 01:28:59,145
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

1649
01:28:59,178 --> 01:29:00,346
He's glorious.

1650
01:29:01,948 --> 01:29:03,449
I mean, he's just like you...

1651
01:29:03,483 --> 01:29:05,017
but way better.

1652
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,955
Way, way better.

1653
01:29:08,988 --> 01:29:10,857
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a compliment.

1654
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,258
I wouldn't touch him
if I were you, Buddy.

1655
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,758
What do you mean you don't
think I should touch him?

1656
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:15,361
You don't mind this, do you?

1657
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:17,330
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1658
01:29:21,033 --> 01:29:23,469
Yeah, I think he's
gonna... hit you.

1659
01:29:23,503 --> 01:29:24,570
He punches so hard.

1660
01:29:24,604 --> 01:29:25,704
But yet his hands are so soft.

1661
01:29:25,737 --> 01:29:27,140
- Be strong.
- Okay, bye.

1662
01:29:27,173 --> 01:29:29,408
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1663
01:29:29,442 --> 01:29:31,077
Whee!

1664
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,478
Ha-ha!

1665
01:29:35,548 --> 01:29:36,883
Oh...

1666
01:29:40,419 --> 01:29:42,788
<i>No, no, no! No!</i>

1667
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:45,657
Get up, Guy, get up!

1668
01:29:46,325 --> 01:29:47,692
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

1669
01:29:47,726 --> 01:29:48,928
I don't know
what that means.

1670
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:53,099
<i>Come on, man. Get up!</i>

1671
01:29:53,132 --> 01:29:54,133
Get up.

1672
01:29:55,234 --> 01:29:58,004
There are three things
I love in life.

1673
01:29:58,037 --> 01:30:02,808
Kickin' ass, TBD,
third thing here.

1674
01:30:06,812 --> 01:30:08,981
<i>Oof! Oh, shit!</i>

1675
01:30:10,682 --> 01:30:12,351
Activate death blow.

1676
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:13,386
Bye, Guy.

1677
01:30:18,024 --> 01:30:20,126
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1678
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,095
Get up!

1679
01:30:23,129 --> 01:30:25,898
Mom, he's coming in
with a death blow!

1680
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:29,969
Get up, Guy.

1681
01:30:36,008 --> 01:30:37,076
Oh.

1682
01:30:39,078 --> 01:30:40,913
What the shit?

1683
01:30:48,354 --> 01:30:49,754
That was dope.

1684
01:31:05,805 --> 01:31:07,506
- Hold on. Is that...
- That's a...

1685
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,742
Yes! That's a
lightsaber, Dude.

1686
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:12,311
Mm-hmm.

1687
01:31:16,983 --> 01:31:19,118
- Is that a lightsaber?
- It is.

1688
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,022
Oh!

1689
01:32:02,428 --> 01:32:03,529
Guy!

1690
01:32:05,431 --> 01:32:06,932
Yes!

1691
01:32:06,966 --> 01:32:09,769
Yes! That's right.
Get up, Guy. Come on.

1692
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:31,490
There you go.

1693
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:34,293
Do you see them
all now? Yeah?

1694
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:35,661
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1695
01:32:35,695 --> 01:32:38,564
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1696
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:41,634
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

1697
01:32:41,667 --> 01:32:43,736
Just lots of little snacks.

1698
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,743
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1699
01:32:50,776 --> 01:32:52,578
Run free, better me.

1700
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:55,247
Let's go.

1701
01:32:55,281 --> 01:32:56,749
Where are we going?

1702
01:32:56,783 --> 01:32:58,785
We can't let them
get across that bridge.

1703
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:00,553
You wanna finish
this out with me?

1704
01:33:00,585 --> 01:33:03,790
Look, I don't even know what's going
on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

1705
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,558
Ha-ha!

1706
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,360
Let's go!

1707
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:33,753
Antwan, come on, man.

1708
01:33:33,787 --> 01:33:36,254
What are we doing here?

1709
01:33:37,189 --> 01:33:38,891
Where are the servers
to <i>Free City 1?</i>

1710
01:33:38,924 --> 01:33:42,061
No. Antwan,
what the hell are you doing?

1711
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:45,799
If they get past that horizon to the
build, I lose everything!

1712
01:33:45,832 --> 01:33:47,233
Wait, so you did
steal their code.

1713
01:33:47,265 --> 01:33:49,803
Welcome to
the conversation, genius.

1714
01:33:49,836 --> 01:33:51,504
Now, where are
those servers?

1715
01:33:51,537 --> 01:33:53,072
It's all of these, but hold on.
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1716
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:54,540
All these? This one?
Right, this one?

1717
01:33:54,573 --> 01:33:55,941
Yeah. How did you...

1718
01:34:02,348 --> 01:34:03,349
Run.

1719
01:34:08,187 --> 01:34:09,188
Antwan!

1720
01:34:19,498 --> 01:34:20,533
Stop!

1721
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:24,838
Officer Johnny!

1722
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:26,272
- Come on!
- Come on!

1723
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:32,011
Which server has the ocean
and the rest of the bridge?

1724
01:34:32,044 --> 01:34:33,112
I'm not gonna tell you.

1725
01:34:33,145 --> 01:34:34,213
You're just
gonna destroy it.

1726
01:34:34,246 --> 01:34:35,748
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1727
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:39,084
Except it's not.
It's Keys' game.

1728
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:40,821
You didn't do shit.

1729
01:34:40,854 --> 01:34:43,989
And guess what?
Keys is my boy.

1730
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:45,458
Security!

1731
01:34:45,491 --> 01:34:48,929
Please escort this former
employee off the premises.

1732
01:34:48,961 --> 01:34:50,996
He can call you
by your real name.

1733
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:12,017
Guy!

1734
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:13,954
- Buddy! Buddy!
- No, no! Keep going!

1735
01:35:13,986 --> 01:35:15,956
Go without me!

1736
01:35:15,988 --> 01:35:18,224
I've been scared
my whole damn life.

1737
01:35:19,725 --> 01:35:21,660
But I'm not scared anymore.

1738
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:26,165
I'm sorry.

1739
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:28,167
I'm not.

1740
01:35:30,903 --> 01:35:33,038
It's been the
best day of my life.

1741
01:35:33,672 --> 01:35:35,508
You get to that build.

1742
01:35:36,877 --> 01:35:38,444
You show 'em we matter.

1743
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:48,855
That security guard right
there was a goddamn hero.

1744
01:37:28,855 --> 01:37:31,891
You did it!

1745
01:37:40,165 --> 01:37:41,935
Yes! Yes!

1746
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:44,436
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1747
01:37:45,872 --> 01:37:47,439
Antwan, stop!

1748
01:37:48,108 --> 01:37:49,508
It's over.

1749
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:53,312
He made it.

1750
01:37:53,345 --> 01:37:57,316
Got your game's original build
out there for everyone to see.

1751
01:37:57,349 --> 01:37:59,218
Probably win
your lawsuit, huh?

1752
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:00,887
Looks likely.

1753
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,388
Cool.

1754
01:38:02,421 --> 01:38:06,291
And here's the thing, bro.
Here's the thing.

1755
01:38:06,325 --> 01:38:09,062
Right here, I got
everything you care about.

1756
01:38:09,095 --> 01:38:13,298
The sliver that's left of <i>Free City,</i>
all your little background friends...

1757
01:38:13,332 --> 01:38:15,768
including your
digital boyfriend.

1758
01:38:16,635 --> 01:38:18,570
Last server.

1759
01:38:18,603 --> 01:38:23,876
Look, I just want the world that
I built and the people in it.

1760
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,544
What's in it for Antwan?

1761
01:38:25,577 --> 01:38:26,780
Everything else.

1762
01:38:26,813 --> 01:38:28,613
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1763
01:38:28,647 --> 01:38:31,084
You have the rights to our
code, keep all the profits...

1764
01:38:31,117 --> 01:38:33,218
just give me
what's left of <i>Free City.</i>

1765
01:38:33,251 --> 01:38:35,253
Let me build my
own world from there.

1766
01:38:35,287 --> 01:38:39,125
What about <i>Free City 2?</i>
<i>Free City 3?</i>

1767
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:40,659
And all pursuant spin-offs?

1768
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:43,762
All yours.
Just put down the axe.

1769
01:38:43,797 --> 01:38:46,432
You know that this is, like,
the dumbest deal

1770
01:38:46,465 --> 01:38:48,901
in the history of
dumb deals, right?

1771
01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:51,336
I mean, you're talking about
giving up millions of dollars.

1772
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:53,439
Why would anyone do that?

1773
01:38:53,472 --> 01:38:55,842
'Cause Keys and I
made something great.

1774
01:38:57,877 --> 01:39:00,980
And I don't need money or
fame to prove that to myself.

1775
01:39:01,014 --> 01:39:03,950
I'm done playing
your game, Antwan.

1776
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:08,487
It's time I played mine.

1777
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:10,857
Deal?

1778
01:39:19,899 --> 01:39:22,202
<i>Popping today
and not in a good way.</i>

1779
01:39:22,267 --> 01:39:24,737
<i>Sales for</i> Free City 2

1780
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:29,175

1781
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:31,543
<i>Embattled Soonami game founder

<i>finds himself

1783
01:39:33,012 --> 01:39:34,379
Crosshairs.

1784
01:39:34,413 --> 01:39:36,215
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

1785
01:39:36,248 --> 01:39:37,649
We're too busy to gloat.

1786
01:39:37,683 --> 01:39:39,551
<i>I'm a victim! I'm a victim!</i>

1787
01:39:39,584 --> 01:39:41,487
Speaking of busy,
we just doubled

the amount of unique
visitors we can handle.

1789
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,690
It's amazing.

1790
01:39:44,723 --> 01:39:46,391
Who'd have thought
that so many people...

1791
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:49,461
would just wanna watch video game
characters instead of shoot at them?

1792
01:39:49,929 --> 01:39:51,030
Hmm...

1793
01:39:51,898 --> 01:39:52,966
Oh, yeah, we did.

1794
01:39:52,999 --> 01:39:54,767
Yeah.

1795
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:58,737
You know,
you're pretty cute when you brag.

1796
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,839
<i>Antwan out!</i>

Uh, hey, Mills...

1803
01:40:17,523 --> 01:40:19,959
Do you wanna come
grab a coffee with me?

1804
01:40:19,993 --> 01:40:22,494
Actually, I'm gonna jump
back into the game.

1805
01:40:24,164 --> 01:40:26,532
- Oh.
- Coffee?

1806
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:29,002
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1807
01:40:29,035 --> 01:40:30,602
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1808
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,205
Oh, Keys, uh...

1809
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:33,940
I know, medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

1810
01:40:33,973 --> 01:40:35,008
Yeah.

1811
01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:47,619
Hi, Randy. Milton.

1812
01:40:50,023 --> 01:40:51,757
Hmm.

1813
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:53,458
I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

1814
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,230
Yeah, life has
been pretty crazy lately.

1815
01:40:57,263 --> 01:40:58,497
You should see it in here.

1816
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,900
We're talkin' free
bubble gum ice cream for life.

1817
01:41:00,934 --> 01:41:02,701
Wow.

1818
01:41:05,104 --> 01:41:06,105
Hey, guys.

1819
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:18,117
Look, Guy...

1820
01:41:18,151 --> 01:41:20,485
Wow, this is harder
than I thought.

1821
01:41:21,087 --> 01:41:22,822
Then let me do it for you.

1822
01:41:23,655 --> 01:41:25,091
Guy...

1823
01:41:27,759 --> 01:41:31,097
you are dreamy.

1824
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:37,203
Your taste in blue shirts and
five-octave musical superstars...

1825
01:41:37,236 --> 01:41:41,506
it's deeply, deeply
attractive to me.

1826
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,077
But I can't keep spending
all my time with you.

1827
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:49,448
I created this world,
but I can't live my life in it.

1828
01:41:53,987 --> 01:41:56,555
See? Was that so hard?

1829
01:41:57,422 --> 01:41:59,491
So, what are you gonna do?

1830
01:42:00,293 --> 01:42:02,996
Anything I want.
Thanks to you.

1831
01:42:04,297 --> 01:42:06,032
I'm not stuck
in a loop anymore.

1832
01:42:06,065 --> 01:42:07,666
Neither are you.

1833
01:42:09,969 --> 01:42:12,638
I love you, Millie.

1834
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:16,109
Maybe that is my programming
talking, but guess what?

1835
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:19,779
Someone wrote that program.

1836
01:42:21,747 --> 01:42:23,983
I'm just a love letter to you.

1837
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:27,552
Somewhere out there
is the author.

1838
01:42:45,271 --> 01:42:49,175
<i>You brought him to life.
You brought him to life.</i>

1839
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:51,476
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person</i>

1840
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:53,246
<i>he'd been waiting for
his whole life.</i>

1841
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:56,648
And I had to make it
realistic, so...

1842
01:42:57,649 --> 01:42:59,718
I based it off of...

1843
01:43:01,354 --> 01:43:02,554
you.

1844
01:43:04,489 --> 01:43:06,625
The woman of his dreams...

1845
01:43:09,262 --> 01:43:10,964
she was the same as mine.

1846
01:43:10,997 --> 01:43:14,533
<i>So she liked bubble gum
ice cream and swing sets...</i>

1847
01:43:14,566 --> 01:43:18,537
<i>and she had this very cute
but oddly specific habit...</i>

1848
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:22,008
<i>of always humming this
classic Mariah Carey track.</i>

1849
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:25,477
<i>Like, all the time,
she would... repeat.</i>

1850
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,681
Finally!

1851
01:43:36,322 --> 01:43:37,522
Keys!

1852
01:43:45,497 --> 01:43:47,233
What are you...

1853
01:44:28,174 --> 01:44:30,043
You okay, little guy Guy?

1854
01:44:30,076 --> 01:44:31,811
You seem adjective.

1855
01:44:31,844 --> 01:44:34,646
I'm great. I'm great.
You could put me down, by the way.

1856
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:36,516
Thank you. That was nice.

1857
01:44:36,548 --> 01:44:40,119
No, I'm great.
You're great, Dude.

1858
01:44:41,521 --> 01:44:43,456
I just miss my best friend.

1859
01:44:44,824 --> 01:44:47,927
We used to do the same walk
together every day.

1860
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,497
Except he wore a shirt.
And could complete a full sentence.

1861
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:53,132
I can bench press
a sentence.

1862
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:56,836
Yeah, that's totally
not the same thing at all.

1863
01:44:56,869 --> 01:44:59,138
Harder laughter!

1864
01:44:59,906 --> 01:45:00,940
Oh...

1865
01:45:00,973 --> 01:45:02,108
Guy?

1866
01:45:04,676 --> 01:45:06,645
- Buddy!
- No!

1867
01:45:06,678 --> 01:45:07,914
Oh, my God! Guy!

1868
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:09,515
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1869
01:45:09,549 --> 01:45:10,883
You didn't!

1870
01:45:10,917 --> 01:45:12,919
One minute, I'm running on
a crazy bridge to nowhere...

1871
01:45:12,952 --> 01:45:15,253
thinkin' my sweet
mundane life is over.

1872
01:45:15,288 --> 01:45:18,057
The next minute, I'm like
in some type of flyin'...

1873
01:45:18,091 --> 01:45:20,193
and some like fairy dust,
pixie dust...

1874
01:45:20,226 --> 01:45:24,330
and then I plopped down
into this slice of heaven.

1875
01:45:24,363 --> 01:45:26,933
Man, I love it here.

1876
01:45:26,966 --> 01:45:29,502
In fact, a couple of days ago,
I rode a centaur.

1877
01:45:29,535 --> 01:45:30,903
Now, it might sound weird...

1878
01:45:30,937 --> 01:45:34,340
I took a piggyback ride on a
half-dude and a half-horse...

1879
01:45:34,373 --> 01:45:36,675
whatever a centaur
is, I did it.

1880
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:38,244
I rode a dude, too!

1881
01:45:38,276 --> 01:45:39,545
Friendly gesture!

1882
01:45:39,579 --> 01:45:41,247
So friendly!

1883
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:42,681
Come on, bring it in!

1884
01:45:42,714 --> 01:45:44,050
- Are we gonna hug?
- I'm coming for you!

1885
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,518
- No, you're not. I'm coming for you.
- Yes, I am!

1886
01:45:45,551 --> 01:45:46,786
- You come here!
- I'm coming to you!

1887
01:45:46,819 --> 01:45:48,554
I'm reeling you in.
I'm reeling you in.

1888
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:53,359
Buddy, I missed you!

1889
01:45:53,392 --> 01:45:55,394
Hey, so where's the bank?

1890
01:45:56,796 --> 01:45:58,297
There is no bank.

1891
01:45:58,331 --> 01:45:59,799
So what do we do?

1892
01:45:59,832 --> 01:46:02,068
Whatever we want.

1893
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,812
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Guy.

01:46:14,174 --> 01:46:19,387
