MONTMARTRE MURDERS
WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING?

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
Just look at that.

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,320
We've always got
house-to-house...

Season 1

"Sets a Trap"
Part 1 of 2

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,700
Taxi!

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,960
How is she?

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,360
She's still got the fever.

14
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,420
She's not gonna sleep, Dennis,
unless I get her something.

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll go.
No. I know what to get.

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,150
I'll go to the pharmacy
once I put the children to bed.

17
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,159
Shh, ssh, it's all right.

18
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,260
Chief Inspector
Maigret's office...

19
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,420
It's another three
streets away yet.

20
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,561
Janvier?

21
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,960
<i>Come in.</i>

22
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,490
Who found her, Lognon?

23
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,501
A showgirl.
Michelle... something or other.

24
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,117
On her way to her club.

25
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,952
Didn't see anyone.

26
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,790
- Is it the same?
- Yes, Chief.

27
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,160
No robbery.

28
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,370
No sexual assault?

29
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
No, Maigret. It's your man again.

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,010
Two stab wounds.
One to the back of the neck,

31
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,890
one to the chest.
But...

32
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,580
the neck alone
would have killed her.

33
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,880
He's cut her clothing like before.

34
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,310
What I don't understand, Maigret,

35
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,870
is
why your man doesn't use a stiletto

36
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,450
or a butcher's knife.

37
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,140
The shape and depth of these
wounds we're seeing,

38
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,359
it's like a penknife.
Or something like it.

39
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Has the family been informed?

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,350
No.
But I'll do it.

41
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,590
It's my district, Maigret.

42
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,380
No, it should be me.

43
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,690
I said it should be me who should go
because of the attacks.

44
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,980
Why don't you sit down?
I don't want to sit down!

45
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,830
It's all right, it's all right.

46
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,888
Can I see her?

47
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,380
Is there someone who can look after
the children?

48
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,720
Where were you?

49
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,959
If this investigation
had been left to the 18th,

50
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,240
we'd have made more progress
than this.

51
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,160
Well, here's the Chief now.
Why don't you talk to him yourself?

52
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,311
Janvier, take me to the showgirl
who found the body.

53
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,400
We normally walk to and from
the club together now.

54
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,920
All the girls talk about
is the killings.

55
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,399
Except tonight I was on my own.

56
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Do you always walk home that way?

57
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,280
Michelle, I know it's hard...

58
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,617
.. but what did you see, what did you
hear as you walked down that street?

59
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:03,519
Tell me everything.

60
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,999
Was there a smell in the air,
like an aftershave or something?

61
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,886
If I'd been earlier, it would have
been me, wouldn't it?

62
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,100
Get a taxi home
when you finish work.

63
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,840
But this is only enough
for one night, isn't it?

64
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,341
What about the other nights?

65
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,622
What about the other girls?

66
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,165
Are you gonna pay for them, too?

67
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,368
Is there another victim,
Maigret?

68
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,692
What's their name?

69
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,839
Was it the same killer as before?

70
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,719
What can you tell us?

71
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,359
Who's the victim, Maigret?

72
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,560
The victim's name
was Georgette Lecoin.

73
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,319
She was a housewife from Montmartre.

74
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
She leaves a husband
and four young children.

75
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
Over here, Chief Inspector! Was it your man?

76
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,879
We believe it's the same person
who killed before.

77
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,926
So that's five, Maigret.

78
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,260
Yes.

79
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,950
We want all witness statements within 30 minutes.

80
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,510
- Who's still out there?
- Lucas.

81
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,680
- Torrence.
- Have we got anything?

82
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,660
Well, let's find something.

83
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,039
Chief, there's been a message
from Comeliau.

84
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,716
You're to meet the Minister of
Interior at nine o'clock tomorrow.

85
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,990
February the 2nd, a prostitute,
Arlette Dutoir.

86
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,340
17th of April, 8.15 in the evening,

87
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,080
a 43-year-old midwife

88
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,440
who had just
delivered a baby at the top of the Butte.

89
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,130
20th of June. Monique Juteaux, 24,

90
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:44,916
a dressmaker.

91
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,216
26th of July,

92
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:50,159
post office clerk,
same stabs in the back,

93
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,514
same ripped clothes.

94
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,519
Now last night.

95
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,920
As examining magistrate, Comeliau,
I want you to explain why,

96
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,800
despite the resources
made available to you,

97
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,101
the women of Paris

98
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,320
are still living
with the threat of this man.

99
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,199
And why the Police judiciaire
are no closer to catching him

100
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,999
than they were on the morning
of... the 2nd of February.

101
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,701
Minister Morel, Maigret has his best
men working

102
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:13,639
full time on this job.

103
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,229
His methods are meticulous and I have every
confidence -

104
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,963
What ARE your methods, Chief Inspector?

105
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,859
I need to understand what attracts
this man

106
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,159
to these women at this time.

107
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,276
The whole of Paris has theories as to
why

108
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,873
he's attracted to these women at this time!

109
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,340
And the Cabinet is full of theories
about what should be done -

110
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:35,364
from establishing a curfew to rounding up

111
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:38,759
every immigrant and undesirable in Montmartre

112
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,440
and interrogating them with impunity
until someone squeals.

113
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,159
This city has seen enough Gestapo
tactics in my lifetime.

114
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,200
It's not something I want to see
again... let alone authorise.

115
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,440
With repeat murders,

116
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,759
the killer is usually
attracted to the same kind of victim.

117
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
But these women are not similar
in age or profession.

118
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,999
Nor are they connected with each
other through church or background.

119
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,558
Their only link

120
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,100
is that they were
walking through Montmartre after dark.

121
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,080
And that they had dark hair.

122
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,280
He leaves no witnesses.

123
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,560
He makes no mistakes.

124
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,440
Maigret, tell me what I should say
to my Cabinet colleagues,

125
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:23,691
as to why Cameliau has not replaced
you

126
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,395
after five months on this case!

127
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,146
Police work can take time, sir.

128
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:32,120
This time is taking lives,
Chief Inspector.

129
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,359
I am very aware of that.

130
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,239
It is taking reputations.

131
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
It's taking mine.

132
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,720
And it is taking yours.

133
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,250
***

134
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm sorry to intrude but I thought
I should return this.

135
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,623
Thank you.

136
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,987
Is there any news?

137
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,815
There's no news.

138
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,960
Would you mind holding her, please?
Thank you.

139
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,519
Will you sit down?
You can join us if you like.

140
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,877
Er... no, thank you.

141
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,378
Do you know when our mummy's
coming home?

142
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
Will you tell me about your mummy?

143
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,625
The fifth victim of the killer who has been
terrorising the 12th arrondisement since June,

144
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,759
- Legenda nדo traduzida -

145
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
has been named by the police
as Georgette Lecoin,

146
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,439
a mother of four young children.

147
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
She also leaves a 30-year-old
husband named Dennis Lecoin.

148
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,897
It is understood from neighbours
that she left the family tenement in the evening

149
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:40,919
to fetch medicine from a nearby
pharmacy for her sick baby,

150
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,159
and was murdered as she made
her way home through Montmartre.

151
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,519
The body was discovered...
Good evening.

152
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,820
Hello. .. who's been interviewed by Chief
Inspector Maigret... I bought us some apples.

153
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:50,999
I bought us some apples.

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,280
Oh, right.
I bought some myself today.

155
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:56,479
We've got enough now
to start a cider press.

156
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,319
But not to worry.
I can always make something.

157
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,999
.. any witnesses in the vicinity
of Rue Lepic yesterday evening

158
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,680
to come forward and to contact
investigators at the Quai des Orfevres.

159
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,025
According to a police statement, Chief Inspector
Maigret

160
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,739
has made no further progress in the case...

161
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,599
They were talking in the queue
at the grocer's this afternoon about the -

162
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,487
.. no new leads have been established
and

163
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,575
You will find him.

164
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,839
Are we not eating?

165
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,359
Oh, we're out for supper tonight.
Don't you remember? Dr Pardon's?

166
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh. Do we have to?

167
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,959
Well, they've already rung
to confirm and...

168
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,927
.. he's invited a colleague to meet you.

169
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:42,150
Professor Tissot from the Sainte-Anne Institute.

170
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll get you a beer.

171
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,359
How is he, Louise?

172
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
Well, I've never seen him
like this before.

173
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,959
I watch him while he's sleeping
and his face is grey.

174
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,920
He won't talk about our holiday
this year or anything.

175
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,217
It's like life can't continue for
him until he's caught this man.

176
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:10,607
I hope he does.

177
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:14,497
Life cannot continue
for any of us until he does.

178
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,480
Drinks, ladies.

179
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,328
Thank you.

180
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,400
Thank you.

181
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:25,279
I hope you don't find this
impertinent, Chief Inspector,

182
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,871
but I was with some friends this
morning and we were all wondering

183
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,757
why the Police Judiciaire
were not doing their job.

184
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,052
We're doing the best job we can.

185
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,593
Then why haven't you caught him?

186
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,959
Because it's often not that simple.
Why is it not?

187
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,400
How many more dead women
do they need?

188
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,670
Simone, we were just talking about

189
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,319
why this man,

190
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,631
who has lived for, 20, 30 years
withought ever committing a crime,

191
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,785
one day decides to attack
these women?

192
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,524
How do you know he's never committed
a crime before?

193
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:07,159
Because we've gone back 20 years,
both in Paris and the districts,

194
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,866
checking prisons and psychiatric
institutions

195
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,680
for all inmates released.

196
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:15,119
Your institute at Sainte-Anne must
have been contacted, Professor?

197
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,420
It was.

198
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,793
But we can find no offender

199
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:20,946
that we can place in Montmartre at this time.

200
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,811
So it's obviously somebody new
then, isn't it?

201
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,079
Freud would say your man had sexual
obsessions.

202
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,629
He'd talk about complexes

203
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,718
and work
his way back to childhood.

204
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,110
Well, thank God Freud isn't on the
case as well,

205
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,411
with all that nonsense.

206
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,462
I deal a lot with the criminally
insane, Maigret.

207
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,930
I think what links them -

208
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,496
Can we not
talk about his anymore, please?

209
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,319
What links them
is a need to assert themselves.

210
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,079
They'll have been humiliated in some part
.of their lives

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,979
and can no longer bear it

212
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,319
I agree.

213
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,877
I think the majority of crimes which are said
to have no motive,

214
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,701
repeated crimes in particular,

215
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:06,274
are a manifestation
of wounded pride.

216
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Strong addiction.
Indeed.

217
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,175
In fact, some of my patients

218
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:14,591
find it impossible not to boast of their crimes.

219
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,796
Our baby would be 24 now.

220
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
I think about her every day
at the moment.

221
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,600
Do you think it's going to rain?
I can smell dust in the air.

222
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,700
What is it?

223
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,228
Something Tissot said.

224
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,230
Killers always have to boast about
their crimes in some way.

225
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,620
We know that.

226
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,840
They like to tell the world...

227
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,693
.. how extraordinary they are.

228
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,914
Pride is always their weakness.

229
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,569
Yes.

230
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,000
So how would a killer react...

231
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,280
.. if someone else was given credit
for his crime?

232
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,996
You're asking me?

233
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,100
Yes.

234
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,320
With anger.

235
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,300
Frustration.

236
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
Baron.

237
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,079
Who's this?
Get out of my way.

238
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,380
Let me through!

239
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,872
Come on, out of the way!
Let me through!

240
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,520
<i>Lognon, who have you got there?</i>

241
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>Lognon...
Is he your killer?</i>

242
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,919
Are you taking him to Maigret?
Where are you taking him?

243
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,700
Lognon, is he a suspect?

244
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,746
<i>Give us a name!</i>

245
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,350
Did you get a good one?
His hat was hiding his face.

246
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,050
Get back to the paper quickly
and then come back here.

247
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,310
If that old grouch
Lognon from Montmartre

248
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,040
is bringing a man to
the Quai des Orfevres

249
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,030
and that man is hiding
his face in front of us,

250
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,250
it can mean only one thing.
They've got him.

251
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,750
No, if that was the killer,
he'd be in handcuffs.

252
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,830
No. I think they've got him.

253
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,180
Constable Mazet.

254
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,990
Welcome
to the Quai des Orfevres.

255
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,220
- Would you like a beer?
- Thank you, sir.

256
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,960
What do we do now?

257
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,280
We see if the Press take the bait.

258
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,475
Let's hope they do, Maigret.

259
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,721
Let's hope they do.

260
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,920
Here he comes.

261
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,650
- Who have you got in there, Chief Inspector?
- Is that man was a suspect, Maigret?

262
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,960
Who you'd been talking to,
Maigret?

263
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,260
- Someone with whom I've been having a conversation.
- A witness?

264
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,570
- I have nothing to tell you.
- Do you have him under arrest?

265
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,219
Gentlemen, I have no announcement
to make.

266
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,606
- Who is he, Maigret?
- Who's the killer, Maigret?

267
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,650
How long you gonna
keep him in custody?

268
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,140
Want a cigarette?
No.

269
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,260
Is that for Maigret?

270
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,487
Tell me what you see.

271
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,740
There's a young man. Get a
description.

272
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,954
Tell us what you see in there.

273
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,650
Go through the dates one more time!

274
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,760
February...

275
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,520
Just put it on the table.

276
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,140
That's it. Thank you.

277
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,549
February the 2nd!

278
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,310
What did you see in there?
Who was in there? Janvier? Maigret?

279
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,810
There's nothing more to say
at this stage.

280
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,890
IS THIS THE MONTMARTRE KILLER?

281
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,620
What the hell is going on, Maigret?

282
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,650
Why did you not contact me
about this?

283
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,999
An arrest an important as this?

284
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,220
There has been no arrest.

285
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,450
Have the journalists made this up?

286
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,710
They've watched certain comings and
goings and have made assumptions.

287
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,680
You'd better explain, Maigret.

288
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,170
Because the first thing the Minister
of Interior did

289
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,750
was ring up this office.

290
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,500
Sir, I have 200 plain-clothed
officers

291
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,530
taking up positions on every street
in Montmartre,

292
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,630
checking into hotels under pseudonyms

293
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,710
and sitting in restaurants and bars.

294
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,640
Why?

295
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,590
Because I believe that the killer
will not be able to stand by

296
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,085
and watch someone else arrested

297
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:15,790
and
given credit for his crimes.

298
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,050
I think he'll strike again
and I think he'll strike tonight.

299
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,586
You've set up this whole operation
without telling me?

300
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:24,899
Yes, sir.

301
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,740
But I'm taking complete
responsibility for it.

302
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,650
I don't like this, Maigret.

303
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,870
Neither do I.

304
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,850
But I have to try to draw him out
before he kills again.

305
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,300
What do I say to the Minister?

306
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,499
Say nothing.

307
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,800
If this goes wrong...

308
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,500
.. I won't back you.

309
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,699
My belief is that the killer will
try to show us he's still out there.

310
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,339
Lapointe, I want 12 volunteers
from the womens section

311
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,740
to walk around Montmartre alone
tonight.

312
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,259
Alone? I want them to be trained
in self-defence,

313
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,720
and, like the victims, I want
them to be above-average height

314
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,270
and brown-haired.

315
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,240
Thank you.

316
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,536
You want them to be attacked?

317
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,520
He hasn't made a mistake yet, Chief.

318
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,700
If we do our job, they'll be safe.

319
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,000
***

320
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,619
Police judiciaire?

321
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,460
This is your number.
Your route's on here.

322
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,779
Don't stick to it rigidly.
Do normal things...

323
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,659
Number four, the hair's too light.

324
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,939
.. go into a shop...
I'll replace her.

325
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,380
.. have a drink,
have a conversation...

326
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,940
There will be men in plain clothes
on the streets

327
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:58,085
You won't know who they are,
but they're armed.

328
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,660
And they'll protect you.

329
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,758
Any questions?

330
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,700
We won't let anyone harm you.

331
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,120
Take care.

332
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,810
Check your routes... and good luck.

333
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,080
Hello.

334
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:05,352
Now there are five murders,

335
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:07,877
my editor
wants me to do an article on Jack the Ripper.

336
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:11,542
I'm sure he does.
Drawing parallels.

337
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:13,359
Between Montmartre and Whitechapel.

338
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:16,220
Jack's five and your five.

339
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,490
Between Inspector Abberline
of Scotland Yard and you.

340
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,149
Abberline was haunted all his life
for not protecting these women.

341
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:26,879
As an old man, he wrote letters to
the newspapers coming up with new theories.

342
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,832
The murders he had to deal with
were very different to this.

343
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:32,807
I don't see a difference.

344
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,908
I see the old story of a man
who is afraid of women.

345
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:39,384
I see the same disgust.

346
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,440
A man who
is unable to see a woman as a human being.

347
00:28:44,153 --> 00:28:46,569
You haven't got him,
have you, Maigret?

348
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:55,088
I have nothing to tell you.

349
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,939
The streets feel different tonight.

350
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,162
Everyone thinks they're safe now
that we've locked someone up.

351
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,659
It's not gonna happen tonight,
is it, Chief?

352
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,140
I know he's out there.
Let's go round again.

353
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,520
Help me!

354
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,820
Help me!

355
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,640
Stop!

356
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,308
Is she hurt?

357
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,822
Did anybody see him?

358
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:18,258
No. I think Lognon's after him.

359
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,579
What happened?

360
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,880
He got away, Chief.

361
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,124
Tell your men to keep looking.
Yes, Chief.

362
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm going back to the Quai.
Keep me informed. Chief.

363
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Lognon. The Press.

364
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,415
That's far enough. Get back, please!

365
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,791
What's your name?

366
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,829
Marthe Jusserand.

367
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,567
Police Officer Marthe
Jusserand... sir.

368
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:26,379
Did you get a good look at him,
Marthe?

369
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,939
For a second, sir.

370
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,499
For a second his face was close
to mine, but...

371
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,419
.. I don't think I'd recognise him,
sir.

372
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,460
You saw the knife?

373
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,860
A small knife.

374
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,029
What was he wearing?

375
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,220
A dark suit. And...

376
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,153
.. he had brown hair, I think.

377
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:52,780
I don't know. I'm... I'm sorry,
it's such a blur.

378
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,940
I know.

379
00:34:58,614 --> 00:34:59,914
What's that?

380
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,343
Oh, yes.

381
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,379
Is this from his jacket?

382
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,680
Yes, sir.

383
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:19,379
A statement will be issued
to the Press in good time.

384
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,680
Thank you.

385
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,491
Marthe, was he tall?

386
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,230
No taller than me.

387
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,000
- Aged...20? 30?
- He was young.

388
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,307
Young will mean something different
to you than it does to me, Marthe.

389
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,779
I'd say... 30.

390
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,127
He was a gentleman.

391
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,459
And he had a ring on his finger.

392
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,400
Wedding ring? Signet ring?

393
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,230
He put his hand over my mouth.

394
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,960
A signet ring would be thick
with a flat top.

395
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,550
It was a wedding ring.

396
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,240
Let's find you a quiet office.

397
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,740
I want you to take your time

398
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,960
and I want
you to write down everything that happened.

399
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,270
Yes, Chief.

400
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,250
Before the attack,
I saw you with someone else.

401
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,900
He's my boyfriend, sir.

402
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:19,990
We were instructed
to act naturally and...

403
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,258
.. as it was past the time the killer
normally attacks, I thought I'd try something.

404
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:25,520
, I thought I'd try something.

405
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,550
If the killer saw you kissing a man
and then go off alone,

406
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,740
you thought it would provoke him?

407
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,041
Yes, sir.

408
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,580
Did I do wrong?

409
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,880
No.

410
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,460
Janvier, could you find her
a quiet desk

411
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,230
where she could write her report?

412
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,860
Thank you.

413
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,380
This way.

414
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,730
Is this all you've got?

415
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,270
Is it possible to know
where it was made, Moers?

416
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,050
Everything's possible, Maigret.

417
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,500
You can build a
picture of the universe

418
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,410
by looking at the smallest thing. You know that.

419
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,259
It looks ordinary enough,

420
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,940
but it's actually
a very good quality button.

421
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,660
Not the kind used
for mass-produced suits.

422
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,274
This cloth interests me.

423
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:38,899
There's a light blue thread
woven through,

424
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,379
which gives it a special character.

425
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,150
I'd swear that it's not French

426
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,970
but from England.

427
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,290
The man you're looking for
is a man of taste.

428
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,800
***

429
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,830
What are you doing here?

430
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:28,544
Has Maigret's prisoner escaped?

431
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:30,327
Nobody's escaped.Will you go back, please?

432
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:32,522
The killer's
attacked in Montmartre again, hasn't he?

433
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:33,970
Did Maigret release his prisoner?

434
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,360
A young
woman was assaulted but she got off with a fright.

435
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,160
Nobody's been released and nobody escaped.

436
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:40,186
What was her name? That's of no importance.

437
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,874
Why? Was she married?

438
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,477
Had she no business being where she was?

439
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,139
You put policewomen on the street
last night as bait?

440
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,208
I had no idea that was
what you were thinking.

441
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,300
They volunteered for duty. Well,

442
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:44,300
of course they'd volunteer for you.

443
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,060
I've got to go.

444
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,443
Assassino Escapa
de Armadilha Policial

445
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,059
Minister.

446
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,737
How far up was this authorised at
the Quai des Orfevres?

447
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,146
Maigret will tell you that he took
this action independently.

448
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,771
But you knew.

449
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,180
Yes.

450
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:35,396
I've given my opinion to the procureur that

451
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:38,035
we need another detective on this investigation.

452
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,544
Minister, he had to try

453
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,739
and lure
the killer into making a mistake.

454
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,273
And what mistake was made last night?

455
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,139
What evidence
did Maigret get? Does he have a description?

456
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,739
I advise you, replace him, Cameliau.

457
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,814
Unless you want the calls to grow
for you to be replaced?

458
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,200
Maigret?

459
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,819
Chief, the button manufacturer
is called Mullerbach.

460
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,219
Now Mullerbach tells us he sells
them directly to the tailors.

461
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,779
And he sold this model to about 40,
some in Lyon and Caen and elsewhere,

462
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,294
but only 28 in Paris.

463
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,849
Let's get to all of them today.
Yes, sir.

464
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,972
I'll send you some men.
Where are you?

465
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:46,346
A cafe, corner of Rue Michel
Bavioine

466
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:47,779
. But that's not all, sir.

467
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,180
We've had a bit of luck
with that English cloth.

468
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,506
I'll cut it short but Janvier
found out from the manufacturer

469
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:56,619
they've had only ten orders
from Paris for the cloth with the blue thread.

470
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,019
We'll take five each and get round
them all this morning. Good.

471
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
Chief.
Good.

472
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,804
I'm recalling Chief Inspector Lefors
from the murder inquiry in Bordeaux.

473
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,774
- Legenda nדo traduzida -

474
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,079
You will hand over all aspects
of the investigation to him.

475
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,307
Sorry, Maigret.

476
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,584
When will he get here?

477
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,667
Tomorrow morning.

478
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,405
That way.
Yes, sir.

479
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,479
What can I do for you, Inspector?

480
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you recognise this cloth?

481
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,041
Sure.

482
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,469
Why? Do you want a suit?

483
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,567
No, I'd like the name of a customer
for whom you made one. Sure.

484
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:16,299
Moncin. Thank you.

485
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,276
Marcel Moncin.

486
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:19,577
Moncin?

487
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,780
What can you tell me about him?

488
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,997
He's a nice young man.

489
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,459
Bought clothes from me for years.
There you are.

490
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,760
How young?

491
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,060
About 30.

492
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,360
Got a nice wife.

493
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,796
She always comes with him,
helps him to choose.

494
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,900
Do you have an address?

495
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,980
Sure. Let me see.

496
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,860
Yeah, he's in the Boulevard
Saint-Germain. What number?

497
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,921
228.
Thank you.

498
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,100
Chief...

499
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,718
Right. So far we have identified
three suits.

500
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,180
This is the only client which
corresponds

501
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:28,630
with Marthes description.

502
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,615
Are you armed?
Sir.

503
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,519
And you're sure he's inside?

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, I've been watching for 20
minutes and nobody's come in or out.

505
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,240
I spoke to the concierge
and she says they're in.

506
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,540
Monsieur.

507
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,950
Is Monsieur Moncin at home?

508
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,085
May we see him, please?

509
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,980
I'll go and ask Madame.

510
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,114
What is it, Odile?

511
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:27,466
Two gentlemen want to speak
to Monsieur Moncin.

512
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,019
What do you want?

513
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,619
Is your husband here?

514
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,028
Yes, but he's asleep.

515
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,207
I must ask you to wake him.

516
00:45:35,508 --> 00:45:36,811
May I ask who...?

517
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,564
Police Judiciaire.

518
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,057
I suppose he got home
late last night?

519
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,179
What do you mean?

520
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,659
Well, does he usually sleep
until after 11?

521
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,370
Yes. He... likes to work
in the evenings.

522
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,699
Through the night sometimes.

523
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,700
He's an... artist.

524
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,792
He went out last night?

525
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,874
Not that I know of.

526
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,300
If you wait in the drawing room,
I will wake him.

527
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,460
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
gentlemen.

528
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,700
I've been, er...

529
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,860
.. well, I've been working very hard
just lately...

530
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,087
.. on the interior decoration
of a grand house

531
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:01,059
that my friend is building
on the Normandy coast.

532
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,979
Well, I apologise for disturbing you

533
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,420
but I would
like to see the suit you were wearing yesterday.

534
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,441
Yes, yes, of course.

535
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,461
Excuse me.

536
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,780
Well, here we are.

537
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,208
You wore this yesterday evening?

538
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,000
Yes, until just after dinner, when

539
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:32,939
I changed into what I'm wearing now

540
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,579
before I started work.

541
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,499
You didn't go out
after eight o'clock?

542
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,617
No, no. I stayed in my office until
about, ooh, er... er...

543
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,821
.. half past three in the morning,
maybe four o'clock.

544
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,033
May I see your whole wardrobe?

545
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,526
Yes, yes.

546
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,539
Last autumn, your tailor made you
a suit in this material.

547
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,888
Do you remember it?

548
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,179
Hmm, yes, I do. Yes.

549
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,553
Where is it?

550
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,027
Someone standing at a bus platform
burnt the lapel with a cigarette.

551
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,428
So... you're having it mended?

552
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,882
Oh, no, no, I hate anything
that's damaged, no matter what.

553
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,398
You threw the suit away?

554
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,419
Oh, no, I gave it away.

555
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,179
I took it out with me one evening
when I was walking by the Seine,

556
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,020
as is my habit,
and I gave it to a tramp.

557
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,180
When?

558
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,900
Oh, er, about a week ago.

559
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,180
Be precise, please.

560
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,305
A week.

561
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,140
Could you call your maid, please?

562
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,660
Yes. Odile?

563
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,760
Come here a minute.

564
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,820
Please answer the Inspector's
questions.

565
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,059
Do you sleep in the apartment?

566
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,299
No. I'm on the sixth floor.

567
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,699
With all the other servants
of the house, sir.

568
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,875
Was it late when you went up
last night?

569
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,620
It was... nine o'clock.

570
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,779
And where was this gentleman?

571
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,740
In his study.

572
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,537
How long ago is it since you saw

573
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,399
his dark
grey suit with the blue thread through it?

574
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,212
The fact is, I don't look after
his clothes.

575
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,380
He's very... particular.

576
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,020
He presses them himself?
Yes.

577
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,099
Have you ever heard talk
while waiting at table

578
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,011
or at any other time of a burn

579
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,125
in the lapel of that suit?

580
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,234
No.

581
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,986
I don't listen
to their conversations.

582
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,210
Thank you.

583
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,779
Thank you, Odile.

584
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,092
I must ask you to get dressed
and come with me to the Quai des Orfevres.

585
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,390
My inspector will stay with you
while you dress.

586
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,550
May I inquire as to why?

587
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,576
Only now you ask us why we are here.

588
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,298
His name is Marcel Moncin.

589
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:31,869
And what police station is he from?

590
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,813
Take a dozen men and

591
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,422
search every
doss house, every tramp on the embankment.

592
00:52:00,423 --> 00:52:02,350
He says he gave one of them his suit.

593
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,003
Comeliau's office want to know
where you are.

594
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,219
You sure it's this man, Chief?

595
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,534
Yes.

596
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,040
Go, Janvier.

597
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:08,424
How long you been married, Yvonne?

598
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,595
12 years.

599
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:17,321
And your husband, he works
as a... architect?

600
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,697
An architect decorator.

601
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,577
An architect decorator?

602
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,511
What does that mean?

603
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,545
Well, he's not... allowed

604
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:29,405
to draw up plans for a building

605
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,827
because he hasn't officially

606
00:53:31,828 --> 00:53:33,549
a degree in architecture.

607
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,980
So he's not a qualified architect?

608
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,694
As I understand, anyone can calld it
themselves a decorator.

609
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,893
He's not a failure, Inspector.

610
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,121
Does he have many clients
for his decorating?

611
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,214
He prefers not to have many.

612
00:53:49,983 --> 00:53:51,743
He... is discerning.

613
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,231
Were you born in Paris?

614
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:58,532
Yes.

615
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,309
Where?

616
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,139
In Montmartre.

617
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,782
At the corner of the Rue
Caulaincourt and the Rue de Maistre.

618
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,968
How long did you live there?

619
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,314
Until I got married.

620
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,926
Are your parents still alive?

621
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,072
My mother. She still lives there.

622
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,111
Were you visiting her last night?
I was working last night.

623
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,191
Or on February the 2nd?

624
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,684
April the 17th?
June the 20th.

625
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:34,660
I was working last night.

626
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,260
Do you get on well with your mother?

627
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,779
YVONNE: Yes, he's on very good terms
with his mother.

628
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,660
He'll go and see her once a month.

629
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,860
By himself?

630
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,060
What did his father do?

631
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,244
His... father died when he was 14.

632
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,700
But what did he do?

633
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,460
He was a butcher.

634
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,660
Look...

635
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,599
.. when will I be able
to see my husband?

636
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,959
Why-why has he been taken away?

637
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,040
How do you pay for this apartment...
.. and the maid,

638
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,989
if you don't work
and your husband earns little money?

639
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,042
I have family money.

640
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,699
Do you recognise Moncin?
Is he known to you in the 18th?

641
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,580
No, Chief.

642
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:42,757
Is he the man you chased last night?

643
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:45,551
Well, he's the same height, similar
build. That's about all I can say.

644
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,819
He said he gave the suit to a tramp
a week ago. Do you believe that?

645
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,260
Maybe the killer's a tramp.
A tramp in a gentleman's suit.

646
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,340
Please, do... come in.

647
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,340
I'm so sorry, gentlemen.
I was doing some housework.

648
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,644
Are you sure it's me you wish
to speak to, Inspector Maigret?

649
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,510
I am sure.

650
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,950
Did you see your son
yesterday evening?

651
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,808
W-what have the police
got to do with my son?

652
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,580
Please answer the question.

653
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,100
Why should I have seen him?

654
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,900
I imagine he visits
every now and again?

655
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,640
Yes.

656
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,902
With his wife?

657
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,770
What has that got to do
with anything, Inspector?

658
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,300
Did your son come here
yesterday evening?

659
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,219
Who told you that?

660
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,300
He DID come?
No.

661
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,423
Nor during the night?
Oh...

662
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,760
.. my son is not in the habit
of visiting me during the night.

663
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,683
I'm afraid you have to
explain your questions, Inspector,

664
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:34,930
or I warn you, I shall answer
no more of them.

665
00:57:35,347 --> 00:57:37,553
I regret to inform you that your son

666
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:41,300
is suspected
of having committed five murders in the last six months.

667
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,839
What did you say?

668
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,406
We have reason to believe -

669
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:51,099
You dare to accuse my Marcel...

670
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,693
.. of attacking those... women?

671
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,583
I believe that later today
he will be identified

672
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:58,586
by the woman he attacked last night.

673
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,438
Just...

674
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,580
.. look at these photographs,
if you will.

675
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,979
Just look at them. Look at them.

676
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,460
Just look at that face.

677
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,819
And now I dare you...

678
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,700
.. to repeat those...
Abominable... suggestions again.

679
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,759
When did you last see him?

680
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,060
Oh, I don't know.

681
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,300
You don't remember his visits?
No.

682
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,733
When he got married, aged 18,
was it with your approval?

683
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,701
What sort of question is that?

684
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,918
Are you trying to make me say
he's mad?

685
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,761
Because what young person does not
marry without their mother helping?

686
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,720
Where is he?

687
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,802
At the Quai des Orfevres.

688
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,544
I... would like to see him.

689
00:59:07,046 --> 00:59:10,320
And if you feel awkward
about my riding with you,
then I will take

690
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:11,621
the metro.

691
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:18,059
My Inspector will stay here
and search your apartment.

692
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,628
Your man can do what he likes.

693
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:24,436
I am going to see my son.

694
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,540
Are you going to take a photograph
of me? I dare you to do it.

695
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,460
Don't be frightened, Marcel.
I'm here.

696
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,060
So, what have they been doing
to you?

697
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,060
At least they haven't beaten you.

698
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,180
No, Mother, no.

699
01:00:17,498 --> 01:00:20,834
I am going to find you
the best lawyer in Paris.

700
01:00:20,835 --> 01:00:23,655
He will get you out of here.
I don't care about the cost.

701
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:26,659
I'm going to spend everything.

702
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,060
I'm going to sell the house,
sell the - Oh, be quiet, Mother!

703
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,412
Does that, er... wife
know you're here?

704
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,699
Is she here?

705
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,500
No, she's not, no.

706
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,242
What does she say?

707
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,430
When did you last see her?

708
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,195
Don't push this family, Inspector!

709
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,260
I would like you to answer
some questions.

710
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,139
I will answer nothing.

711
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,459
And Marcel - answer nothing.

712
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,074
Don't let these... men
intimidate you.

713
01:01:15,366 --> 01:01:19,218
You are going to be hearing from
the most expensive lawyer in Paris tomorrow.

714
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,682
Line here, please.

715
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:44,900
Forward.

716
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,102
Marthe?

717
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,284
It's the same location
and same conditions as last night.

718
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,086
I want you to take your time...

719
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,900
.. and see if you can identify
any of these men.

720
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,520
I have a feeling it's him.

721
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,786
Turn to your left, please,
all of you.

722
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,780
Now face front.

723
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,740
Marthe?

724
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:22,862
I don't know.

725
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,398
I can't say
for definite that it's him.

726
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,670
Let's get them back to the Quai.
Come on.

727
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,819
This is a man Maigret wants placed
in Montmartre two nights ago.

728
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,060
Or on the 16th, when the woman
Lecoin was murdered.

729
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,965
One metre, 80 or so.

730
01:03:54,966 --> 01:03:57,979
Fair hair.
Wearing a dark suit.

731
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,661
Where's Maigret, Lognon?

732
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:04,441
I don't know, sir.

733
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:11,539
Chief Inspector Lefors will be
leading this investigation from now on.

734
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,030
Now he's returned from Bordeaux,
you will all report directly to him.

735
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,500
This is your main suspect?

736
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:26,900
Yes, sir.

737
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:28,907
Tell me about him.

738
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,739
His name is Marcel Moncin.

739
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,739
The Chief believes he owned the suit
worn by the killer.

740
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,629
But he doesn't have witnesses
placing him in Montmartre?

741
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,060
No, sir.

742
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,539
What have you done
to place him in the vicinity?

743
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,880
Well, erm...

744
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,893
Have you learned anything from the
house-to-house searches?

745
01:04:48,894 --> 01:04:50,660
? Not so far, sir.

746
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,106
Where's the Chief?

747
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:54,659
He's with Moncin in his cell.

748
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,340
Comeliau has replaced him.

749
01:05:00,632 --> 01:05:03,519
Found this suit on a tramp down on
the embankment. The button's missing.

750
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,380
Has it got a burn on it?
Just like Moncin said.

751
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,780
I think the Chief's
got the wrong man.

752
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,140
Do you love your mother?

753
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,660
My mother loves me.
She loves me very much.

754
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,540
She makes you feel special?

755
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,900
She always has.

756
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,260
Even though you're not.

757
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,620
Are you?

758
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:49,485
I am... special.

759
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,540
What did your father, the butcher,
think of you?

760
01:05:58,272 --> 01:05:59,580
He, er... he never spoke to me.

761
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:09,060
The most expensive lawyers
in Paris...

762
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,540
.. are coming after you... today.

763
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,060
Your mother can't afford
an expensive lawyer.

764
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,660
Neither can your wife anymore...

765
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,299
.. can she?

766
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,297
We've learnt from your concierge

767
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:27,940
that she hasn't paid the rent for seven months.

768
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,913
And the money's dried up, hasn't it?

769
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,060
You're a failure, Moncin.

770
01:06:36,921 --> 01:06:39,139
You don't sell any paintings.

771
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,099
You can't work as an architect.

772
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,740
My business is about to take off,
so...

773
01:06:43,741 --> 01:06:47,188
These women have trapped you
in a life that you cannot sustain.

774
01:06:47,189 --> 01:06:48,580
I am... I'm... I'm working all hours.

775
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:52,379
Is that why you started dreaming
on the long walks between their apartments

776
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,301
of doing something that would prove your
strength?

777
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,939
I was not in Montmartre two days ago.

778
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,260
And that woman...
Could not identify me.

779
01:07:36,564 --> 01:07:39,234
Chief, Cameliau's brought in Lefors.

780
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,920
Do they know where I am?
No.

781
01:07:43,515 --> 01:07:45,678
Go over the dates of the murders
with him again.

782
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:47,740
Try and place him in Montmartre.

783
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,659
Tramp found the jacket
early this morning.

784
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,819
Doesn't know how long
it's been there.

785
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,180
Where was it found?
Down by the river.

786
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,260
His mate took the trousers.

787
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,960
Moncin could be telling us
the truth, Chief.

788
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,865
If he gave it away a week ago,

789
01:08:03,866 --> 01:08:06,417
he
wasn't wearing it two nights ago.

790
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:10,736
Get it to Moers. See if he can tell
us how old the burn is.

791
01:08:10,737 --> 01:08:13,860
And if it's less than two days old,
then Moncin's lying about when he dumped it.

792
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,899
Then meet me at the car.

793
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,940
This is Chief Inspector Lefors.

794
01:08:18,941 --> 01:08:21,499
He will be heading this
investigation from hereon in.

795
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,035
I am sure we're going to have...

796
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,379
We expect a very good outcome in the near future.

797
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,815
I've nothing more to say.

798
01:08:29,758 --> 01:08:32,737
Search the whole place. I
know the knife's in there somewhere.

799
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:49,160
As far as I can recall, he was here
every evening on these dates.

800
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:02,158
One day, you will see you were
mistaken about this, Chief Inspector

801
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:06,060
and then you will be sorry for all
the harm you're doing him.

802
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:22,180
Have you not been afraid of him?

803
01:09:25,062 --> 01:09:27,020
I'm not afraid of my husband.

804
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,260
Do you love him?

805
01:09:31,774 --> 01:09:34,140
Of course. He's my darling.

806
01:10:02,822 --> 01:10:05,140
Chief, Comeliau and Lefors
are in your office.

807
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:10,100
Where's Moers?
He left a message.

808
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,060
Get him here now, with the jacket.

809
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,140
Lefors, I fear that you may have had
a wasted journey.

810
01:10:24,522 --> 01:10:26,885
Developments in the past hour make me confident

811
01:10:26,886 --> 01:10:29,540
that I have enough evidence to charge our suspect.

812
01:10:30,857 --> 01:10:32,580
You have a witness, Maigret?

813
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:35,037
We have knives - thank you -

814
01:10:35,038 --> 01:10:37,204
taken from Moncin's apartment,

815
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:40,740
which I believe will fit the unusual
wounds found on the victims.

816
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,450
And we have retrieved the suit worn
by the attacker. Come in, Moers.

817
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:50,619
Our suspect told us that he gave
his suit to a tramp a week ago

818
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,859
because it had a burn on the lapel.

819
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,619
However, we found the suit
only this morning.

820
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,819
And our tests prove the burn
is not more than 24 hours old.

821
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,899
And if you'd like me to explain,
I doused the fabric -

822
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,139
Yes, thank you, Moers. Are you sure?

823
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,939
Certain.

824
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,619
And I have made two more burns
in the back panel

825
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,139
which will be useful control
should the case come to trial.

826
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,740
What does this prove?

827
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:20,459
It proves that the suspect
was wearing the suit at the time of the attack

828
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,260
on Marthe Jusserand.

829
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,700
Charge him, Maigret.

830
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,384
Thank you.

831
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,114
Is it over?

832
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,388
Yes.

833
01:12:39,257 --> 01:12:41,749
Tomorrow, shall we talk about
when we can get away?

834
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,680
Yes. I'd like that.

835
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,666
Maigret.

836
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,258
There's been another one, Chief.

837
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:45,696
Who was she?
Her name was Janine Laurent.

838
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:49,059
A service girl working for a family
called Durandeau on the Rue de Clignancourt.

839
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,940
How old?
Nineteen.

840
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:03,540
I've counted at least
six knife wounds.

841
01:14:04,581 --> 01:14:05,882
Not in the back?

842
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:08,407
No, four in the
chest, two in the throat,

843
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:09,979
which seem to have been delivered
after the others,

844
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,319
probably when she was on the ground.
It's not as clean as the others.

845
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,706
There's wounds on the forearms,
the hands,

846
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:18,022
the dress is nearly ripped off.

847
01:14:18,023 --> 01:14:19,780
But it's the same weapon, Maigret.

848
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,682
I'll deal with this lot.

849
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,253
Is Madame Moncin at home?

850
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,220
Janine Laurent.

851
01:14:57,221 --> 01:15:00,619
She left a dance hall near the Place
de Terte at about 1.15 this morning.

852
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,419
That was the last anyone heard
of her? She left by herself?

853
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,479
The boys think so,
but they can't be sure.

854
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,109
No boyfriend? Not a regular one.

855
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,859
They had the impression she was a good girl.

856
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,820
Is that the early edition?
Sir.

857
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,760
Sit down.

858
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:07,782
OUTRA VֽTIMA APESAR
DA PRISֳO DO DECORADOR

859
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,947
Is my lawyer here?

860
01:16:30,948 --> 01:16:32,900
No, but your wife and mother are.

861
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,740
Do you want to see them?

862
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,500
When did your wife and mother
begin to hate each other?

863
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,770
I think that your mother felt
very threatened by your wife...

864
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:10,931
.. because she also wanted to be
mother...

865
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,780
to her little baby doll.

866
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,310
I think, at first, she probably
tried to contain her jealousy,

867
01:17:18,311 --> 01:17:20,935
and tried to control her,

868
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,264
like she controlled you.

869
01:17:32,165 --> 01:17:33,979
Mother arranged for us
to be married,

870
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,740
so long as we stayed with her.

871
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,460
How long did that last?

872
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,420
Until Yvonne found the place
on Saint-Germain.

873
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,180
We moved one night as Mother slept.

874
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,219
Did you feel free there?

875
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,020
No!

876
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,339
Thank you.

877
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:26,647
They both knew that you were
the killer, didn't they?

878
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,053
Maybe not at first,
but after the second or third time.

879
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,580
And they protected you.

880
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,300
Because that's what they do.

881
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:49,340
And one of them tried to protect you
last night...

882
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,820
.. so she could keep you...
And smother you...

883
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,850
.. forever.

884
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:01,325
The one who murdered last night
knows what she did.

885
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:08,380
And the other's jealous
that she didn't think of it first.

886
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,240
Chief...

887
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,869
Where is my husband?

888
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,940
Are you releasing him?

889
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:35,739
If the killer is still out there,
Inspector,

890
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,099
I think it's time you acknowledged
your mistake.

891
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,979
When are you releasing him?

892
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,860
I'd like to see him immediately.

893
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,140
Thank you.

894
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,420
Marcel! What have they done to you?!

895
01:20:01,358 --> 01:20:04,300
Oh, my beautiful little boy.
My Marcel.

896
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:09,180
Release him.
I insist you release him!

897
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:13,180
He will not be released because
he has committed five murders.

898
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:19,300
And one of you...
Has just committed another...

899
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,779
.. so that you can take him back...

900
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,200
.. and hide him from the world.

901
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:27,260
Subdue him again.

902
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,780
Make him nothing.
I am not nothing!

903
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,580
I want you dead.

904
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,060
I want you both dead!

905
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,900
I killed them...

906
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,740
.. because I hate you.

907
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,267
Oh, my poor little baby. You need your mother.

908
01:20:44,268 --> 01:20:46,620
He's hurting. My little boy is hurting.

909
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,579
I would do anything for you.
I would die for you.

910
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,126
I would give my life. (SOBS)

911
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,180
Did you murder Janine Laurent
in the early hours of this morning?

912
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,777
This is my child.

913
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:06,099
It doesn't matter to me what he's
done or what becomes of those...

914
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,400
.. little tarts who walk the streets
of Montmartre at night.

915
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:10,193
- Legenda nדo traduzida -

916
01:21:10,993 --> 01:21:14,869
Did you kill Janine Laurent
in the early hours of this morning?

917
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,728
Yes, I did.

918
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,337
Yes! I did!

919
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,980
Because I would do anything for him.

920
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,220
In that case, you can tell me
the colour of her dress.

921
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,940
It was dark, it-it...

922
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,819
.. it was too dark to see.

923
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,643
She was killed five metres
from a street lamp.

924
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:59,298
What was the colour of her dress?

925
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,785
It was blue.

926
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:25,060
Inspector, take her upstairs
and get a signed confession.

927
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,542
Come with me, Madame.

928
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,860
I killed them...

929
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,540
.. because I hate you.

930
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,420
I hate you!

931
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,380
I hate you.

932
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,220
Because I... because I hate you!

933
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,260
It was your fault. It's your fault!

934
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:16,820
Because... because I hate you.

935
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,299
'Hello, Maigrets?'

936
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,680
It's me.

937
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,700
Is everything all right?

938
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:12,027
Yes, it is.

939
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,940
'Shall we do something tonight?

940
01:24:19,941 --> 01:24:22,750
We could go to the pictures
or maybe just go for a walk?'

941
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:24,580
No, let's stay at home.

942
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,620
I'd like to stay at home.

943
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,780
All right.

944
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,980
See you soon.

945
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,340
OK.

946
