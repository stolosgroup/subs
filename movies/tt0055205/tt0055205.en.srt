00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,248
- Tickets please.
- A woman has been strangled. I saw it.

7
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,421
- I beg your pardon?
- A man strangled a woman in a train.

8
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,918
I saw it. Out there.

9
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,086
- Strangled?
- Yes, strangled.

10
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,886
You must do something
about it at once.

11
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:44,929
Me? Well...

12
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,768
Madam, don't you think perhaps you had
a little nap and maybe had a bad dream?

13
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,937
Young man, I was not dreaming.
I saw it.

14
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,600
What are you going to do about it?

15
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:59,851
Well, look, we'll be in Brackhampton
in about five minutes.

16
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:02,281
- I'll report it as soon as we get there.
- Thank you.

17
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,902
- Could I have your name and address...?
- Yes, of course. Miss Jane Marple.

18
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:08,620
- Marple?
- Marple.

19
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,784
- Old Pasture Lane.
- Pasture Lane.

20
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,116
- Milchester.
- Milchester.

21
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:17,163
Very well, Miss Marple.
I'll report this to the station master...

22
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,417
- Yes, please do.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:26,468
A bad dream indeed.

24
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:46,359
All right, Lucy. I'll answer that.

25
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,997
- Good morning, madam. I'm...
- Not today, thank you.

26
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,827
Inspector Craddock, County CID, madam.

27
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:00,502
Oh, I am so sorry.
Do come in, inspector.

28
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,499
I've just been going through
all the papers again...

29
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:08,342
...for the last two days,
and still not a word about the murder.

30
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,847
I suppose the police asked the press
to say nothing for the moment.

31
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:14,010
Do sit down, won't you?

32
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:18,515
Lull the murderer into a false
sense of security, then pounce, eh?

33
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,063
What's that?
Oh, how stupid of me.

34
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,144
- Here.
- I'm so sorry.

35
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,523
Lucy. You will have some tea,
won't you?

36
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,525
Some tea for the inspector, dear, please.

37
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,278
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,703
Well, now, have you got him?

39
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:35,958
Well, I...

40
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:41,998
That is, we have come to the conclusion
that what you saw on the train was...

41
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,043
- Well, a man and a woman...
- Yes, as I said.

42
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:51,177
I mean, perhaps
they were honeymooners.

43
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:55,761
Inspector, I may be
what is termed a spinster...

44
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:59,981
...but I do know the difference
between horseplay and murder.

45
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,102
Of course, madam... Miss Marple.

46
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,193
But the fact remains that there's been
a search of every train...

47
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,770
...and no hospital treated any woman
as you describe.

48
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:10,902
She was blond and had on a coat
with a pale fur collar.

49
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,746
And no such woman has been seen
getting on or off a train...

50
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,617
...alone or with anybody else.
- Of course not. She was dead.

51
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,078
Further, a search has been
made of every inch of the tracks...

52
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,494
...for the whole length of the line.
Negative.

53
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:26,081
So you don't believe me?

54
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:28,594
- I didn't mean to imply that.
- You certainly did.

55
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,800
- Not at all. L...
- What then?

56
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:33,047
L... I assure you Miss Marple...

57
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:36,972
...that a woman cannot be murdered on
a train a few minutes before a station...

58
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:38,769
...without our finding out about it.

59
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:41,096
I'm quite sure you mean well,
inspector...

60
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:44,025
...but if you imagine
that I am going to sit back...

61
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,194
...and let everybody regard me
as a dotty old maid...

62
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,604
...you are very much mistaken.

63
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:51,442
Good day.

64
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,222
Sorry, Mrs. Stainton.

65
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,892
<i>The Hat Rack Hanging,</i>
Falcon Smith's latest...

66
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,739
...I'm afraid we haven't
received our copy yet.

67
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,780
Plain inefficiency.

68
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,610
I want to know
the moment it comes in.

69
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:37,157
Of course, of course, Mrs. Stainton.

70
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,374
- Oh, good morning, Miss Marple.
- Good morning, Mr. Stringer.

71
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,416
Good morning, Hilda.

72
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:47,747
One moment.

73
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,624
<i>The Hat Rack Hanging.</i>
I've been keeping it for you.

74
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:58,472
Mr. Stringer, would you say
I was an unstable woman?

75
00:07:58,642 --> 00:07:59,685
Certainly not.

76
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,936
- In full possession of my faculties?
- Absolutely.

77
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,561
- Not given to hallucinations?
- Why, no.

78
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,768
Thank you, Mr. Stringer.

79
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:10,019
- The police think I'm dotty.
- What?

80
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,686
Apparently what I saw
was a young man and woman...

81
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,857
...in the throes of connubial bliss.

82
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,277
I see. Well, if I were you,
Miss Marple...

83
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,908
...I would certainly write
to the chief constable.

84
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,948
How many detective novels would you
say we have read over the years?

85
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,786
Impossible to say.
Certainly many hundreds.

86
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,836
Yes. Which gives us,
wouldn't you agree...

87
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:31,414
...a certain knowledge
of the criminal mind?

88
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,707
Most assuredly.

89
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,965
Well, this is where we put
that knowledge to the test.

90
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,262
- We?
- Yes, we.

91
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,637
So it has come in.

92
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:50,144
- Has it?
- Well, I think I have first call.

93
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,525
I don't think you'll like it, Hilda.
Too obvious.

94
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:53,977
The mother did it, of course.

95
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,279
How can you know that?
The book has just come in.

96
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,077
It always is with Falcon Smith.
A deprived child, you know.

97
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:05,247
Hot buttered crumpets for tea,
Mr. Stringer, if you care to join me.

98
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,413
Indeed I would, Miss Marple.

99
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:14,964
Yes, here we are.

100
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,840
Now I calculate
the 5:00 express to Brackhampton...

101
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,678
...overtook my train
somewhere about there.

102
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,724
But how can you be sure?

103
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:27,429
Well, I remember the ticket collector
saying, "Five minutes to Brackhampton."

104
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:30,691
It couldn't have been more than
a minute after the murder he came in.

105
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,433
So that makes it six minutes
before Brackhampton...

106
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:37,028
...at, say, 30 miles an hour.

107
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,327
So about there.

108
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,656
But the body, Miss Marple?

109
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,237
Well, it seems clear
that was thrown from the train...

110
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,040
...between here and Brackhampton.

111
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,914
- The police found nothing.
- Of course not.

112
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:53,954
The murderer returned before the search
and disposed of the body.

113
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,466
By Jove, the police will certainly
want to investigate now.

114
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:00,174
Well, according to them,
there is nothing to investigate.

115
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,636
Surely, in the light of our theory,
a fresh search...

116
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:05,477
Certainly. But this time
we will conduct our own.

117
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,807
Yes, Mr. Stringer.

118
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,982
I recommend
a hearty breakfast tomorrow.

119
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,732
You and I are going to take
an early morning walk.

120
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,322
There must be something somewhere.

121
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,988
You can't throw a body
out of a fast-moving train...

122
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,243
...without leaving some kind of trace.

123
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:32,495
Miss Marple,
if we linger here much longer...

124
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,545
...I feel certain we shall be apprehended.

125
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:38,166
Oh, nonsense. No one will give
a couple of tracklayers a second glance.

126
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:41,179
I'm not altogether convinced
our disguises are adequate.

127
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:44,348
A shoe, a bit of cloth, something.

128
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,186
I'll concede our timetable
may have been out of date...

129
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,808
...but I'm quite sure
the 7: 15 is still running.

130
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,729
- Very possibly.
- But it could be most dangerous up here.

131
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,810
Undoubtedly.

132
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:13,872
Miss Marple.

133
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,789
- Miss Marple.
- Yes?

134
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,717
There you are.
I think I heard something.

135
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:22,926
And I think I've found something.

136
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,556
Really?

137
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:39,149
Consistent with something having been
dumped from a train, wouldn't you say?

138
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:45,411
If it was the body, it would roll down
and finish up against this wall.

139
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:47,570
Then where is it?

140
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:50,831
That, Mr. Stringer, is the question.

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,076
It could be buried.

142
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:55,624
You'd need a pick or a shovel.

143
00:11:55,796 --> 00:12:00,588
No, this is hardly an ideal spot
for disposing of a body.

144
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,586
Unless...

145
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,354
From her fur collar, I think.

146
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,777
Mr. Stringer,
will you kindly give me a leg up?

147
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:22,609
- Really, Miss Marple, l...
- Please, Mr. Stringer.

148
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,242
No, no.

149
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,528
Make a stirrup.

150
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:32,533
- Come on, careful. Are you ready?
- Yes.

151
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,291
- Interlock your fingers.
- They are interlocked.

152
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,170
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

153
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,381
Up.

154
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,125
Magnificent.

155
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:45,346
Down.

156
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:53,305
- What a frightful-looking man.
- What a frightful-looking dog.

157
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,052
Miss Marple,
prudence demands a retreat.

158
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,683
Mr. Stringer, I am convinced the body
is on the other side of this wall.

159
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,351
But that's the Ackenthorpe Hall Estate.

160
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,237
I know. Perfect.

161
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,529
Easy for someone to come down
out of the house...

162
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,535
...recover the body, and dispose of it
somewhere in the grounds.

163
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,992
Someone from the house?
You mean one of the family?

164
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:15,580
Yes. Or one of the servants,
if they're lucky enough to have any.

165
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,496
Servants. I wonder...

166
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,881
Miss Marple, whatever it is, no, no.

167
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:28,253
Mr. Stringer,
we will withdraw temporarily.

168
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,902
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,073
I'm afraid there's
nothing on my books.

170
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:49,701
Not so much as a mother's help.

171
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm seeking a post, not offering one.

172
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,200
- Pray be seated, do, my good woman.
- Thank you.

173
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,998
You need seek no more.
You've come to the right place.

174
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:05,715
How good to see the spirit
of unselfish service is still with us.

175
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,794
Let me see now.

176
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,927
Yes. Here's a perfect plum.

177
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:12,588
"Cheerful home for cheerful lady.

178
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:15,886
Own suite, TV, radio and the use of car.

179
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,517
Tea in bed on Sundays.
Pension scheme."

180
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:19,732
Heaven forbid.

181
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,727
Oh, all right.

182
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:24,396
"Mrs. Forbes Alexbridge.

183
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,313
Setting up house near Monte Carlo."

184
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,481
They won't have any foreigners,
of course.

185
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,068
"Own gaming allowance."

186
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,820
Well, I don't approve of gambling.

187
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:36,244
"Mrs. Hamilton Potts."
The Dingley Stud Farm, you know.

188
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:38,953
"Seven children, eldest, 7."

189
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,407
Oh, no, thank you.

190
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,083
Perhaps if I might have a quiet word
with Mrs. Binster.

191
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,426
I am Mrs. Binster.

192
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,844
Oh, I see.

193
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,259
Well, as a matter of fact...

194
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:56,599
...I wondered if there might be a position
at Ackenthorpe Hall?

195
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,303
- Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Yes, Ackenthorpe Hall.

196
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:04,848
Oh, yes, I think I can accommodate you.

197
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:08,230
Yes, there's always a vacancy there.

198
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,378
Thank you.

199
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:27,401
Yes?

200
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:31,444
I'm Jane
from Mrs. Binster's Employment Agency.

201
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,238
The new maid.

202
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:37,452
Well, you look old enough
to know better. Come in.

203
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,509
I am to see Miss Ackenthorpe.

204
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:56,631
You're expected. In there.

205
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,802
- Miss Ackenthorpe?
- Yes?

206
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,309
I'm Jane.

207
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:12,602
- The new maid?
- Yes, Jane Marple.

208
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,567
Now, if you'll kindly show me
where I'm to put my things...

209
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:18,778
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

210
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:23,160
But I'm wondering if this post is really
what you're looking for, Miss Marple.

211
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:26,084
Well, naturally.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

212
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,251
I don't want a housekeeper, you know.

213
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,627
I want someone to...
Well, to do the work.

214
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:35,003
Yes. You want cooking, washing up,
beds made, floors scrubbed...

215
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:38,178
...fires lit, ashes taken away,
I quite understand.

216
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:42,591
- Well, I hope you'll find us suitable.
- I'm sure I shall.

217
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,761
Perhaps you won't find the work
too exacting.

218
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:46,265
There are only the three of us.

219
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:49,605
Myself, my nephew
down from school for the holidays...

220
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:51,937
...and then there's Father.

221
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,436
- May I show you to your room?
- Yes, certainly.

222
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:58,907
I'll take that, my dear.

223
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,567
Perhaps the clubs, if you wouldn't mind.

224
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,619
I must keep fit, you know.

225
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,078
Yes, of course.

226
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,491
Our staff consists of Hillman,
the gardener...

227
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,497
...and Mrs. Kidder, she let you in.

228
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:14,128
She comes in from the village
three afternoons a week...

229
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,126
...to do the rough work.

230
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,838
That was my grandfather.
He founded the family fortune.

231
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,137
- Tea biscuits, you know.
- Oh, yes.

232
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,977
And very excellent biscuits
they were too.

233
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,974
Quite a severe man, I'm afraid.

234
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:32,648
Miss Marple, I think it only fair
to explain to you...

235
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:35,143
...that my father himself is...

236
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,728
Well, quite frankly,
he's a bit difficult at times.

237
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,864
He's an invalid, you know.

238
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,943
He's very keen on economy...

239
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,575
...and he sometimes says things
that upset people.

240
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:45,861
I wouldn't want you to...

241
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,373
I'm quite used to looking
after elderly people of all sorts.

242
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,168
We'll manage.

243
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:56,502
Emma? Emma? I hear you?

244
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:58,751
Yes, Father. Excuse me one moment.

245
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:01,134
Don't try to sneak off.

246
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,716
Is that the new girl with you?

247
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,346
Well, yes, Father.

248
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,508
Hope she's got a bit more meat on her
than the last one.

249
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,561
Can't stand them skinny.

250
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:13,020
Don't just stand there boggling,
girl, bring her in.

251
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,184
- I want to look at her.
- Yes.

252
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,353
Will you come in, please?

253
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,869
Father, this is Miss Marple. Jane.

254
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,034
And a plainer Jane
I've never set eyes on.

255
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,042
Well, we can't all be young and
handsome, can we, Mr. Ackenthorpe?

256
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:37,883
There's one thing
I can't tolerate and that is impertinence.

257
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,718
Well, we should get on admirably.
Neither can I.

258
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,469
Well, if you're coming to stay here...

259
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,716
...there's one thing
you'd better understand.

260
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,726
Because I live in a big house...

261
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,302
...it doesn't necessarily follow
that I'm a rich man...

262
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,351
...so there's no good coming here
with extravagant ideas.

263
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:58,225
I live here because I want to,
not because I can afford it.

264
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:00,739
- Father, don't you think...?
- No, I don't.

265
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:04,571
- Can you cook?
- If you want good English cooking, yes.

266
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,578
Cod's as good as lobster any day,
and much cheaper.

267
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:13,910
That depends on whether or not one
has a palate unsullied by cheap opiates.

268
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,830
If you mean what I think you mean...

269
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,665
...this cheroot cost two shillings.

270
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,253
Yes, quite.

271
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:22,256
I'll show Miss Marple to her room.
This way, please.

272
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,421
Good idea.

273
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,894
That was Hillman, the gardener.

274
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:35,182
When Mr. Ackenthorpe wants
to move about, he always calls him.

275
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,982
They're quite close.

276
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:40,271
Will you be staying, Miss Marple... Jane?

277
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,604
Why, my dear lady, of course.

278
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,026
I'm so glad.

279
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:47,485
Emma. Come back here.
You've forgotten my medicine.

280
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:49,950
Excuse me a moment.
That's your room, down there.

281
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:53,123
- The door opposite the small stairs.
- I'll find it. Don't you worry.

282
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,793
- May I give you those?
- Of course.

283
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,953
- All right?
- Yes, thank you.

284
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:12,363
Come out at once.

285
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,873
I advise you to come out.

286
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:19,956
Very well.

287
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:47,152
You're Miss Emma's nephew, I presume.

288
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:50,407
Yes. Alexander Eastley. How do you do?

289
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:53,945
How do you do? I'm Jane, Jane Marple.

290
00:22:54,663 --> 00:22:57,285
Yes. It is disappointing, isn't it?

291
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,497
I'd rather hoped
for the Jayne Mansfield type.

292
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,206
I see you have something in common
with your grandfather.

293
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,254
Oh, we're very alike in many ways.

294
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,547
Mind you, I'm not mean with money.

295
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:10,838
He'll stop that vase
out of your wages, you know.

296
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:14,182
It's just as well you got out
of the way, otherwise...

297
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,137
It'd have been my head,
and you'd have got 10 years.

298
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,432
That is still possible.

299
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:27,944
You know, it isn't just that
you don't look like Jayne Mansfield...

300
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,940
...you're not my idea of a maid, either.

301
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:34,661
Well, quite honestly, I don't think
you'd be everybody's idea of a boy.

302
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:37,366
You know, there's something
decidedly fishy about you.

303
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:41,285
I can see you'll have to go.
After Mrs. Kidder, of course.

304
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,618
She's next. Depressing creature.

305
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:45,041
So was Annie.

306
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,171
- Annie?
- Your predecessor.

307
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:50,710
Thin as a rake and a shocking cook.
Can you cook?

308
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,135
Well, I think I've done better
than Annie.

309
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,092
Grandfather's like that too,
and he hates his dinner to be late.

310
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,595
I'd leave your unpacking until later,
if I were you.

311
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:05,473
Well, in that case, hadn't you better
show me the way to the kitchen?

312
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,320
Very well, Jane.

313
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,910
- Emma.
- That's him.

314
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,538
Always shouting about something.

315
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:21,375
- Mostly money. This way.
- Emma.

316
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,329
Of course, they're all waiting for him
to drop dead, you know.

317
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,330
Frightful pack of vultures, our family.

318
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:28,249
Except possibly Aunt Emma.

319
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,500
And who are these vultures?

320
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,345
There's Uncle Harold,
stinking rich and just as mean.

321
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:36,050
Uncle Albert, deadly dull, poor fellow.

322
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:39,972
Then there's Uncle Cedric.
He paints, but not for art's sake.

323
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,765
Do you know, last year,
he and one of his models...

324
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,855
- Alexander!
- Well, he's like that.

325
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,851
- There was an Uncle Edmond.
- Was?

326
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,398
Yes. Stopped a whole bomb
during the war, all by himself.

327
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:57,025
Wasn't another man around for miles.
Deserting, probably.

328
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,409
And who can be held responsible
for you?

329
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:03,241
Well put. Mummy's name was Edith,
but she's dead.

330
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:05,952
Daddy's Brian Eastley, you know.

331
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,334
You know, the fighter ace.
Battle of Britain.

332
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,747
- Oh, the Brian Eastley.
- Yes.

333
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:14,874
I'm going to set him up in business when
I get my inheritance from Grandfather.

334
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:16,096
Here we are.

335
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,549
There you are, and about time too.
Well, I'm off.

336
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:23,893
I wouldn't stay in this place after dark.
Not for all the tea in China.

337
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:27,147
Now look, the pots and pans
are on that shelf there, over the stove.

338
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:32,108
- Oh, yes.
- The groceries and provisions, in there.

339
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,938
- Thank you.
- Well, cheerio.

340
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:38,401
- Good day.
- Good day, Mrs. Kidder.

341
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:41,329
- What's the matter with you?
- I was merely being polite.

342
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,409
Charming, isn't she, Jane?

343
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:48,545
- I think you should see this. Come on.
- What?

344
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:51,541
Phase four, anti-Kidder campaign.

345
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,434
Splendid.

346
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,477
Dinner at 8, please, Jane.

347
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,662
I see you made yourself comfortable.

348
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,161
I trust you have no objection.

349
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,590
Maybe.

350
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,338
I shouldn't make yourself
too comfortable if I was you.

351
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:28,706
Yes?

352
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:33,619
- Who are you?
- I'm the new maid, sir.

353
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:36,625
Doctor Quimper.
You'll get used to seeing me here.

354
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,378
- Alexander, I suppose?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

355
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,924
Well, Mr. Ackenthorpe
will be expecting me.

356
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:45,341
Oh, yes. I'll show you up.

357
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:47,174
Oh, that won't be...

358
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,475
The doctor...

359
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,770
Where on earth
are my confounded matches?

360
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,155
Oh, it's you.

361
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,065
- Good morning.
- Morning.

362
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,158
What are you doing in here?
Snooping, I suppose.

363
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,366
Where are my matches?

364
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,960
If you're going to smoke,
we'd better have some windows open.

365
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:18,461
I'm a great believer in fresh air,
aren't you, doctor?

366
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,956
Why, yes, I am, Miss...?

367
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,632
Marple her name, marble her nature.

368
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,138
That's right.
Let her give me double pneumonia.

369
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,594
If you can't kill me off one way,
you'll kill me off another.

370
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:37,471
Nonsense. You're going to live to be
100 in spite of anything I can do.

371
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,564
In that case, tell that woman to stop
opening windows and light my cheroot.

372
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:44,738
Is there any chance
that will send him to sleep, doctor?

373
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,239
I'm afraid it's a stimulant.

374
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,990
Roll over.

375
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:52,990
Oh, dear.

376
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,955
Hold it closer, woman.

377
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:08,094
Your hometown lost a good horse doctor
when you left, Quimper.

378
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,552
As a matter of fact,
I was very bad with the horses.

379
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,844
How'd the birthday party go?
All the family get down all right?

380
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:16,557
Of course they did.
Made a whole weekend of it.

381
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,684
- Board and lodging from Friday night.
- Friday.

382
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,976
- What's that to do with you?
- Oh, nothing.

383
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:26,439
It just happened to be
an interesting day for me too.

384
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,275
How old were you, Mr. Ackenthorpe?

385
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:32,282
Mind your business.
Anyhow, it was a miserable weekend.

386
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,033
I hope it'll be a long time...

387
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:36,282
...before I have to put up
with them again.

388
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,670
Not a very nice way
to talk about one's family.

389
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,248
Not a very nice family.

390
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,292
And you know what
that overgrown beatnik Cedric, did?

391
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,957
Told Emma, in front of me,
she ought to get out of here.

392
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,505
Get married or something.
Tried to make her as selfish as he is.

393
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:55,390
I don't know. If Emma did marry,
it wouldn't be such a bad thing.

394
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,017
Father, I thought I'd tell you
I'm going into town.

395
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,431
I'll be leaving in a moment.
Can I give you a lift?

396
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,645
What do you want to go to town for?
Can't she go for whatever it is?

397
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,026
Well, it's tradesmen, Father.
A few bills to pay.

398
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:11,242
Money. All right, it's a different thing.
Can't trust anybody these days.

399
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,821
All right, off you go.

400
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:15,237
- In that case, may I be of service?
- Thank you.

401
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,201
Of course you can, Quimper.
Save the price of a taxi.

402
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,582
- Pay you enough as it is.
- It'll be on your bill.

403
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,087
- You ready now?
- Only my coat.

404
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:25,837
Good. Friday, then, Mr. Ackenthorpe.
Good day, Miss Marple.

405
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:27,634
Good day, doctor.

406
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:31,585
If you don't shut those windows,
you'll be fired.

407
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:36,390
In that case, I shall require
four weeks wages in lieu of notice.

408
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,605
- Get out of my sight, woman!
- With pleasure.

409
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,682
Your weight
isn't quite evenly distributed.

410
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:26,145
I'll have you know that I won
the Ladies Open Handicap in 1921.

411
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:27,778
Really?

412
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:32,365
- I'm sure you have many things to do.
- Not at all. I'm most interested.

413
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,656
We've never had
a golf-playing maid before.

414
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,496
You may have heard that this is the age
of the common woman.

415
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,828
- You hooked.
- I'm aware of it.

416
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,344
- You know something?
- What?

417
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:58,552
I believe you pulled those shots
on purpose.

418
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:01,854
Alexander, if you wish
to be helpful at all...

419
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:06,232
...will you kindly look for the hook
while I look for the slice?

420
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,141
Found yours yet?

421
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:23,768
Yes, have you?

422
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,560
Disappeared without a trace.

423
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,556
Well, fortunately I have some more.

424
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:30,483
At the present rate,
you're going to need them.

425
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:34,564
Perhaps you would care
to demonstrate the next one.

426
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:35,936
Certainly.

427
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,910
Let's see how close you can get
to those outbuildings.

428
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,037
Yes, I think that's possible.

429
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,635
Fair.

430
00:34:57,511 --> 00:35:01,176
You know perfectly well it was superb
for a boy of my age.

431
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:13,062
Right on the fairway.

432
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:15,809
A chip and a putt
and I'd have holed out in three.

433
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:19,111
Does your grandfather keep horses,
Alexander?

434
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,150
He did. Now he just keeps a few relics
of a more spacious age.

435
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,527
Nostalgia, you know.

436
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,908
A failing of the old, I suppose.
Like to look?

437
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,918
Well, I think I'm old enough don't you?

438
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,844
An old-fashioned Pony chaise.

439
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,089
They used that for going to the village.

440
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,590
I suppose they used the Victoria
for going to church?

441
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,722
Yes, on Sundays in the summer,
I believe.

442
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,470
And the brougham's for visiting
in the winter perhaps.

443
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,273
Yes, I expect so.

444
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,435
It's supposed to be haunted here,
you know.

445
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,734
Grandfather found a man
hanging from this rafter.

446
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,573
- Good heavens.
- He'd been dead a week.

447
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,234
- That will do.
- All purple.

448
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,903
Alexander.

449
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,327
- What was that?
- I wonder.

450
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,205
All right. I'll look.

451
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,117
All yours.

452
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,544
Dear, dear, we are nervous, aren't we?

453
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,716
Pity.

454
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:20,125
- Well, what did you expect to find?
- Bodies.

455
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:22,972
- What?
- Live ones, of course.

456
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:25,926
Used to be quite the spot
for courting couples from the town...

457
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,306
...till grandfather got Hillman to stop it.

458
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,763
Spoil sport. Quite extraordinary,
the goings-on here.

459
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,644
- Apparently there was this girl...
- That's enough, Alexander.

460
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,652
There may be some other
poor bird trapped.

461
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,836
Look at this.

462
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,835
Somebody else must have been in here.

463
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,087
- This isn't Aunt Emma's.
- It's mine.

464
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,430
I must have dropped it.
Thank you so much.

465
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,841
It was bequeathed to me.

466
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,936
You're not, by any chance, on the run
from the police, are you?

467
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,184
Too much television.

468
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:17,606
You must learn to rationalize
your imagination.

469
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,942
What's behind there?

470
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,654
More relics from the past?

471
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,281
Matter of fact, yes.

472
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,488
The fruits of grandfather's
Egyptian phase.

473
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,119
Indeed.

474
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,280
How interesting.

475
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,552
- No one's allowed in there.
- Let go of my wrist.

476
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,171
- What are you up to?
- Up to?

477
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,837
- The boy was showing me around.
- What boy?

478
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,054
- Alexander. He...
- You're lying.

479
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,229
Alexander, come out of there at once.

480
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:59,556
I thought discretion
the better part of valor, Jane.

481
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,308
This fellow's not above clipping
a person's ear.

482
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,358
You know your grandfather don't like
no one sneaking around here.

483
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,240
Don't think I won't tell him, neither.

484
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,983
Despite the double negatives,
I'm sure you will.

485
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,953
Come, Jane.

486
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,620
Good for you, young man.

487
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,054
What?

488
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,847
No.

489
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,766
No.

490
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,055
Now, listen, Mr. Stringer...

491
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:04,346
...I want you to inform the police,
anonymously.

492
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,395
Don't mention me yet.

493
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,772
I wish to be in at the kill, so to speak.

494
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,313
Miss Marple, really.

495
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:14,863
All right, but it makes my blood run cold
to think of you there alone.

496
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:19,445
I was wondering, perhaps they have
a vacancy for a gardener?

497
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,537
They've got one.

498
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,279
Very well, I'll do as you say.

499
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,415
Miss Marple, the compact.

500
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,160
If the murderer should know
that you have it...

501
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,747
I'll be careful, dear Mr. Stringer.

502
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,250
Now phone the inspector right away.

503
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,776
- Well?
- Never seen her before in my life.

504
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,073
No, she's not from these parts.

505
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,913
Well, whoever she is,
I want her out of here at once.

506
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,992
If you hadn't left the barn unlocked
this wouldn't have happened.

507
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,084
We wouldn't have these people
poking their noses into everything.

508
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,087
- Are you all right, Father?
- Of course I'm all right.

509
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,170
Think I've never seen a corpse before?

510
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,422
Be one myself soon.

511
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,298
Perhaps you'd better
go back to the house.

512
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,434
I'll follow you up.

513
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,691
Whoever it was tried
to get her in here first.

514
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,280
It must've taken the strength
of a maniac to shift it this far.

515
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,028
Inspector?

516
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,453
Oh, yes, doctor.

517
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,658
I don't know whether
this is being helpful...

518
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,657
Go on.

519
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,041
Well, the woman, no one recognized her.

520
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,831
And her clothes struck me as
being foreign. Perhaps French.

521
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,213
Yes, that's very interesting.
Yes, thank you, doctor.

522
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,680
Well, it was just a thought.

523
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,723
Maybe a useful one. Thank you.

524
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,935
That would explain why
I didn't recognize her, sir.

525
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,820
I know every face for miles around.

526
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,365
I'm sure you do, sergeant.

527
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,525
Still, I have to start
with the assumption...

528
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,073
...there's some connection
between her and the family.

529
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,534
I think I'll get the whole bunch
down here.

530
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,660
There'll be fireworks, sir.
They hate the sight of each other.

531
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,163
So I believe.

532
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,163
Anyway, routine first.

533
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,710
Have they any other servants
apart from this gardener?

534
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,709
Yes, they have, inspector.

535
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:44,567
Good Lord.

536
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:46,693
- You.
- Yes.

537
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:48,986
Dotty old me.

538
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,674
In there, please.

539
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:14,554
It's only a cigarette packet.
Of doubtful significance, I'd say.

540
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:16,718
I'll bear your views in mind.

541
00:45:16,893 --> 00:45:20,262
Any idea what you expect
your fellows to find?

542
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:22,432
- Clues.
- Well, naturally.

543
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:25,774
But do you seriously think
they'll find anything?

544
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:30,147
Well, somebody dragged the body
from there over to there.

545
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:33,241
It's possible something could have been
dropped in the process.

546
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,613
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

547
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:39,955
- Did you find anything?
- No, inspector. Not a thing.

548
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:43,244
- Family's here, by the way.
- Thank you.

549
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,163
I'll get around to them later.

550
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:48,837
They'll enjoy that, I'm sure.
Good hunting.

551
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:55,212
Some silly idiot goes
and strangles his girlfriend...

552
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,307
...which she probably richly deserved,
and what do they do?

553
00:45:58,476 --> 00:45:59,935
Swarm all over the place...

554
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,179
...mess about in our private affairs.

555
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:05,439
I said to this inspector fellow,
Haddock, or whatever his name is...

556
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:07,983
Craddock, sir.

557
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:11,070
- Shall I pour?
- Of course.

558
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:13,778
Anyway, I said to this fellow, Haddock...

559
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,615
...that no member of my family had ever
seen the woman, and that was final.

560
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:19,780
Well, what makes you
so sure of that, Father?

561
00:46:19,956 --> 00:46:21,201
Now, Cedric, this is absurd.

562
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:23,782
Well, after all, Harold,
she wasn't from around here...

563
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,202
...and she was found in our stable,
wasn't she?

564
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,206
One of us could have known her.

565
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:30,216
She could've been your girlfriend,
dear boy.

566
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:31,468
What?

567
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:34,671
Yes, yes, I suppose
Cedric has a point there.

568
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:38,092
- He never has a point.
- I mean, from the police point of view.

569
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:39,677
It's all right for you, Eastley.

570
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:42,686
I don't suppose you're too concerned
with the family reputation.

571
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:45,855
After all, you're not a member of it,
are you, strictly speaking?

572
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:48,396
What I can't understand
is who telephoned the police.

573
00:46:48,568 --> 00:46:50,893
Oh, I know who did that.

574
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:53,823
Who?

575
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,024
Obviously someone who knew
the body was there.

576
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:00,992
Any coffee left, Jane?

577
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:03,366
Help yourself.

578
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,160
Well, it certainly wasn't one of us.

579
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:08,909
- Who knows?
- Who cares who did it anyway?

580
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:12,043
- The woman was probably a spy.
- That's absurd, Father.

581
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:13,877
The police think she was a foreigner.

582
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:17,088
Well, lots of English girls go to Paris
and buy French clothes.

583
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:19,389
Decent ones don't.

584
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:22,309
Doctor Quimper to see you,
Mr. Ackenthorpe.

585
00:47:22,477 --> 00:47:25,727
Still getting shot
with revitalizers, Father?

586
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:28,518
I'd take anything to outlive you lot...

587
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:32,025
...and keep my property from
your thieving hands.

588
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:39,113
Well, I'll just go and see if I can be
of any further assistance to the police.

589
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:41,693
Delicious coffee, Jane.

590
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:48,742
By the way, the inspector said
he'd be interrogating you all later.

591
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,411
Better get your alibis ready.

592
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,548
He's a bright boy, that one.

593
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:58,003
Well, let's face it, the police say
the woman was murdered on Friday...

594
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,971
...and we were down here last Friday.

595
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,132
They're gonna be very interested
in all of us.

596
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:04,135
But none of us were here till quite late.

597
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,640
Yes, but the point is,
what were we all doing earlier?

598
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:10,642
Albert, what about you?

599
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,062
- Me?
- Yes, you.

600
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,228
Don't tell me you were
in your office all day.

601
00:48:14,404 --> 00:48:17,073
L... Well, no.

602
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,190
As a matter of fact, there was a film
that I particularly wanted to see.

603
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,744
A Brigitte Bardot?

604
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:24,739
Now, look, Cedric, this is preposterous.

605
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:28,248
Oh, well, is it, Harold?
Very well, what about you?

606
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,917
Or can your secretary verify
all your movements on that day?

607
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:34,840
- That's none of your business.
- Well, I'm in the clear.

608
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:37,000
I was at my club.

609
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,135
It has a back door, hasn't it?

610
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:43,088
Yes, I think so, but I didn't get
here until Saturday.

611
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:45,840
But you could've lugged
the body up here on Friday...

612
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:47,347
...slipped back to London...

613
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,936
...and be sitting in your usual chair
when the club closed.

614
00:48:51,107 --> 00:48:53,645
I suppose one of your women friends
can vouch for you?

615
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:58,030
Why, I'm certain my current comfort
will satisfy the inspector completely...

616
00:48:58,198 --> 00:49:00,867
...as, no doubt, will your secretary.

617
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:05,572
When you've finished here, will you
kindly bring me some fresh coffee...

618
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:06,909
...into the library?

619
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:08,624
Certainly, sir.

620
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,579
Well, well, jumpy, isn't he?

621
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:13,164
And you're very calm.

622
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:15,663
But then, I've no reason not to be.

623
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:21,547
I've just been thinking.

624
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:23,931
If that woman was foreign...

625
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,091
You should think of girls
more often, Albert.

626
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:28,011
Might bring about
some changes in you.

627
00:49:28,186 --> 00:49:30,309
- I know it's laughable.
- I agree.

628
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,058
No, but, I mean, if she was French...
It could be her, I suppose.

629
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:36,812
All right, I give up. Could be who?

630
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:39,149
That Martine woman.

631
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,155
- Martine?
- Yes.

632
00:49:41,324 --> 00:49:44,076
You know that French farm girl
we had all the trouble about?

633
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:47,161
The one Edmond was so infatuated with
before he was killed?

634
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,366
- But that was ages ago.
- Yes, I know.

635
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:53,074
Still, I suppose it is possible.

636
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:57,381
But why should she turn up dead
in our stable 16 years later?

637
00:49:57,549 --> 00:50:01,083
- It's preposterous.
- Well, it isn't my idea.

638
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:02,671
Well, whose idea is it then?

639
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,470
Well, Emma's.

640
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:07,225
Emma?

641
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,269
Emma's?

642
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:11,179
That's odd.

643
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:17,777
Paul.

644
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:36,456
- Darling.
- No, Paul, please.

645
00:50:36,629 --> 00:50:38,752
How much longer are we
going on like this, Emma?

646
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:41,046
We've got to tell the old man.

647
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,969
- Not yet. Please, not yet.
- Why? Why?

648
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,637
Paul...

649
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:49,222
...I think someone in the family
may be a murderer.

650
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:50,602
Emma.

651
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:55,351
I've had a letter.
I can't keep it to myself any longer.

652
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:57,682
I want you to read it.

653
00:50:59,194 --> 00:51:02,230
I'm afraid my French isn't up to this.

654
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,946
"Dear Miss Ackenthorpe...

655
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,654
...you will be surprised to hear,
after so many years...

656
00:51:07,827 --> 00:51:10,401
...that you have a sister-in-law.

657
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,660
I married your brother Edmond
two days before he was killed in action.

658
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,076
I decided it was best
to forget the marriage...

659
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:19,246
...but now I'm planning
a visit to England...

660
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:22,340
...and I find I do wish to meet you all.

661
00:51:22,675 --> 00:51:26,969
I write to you instead of your father
because I understand he is a sick man...

662
00:51:27,138 --> 00:51:31,765
...and my existence may come as a
shock to him, as it must be to you all.

663
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:36,098
Sincerely yours, Martine Ackenthorpe."

664
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:39,815
But I thought Edmond was killed
before they had a chance to marry.

665
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:41,776
That's what we all thought.

666
00:51:42,529 --> 00:51:44,770
- What's on your mind, Emma?
- Well, don't you see?

667
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:47,273
The strangled woman,
it must have been Martine.

668
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:50,237
Listen, if she could've proved
she was really Edmond's widow...

669
00:51:50,412 --> 00:51:52,534
...she'd have been entitled
to share in the will.

670
00:51:52,705 --> 00:51:54,791
Oh, I see.

671
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,951
Paul, what shall I do?

672
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,870
- Have you told the others?
- No.

673
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:04,121
I did suggest to Albert that if the woman
was French, she might be Martine.

674
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,498
What did he say?

675
00:52:05,677 --> 00:52:09,461
He said it was fantastic,
but I think he was worried.

676
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:14,059
You'll have to tell the police.

677
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:16,433
They're bound to think
one of the family did this.

678
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:17,885
What else can you do?

679
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:20,353
I don't know. I don't know.

680
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:22,933
I think you must tell them.

681
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:25,769
I'll have to think about this.

682
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:28,482
You'd better go.

683
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,994
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

684
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:36,764
- Oh, there you are.
- The train was late, Miss Marple. L...

685
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:39,893
Good evening, inspector.

686
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:42,102
I suppose you knew about
this compact business?

687
00:53:42,273 --> 00:53:43,858
- Well, l...
- Before I did, no doubt?

688
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:45,068
Well, you see...

689
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:48,568
I thought it best to bring the inspector
in on this after all, Mr. Stringer.

690
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:51,739
- Very wise. Very wise.
- I'm glad you think so.

691
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:54,911
Withholding information from
the police is a serious matter.

692
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:57,908
Oh, I know, inspector,
and I'm most awfully sorry.

693
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:01,035
- Will you take tea?
- Thank you, no.

694
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,208
Don't you realize what this means?

695
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:05,370
The compact having been stolen
from your room?

696
00:54:05,547 --> 00:54:06,875
Coffee perhaps?

697
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:10,251
It means that the thief and the murderer
are almost certainly the same...

698
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:12,752
...and that he or she is in that house...

699
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:15,421
...and that your life may be
in great danger.

700
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:17,924
Oh, I say, do you really think so?

701
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,596
Now, I must ask you to give the whole
thing up immediately, tonight.

702
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:25,105
Yes, of course.
Indeed you must, Miss Marple.

703
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:31,154
Very well, then, I'll give in
my notice tomorrow.

704
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:32,365
Good.

705
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:34,439
That's settled then.

706
00:54:34,617 --> 00:54:37,618
It has to be a month's notice, you know.

707
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:41,957
- Will you have a small beer, inspector?
- Miss Marple, I...

708
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,580
Oh, what's the use?

709
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:49,873
- Good night.
- Good night.

710
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:55,217
Well, now, how did you get
on at the Probate Registry?

711
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:58,639
Really, Miss Marple, I think,
in view of what the inspector said...

712
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:01,180
- Did you see the will?
- Yes.

713
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,176
And what did it say?

714
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:07,815
Well, old Mr. Ackenthorpe's father
obviously didn't get on well with him.

715
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,893
I'm not surprised at that. Go on.

716
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,853
You see, the house and the income
from the family fortune are his...

717
00:55:14,032 --> 00:55:17,483
...but he can't touch the fortune itself.

718
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,736
That's the first point.

719
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:21,331
Yes?

720
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:25,116
The second point is that the fortune
goes to his children on his death.

721
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:28,709
- To Emma, Cedric, Harold and Albert.
- Yes.

722
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,086
Two of the others in the will,
Edith and Edmond...

723
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:32,835
...are already dead, of course.

724
00:55:33,676 --> 00:55:34,957
That much more for the rest.

725
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,627
Well, young Alexander,
Edith's son, gets her share.

726
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:39,597
What about the boy's father, Eastley?

727
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:43,016
Next of kin only come in for a share
if there's no issue of a marriage.

728
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:46,353
So Eastley's only interest is
how much young Alexander gets?

729
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:50,686
- Dr. Quimper to see you, sir.
- Oh, yes, send him in.

730
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:53,477
Your call to the Probate Registry's
been very useful.

731
00:55:53,655 --> 00:55:55,030
Thanks.

732
00:55:55,824 --> 00:55:57,909
- Morning, inspector.
- Morning, doctor, sit down.

733
00:55:58,118 --> 00:55:59,576
Thank you.

734
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:02,361
Have you found out
who the woman is yet?

735
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:05,041
The French police haven't come up
with anything so far, sir.

736
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:08,538
You are working on the assumption
that she's French, then?

737
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:12,045
The clothes and makeup did turn out
to be made in Paris, yes.

738
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,457
Is that what you wanted
to see me about?

739
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:16,212
No, sir.

740
00:56:17,345 --> 00:56:19,053
I understand last Christmas...

741
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:21,215
...old Mr. Ackenthorpe
had a stomach upset.

742
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:25,258
Yes, he's inclined to overindulge
when there's too much rich food about.

743
00:56:25,437 --> 00:56:28,437
But he said you had asked him
a lot of questions...

744
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:30,806
...as though you suspected
arsenic poisoning.

745
00:56:30,984 --> 00:56:32,312
All right.

746
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,727
I did suspect
something was a bit odd.

747
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,064
- Didn't you run a food test?
- No.

748
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,520
Why not?

749
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,318
Well, there was nothing positive.
No history of chronic gastric trouble...

750
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:46,493
...such as one would expect to find in
the classic method of arsenic poisoning.

751
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,623
You mean small doses
administered regularly?

752
00:56:48,835 --> 00:56:50,503
Exactly.

753
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:53,249
Excuse me.

754
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,553
Yes?

755
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:01,805
Put her on.

756
00:57:01,973 --> 00:57:04,262
- Miss Ackenthorpe.
- Emma?

757
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:07,645
Yes.

758
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:11,349
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. Morning.

759
00:57:11,524 --> 00:57:13,102
<i>I've had a letter from...</i>

760
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:15,236
I see.

761
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:18,816
Well, would you read the letter to me?

762
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,446
<i>"You will be surprised to hear,</i>
<i>after so many years...</i>

763
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:23,776
<i>... that you have...</i>

764
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:26,705
<i>I am planning a visit to England,</i>
<i>and I find I'm"...</i>

765
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:27,916
Thank you.

766
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:31,368
I'd like to send round for that letter
if you don't mind, Miss Ackenthorpe.

767
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:33,336
Yes, we'll check with the French police.

768
00:57:33,505 --> 00:57:36,126
Thank you. Goodbye.

769
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:40,341
Do you know what
that was about, doctor?

770
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:42,801
Yes, I think I do.

771
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:44,052
Why didn't you tell me?

772
00:57:46,851 --> 00:57:50,303
I'm in love with Emma, inspector.
I want to marry her.

773
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,888
I told her I thought
she ought to tell you about this.

774
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:55,105
- But you didn't insist?
- No.

775
00:57:55,276 --> 00:57:58,692
It was important to me, to us,
that she made up her own mind.

776
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:02,943
- I understand, doctor.
- Thank you. Is that all?

777
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:08,246
Doctor, do you think the dead woman
is Martine Ackenthorpe?

778
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:10,407
Well, who else could it be?

779
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:13,288
Do you think she was killed by
a member of the family?

780
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,498
I'd rather not answer that, inspector.

781
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:19,050
All right, doctor.

782
00:58:19,217 --> 00:58:21,340
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

783
00:58:32,939 --> 00:58:34,517
Well, sir?

784
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:36,228
I'm worried, Bacon.

785
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:39,734
- About the doctor?
- No, no, not him.

786
00:58:40,196 --> 00:58:42,189
I'm worried about Miss Marple.

787
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,741
Looking for something, Miss Marple?

788
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:37,587
No, I...

789
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:40,669
Are you...? Are you all right?

790
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,248
Yes, perfectly, thank you, Mr. Eastley.

791
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:44,707
What is it you want?

792
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:47,459
Well, I just thought I'd take up
the old boy's nightcap...

793
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:48,919
...and save you the trouble.

794
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:52,432
That's kind of you. It is ready.

795
01:00:01,152 --> 01:00:04,568
The storm, I expect.
The electricity supply's rather shaky.

796
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,981
Like the rest of the place.

797
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:11,318
- You're a little shaky too, aren't you?
- No, not at all.

798
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:14,872
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

799
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:18,177
Oh, my goodness, what are you doing?

800
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:19,731
Looking for light.

801
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:22,685
- You ought to be asleep.
- I happen to be reading.

802
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:27,021
May I ask what you're doing?

803
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,522
Trying to provide light.

804
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:32,618
Oh, I see. Well, you won't
find it there, you know.

805
01:01:32,786 --> 01:01:35,786
- Indeed?
- It's a power failure. Often happens.

806
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:38,661
- May I borrow this?
- Alexander, come back.

807
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,909
Good night, Jane.

808
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:51,006
Who's that? Who is it?

809
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:58,508
Mr. Cedric, it's a power failure.
Often happens.

810
01:01:58,686 --> 01:02:00,975
I'll have to find some candles,
if you'll excuse me.

811
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:02,689
Just a minute.

812
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:06,271
My sister says you started work here
only a few days ago.

813
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:07,487
Yes.

814
01:02:07,779 --> 01:02:09,736
You don't look like a domestic to me.

815
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:13,115
I have to earn my living,
Mr. Ackenthorpe, like anybody else.

816
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:16,745
The day after you arrived,
the body was discovered.

817
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:20,243
- You found it, didn't you?
- What makes you think that?

818
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:23,246
Because it fits, and so neatly.

819
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:25,878
You telephoned the police, didn't you?

820
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,214
I assure you, I am not the person
who telephoned the police.

821
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:30,546
- You're not?
- No.

822
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:33,591
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?

823
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:36,171
I have already told you.

824
01:02:37,392 --> 01:02:40,677
Well, I'm going to watch you
very closely, Miss Marple.

825
01:02:40,854 --> 01:02:41,896
Jane.

826
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,476
Oh, Hillman, I want
to have a word with you.

827
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:35,867
Help.

828
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:43,875
Help.

829
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,747
What's the matter? What is it?

830
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:54,043
Albert, see to Albert.

831
01:03:57,388 --> 01:04:01,007
Alexander, call the doctor, quickly.

832
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:07,771
There was nothing I could do for him,
I'm afraid, inspector.

833
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:09,686
How are the others now?

834
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:11,733
Well, Emma, Cedric, Harold
and Eastley...

835
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:14,228
...have had only comparatively
minor effects.

836
01:04:14,406 --> 01:04:17,360
And the old man will be all right.
He's a tough old bird.

837
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:19,526
He'll be recovered by morning.

838
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:25,203
- No doubt about the cause?
- No.

839
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,035
They were all poisoned.

840
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,368
Well, thank you, doctor.

841
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:31,585
Quimper! Quimper!

842
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:35,706
Harold. I might have expected him
to bellow the hardest.

843
01:04:41,975 --> 01:04:45,723
- This is the last. Chicken stock.
- Thank you.

844
01:04:52,277 --> 01:04:53,945
- Finished, sergeant?
- Just about, sir.

845
01:04:54,154 --> 01:04:56,395
See that stuff gets
down to the lab right away.

846
01:04:56,573 --> 01:04:58,980
We're pretty well all through for tonight.

847
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:06,624
Well, Miss Marple?

848
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:11,914
Mushroom soup, curried duck,
rice and apple pie.

849
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:14,208
Thank you.

850
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:17,585
- Mushroom soup out of a can?
- Certainly not.

851
01:05:17,761 --> 01:05:21,295
Half a pound of mushrooms,
chicken stock, milk, flour, butter...

852
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:23,761
...lemon juice, touch of herbs.

853
01:05:25,143 --> 01:05:29,093
- Mushrooms?
- I had some of the soup myself. Superb.

854
01:05:29,939 --> 01:05:32,347
I'm sure. The pie?

855
01:05:32,776 --> 01:05:36,145
I'm afraid I never can resist
my own pie, inspector.

856
01:05:36,321 --> 01:05:38,195
Anybody else's, of course...

857
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,231
- The curry?
- Exactly.

858
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:44,861
Good, of course.
But rice, you see... Fattening.

859
01:05:45,538 --> 01:05:47,163
And as I was having the pie...

860
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,202
Where did the duck come from?

861
01:05:51,377 --> 01:05:53,666
Oh, those. Mr. Harold shot them.

862
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,088
He seems to be rather fond
of killing things.

863
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:01,421
The boy, Alexander, he doesn't seem
to have had any curry either?

864
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:03,921
No. I thought it would appeal to him.

865
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:06,138
Curious child.

866
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:11,185
Well, did anyone come into the kitchen
while the cooking was going on?

867
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:13,016
Not while I was there.

868
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:16,227
I do have other duties, you know.

869
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:19,104
Anyone could've come in then.

870
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:22,688
Six people are poisoned...

871
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:25,526
...only one dies.

872
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:29,614
I'm thinking about that too, inspector.

873
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,492
Excuse me, sir, message
from the chief constable.

874
01:06:32,669 --> 01:06:35,504
- He's waiting up to hear your report.
- All right.

875
01:06:35,672 --> 01:06:38,377
- In person, sir.
- Right, sergeant, get the car.

876
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,756
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Very good.

877
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:47,801
I think the two killings
are connected, don't you?

878
01:06:47,976 --> 01:06:49,174
Yes, I do.

879
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:52,519
Now, we've got to find out who
has that compact, Miss Marple.

880
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:55,974
So far I've only been able
to search one room.

881
01:06:56,151 --> 01:06:59,602
- Whose?
- Unfortunately, Albert's.

882
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:05,068
- Miss Marple, I have to go now, but...
- Oh, yes, I know.

883
01:07:05,243 --> 01:07:08,197
A policeman's work is never done.

884
01:07:09,205 --> 01:07:11,032
Nor a woman's.

885
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:15,372
I was going to say, please be careful.

886
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,414
If you do think of anything, I hope you'll
take me into your confidence.

887
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:56,242
The lab boys turned it up
as arsenic in the curry.

888
01:07:56,419 --> 01:08:00,203
Not a lot, just enough for
stomach aches all the way around.

889
01:08:00,381 --> 01:08:03,501
- Not enough to kill.
- So Albert must have had an extra dose.

890
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:05,843
Yes, but why poison the others at all?

891
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:09,927
If the poisoner is a member of
the family, he had to be ill as well.

892
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:11,802
Well, say it isn't, sir.

893
01:08:11,976 --> 01:08:14,977
I mean, that gardener
of theirs, Hillman...

894
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:18,100
...there's talk in the local pub that
he's in for a nice bequest...

895
01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:19,650
...when old Ackenthorpe goes.

896
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:21,193
Well, it is a possibility, sir.

897
01:08:21,361 --> 01:08:23,686
You're forgetting
the dead woman, Bacon.

898
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:26,817
This poisoning makes it pretty certain
she was Martine Ackenthorpe.

899
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:29,949
French police come up
with something then?

900
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,492
Only that there's
no record of a marriage.

901
01:08:32,664 --> 01:08:35,949
The village where Edmond was stationed
was blown to bits during the war.

902
01:08:36,126 --> 01:08:38,617
- All the files in the town hall, destroyed.
- Well, sir?

903
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,500
Well, don't you see, Bacon?
It's the pattern of the killings.

904
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:44,460
Only a member of the family would
want to get rid of her too.

905
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:48,335
Yes, kill off your relations in easy stages,
except the old man.

906
01:08:48,513 --> 01:08:50,137
When he dies a natural death...

907
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:53,510
...inherit the entire fortune
as well as the property.

908
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:57,812
Albert must have got his
second dose after dinner.

909
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:59,185
Possibly in a drink.

910
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,403
I shouldn't drink that.

911
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:14,661
- Why not?
- Because it's lunch time.

912
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:18,451
- What is it?
- Beef broth, baked custard.

913
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,370
Beef broth? But I ordered beef steak.

914
01:09:20,545 --> 01:09:22,621
The doctor said beef broth.

915
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:25,335
To the blazes with him.
I give the orders in this house.

916
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,631
I'm sick of slops. Take it away.

917
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:29,510
Certainly.

918
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:39,766
Hillman, another bottle.

919
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:42,395
Surely you realize that
if the woman was Martine...

920
01:09:42,567 --> 01:09:46,268
...by showing that letter to the police,
you've pointed the finger at one of us.

921
01:09:46,446 --> 01:09:48,688
Not only for her death, but Albert's too.

922
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:52,281
- Exactly. One of us.
- I might have expected that from you.

923
01:09:52,452 --> 01:09:56,200
Come now, you're thinking along
exactly the same lines as I am.

924
01:09:56,372 --> 01:09:59,907
If you didn't do it, that is.
You're probably thinking it was me.

925
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:01,709
Stop it. Stop it.

926
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:03,705
Or even you, dear Emma.

927
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,632
Look, I think we've had just about
enough of this nonsense.

928
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,673
I bet the police don't think it's nonsense.

929
01:10:08,843 --> 01:10:09,886
Now listen, Cedric...

930
01:10:10,053 --> 01:10:13,220
...say what you like about the rest of us,
but leave Emma out of it.

931
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:15,963
Well, it could be argued, you know...

932
01:10:16,142 --> 01:10:20,222
...that Emma kept that letter until
she could use it to her own advantage.

933
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:22,440
What?

934
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,399
I think you'd better explain that.

935
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,736
Well, let's face it. The moment
Martine's body was discovered...

936
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:31,194
...everyone in this family
was under suspicion...

937
01:10:31,366 --> 01:10:33,074
...including you, Emma.

938
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:35,615
And the moment you produced
the letter voluntarily...

939
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:38,159
...everyone was under suspicion...

940
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:40,490
...excluding you.

941
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:46,953
- I hadn't thought of it like that.
- You must be round the bend.

942
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:49,124
That woman was strangled.

943
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,922
Do you think your sister capable
of a thing like that?

944
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:55,428
Oh, but Emma's an attractive woman,
don't you think so?

945
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:56,641
Well?

946
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:01,478
Well, an attractive woman doesn't need
to do her own dirty work, does she?

947
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:04,355
Emma, I think we better
leave them to it.

948
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:06,232
Now, now, Eastley...

949
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:09,022
...Emma has her eye
on the good doctor, you know.

950
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:13,407
It's not going to be easy for you to
marry into the family for a second time.

951
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,946
That hit home, didn't it?

952
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:19,286
Yes, and I'm about ready
to break your blasted neck.

953
01:11:19,456 --> 01:11:20,950
Very possibly.

954
01:11:21,124 --> 01:11:22,702
But tell me something first:

955
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:25,117
Do you deny meeting Emma
secretly in the grounds...

956
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:27,287
...the night before
the body was discovered?

957
01:11:29,466 --> 01:11:31,542
- Well, I...
- Hillman saw you, you know.

958
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:35,092
All right, we did meet that night, yes.

959
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:37,137
He asked me to intercede with Father.

960
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:42,769
- What for?
- To borrow money, if you must know.

961
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,340
Oh, my goodness.

962
01:12:41,538 --> 01:12:43,411
What are you doing?

963
01:12:43,581 --> 01:12:44,862
Making up the bed.

964
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,619
But you made it up this morning.

965
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:49,545
Yes, but the pillow slips
need changing.

966
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:51,586
They look perfectly all right to me.

967
01:12:51,756 --> 01:12:55,836
But not to me. What am I doing?

968
01:13:02,392 --> 01:13:04,883
I do wish that woman would hurry up.

969
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:07,220
They know I don't like being
here after dark.

970
01:13:07,397 --> 01:13:10,766
What are you afeard of?
Some man will get you?

971
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:14,643
You know, it's funny how
things always come together.

972
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:16,979
My sister's eldest had measles...

973
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:19,233
...and then her Ernie fell
and broke his arm...

974
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:21,567
...and her husband come
out all over with boils.

975
01:13:21,745 --> 01:13:24,615
All in the same week.
You wouldn't believe it, would you?

976
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:26,782
It's gonna be the same thing here.

977
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:29,081
First that nasty murder...

978
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:30,794
...and then Mr. Albert poisoned.

979
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:33,667
Who's gonna be the next,
I'd like to know?

980
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,248
Things always go in threes.

981
01:13:36,426 --> 01:13:38,964
Here you are, Mrs. Kidder.
I'm sorry to have kept you...

982
01:13:39,137 --> 01:13:41,343
...but the doctor has been
with Mr. Ackenthorpe.

983
01:13:41,514 --> 01:13:43,886
Long wait for very little.

984
01:13:47,312 --> 01:13:49,803
The younger generation.

985
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:52,438
Well, I don't know.

986
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:44,816
What's the matter with you?

987
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:50,364
It's Mr. Harold.

988
01:14:52,877 --> 01:14:55,831
Did he use this on himself,
or did somebody else pull the trigger?

989
01:14:56,005 --> 01:14:57,832
Well, it'll add up if it was suicide.

990
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,130
Harold killed the other two,
got cold feet...

991
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:03,172
...and took what is laughingly
called the easy way out.

992
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:07,341
All of them knew he liked shooting
before dinner when he was at the Hall.

993
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:09,556
But he was shot from a range
of two inches.

994
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:13,515
All right, someone he knows
comes up to him...

995
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,856
...casually asks to have a look
at the gun and...

996
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:18,686
Still could've been suicide, though.

997
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:21,898
If I were the murderer, that's exactly
what I'd want us to think.

998
01:15:22,073 --> 01:15:24,860
One thing's sure, we can't risk
any more killings. Come on.

999
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:27,608
- Where to, sir?
- The Hall.

1000
01:15:27,787 --> 01:15:29,246
I'm gonna find that compact...

1001
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:32,450
...if I have to turn the whole place
and everyone in it upside down.

1002
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:36,077
Excuse me, sir.
There's a lady to see you, sir.

1003
01:15:36,254 --> 01:15:37,748
A Miss Marple.

1004
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:40,710
Oh, come in.
Good afternoon, Miss Marple.

1005
01:15:40,884 --> 01:15:42,793
- You were going somewhere?
- Yes.

1006
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:45,542
Then I'll come to the point at once.

1007
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:56,934
A beautiful little piece, isn't it?

1008
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:03,154
- Who had it?
- Young Alexander.

1009
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,405
- What?
- I should have realized, of course.

1010
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:08,236
That boy's incorrigible.

1011
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:11,116
Playing it in the middle
of the night like that. Typical.

1012
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:14,119
- So we're back where we started?
- Oh, no, inspector.

1013
01:16:14,584 --> 01:16:18,167
I think I know who our murderer is.

1014
01:16:18,963 --> 01:16:22,831
The difficulty's going to be
getting him to show his hand.

1015
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:28,049
- Sit down, Miss Marple.
- Thank you.

1016
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,812
Oh, hold that expression, Emma.

1017
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:42,601
Oh, pity, you spoiled it.

1018
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,234
What's the matter, darling?
Things not working out for you?

1019
01:16:46,408 --> 01:16:50,239
How do you manage to make everything
you say sound like an insinuation?

1020
01:16:50,412 --> 01:16:53,662
- He works at it.
- For heaven's sake stop fussing.

1021
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:56,916
If I wish to come down,
I shall do so.

1022
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:58,662
I think this chair, Hillman.

1023
01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:01,047
- Father, don't you think...?
- Now, don't you start.

1024
01:17:01,214 --> 01:17:03,883
Sorry, but you know what he's like
when his mind is made up.

1025
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:09,045
I'm not gonna stay up there all alone.
Might get murdered in me bed.

1026
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:11,049
At least there's some safety in numbers.

1027
01:17:11,224 --> 01:17:14,308
- I quite agree with you, Father.
- Well, that makes a nice change.

1028
01:17:14,477 --> 01:17:17,264
I want a drink.
No, not you. Quimper.

1029
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,561
Then I must be going.

1030
01:17:21,484 --> 01:17:23,809
Don't smother me with it, man,
put it round me knees.

1031
01:17:23,987 --> 01:17:26,026
Well, this is all very nice and cozy.

1032
01:17:26,197 --> 01:17:28,356
How about a rubber of bridge?

1033
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,490
It was just a thought.

1034
01:17:39,961 --> 01:17:41,669
What have you got there, boy?

1035
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:43,332
Oh, a charming little thing.

1036
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:46,507
French, Second Empire.
Pretty valuable, I'd say.

1037
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,012
- Where'd you get it?
- It belongs to Miss Marple.

1038
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,753
Really? You better give it
back to her, haven't you?

1039
01:17:52,932 --> 01:17:56,847
I only borrowed it.
I'll drop it in on my way to bed.

1040
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,776
Come in, doctor.

1041
01:18:55,954 --> 01:18:57,234
You're expecting me?

1042
01:18:57,914 --> 01:18:59,574
Didn't Alexander tell you?

1043
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,328
Tell me what?

1044
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:06,212
Forgetful boy.

1045
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:08,255
I have a sore throat, doctor...

1046
01:19:08,425 --> 01:19:12,837
...and I asked him to ask you to be kind
enough to have a look before you left.

1047
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:14,347
I see.

1048
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:19,266
I'm sorry to trouble you. I haven't
had one of these throats in years.

1049
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:21,558
Well, you've been lucky, Miss Marple.

1050
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:23,140
Any headaches?

1051
01:19:23,314 --> 01:19:25,770
No, just a sore throat.

1052
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:28,439
Well, we'll have a look.

1053
01:19:30,488 --> 01:19:33,525
- This is rather attractive.
- Yes, isn't it?

1054
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,739
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.

1055
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:39,445
- Where?
- In the stables here.

1056
01:19:39,622 --> 01:19:40,998
Really?

1057
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:44,957
Open wide, please.

1058
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,496
Say "aah."

1059
01:19:48,506 --> 01:19:50,546
No inflammation.

1060
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:53,298
Don't you think that was
a little dishonest?

1061
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,964
Keeping the compact, I mean?

1062
01:19:55,138 --> 01:19:58,139
Under the circumstances, doctor, no.

1063
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:04,562
- Is there any swelling?
- I don't think so.

1064
01:20:09,819 --> 01:20:12,144
I've seen you like that
once before, doctor...

1065
01:20:12,322 --> 01:20:14,149
...your hands at a woman's throat.

1066
01:20:14,324 --> 01:20:18,784
It was on a train,
and you were strangling her.

1067
01:20:27,378 --> 01:20:29,003
That's quite an allegation.

1068
01:20:29,798 --> 01:20:31,208
I have a few more.

1069
01:20:33,885 --> 01:20:37,254
You've come for the compact because
you had given it to that woman...

1070
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,966
...and it might be traced back to you.

1071
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:44,843
- I think she was your wife.
- Do you?

1072
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:49,525
You killed her after you had written
that letter to Emma...

1073
01:20:49,692 --> 01:20:52,943
...signing it Martine Ackenthorpe.

1074
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:54,358
Why should I do that?

1075
01:20:55,323 --> 01:20:59,273
The murder, so that you would
then be free to marry Emma...

1076
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:04,699
...the letter, so that people would think
the dead woman was Martine...

1077
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:07,246
...and look among the family
for the killer...

1078
01:21:07,794 --> 01:21:09,074
...never at you.

1079
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:20,721
How did you arrive at
this fascinating hypothesis?

1080
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,097
It was I who found her body.

1081
01:21:23,518 --> 01:21:28,144
Martine was, or is, for all I know,
a Normandy peasant.

1082
01:21:28,398 --> 01:21:31,067
The dead woman had never
worked on a farm in her life.

1083
01:21:31,568 --> 01:21:33,774
I saw her hands.

1084
01:21:34,571 --> 01:21:37,737
- Go on.
- Certainly.

1085
01:21:37,907 --> 01:21:40,445
You then proceeded to
augment your prospects...

1086
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,404
...by eliminating Albert and Harold.

1087
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:45,909
How, conceivably?

1088
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:50,618
You contrived to introduce
arsenic into my curry...

1089
01:21:50,795 --> 01:21:54,164
...which I find unforgivable,
by the way...

1090
01:21:54,424 --> 01:21:57,959
...knowing that you would be called on
to deal with the aftereffects.

1091
01:21:58,136 --> 01:22:02,762
Easy then to give Albert
his final dose in the medicine.

1092
01:22:02,932 --> 01:22:04,557
And Harold?

1093
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:08,095
You shot him
and made it look like suicide.

1094
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,347
Ingenious, I must admit.

1095
01:22:11,858 --> 01:22:13,436
More than that.

1096
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:17,026
Now that you are here to secure
your dead wife's compact...

1097
01:22:17,197 --> 01:22:18,988
...a fair case.

1098
01:22:20,617 --> 01:22:21,659
Yes.

1099
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:24,699
A pity you won't be able
to present it.

1100
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:29,535
One more murder, doctor,
might be one too many.

1101
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:32,165
This won't look like murder,
Miss Marple.

1102
01:22:32,337 --> 01:22:34,709
The death certificate,
signed by me, of course...

1103
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:37,668
...will register heart failure.

1104
01:22:40,136 --> 01:22:42,461
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

1105
01:22:43,556 --> 01:22:45,513
You're under arrest,
and I must warn you...

1106
01:22:45,683 --> 01:22:49,183
That everything I've said has been taken
down and will be used in evidence.

1107
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:52,807
You were right about
everything, of course.

1108
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:16,204
You're a very brave woman,
Miss Marple.

1109
01:23:16,381 --> 01:23:18,089
Good night.

1110
01:23:44,075 --> 01:23:46,234
About time too.

1111
01:23:46,828 --> 01:23:49,533
I was coming up to see you,
you know, before leaving.

1112
01:23:49,706 --> 01:23:51,283
No need to leave.

1113
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:54,375
- I have my own home, Mr. Ackenthorpe.
- Sell it.

1114
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:55,955
Why on earth should I?

1115
01:23:57,005 --> 01:24:00,705
Well, taking one thing and another...

1116
01:24:00,884 --> 01:24:03,209
I mean, you're a fair cook...

1117
01:24:03,803 --> 01:24:06,721
...and you seem to have
your wits about you...

1118
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:12,050
...and, well, I've decided to marry you.

1119
01:24:14,189 --> 01:24:17,392
- Well?
- Well, I'm honored, of course.

1120
01:24:17,567 --> 01:24:20,023
Of course you are,
but come to the point.

1121
01:24:20,195 --> 01:24:21,819
I'm afraid that cannot be.

1122
01:24:21,988 --> 01:24:23,031
Why?

1123
01:24:23,656 --> 01:24:27,156
Well, if ever I do embark
on such a venture...

1124
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:28,738
...there is someone else.

1125
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:31,073
Nonsense.

1126
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:34,118
I don't believe it.
Who on earth would have you?

1127
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:37,246
Apparently you, for one,
Mr. Ackenthorpe.

1128
01:24:37,796 --> 01:24:39,464
Goodbye.

1129
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:52,429
The woman must be
completely unbalanced.

1130
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:57,889
- Oh, Miss Marple, I am so glad.
- How good of you to come.

1131
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,853
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

1132
