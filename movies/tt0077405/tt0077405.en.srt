<i>Keep it goin'!
All right. Shake it out. Keep movin'.</i>

3
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,905
You're late.

4
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,336
<i>Hey, you.</i>

5
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,883
Shake it out!

6
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,231
<i>- Hey.

7
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,745
<i>Here!</i>

8
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,358
<i>Me and my brother-
It just used to be me and my brother.</i>

9
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,560
<i>We used to do things together.</i>

10
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,637
<i>We used to have fun.</i>

11
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,075
<i>We used to roam the streets.</i>

12
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,543
<i>There was people sufferin'
of pain and hunger.</i>

13
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,983
<i>Some people, their tongues
were hangin' out of their mouth.</i>

14
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:12,981
<i>Just gotta get fixed up first.</i>

15
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,598
Things aren't always
gonna be this way.

16
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,036
You know that, don't you?

17
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:33,131
<i>He used to juggle apples.</i>

18
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,939
<i>He- He used to amuse us.</i>

19
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,014
<i>He used to entertain us.</i>

20
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:44,181
What else do I get to do today?

21
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,687
<i>In fact, all three of us been goin'places...</i>

22
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,249
<i>Looking for things,
searching for things...</i>

23
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,597
<i>goin' on adventures.</i>

24
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,969
<i>They told everybody
they were brother and sister.</i>

25
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,477
<i>My brother didn't want nobody to know.</i>

26
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:14,145
<i>You know how people are.</i>

27
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,981
<i>You tell 'em somethin',
they start talkin'.</i>

28
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:47,640
<i>I met this guy named Ding Dong.</i>

29
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:50,515
<i>He told me the whole earth
is goin' up in flames.</i>

30
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:53,920
<i>Flames will come out
of here and there...</i>

31
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,151
<i>and they'll just rise up.</i>

32
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,354
<i>The mountains are gonna go up
in big flames.</i>

33
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,932
<i>The water's gonna rise in flames.</i>

34
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,162
<i>There's gonna be creatures
runnin' every which way...</i>

35
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:10,571
<i>some of them burned,
half their wings burnin'.</i>

36
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:14,111
<i>People are gonna be screamin'
and hollerin' for help.</i>

37
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:19,040
<i>See, the people that have been good,
they're gonna go to heaven...</i>

38
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,084
<i>and escape all that fire.</i>

39
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,677
Sackers! I need sackers!

40
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,621
<i>But if you've
been bad, God don't even hear you.</i>

41
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,353
<i>He don't even hear you talkin'.</i>

42
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:33,419
A man can earn three dollars a day
if he wants to work.

43
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,023
Sackers! I need sackers!
You ever sack before?

44
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,762
- Sure.
- When was that?

45
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,462
- Last year.
- Get on.

46
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,708
Whose place is that?

47
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,301
The owner's. Don't any of you
go up around there either.

48
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:54,710
- Silver tongue.
- Hey!

49
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,677
- You all right?
- Sure, I am.

50
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,852
- You live around here?
- No, kid.

51
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,856
No, I don't.

52
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,826
- Where do you live?
- In Chicago.

53
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,828
Oh, yeah?

54
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,891
- What's that in your hair?
- In my hair?

55
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,696
- This.
- In my ear?

56
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,771
- Yeah.
- That's what you call a makins.

57
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,398
- What's a makins?
- A cigarette.

58
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:55,602
- Oh.
- I-It's tobacco in a bag.

59
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,975
And you put it - roll it up.

60
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,447
- But I'm not gonna - I'm gonna save it.
- You like it out here?

61
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,177
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

62
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,879
I lo - I know. I love it out here.
I like the wheat fields and -

63
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:10,152
- You have any brothers or sisters?
- No.

64
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,558
- I have a brother.
- What's his name?

65
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,995
- Bill.
- Where?

66
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,694
He's somewhere - I don't know -
over there. I don't know.

67
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:26,201
<i>I got one.</i>

68
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,208
Let me see.

69
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,047
Don't lose him. There he goes.
Look, look. Look. Oh, you lost him.

70
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,914
I don't think they like us.

71
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,993
Abby's it!

72
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,563
Abby's too slow.

73
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,098
You didn't get me.
You didn't get me.

74
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:33,336
"For a thousand years in thy sight
are but as yesterday when it is past...

75
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,935
<i>"and as a watch in the night.</i>

76
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:39,447
<i>As soon as thou scatters
them that are evil"-</i>

77
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,771
Amen.

78
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,775
Amen.

79
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:23,326
Ho!

80
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,602
<i>Stop straggling. Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>

81
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,012
<i>Get that rake over there.</i>

82
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:45,015
<i>Come on!</i>

83
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,688
<i>Line 'em up.</i>

84
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,690
<i>Come on!</i>

85
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,048
<i>This farmer,
he didn't know when he first saw her...</i>

86
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,754
<i>or what it was about her
that caught his eye.</i>

87
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:35,000
<i>Maybe it was the way the wind
blew through her hair.</i>

88
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,502
- What are you smokin' for?
- Why do you wear a black hat?

89
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:42,542
Let me see your hands.

90
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,913
Why don't you get some spoons,
and I'll meet you over there?

91
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,542
Okay? Over in the field here.

92
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,821
Your sister keep you warm
at night, does she?

93
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,457
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

94
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,780
Come on!

95
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,322
Let me go!

96
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,291
- Relax.
- Okay!

97
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:55,614
Too bad you ain't got any real food left.
I'm kinda hungry.

98
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,124
I got a little potato here.

99
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,958
You know anything about that woman
out there, the one with the black hair?

100
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,975
You haven't heard anything about her?
Where she's from?

101
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,171
<i>You want me to find out?</i>

102
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,680
You wasted more than 12 bushels
in this row.

103
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,553
I'm docking you three dollars.

104
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,889
Hey, what are you talkin' about?
That's not fair!

105
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,962
<i>Then leave. You're fired.</i>

106
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,066
<i>- Wait a minute.
- Forget it. Don't fight about it.</i>

107
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,761
You want to stay?

108
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,997
Then shut up and get back to work.

109
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:09,185
They treat you like shit out here.

110
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:13,257
Don't worry about it.

111
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,194
I seen a doctor comin' by.

112
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,958
I'll see if I can get him
to give you somethin' for that.

113
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,966
Right?

114
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:26,236
Okay.

115
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,985
Ooh!

116
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,601
<i>Hey!</i>

117
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,576
<i>I appreciate you coming out, Doc.</i>

118
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,645
That's all right.

119
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,482
I'll be checking on you
as time goes on.

120
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,352
You never think it's gonna happen to you.

121
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,388
Yup.

122
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,458
How long would you reckon I have?

123
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,695
<i>You know, you can tell me.</i>

124
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,562
<i>A year. Maybe a year.</i>

125
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:40,741
<i>He knew he was gonna die.</i>

126
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,281
<i>He knew there was nothin'
that could be done.</i>

127
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:45,283
Catch it.

128
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,718
Goosey.

129
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,726
<i>You're only on this Earth once.</i>

130
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:57,319
<i>And I- to my opinion,
as long as you're around...</i>

131
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,331
<i>you should have it nice.</i>

132
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,741
Here we go. Here we go.

133
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:30,297
Excuse me.
I forgot where I was.

134
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:32,298
Don't worry.

135
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:37,960
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

136
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,876
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

137
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,314
Where do you go from here?

138
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,610
All over.

139
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,947
<i>Wyoming.</i>

140
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,789
You think I'll like it?

141
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,893
- I saved your life today.
- Nah.

142
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,530
Yeah, I killed a shit-eating dog.

143
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:08,102
Thanks.

144
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:10,171
I'm always lookin' out for you.

145
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:13,741
You deserve a medal.

146
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:25,512
Are you cold?

147
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,748
It's only for a while.

148
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,222
Then we'll go to New York.

149
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,225
And then what?

150
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:35,387
Then we're there.
Then we get fixed up.

151
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:19,868
<i>All right. I want to see everybody working.</i>

152
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,877
<i>Everybody out here,
movin' it along.</i>

153
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,345
<i>Shake it! Come on. Let's go!</i>

154
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,416
<i>Let's go! Go now!</i>

155
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,720
<i>There we go!</i>

156
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:44,659
<i>From the time
the sun went up till it went down...</i>

157
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:47,236

158
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,497
<i>No- Nonstop.</i>

159
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,576
<i>Just keep going.</i>

160
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:56,873
<i>Up with it. Come on. Let's go!</i>

161
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:00,178
<i>You didn't work,
they'd ship you right out of there.</i>

162
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:03,254
<i>All right. Let's go! Shake it out!</i>

163
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:05,482
<i>They don't need you.</i>

164
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,354
<i>They can always get somebody else.</i>

165
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:57,098
That's at a profit of $4.75 an acre.

166
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,541
Multiply that by 20,000.

167
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,613
You're talkin' over six figures.

168
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:04,182
- Big year.
- Your biggest ever.

169
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,751
Should make you the richest man
in the panhandle.

170
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:12,089
You oughta get out
while you're this far ahead.

171
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,318
You have nothing to gain by staying.

172
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:44,022
Hey, get off of there!

173
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:46,024
No!

174
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,963
You fall in, I gotta clean up.

175
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:12,816
<i>This farmer, he had a big spread...</i>

176
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,218
<i>and a lot of money.</i>

177
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:18,224
<i>Whoever was sittin' in the chair
when he'd come around...</i>

178
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:20,794
<i>why, they'd stand up
and give it to him.</i>

179
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,233
<i>Wasn't no harm in him.</i>

180
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:29,326
<i>You'd give him a flower,
he'd keep it forever.</i>

181
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,537
<i>He was headed for the boneyard
any minute...</i>

182
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:41,513
<i>but he wasn't really goin' around
squawkin' about it...</i>

183
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,275
<i>like some people.</i>

184
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:48,116
<i>In one way, I felt sorry for him...</i>

185
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:52,022
<i>'cause he had nobody
to stand out for him...</i>

186
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:54,925
<i>be by his side...</i>

187
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,726
<i>hold his hand
when he needs attention or somethin'.</i>

188
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,734
<i>That's touchin'.</i>

189
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:05,072
We'll probably be all done
by tomorrow.

190
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,376
You still plan on goin' north?

191
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:25,183
The reason I ask is...

192
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,125
maybe you'd like to stay on here.

193
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:35,994
Well, it'd be easier than it is now.
There's not that much work after the harvest.

194
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:40,309
Pay's just as good.

195
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:48,683
It's an idea. You could think about it
and let me know later.

196
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,530
I gotta run.

197
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,761
<i>Who's that?</i>

198
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,769
My brother.

199
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:15,511
He's stuck on ya.

200
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,612
- Hmm. Legs.
- There are people around.

201
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,621
- There's nobody around.
- Yes, there are.

202
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:27,623
- Look at that.
- Stop it.

203
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:39,936
He doesn't have any family either.

204
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:50,510
<i>Why don't you tell him you'll stay?</i>

205
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,248
What for?

206
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,255
I don't know.

207
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,528
Somethin' might happen.

208
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,665
<i>What's your mouth hangin' open for?</i>

209
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,974
Don't tell me. I already know.

210
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,840
On account of your unhappy life -
all that shit.

211
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,616
Well, I'm tellin' you,
we gotta do something about it.

212
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,618
Can't expect anybody else to.

213
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,682
<i>Last load! Comin' down!</i>

214
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,454
<i>Hup! Shut her down!</i>

215
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,931
Are we gonna stay?

216
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,635
If she wants to.

217
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,241
You'd rather go?

218
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:00,880
I'd rather be the king of Siam.

219
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,784
You put aspirin in this?

220
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,719
<i>- Ninety dollars.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

221
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,721
Hey!

222
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,686
<i>- Want a bite?
- Thank you very much, sir.</i>

223
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,697
Eighty-seven dollars.

224
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,426
<i>Did he ever buy you anything?</i>

225
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,868
Lots of things.

226
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:26,600
<i>He'll come back, I'm sure.</i>

227
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:31,037
I don't think so.

228
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,079
Why not?

229
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:36,639
'Cause if he wanted me to be with him,
he would have took me.

230
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,720
Oh, that's not true.

231
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:43,849
<i>I don't know. Maybe I wasn't
pretty enough or somethin'.</i>

232
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,926
<i>Somethin' stupid like that.</i>

233
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:49,063
What happened to your ear?

234
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,265
<i>My dog bit me when I was little.
We were playin'.</i>

235
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,340
Can I have a puff?

236
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:06,675
<i>He was tired of livin' like the rest of them-</i>

237
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,808
<i>nosin' around like a pig in a gutter.</i>

238
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,886
<i>He wasn't in the mood no more.</i>

239
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:16,120
<i>He figured there must be
somethin' wrong with 'em-</i>

240
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,420
<i>the way they always got no luck-</i>

241
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,722
<i>and they oughta get it
straightened out.</i>

242
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,797
<i>He figured some people need
more than they got...</i>

243
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,494
<i>other people got more
than they need.</i>

244
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:30,037
<i>Just a matter of gettin' us
all together.</i>

245
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:33,399
<i>Chicago!</i>

246
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,409
Well, go ahead!

247
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:58,689
Weren't even dancing shoes.
You got on regular shoes.

248
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,788
You never used to be like this.

249
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,594
As long as I can remember, people been giving
me a hard time about one thing or another.

250
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,665
Don't you start in too.

251
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:32,269
Big federal case.

252
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:39,032
We don't have to decide
anything final now.

253
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:41,043
Just if we're gonna stay.

254
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:56,053
Hey-yee!

255
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:24,544
Whoo!

256
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:28,251
Hey-yee!

257
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:37,467
<i>Yeah, I could stay, sure. I gotta keep
my brother and sister with me though.</i>

258
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,281
<i>- Whoo!
- Yeah!</i>

259
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:57,846
<i>Hey! Yea!</i>

260
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:23,203
I'll try and come back. I'll try and come back
'cause I - I really liked staying with you.

261
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,682
You were so much fun.
I love you, okay?

262
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,812
I want you to be really good.
And I don't want you to do anything wrong.

263
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:31,789
If you do anything wrong,
I'll come back and I'll get ya. All right?

264
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:34,360
I love you,
and don't do nothin' wrong!

265
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,361
All right?

266
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:28,374
<i>I've been thinkin' what to do with my future.</i>

267
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:39,287
<i>I could be a mud doctor...</i>

268
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,862
<i>checkin' out the earth underneath.</i>

269
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,018
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

270
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,993
When I was your age,
I was all by myself in the world.

271
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:22,436
I used to sit and wrap cigars...

272
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,438
until after dark.

273
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,937
My skin was as white as paper.

274
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:31,012
I never saw the daylight.

275
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:37,285
This is not so bad.

276
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:43,890
Don't make me laugh.

277
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:46,689
What about this then?

278
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:51,198
Wait a minute.

279
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:54,270
- Where are you people from?
- Chicago.

280
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:57,465
- Yeah? What'd you do there?
- Nothing.

281
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:59,474
Your brother, I mean.

282
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:02,044
He worked in a factory.

283
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:07,879
I can remember
the first time I ever saw you.

284
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,919
Never seen hair as black as yours.

285
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:17,425
Skin so pretty.

286
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:24,200
Scared I'd never see you again.

287
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,038
- Run!
- Come on.

288
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:39,583
<i>Safe!</i>

289
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,258
<i>So, I went to work in the mill.</i>

290
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:55,332
Couldn't wait to get in there.

291
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:58,266
Begin at 7:00.
Got to have a smile on your face.

292
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:04,142
And one day you wake up...

293
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:09,310
you find you're not
the smartest guy in the world.

294
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,712
Never gonna come up
with the big score.

295
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,921
When I was growin' up,
I thought I really would.

296
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:36,930
- Where'd you learn that?
- From watching the girls at Baker Hall.

297
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:41,441
<i>Actually,
I could have been a dancer.</i>

298
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:50,281
I think I love you.

299
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:55,820
What a nice thing to say.

300
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,934
Never thought he'd have the guts.

301
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:19,379
- Who'd know but you and me?
- Nobody.

302
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,612
That's all that matters, isn't it?

303
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:26,350
You talk like it was all right.

304
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,359
He'll never have a chance
to enjoy his money anyway.

305
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:42,533
What makes you think we're talkin'
about just a couple of months?

306
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,840
The man's got one foot on a banana peel,
the other on a roller skate.

307
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,211
It'll all be gone in a couple of years.

308
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:53,616
Who's gonna care
that we acted perfect?

309
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,993
I held out a long time.

310
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,061
I had rich men
pay me compliments.

311
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,166
Have I ever said anything to you
that would make you think-

312
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:10,361
You don't have to.

313
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,406
I mean, I hate it,
to see you stooped over out there.

314
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:17,438
<i>Them looking at your ass
like you're a whore.</i>

315
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,117
<i>I hate it.</i>

316
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:57,815
<i>As you will answer
at the dreadful day of judgment.</i>

317
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,320
The secrets in all hearts
shall be disclosed.

318
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,617
And if either of you know
any impediment -

319
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,955
<i>For richer and for poorer...</i>

320
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,960
for better, for worse...

321
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,496
in sickness and in health...

322
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,793
to love and to cherish...

323
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,868
till death us do part.

324
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,335
<i>Bless, O Lord, this ring
that he who gives it...</i>

325
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,032
<i>and she who wears it
may abide by peace.</i>

326
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,357
<i>Thank you.</i>

327
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,528
Thank you.

328
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:12,895
You're like an angel.

329
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,397
I wish I was.

330
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,869
Does all this seem strange to you?

331
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:37,743
Why don't you move your things in here,
into the house, while we're gone?

332
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:40,723
All right.

333
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,830
Bye.

334
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,677
Did you see this?

335
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:10,074
There's more right up there too.

336
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:21,051
You've never been in love before?

337
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,060
Why's that?

338
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:45,151
<i>We never been this rich, all right?</i>

339
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:47,777
<i>I mean, we were just,
all of a sudden...</i>

340
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:49,856
<i>livin' like kings.</i>

341
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:55,657
<i>Just nothin' to do all day
but crack jokes, lay around.</i>

342
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,787
<i>- Help!
- We didn't have to work.</i>

343
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:02,758
<i>I'm tellin' you,
the rich got it figured out.</i>

344
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,498
This.

345
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:07,506
Soft tickle.

346
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:51,885
<i>- Oh, Linda!
- Hey, don't. Please, go away.</i>

347
00:43:51,986 --> 00:43:53,954
- Can you do anything?
- No.

348
00:43:54,055 --> 00:43:56,388
That's not so. Show 'em that.

349
00:43:56,492 --> 00:43:59,950
What? With potatoes?

350
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:02,496
<i>Uh-huh.
So this is what you do all day.</i>

351
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,565
- Hey! That's mine.
- Now it's for the dogs.

352
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:18,045
<i>I got to like this farm.</i>

353
00:44:18,147 --> 00:44:20,047
<i>Do anything I want.</i>

354
00:44:20,149 --> 00:44:22,117
<i>Roll in the fields...</i>

355
00:44:23,152 --> 00:44:25,450
<i>talk to the wheat patches.</i>

356
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,716
<i>When I was sleepin',
they'd talk to me.</i>

357
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:33,687
<i>They'd go in my dreams.</i>

358
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:09,665
What's the matter with you?

359
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:11,666
- I get lonely by myself.
- Shh!

360
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:25,676
You see this bottle?
I want to break it.

361
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:28,149
- You're crazy.
- That sound dumb?

362
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:30,277
<i>What do you think?</i>

363
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:39,458
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

364
00:45:50,274 --> 00:45:52,572
It scares me doing this,
you know?

365
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,641
Dropped my glass.

366
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,650
Doesn't matter.

367
00:46:11,963 --> 00:46:14,557
<i>I never wanted
to fall in love with you.</i>

368
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,369
Nobody asked you to.

369
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,431
A minute ago you said
I was irresistible.

370
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,442
I still am.

371
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:28,946
Your hair's still the same.

372
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:55,473
<i>Abby?</i>

373
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,580
<i>Abby?</i>

374
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:20,257
Where you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

375
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:23,995
I couldn't sleep well.
I went out for a walk.

376
00:47:24,103 --> 00:47:27,595
- You should've woke me up.
- I didn't want to.

377
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,135
<i>Nobody sent us letters.</i>

378
00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:00,373
<i>We didn't receive no cards.</i>

379
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,762
<i>Sometimes I'd feel very old...</i>

380
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:24,832
<i>like my whole life's over...</i>

381
00:48:26,134 --> 00:48:28,432
<i>like I'm not around no more.</i>

382
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:30,561
<i>Bet he likes looking at you in that.</i>

383
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:33,597
This?

384
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,676
I thought you liked it.

385
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:40,080
You don't like them, do ya?

386
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:42,342
You never have.

387
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,509
I don't think they're honest people.

388
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:48,381
As a matter of fact,
I think they're a pair of con artists.

389
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:57,825
You know, maybe you'd be better off
taking over the north end till spring.

390
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:03,560
I mean, we've been together a long time
and I've always felt close to you.

391
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:10,034
Just might work out better is all.
Less friction.

392
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:15,110
You're talkin' about my wife.

393
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,022
Maybe I'd better pack.

394
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:38,406
I know what you're doing.

395
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,011
That boy's like a son to me.

396
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:20,376
You know what I thought
when I first saw you?

397
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:23,783
I thought, "If only I could touch her,
then everything'd be all right. "

398
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:29,320
You make me feel like I've come back to life.
Isn't that funny?

399
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:36,429
I always thought that being alone was
just something that a man had to put up with.

400
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,332
It was like I just got used to it.

401
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:46,175
Sometimes it's like...

402
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,177
you're right inside of me,
you know...

403
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,909
like I can hear your voice
and feel your breath and everything.

404
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,163
Why are you so uneasy with me?

405
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:09,665
I'm sorry.

406
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:12,737
I don't blame you.
Did I make it sound like that?

407
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:20,812
You have a right to.

408
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,906
It's just that it seems
like I don't know you.

409
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:09,723
<i>Did you see him wave?</i>

410
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,856
- Here he is!
- There he goes!

411
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:17,265
That's the president of the whole country.

412
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:23,241
Will you help me up?

413
00:52:23,342 --> 00:52:25,242
<i>Instead of gettin'sicker...</i>

414
00:52:25,344 --> 00:52:27,312
<i>he just stayed the same.</i>

415
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:31,551
<i>He didn't get sicker,
he didn't get better.</i>

416
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:37,150
<i>They were kindhearted.</i>

417
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:41,091
<i>They thought he was going out
on his own steam.</i>

418
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:53,939
<i>I don't know. The doc musta come over
or somethin' and gave him somethin'.</i>

419
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,010
<i>Probably some kind of medicine
or somethin'.</i>

420
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:01,441
<i>I coulda just took it,
put it in a ditch...</i>

421
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,981
<i>like they do to a horse.</i>

422
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:09,612
<i>They shoot 'im right away.</i>

423
00:53:31,746 --> 00:53:33,976
Buster, fetch.

424
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:37,779
<i>Whoa. Easy.</i>

425
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:42,112
Whoa, pup.

426
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,825
<i>Sally.</i>

427
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:49,061
<i>Whoa, pup.</i>

428
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:50,926
<i>Sally, Sally.</i>

429
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:57,405
<i>Whoa, pup.</i>

430
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,101
You seem jumpy today.

431
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:31,765
I'm sick of these stinkin' birds.

432
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:34,775
- What's the matter?
- You don't wanna know about it.

433
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:30,626
<i>Just when things were
about to blow, this flyin' circus come in.</i>

434
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:38,072
<i>After six months on this wheat patch,
I needed a breath of fresh air.</i>

435
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:52,454
<i>They were screamin' and yellin'
and boppin' each other.</i>

436
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:55,457
<i>He- The big one
pushed the little one and said...</i>

437
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,459
<i>"Come on.
I start it, you start. "</i>

438
00:55:57,561 --> 00:56:01,224
<i>The little one just started in.</i>

439
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:05,393
<i>If they couldn't think of a good one
to come back with, they'd start fightin'.</i>

440
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:21,885
<i>The little one said, "No, I didn't do this. "
The big one said, "Yes, you did do this. "</i>

441
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:25,445
<i>You couldn't sort it out.</i>

442
00:56:26,558 --> 00:56:29,254
I wanna give 'em a hand for this.

443
00:56:29,361 --> 00:56:31,693
Hey! Bong!

444
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:40,700
<i>Mmm. Watch out.</i>

445
00:56:40,806 --> 00:56:43,934
<i>Watch out, watch out.</i>

446
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:48,406
<i>The devil just sittin' there, laughin'.</i>

447
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:52,441
<i>He's glad when people does bad.</i>

448
00:56:52,552 --> 00:56:54,884
<i>Then he sends 'em to the snake house.</i>

449
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:59,287
<i>He just sits there and laughs and watch
while you're sittin' there all tied up...</i>

450
00:56:59,392 --> 00:57:02,293
<i>and snakes are eatin' your eyes out.</i>

451
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:05,296
<i>They go down your throat
and eat all your systems out.</i>

452
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,131
You're confusing me, you know.

453
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,537
Drivin' me crazy.

454
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,872
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin'.

455
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,037
You never did.

456
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:43,327
<i>I think the devil was on the farm.</i>

457
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,587
What's going on?

458
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,657
What's the matter?

459
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:08,862
You know what I mean.

460
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:13,967
Why do you let him
touch you like that?

461
00:58:22,143 --> 00:58:24,111
What are you talking about?

462
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:28,813
I don't know how brothers and sisters act
where you come from -

463
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:31,385
<i>Did you ever have a sister?</i>

464
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:34,955
Well, then who are you to judge?

465
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:39,583
<i>Ah, buongiorno, signorina-</i>

466
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:45,065
Did you say anything to him?

467
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:49,929
Never seen him act like this before.

468
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:53,633
- He must think we're awful.
- What do you care what he thinks?

469
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:05,483
You're in love with him, aren't you?

470
00:59:13,729 --> 00:59:16,857
<i>Are you leavin'?</i>

471
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,662
<i>- Yeah.
- What for?</i>

472
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:23,363
I got some business to take care of.
They're giving me a lift.

473
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:27,938
- Just like that, huh?
- Guess so.

474
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:54,394
<i>He seen how it all was.</i>

475
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:59,175
<i>She loves the farmer.</i>

476
01:00:44,355 --> 01:00:48,883
<i>He taught me keys on the pianos
and notes.</i>

477
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:54,825
<i>He taught me about
the parts of a globe.</i>

478
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:37,598
And the mast here.
Then another great big one straight up here.

479
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:42,442
So here would be the - the front,
and then the bow.

480
01:04:00,856 --> 01:04:03,825
- Bill!
- Hey, sprinkle!

481
01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:06,224
- I missed you so much. Did you miss me?
- Yeah!

482
01:04:06,328 --> 01:04:08,228
- How much?
- A lot!

483
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,525
- Hey. You look just the same.
- How you doin'?

484
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:12,533
We been readin' about you.

485
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:15,798
- What do you mean?
- Oh, about Chicago.

486
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:18,373
You come all that way by motorcycle?

487
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:23,873
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

488
01:05:31,482 --> 01:05:33,507
You didn't do nothin' to me.

489
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:39,957
I didn't know what I had with you.

490
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:45,395
I think about it -

491
01:05:46,964 --> 01:05:50,491
the things I said to you...

492
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:53,069
<i>how I pushed you into this.</i>

493
01:06:02,813 --> 01:06:05,281
Got nobody to blame but myself.

494
01:06:11,223 --> 01:06:13,123
I oughta get goin'...

495
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:15,193
before it gets too late.

496
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:18,243
Smoke 'em out!
Swat 'em out!

497
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:24,952
That way! Let's go! Come on!

498
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,904
What's this?

499
01:11:53,006 --> 01:11:54,906
What are you doin'?

500
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:56,908
What do you care?

501
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,137
What are you doin'?

502
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:01,939
Are you crazy?

503
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,060
Catch 'em!

504
01:12:20,566 --> 01:12:22,295
Let it burn!

505
01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:24,962
Let it burn!

506
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:32,905
Get tractors! Blankets!

507
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:37,646
Catch that mare!

508
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:42,754
Get back!

509
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:16,856
He doesn't understand me.

510
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:19,426
What are we gonna do?

511
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:25,761
We gotta get out of here.

512
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,901
He knows.

513
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,570
- Do somethin'!
- Fire! Fire!

514
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,317
<i>- Up this way!
- Come here!</i>

515
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,855
<i>Don't stir them up!</i>

516
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:43,068
Help me get this ground -

517
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:04,629
- Comin' through here!
- Comin' this way!

518
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,793
Out of my way!

519
01:15:44,108 --> 01:15:46,702
What did you want from me?

520
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:06,897
Wait!

521
01:16:11,336 --> 01:16:12,803
You're a liar!

522
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,229
Pull it out?

523
01:18:37,685 --> 01:18:40,779
Look, I'll tell you
the whole story later.

524
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:43,187
Nothing we can do about it now.

525
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,242
<i>Well, you're skinnin' me alive, but-</i>

526
01:19:02,344 --> 01:19:04,244
And the Victrola.

527
01:19:04,346 --> 01:19:06,337
- Even up?
- Yeah.

528
01:19:15,824 --> 01:19:17,985
<i>Nobody's perfect.</i>

529
01:19:18,093 --> 01:19:21,119
<i>There was never
a perfect person around.</i>

530
01:19:22,364 --> 01:19:26,460
<i>You just got half devil
and half angel in you.</i>

531
01:19:42,518 --> 01:19:46,649
<i>She promised herself
she'd lead a good life from now on.</i>

532
01:19:46,756 --> 01:19:48,883
<i>She blamed it all on herself.</i>

533
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,230
It's good. I like it.

534
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,362
<i>She didn't care if she was happy or not.</i>

535
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:05,805
<i>She just wanted to make up
for what she did wrong.</i>

536
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:09,209
Got about a three-pound carp.

537
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:13,806
<i>The sun looks ghostly when
there's a mist on a river and everything's quiet.</i>

538
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,112
<i>I never knowed it before.</i>

539
01:20:20,223 --> 01:20:22,384
<i>You could see people on the shore...</i>

540
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:26,088
<i>but it was far off and you couldn't see
what they were doin'.</i>

541
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:30,099
<i>They were probably
callin' for help or somethin'...</i>

542
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:35,161
<i>or they were tryin'
to bury somebody or somethin'.</i>

543
01:20:38,342 --> 01:20:42,210
<i>We seen trees
that the leaves are shakin'...</i>

544
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:47,683
<i>and it looks like
shadows of guys comin' at you and stuff.</i>

545
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:53,183
<i>We heard owls squawkin' away,
hootin' away.</i>

546
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:58,294
<i>We didn't know where we were goin',
what we were gonna do.</i>

547
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:01,024
<i>I've never been on a boat before.</i>

548
01:21:01,132 --> 01:21:02,997
<i>That was the first time.</i>

549
01:21:05,036 --> 01:21:07,527
Have you seen her?

550
01:21:07,638 --> 01:21:09,607
Where?

551
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:12,609
<i>Some sights that I saw was really spooky...</i>

552
01:21:12,711 --> 01:21:15,976
<i>that it gave me goose pimples.</i>

553
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:18,549
<i>I felt like cold hands...</i>

554
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,108
<i>touchin' the back of my neck and-</i>

555
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:26,054
<i>And it could be the dead
comin' for me or somethin'.</i>

556
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:30,589
<i>I remember this guy-
his name was Black Jack.</i>

557
01:21:30,696 --> 01:21:34,826
<i>He died.
He only had one leg, and he died.</i>

558
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:39,267
<i>And I think that was Black Jack
makin' those noises.</i>

559
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:39,023
Got 'er wedged in there.

560
01:22:42,503 --> 01:22:45,495
- Grab it.
- Hold on, Randy.

561
01:22:51,245 --> 01:22:53,304
There!

562
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,218
<i>Move over this way!</i>

563
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:21,171
<i>Check out those trees!</i>

564
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:26,405
Steady.
Gotta be in here somewhere.

565
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:30,180
- What's going on?
- Keep down!

566
01:23:33,822 --> 01:23:36,791
- Just stay here.
- Wait a minute -

567
01:23:47,735 --> 01:23:49,430
<i>There!</i>

568
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:53,803
<i>- I'm gonna come around back that way.
- Don't let him get back to the river.</i>

569
01:24:03,686 --> 01:24:07,087
<i>- Move over. Down this stretch!
- Check out those trees!</i>

570
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,558
<i>Watch it! He's going around
the other side of that bank!</i>

571
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:26,507
<i>The other's goin' the other way!</i>

572
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,276
Come on!

573
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:42,990
<i>- Buck!
- Back over there!</i>

574
01:24:43,092 --> 01:24:45,994
<i>You!
You go over there!</i>

575
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:49,395
<i>I'm gonna go this way. You go over there!</i>

576
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:57,764
<i>He's in here somewhere!</i>

577
01:25:02,078 --> 01:25:05,639
<i>- Hey, Linder!
- Check it there! Check it there!</i>

578
01:25:08,952 --> 01:25:12,115
Over there! There!

579
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:49,553
It'll work out. Right?

580
01:26:49,655 --> 01:26:52,750
- Mmm.
- You'll make lots of friends.

581
01:27:16,716 --> 01:27:18,684
You'll be all right.

582
01:27:20,453 --> 01:27:22,421
Now turn around and go inside.

583
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,339
<i>Oranges.</i>

584
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:55,713
<i>Oranges. Oranges.</i>

585
01:27:55,823 --> 01:27:57,791
<i>Oranges.</i>

586
01:28:04,298 --> 01:28:08,826
<i>- Big barrel of coal.
- Yeah, I saw! I saw!</i>

587
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:22,808
<i>Keep safe, boys.</i>

588
01:28:55,183 --> 01:28:58,016
<i>Hey, come look!</i>

589
01:29:05,561 --> 01:29:09,190
Come on! Come on!

590
01:29:09,298 --> 01:29:12,790
Don't worry about all that stuff.
I got a new boyfriend. He's in the army.

591
01:29:12,902 --> 01:29:15,803
Maybe he'll get killed or somethin'.

592
01:29:15,905 --> 01:29:18,931
I don't know. Anyway, he said I'm pretty.
And maybe I am.

593
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,941
Look at this!

594
01:29:21,043 --> 01:29:23,944
Come on. Come on.
Hey, what'd you do at that school anyway?

595
01:29:24,046 --> 01:29:26,014
Ballet!

596
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:47,461
Yeah, I got it!
Get in the alley! Hurry up!

597
01:29:51,341 --> 01:29:53,832
I don't wait two hours for nobody.

598
01:29:55,946 --> 01:29:58,847
Maybe he don't have a watch.

599
01:29:58,949 --> 01:30:01,918
Yeah. If I believe that,
he'll tell me another.

600
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:06,019
His name was Edward.

601
01:30:08,124 --> 01:30:10,592
He was nice. I liked him.

602
01:30:10,694 --> 01:30:13,595
I don't know.
He said he was gonna buy me a fur.

603
01:30:13,697 --> 01:30:16,427
I always wanted a fur.

604
01:30:16,533 --> 01:30:19,661
- Where ya goin'?
- For a walk.

605
01:30:21,071 --> 01:30:23,096
I don't know where, but -

606
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:28,073
Go - Go beat the heck
out of some tree or somethin'.

607
01:30:28,179 --> 01:30:30,079
Take it out on them.

608
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:32,081
You comin' with me or what?

609
01:30:32,183 --> 01:30:35,084
<i>This girl,
she didn't know where she was goin'...</i>

610
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,086
<i>or what she was gonna do.</i>

611
01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:39,816
<i>She didn't have no money on her.</i>

612
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:44,161
<i>Maybe she'd meet up with a character.</i>

613
01:30:45,596 --> 01:30:48,497
<i>I was hopin'
things would work out for her.</i>

614
01:30:48,599 --> 01:30:51,067
<i>She was a good friend of mine.</i>

615
01:30:52,305 --> 01:31:52,468
