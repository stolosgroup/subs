00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,287
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

4
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,787
<i>...the Ardor residence.</i>

5
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,299
<i>Please leave a message</i>

6
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:54,457
<i>after the tone.</i>

7
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:59,796
<i>Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

8
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,165
<i>Uh, I'm sorry
to be calling so late.</i>

9
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,035
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

10
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,970
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

11
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,339
<i>Um...</i>

12
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,741
<i>Listen, I got kind of
a scary email from Terri</i>

13
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:13,410
<i>and she hasn't
been responding.</i>

14
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,545
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

15
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,548
<i>But, uh, yeah,
it sounds like you guys</i>

16
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:21,618
<i>have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

17
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:24,488
<i>Anyway, uh, I just got
a little worried.</i>

18
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,291
<i>So, um, if you can call
when you can,</i>

19
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,825
<i>and of course, you know I'm...
I'm always here</i>

20
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,427
<i>if you need anything,</i>

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,996
<i>of course.</i>

22
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,203
Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.

23
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,044
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

24
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,312
What are you up to?

25
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:56,282
<i>Um, just smoked
some resin with Mark</i>

26
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,616
<i>and now we're getting pizza.</i>

27
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,252
Oh, nice.

28
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,489
<i>- Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.
- Yeah, um...</i>

29
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,425
<i>He's saying "hi"
right now, over and over.</i>

30
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,694
- Hi, Mark.
- <i>Hi, Mark.</i>

31
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:12,833
So, I was calling
just to see if you...

32
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:15,235
You still wanted
to hang out later?

33
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,304
<i>Oh.</i>

34
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,675
<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

35
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,677
I mean, not...
Not concretely,

36
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,912
but, um,
I just wanted to see...

37
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:29,850
<i>Um... Well... Okay.</i>

38
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:32,553
<i>Yeah, I should be able
to swing by.</i>

39
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,721
- Cool.
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

40
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,129
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

41
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,132
Um, well...

42
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,736
Uh, yeah, um...

43
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,841
I emailed her three times

44
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,210
and still no response

45
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:58,113
so I'm getting
a little bit nervous, so...

46
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,882
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

47
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:02,817
Yeah, probably...

48
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,162
<i>She does this
every other day, Dani.</i>

49
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,321
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

50
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,135
Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

51
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,959
<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babes.</i>

52
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,361
<i>You go straight
to crisis mode.</i>

53
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,831
Well, she's my sister

54
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:19,469
and even you said that
this email seemed different.

55
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,669
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

56
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,474
<i>Is it though, really?</i>

57
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,975
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

58
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,745
<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

59
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,348
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,418
You are right, yeah, I know.

61
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,886
<i>I mean, the more you respond</i>

62
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,555
<i>the more she's encouraged
to keep...</i>

63
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,366
No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

64
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,391
I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.

65
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,796
I'm very lucky to have you.

66
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,266
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

67
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,100
I love you.

68
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,071
<i>I love you.</i>

69
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,276
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

70
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,613
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

71
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,647
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

72
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,484
Okay, I love you.

73
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,153
- <i>All right.</i>
- Bye.

74
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,367
It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

75
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,271
he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

76
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,895
<i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

77
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,329
What if
I've scared him, though?

78
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,906
I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

79
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,065
<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

80
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,635
I'm always leaning on him!

81
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,247
Like, I even called him today
in tears

82
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,671
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary email.

83
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,007
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,010
What if I'm scaring him off?

85
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,379
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

86
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:35,580
Mmm.

87
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:36,948
Just some ominous bullshit

88
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:38,882
like she always does
and it's torture.

89
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,884
And I lean on him constantly
for support.

90
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,354
Like, what if
I have overwhelmed him

91
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,523
and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

92
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:48,192
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

93
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,030
No, not if I...
I went too far, if I leaned too much.

94
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,365
<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

95
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,301
Yeah, but what if
I need him too often

96
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,669
and it becomes a chore?

97
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,870
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

98
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,444
<i>Because it shouldn't
ever be a chore.</i>

99
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,241
<i>Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?</i>

100
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,852
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me
for anything.

101
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,036
I've never even seen him cry,

102
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:08,079
so I'm the only one
that's leaning.

103
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,157
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

104
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,318
<i>The only one
making yourself vulnerable.</i>

105
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:13,851
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

106
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,787
Dude.

107
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,189
You have gotta
get off the fence with this.

108
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:22,170
What if
I regret it later

109
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:23,462
and I can't get her back?

110
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,831
- You don't want her back!
- But I might.

111
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,166
Okay, well, then you can

112
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,735
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

113
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,438
and then
we'll remind you again

114
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,149
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

115
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:35,575
for, like, a year now

116
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,977
and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

117
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,121
and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

118
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,449
Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

119
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,317
that is playing out
this particular drama

120
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,952
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

121
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:51,258
What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

122
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,426
Well, I dunno,
your prospectus, maybe?

123
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,828
Your PhD...

124
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,862
Wow, okay,
thanks for the psychoanalysis.

125
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,274
It's not
about academics, Josh.

126
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,733
I'm just trying
to get you focused.

127
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,801
- Change?
- Um, that's for you.

128
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,540
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

129
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,252
And don't forget about
all the Swedish women

130
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,645
you can impregnate in June.

131
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:12,097
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

132
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,665
- all the Swedish milkmaids.
- Mmm-hmm.

133
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,284
That's not her again.

134
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:19,953
Seriously?

135
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,657
Oh, my God.

136
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,600
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

137
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,744
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

138
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,028
It's literally abuse.

139
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,597
- She's abusing you.
- 'Scuse me.

140
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,666
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

141
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,333
Okay, excuse me, guys.

142
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,934
- Well...
- Great.

143
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,278
- Hey.
<i>- No.</i>

144
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:48,582
- Dani, babe?
- <i>Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

145
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,016
No, no, no, no, no!

146
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,388
Hey, babe.

147
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,290
How you feeling?

148
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:24,833
I'm up.

149
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,006
Where you going?

150
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:32,975
I was just gonna go
to that party for 45 minutes.

151
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,476
But, you just keep sleeping.

152
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,377
No.

153
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,179
No, I'll come with you.

154
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,512
You sure you got enough sleep?

155
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,616
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

156
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,031
Yeah, I'm fucking
dreading the summer.

157
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,322
Stuck in a shit-ass hole

158
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,726
listening to my step-mom
fuck my dad all day.

159
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,194
I'll listen to
your step-mom fuck your dad.

160
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,463
Hey, Josh, you, uh,
going to Europe?

161
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:56,164
Uh, yeah, yeah,
for my thesis,

162
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,501
you know, we all are.

163
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,837
Oh, you're all going?

164
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,007
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Halsingland.

165
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,441
Sweden.

166
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:08,779
Oh, any occasion,
or is it just for fun?

167
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,315
Uh, well, I'm...
I'm doing my research

168
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:14,017
on European
midsummer traditions,

169
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,718
these guys
are just tagging along.

170
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,520
Mr. Pelle's invited us to

171
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,856
an authentic hippie midsummer
at his yodeling farm.

172
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,460
Oh, yeah?

173
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,831
I mean,
we were talking about it.

174
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,532
We were thinking about it.

175
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:32,903
For when?

176
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:34,838
Uh...

177
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,573
Mid-June to mid-July.

178
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,741
Yeah, two weeks from now?

179
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,276
Yeah.

180
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,780
I mean, that's if we even go.

181
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:45,249
I'm probably
not gonna go, but...

182
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,918
Yeah, we were talking
about it.

183
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,494
You okay?

184
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:31,897
Mmm-hmm. Fine.

185
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,937
That was just really weird.

186
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,539
What was?

187
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,414
The...

188
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,817
Sweden.

189
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,453
I had no idea.

190
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,758
Well, what do you mean?

191
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,893
'Cause I told you
I wanted to go.

192
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,966
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

193
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,337
I just decided today.

194
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,373
I wasn't keeping it from you.

195
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,609
You already have a ticket.

196
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,782
I'm sorry?

197
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,556
Okay, well, just

198
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,325
imagine if you were at a party
and someone said,

199
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,493
"Hey, what're you doing
for summer?"

200
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,596
And then my friend said,

201
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,200
"Oh, we're going to China
for three months

202
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,576
"and we're leaving
in two weeks..."

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,979
It's Sweden,
for a month and a half.

204
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,445
And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

205
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,671
Okay.

206
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,540
I told you
I wanted to go to Sweden.

207
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,642
No, you said
it would be cool to go.

208
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,211
Yeah, and then
I got the opportunity

209
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,021
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

210
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,314
I just wish you would've
told me, that's all.

211
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,550
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

212
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,487
You didn't apologize,
you said sorry,

213
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,588
which sounds more like,
"Too bad."

214
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,762
Maybe I should just go home.

215
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,597
What? No, no.

216
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,599
I'm just trying to understand.

217
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,844
And I'm trying to apologize.

218
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,536
And I don't need an apology.

219
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,839
I don't, I just wanted to talk
about it, that's all.

220
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,252
I really think
I should just leave.

221
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,945
No, no, no, no.

222
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,656
Please, please, please. I'm not...
I'm not trying to attack you.

223
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,991
- It really feels like you are.
- I'm not.

224
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,482
Well, then...
Well, then I'm sorry.

225
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:31,853
I'm... I just got confused.
I'm sorry, I...

226
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:34,223
Hey, please, c'mon,
can you come?

227
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:35,399
- Just can you come and sit...
- Stop.

228
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,557
...with me, please?

229
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:38,894
Please, and we can
talk about it.

230
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:41,796
Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

231
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,631
But I'm fine,
I think it's great

232
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,601
that you're going to Sweden,
I do.

233
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:47,603
I think it's amazing.

234
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:50,605
Are you going for your thesis?

235
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,710
I don't know
what my thesis is.

236
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:57,579
I know and it...
It can... It will...

237
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,617
It can be inspiring, right?

238
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:04,786
Right?

239
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,926
In Stockholm, are there
any, like, meatball sex clubs

240
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,363
we should hit up
before we head north?

241
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,164
No, we're going
straight north.

242
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,346
Not straight, straight,
though, right?

243
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,477
We gotta go through Stockholm

244
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:20,569
to get there.

245
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:21,780
No, it's
the opposite direction.

246
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,806
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

247
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,276
Guys, it's Dani.

248
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,809
She's coming up.

249
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,746
Okay.

250
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,749
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

251
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:43,693
Um,
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

252
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:46,230
So you guys know.

253
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,697
She's not actually gonna come,

254
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,500
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

255
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:54,538
- You invited her to...
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,873
But she's not coming.

257
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,743
She doesn't want to?

258
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,581
I invited her
and she accepted,

259
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,617
but she's not actually coming
to Sweden.

260
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:09,520
Okay.

261
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:14,059
Guys, you know
what she's been going through.

262
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:18,562
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

263
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,098
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

264
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,109
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

265
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,768
Okay, that's great.

266
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:28,472
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

267
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,884
and you all know
that she's coming...

268
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,142
Agreed?

269
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:32,445
Yep.

270
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:34,179
- Hey!
- Hey, babe!

271
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:36,580
Hey, guys.

272
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:38,482
- Hey.
- Yo.

273
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,051
How's it going?

274
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:42,921
We're chilling.

275
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:44,190
Nice.

276
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:48,660
So, Sweden.

277
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,273
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

278
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,331
I mean, I...

279
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:53,733
I guess so,

280
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,786
if that's not completely
ruining you guys' plans.

281
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,036
- Oh, no, no.
- No, not at all.

282
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,709
Uh, Christian,
can I get you to take a look

283
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,644
at this paragraph real quick?

284
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,949
Uh, yeah, sure.

285
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,818
- I'll be back.
- Mmm-hmm.

286
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,792
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

287
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,137
What were you drawing?

288
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,505
Uh, just the table.

289
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:32,872
Oh.

290
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:35,306
How have you been?

291
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,210
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

292
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:40,213
Survived finals, you know.

293
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,848
- And you?
- Uh...

294
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,284
I didn't quite finish,

295
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:48,021
but they're giving me
a break this year.

296
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,425
Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

297
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,824
It's, uh...

298
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,860
How did you like
the Anthropology department?

299
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,695
I like it, yeah.

300
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,831
Not as much as
this one maybe, but...

301
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:02,202
You're doing psychiatry,
right?

302
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,603
Uh, psychology, yeah.

303
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:06,106
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

304
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,409
Yeah, also that funny look
in your eye.

305
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,145
So you're coming
to Halsingland?

306
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,481
I guess so, yeah.

307
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:17,018
And, um, we'll actually
be arriving on my birthday.

308
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,620
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you!

309
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:24,525
Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

310
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,194
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy

311
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,062
nine-day festival
my family's doing.

312
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,131
- Lots of pageantry...
- Uh-huh.

313
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,033
...special ceremonies,
and dressing up.

314
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,634
That sounds fun.

315
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:35,571
It'll probably seem
very silly.

316
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,939
But, it's like theater.

317
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,274
Yeah, Christian says you're...

318
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:42,143
You're from
like a commune, right?

319
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,379
Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

320
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:47,316
Here. I'll show you.

321
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,323
Oh, wow.

322
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,859
I see what you mean
about the pageantry.

323
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,337
Yeah, we make
those clothes special

324
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,429
for every
winter and summer solstice.

325
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:03,532
I mean, everybody sort of
does everything together.

326
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:05,134
That's an interesting symbol.

327
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:08,537
Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

328
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,839
Whoa, who's that one?

329
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:13,409
- That's last year's May Queen.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,644
Beautiful.

331
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:19,648
You know, I'm very, very glad
you're coming.

332
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:24,087
I... I think
it's very good you're coming.

333
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:26,189
Thank you.

334
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,790
Also, I...

335
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,560
I never had the chance
to tell you...

336
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,229
- Mmm.
- ...but I was...

337
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:36,900
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

338
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:40,370
- Oh.
- What happened, I mean,

339
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,205
I can't even imagine.

340
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:43,907
I mean...

341
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,675
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

342
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,343
I kind of have some idea.

343
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:48,945
- I'm sorry.
- No!

344
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:50,446
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

345
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,016
I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

346
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,169
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

347
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,373
<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

348
00:23:57,182 --> 00:24:00,218
Oh, my God, the women here.

349
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,255
What is it
that makes them hotter?

350
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:04,108
The Vikings
grabbed all the best babes

351
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:07,425
from other countries
and dragged them over.

352
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,894
Christian, you can do
your thesis on that.

353
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,497
How long is the drive?

354
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,665
About four hours.

355
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,799
Oh, my God.

356
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,970
Okay,
this is the first stop.

357
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:25,205
This is it?

358
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,308
Not quite, almost.

359
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,581
Pelle!

360
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,450
- Hey!
- Hey!

361
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,023
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

362
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:37,952
Hey, guys,
so these are younger people

363
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:39,420
from my village.

364
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,522
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

365
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:43,257
Come on over.

366
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:46,227
Hey!

367
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,530
These are my friends
from America.

368
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:53,000
- Oh, dude.
- Hey.

369
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,436
Just fucking walk.

370
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,013
Yeah, dude,
there's so many bugs.

371
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,606
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mmm.

372
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,114
Okay, so this is, uh...

373
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,615
- Mark, Dani...
- Hi.

374
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:09,350
Christian and Josh.

375
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,152
What?

376
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,989
Give me just one second.

377
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,491
You think
he knows that guy?

378
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:16,624
He sounded mad.

379
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,570
That must be good.

380
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,546
Here! Come on over,
come on over.

381
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,481
This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

382
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:40,616
Christian, Dani,

383
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:42,050
- Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

384
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,686
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

385
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,723
Uh, best friends since
we were babies, actually.

386
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,022
Yeah.

387
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:50,226
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

388
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,561
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

389
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,663
Awesome! And say hello
to my friends.

390
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,198
This is Simon and Connie

391
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,833
- from London.
- How's it going?

392
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,967
- Hi.
- Simon, this is Pelle...

393
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:01,137
And these are all the names

394
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,673
I just learned
two seconds ago.

395
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,109
Perfect timing, by the way,

396
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:08,913
we... We just took these
five minutes ago.

397
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,080
Haven't even started
coming up yet.

398
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,350
Oh, shit!

399
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:16,286
Do you guys wanna take it now
or should we settle in first?

400
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:17,864
Fuck it,
let's just take it now, right?

401
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,222
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

402
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,125
Uh, you know what,

403
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:24,094
I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

404
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,697
- Uh, yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

405
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,365
And listen,
if you're feeling uneasy,

406
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,201
you don't have
to take them at all.

407
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,771
No. No, no, no. I just...
I wanna feel settled first.

408
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,338
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,308
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

410
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,742
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

411
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,511
I want us to come up together.

412
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,781
- Ready?
- Okay?

413
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:45,649
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

414
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:49,821
Dude, we can't take them
at different times,

415
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:51,523
they'll be
totally separate trips.

416
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,159
You wanna wait for us then?

417
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:02,678
You know what,
it's fine, it's fine.

418
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,377
- Babe... Babe, no.
- I'm ready.

419
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,780
- No, it's okay,
- Don't feel rushed.

420
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,639
I don't, I don't.
It's fine, I'm ready.

421
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,542
Are you sure?

422
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:14,346
Yes, Mark, thank you.

423
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,147
- They've made mushroom tea.
- Mmm-hmm.

424
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:17,682
If you prefer
against the taste.

425
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:20,151
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll try that, thank you.

426
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:21,621
- Ingemar? Ingemar?
- Ingemar.

427
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:23,655
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
- Perfect.

428
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,358
Don't let Mark be the one

429
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:27,651
- to pressure you.
- He's not.

430
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,562
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

431
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,106
It will... It will get
complicated otherwise, it's fine.

432
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,697
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

433
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:34,232
- There you go.
- Ooh.

434
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:35,401
Thanks, dude.

435
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,203
Okay,
here we go then.

436
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:38,747
- Think happy thoughts!
- Are you sure about this?

437
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,974
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers!

438
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:44,710
- All right.
- Yeah?

439
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:46,145
Are you sure about this?

440
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,247
I think it's gonna be fun.

441
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:50,417
- We're in?
- Yep, go.

442
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,089
What time is it?

443
00:28:57,223 --> 00:29:00,360
It's 9:00 p.m.

444
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:03,697
What do you mean?

445
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:06,733
What do you mean?

446
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,237
That can't be right!
The sky is blue!

447
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:13,306
It's fine, it's Sweden.

448
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,376
That's not fine!
Why is it like that?

449
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,313
It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

450
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,648
That feels wrong,
I don't like that!

451
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,884
I promise you,
it's okay.

452
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:25,252
I'm not okay.

453
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,055
Oh, fuck,
it's a new person.

454
00:29:27,187 --> 00:29:28,288
What?

455
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:30,691
I don't want new people
right now.

456
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:33,627
No,
new people are good, Mark.

457
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:36,096
Hi, hi!

458
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,466
I'm just gonna lay down, okay?

459
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:41,936
Yeah, do that.

460
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,137
Everybody else lay down.

461
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,343
Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

462
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:54,415
Josh, can you lie down,
please?

463
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,786
Can you feel that?

464
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,754
The energy.

465
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:01,322
Coming up from the earth.

466
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,107
Look!

467
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:19,641
The trees too,
they're breathing.

468
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,917
Nature just knows
instinctively

469
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,886
how to stay in harmony.

470
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:36,593
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

471
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,368
You guys are like my family.

472
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,941
You're like my real,
actual family.

473
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,378
Dani?

474
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,415
Sorry.

475
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:02,619
Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

476
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:04,387
I can walk, too.

477
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,157
No, I'm good.

478
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,528
No, no, no, no.

479
00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:13,998
Don't think that. You're fine.

480
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:15,532
It's almost your birthday.

481
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,170
You're okay, you're fine.
You're fine.

482
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:31,247
Stop it! I'm fine.

483
00:31:31,382 --> 00:31:32,983
Hey, Dani!

484
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:36,987
How are you?

485
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:39,957
They were laughing at me.

486
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:43,294
What? No, no, no,
I'm sure they weren't.

487
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,629
They've been laughing.

488
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:48,399
Want to come meet my friends?

489
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,905
Thank you.
I'm sorry, thank you.

490
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:04,582
Stop it! Stop it, fuck!

491
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:11,456
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

492
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:48,795
Hey.

493
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:57,870
How long was I asleep?

494
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,073
I mean,

495
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,676
we found you here, like,
six hours ago.

496
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,617
Did it get dark at all?

497
00:33:13,987 --> 00:33:16,857
For a couple of hours,
not completely.

498
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,827
Is it tomorrow?

499
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,964
I mean,
from yesterday's perspective.

500
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:29,669
Come on.

501
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:34,474
Where are we going?

502
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:35,843
What we came for.

503
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:17,019
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

504
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:19,621
Yeah, this is way
the hell out there.

505
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:26,028
Do they have ticks
in Sweden?

506
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:28,062
Sweden has a tick problem.

507
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:29,464
What?

508
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,797
No they don't, do they really?

509
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,400
Actually,
it is a big problem.

510
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,236
Last summer,
a record number of people

511
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,005
got tick-borne encephalitis.

512
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:38,406
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

513
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,575
Both my grandparents
died from ticks.

514
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,309
Had to give them
a closed casket funeral.

515
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:46,282
Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

516
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:47,850
And believe me,
if you ask him,

517
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:50,185
it was not worth the pleasant
picnic in the park.

518
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,487
He's fucked.

519
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:36,533
So, this is the place.

520
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,602
The tranquil
and majestic Harga.

521
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,308
Pelle, you know
all these people?

522
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,077
These are my family!

523
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,081
So we're stopping in Waco

524
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,850
before going
to Pelle's village?

525
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, thank you!

526
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,236
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

527
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,304
- Oh, wow, thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

528
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,739
This bag?

529
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,042
Thank you... Uh, sorry.

530
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,145
Hey, guys?

531
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,580
Meet my sister, Dagny.

532
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,448
Born the exact same day as me.

533
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,650
- Hi.
- Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

534
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,922
- Uh, <i>tack!</i>
- Thank you.

535
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,823
<i>- Tack.</i>
- Hey.

536
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:45,971
Father Odd!

537
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,925
Sorry,
these are my friends.

538
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,728
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

539
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,629
- Hello.
- Hi.

540
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:13,966
Welcome, welcome.

541
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,935
- Hi, oh!
- Welcome home.

542
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:19,704
We are so very happy
to have you.

543
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,140
Oh, thank you.

544
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:24,677
Pelle has an immaculate sense
for people.

545
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:27,481
I... I love
what you're wearing.

546
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:28,658
- My frock?
- Uh-huh.

547
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,049
Yeah, quite girly, no?

548
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,786
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

549
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,156
and because of the nature's

550
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:41,195
hermaphrodite,
I think, qualities. Yeah.

551
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:44,398
Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing

552
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:46,334
in Brajbhoomi?

553
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:48,969
So, we are your hosts.

554
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,703
So whatever you need,
just say so

555
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,540
and we will accommodate, okay?

556
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,007
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

557
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,709
Today is all festivities.

558
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,611
Um, just tomorrow,
the official ceremony begin

559
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:00,214
and you are welcome!

560
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,616
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

561
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,552
Yeah. Enjoy.

562
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,821
Just... Thank you.

563
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:10,291
That guy
has a very red face.

564
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,393
Yeah?

565
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:17,265
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:25,768
- Can I take photos?
- Um... Discreetly.

567
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:30,440
Thanks.

568
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:32,876
Oh, forgive me.

569
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,878
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

570
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:39,115
Welcome to Harga,

571
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:41,218
and happy midsummer!

572
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:45,121
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

573
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:48,459
and it will be 90 years
before our next.

574
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:51,195
And what poetry
that it's now the hottest

575
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,964
and brightest summer
on record.

576
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:57,067
We already have
so much to give back

577
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,769
and so, without any
further blathering,

578
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:02,106
let's raise our glasses.

579
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:08,079
Let our
Nine-Day feast commence.

580
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,816
You guys should join.

581
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:52,186
Oh, no, I'm too scared.

582
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,927
- All right.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

583
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:05,332
What are the kids playing?

584
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,234
Skin the fool.

585
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,937
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

586
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,905
Precious.

587
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:27,522
Hey, Pelle,
can anybody just join in?

588
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:31,059
You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

589
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:32,560
All right.

590
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:36,598
Hey.

591
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:39,434
Happy birthday.

592
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:44,306
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

593
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,008
Just something I do
for birthdays.

594
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,510
Maybe it's not appropriate?

595
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:52,180
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

596
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:54,483
It's beautiful.

597
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:56,551
Anyway, just between us.

598
00:42:57,853 --> 00:42:59,588
Yeah, well...

599
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:02,992
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

600
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:04,993
Oh.

601
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,329
No. No, no, no,
I forgot to remind him

602
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,665
and it's not
his fault, it's...

603
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:11,933
Never mind, it's okay.

604
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:13,537
This is beautiful.

605
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,205
Thank you so much,
I'm really touched.

606
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:20,409
So, how do you support
this place?

607
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,978
Lumbering, linen,
homeopathics...

608
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:24,480
Water power plant.

609
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:28,083
School time over here.

610
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:30,186
Carving runes?

611
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,521
Really?

612
00:43:33,056 --> 00:43:36,025
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

613
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,628
Oh, yeah.
I do that, too.

614
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:40,630
Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

615
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,399
Oh, shit.

616
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:44,333
What alphabet is that from?

617
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:47,537
Uh, the Younger Futhark.

618
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,406
I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

619
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:52,142
Actually, that is
the Elder Futhark.

620
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:55,010
So, how long have you two
been together?

621
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:57,247
- Oh, geez, um...
- Um...

622
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,282
Just over
three and a half years.

623
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:01,218
Four years.

624
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,820
- No? Really?
- Yeah.

625
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:05,489
Four years in two weeks.

626
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:08,359
You're right, I'm sorry.

627
00:44:08,493 --> 00:44:10,661
- You're right. Four years.
- Mmm-hmm.

628
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:16,166
Yeah, um,
how did you guys all meet?

629
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,003
Well, uh...

630
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:21,105
We were all working
on the same farm

631
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,040
and funny enough,
I was dating Connie

632
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,410
when Simon and me
first became pals.

633
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,714
Well, we'd been on a date.

634
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:31,048
And I didn't even actually
know it was a date, so...

635
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:32,550
You're right. No, no.

636
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,194
I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

637
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:36,053
We... We decided to be friends.

638
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:37,523
And that was just before

639
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:39,858
Connie and Simon
started dating.

640
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:41,526
And now they're engaged.

641
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,128
- What? Congratulations!
- Wow.

642
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:46,130
Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

643
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:49,101
Yeah, thanks. Yeah,
we actually asked Ingemar

644
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:50,635
to officiate the wedding.

645
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:52,303
- Really?
- Nah.

646
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:54,540
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

647
00:44:55,474 --> 00:44:57,276
It's like a sacred temple,

648
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:59,444
but no one's allowed in there.

649
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:03,080
Uh, let me show you
where we sleep.

650
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:06,585
Let me show you
the <i>Rotvalta!</i>

651
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:08,888
So we're just gonna ignore
the bear then?

652
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:11,123
It's a bear.

653
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:17,430
What's that?

654
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,532
- We can check it out.
- Yeah.

655
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:31,243
Love story.

656
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:12,620
Oh, wow. What? Wow.

657
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,558
Wow.

658
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,195
Wow, wow, wow.

659
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:26,001
Oh, man. Wow.

660
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:29,403
It's like in the Scripture.

661
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,709
What do you think?

662
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:37,879
It's like another world.

663
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:40,482
Amazing.

664
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:42,083
People just sleep here?

665
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,294
Yeah, all the younger ones

666
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:44,486
until we turn 36

667
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:46,153
and then we move
to the laborers house.

668
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:47,555
Why 36?

669
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:49,858
Well, we think of life
like the seasons.

670
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:52,727
So you're a child until
you're 18 and that's Spring.

671
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:54,963
And then at some point,
we all do our Pilgrimage

672
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:56,765
which is between 18 and 36.

673
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:01,236
That's Summer,
and then from 36 to 54,

674
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:03,739
we're working age,
which is Fall.

675
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:07,509
And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

676
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:10,946
What happens at 72?

677
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:16,584
Not a lot of privacy.

678
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:18,697
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

679
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:20,332
Especially with all these
dicks on the wall.

680
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:21,356
There's a lot of dicks.

681
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:39,254
Did she say something?

682
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:40,644
No, no, no, absolutely not.

683
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:43,245
I just wanted to
let you know before, so...

684
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:44,914
Are these the May Queens?

685
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:47,050
Yeah.

686
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:50,053
Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

687
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:53,056
And who are your May Queens?

688
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,892
Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

689
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:57,694
and the winner gets crowned
and this is...

690
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:00,497
- Oh, wow.
- Hey!

691
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:11,975
Was that...

692
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:14,544
You saw that too, right?

693
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:17,882
Pelle, who was that?

694
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:19,550
Inge.

695
00:48:19,684 --> 00:48:21,785
Oh, my God,
I want to give her a bath.

696
00:48:21,918 --> 00:48:24,755
Hey, can I pull you outside
for a sec?

697
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:26,991
Yeah, sure.

698
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,695
Pelle,
tell her to come back.

699
00:48:40,872 --> 00:48:43,641
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

700
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,876
What?

701
00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:49,514
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

702
00:48:49,648 --> 00:48:54,519
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dani ♪</i>

703
00:48:54,652 --> 00:48:58,056
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

704
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,458
Fuck.

705
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:02,961
- Stop, it's fine.
- What?

706
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:06,365
You didn't think
I forgot, did you?

707
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:10,002
I'm sorry.

708
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:11,737
I'm sorry I got fucked up
by the daylight

709
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,238
and I thought
it was yesterday.

710
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:14,716
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Happy birthday.

711
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,917
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. I'm not upset.

712
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,941
It's okay.

713
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,944
- You should be.
- I... I should be.

714
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,879
I'm sorry.

715
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:48,007
All right, beauty rest.

716
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:50,643
Tomorrow's a big day.

717
00:49:52,378 --> 00:49:53,780
What's tomorrow?

718
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:55,648
First of the big ceremonies.

719
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:02,122
<i>Attestupa.</i>

720
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,059
What's that?

721
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:06,660
Uh, it's too hard to explain,

722
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:08,828
you'll get
a better sense tomorrow.

723
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:12,465
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

724
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:17,370
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

725
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,706
I mean,
it's pretty actual.

726
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,908
Fuck.

727
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,478
Do you know what it is?

728
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,049
Dude!

729
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:32,720
Is it scary?

730
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:37,958
That is so fucking annoying.

731
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:40,027
Yo! Check my scalp for ticks,

732
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,229
then I'll check yours.

733
00:52:08,118 --> 00:52:09,363
Somebody should tell
those girls

734
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:10,787
they're walking stupid.

735
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:20,831
How long
do they typically stand?

736
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:23,867
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

737
00:52:27,238 --> 00:52:29,606
Hey. Oh.

738
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:31,742
- Are these for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

739
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:34,544
- You pick 'em backwards?
- Yeah.

740
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:40,279
Are those the ones?

741
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:41,747
Yeah.

742
00:54:07,806 --> 00:54:09,042
Dude, I'm so hungry.

743
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:11,311
It's like they're trying
to make it gross.

744
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:27,894
Her... Her mother
is on Pilgrimage.

745
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:30,097
- Oh...
- Helps her to detach.

746
00:54:30,697 --> 00:54:31,932
Okay.

747
00:54:32,066 --> 00:54:33,834
The babies
are raised here by everyone.

748
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,636
Wow. You want this?

749
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,726
Dude, are you
following them out?

750
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,360
I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

751
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:12,030
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

752
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:14,999
Wait,
what're we doing now?

753
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:15,523
What is that book?

754
00:59:15,657 --> 00:59:18,225
<i>Rubi Radr.</i>
Our scripture.

755
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:22,899
Can I read that?

756
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,466
You would not be able.

757
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:51,784
Oh, my God!

758
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,255
It's fine.

759
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:57,890
Did she jump?

760
01:01:58,023 --> 01:01:59,123
What the...

761
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,535
It's part of the ceremony.

762
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,736
What?
No, she fell, she fell.

763
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,963
Fuck!

764
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:05,130
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

765
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:06,498
It's okay.

766
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:08,434
Oh, my...
Did she fall or did she jump?

767
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,937
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

768
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,304
What do you mean it's fine?

769
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,206
She's fucking dead.
Look at her head!

770
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:15,975
Look at her head, she's dead!

771
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,610
It's a part
of the ceremony.

772
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:19,154
Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

773
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:21,381
She just fucking jumped
off the cliff.

774
01:02:21,514 --> 01:02:25,118
Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

775
01:02:28,722 --> 01:02:30,223
Oh, my God.

776
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:32,659
What the fuck?

777
01:02:43,604 --> 01:02:46,373
No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

778
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:48,608
He's doing the same
fucking thing!

779
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:53,014
Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

780
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:54,581
Tell him to stop.

781
01:02:54,714 --> 01:02:57,084
Why's everyone just
standing there, what the fuck?

782
01:02:57,217 --> 01:03:00,254
Sir, don't...
Don't jump, don't jump!

783
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:01,922
Please, someone tell him
not to jump.

784
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:03,537
- What the fuck?
- Someone tell him...

785
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:29,250
- He's still alive.
- What's going on?

786
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,386
Fuck, we're going.

787
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:40,323
- Fuck! This is fucked!
- Where?

788
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:42,759
Fuck this! You're fucked!

789
01:04:42,893 --> 01:04:44,871
Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

790
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:46,329
what the fuck is wrong
with you?

791
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:51,201
- Please! Please!
- No, fucking leave her alone!

792
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:53,036
Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

793
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,404
What? Explain what?

794
01:04:54,538 --> 01:04:56,473
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

795
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:58,475
Please! What you just saw

796
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:01,578
is a long, long,
long observed custom.

797
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:03,380
- "Custom!" It's fucked!
- Yes.

798
01:05:03,514 --> 01:05:05,850
Those two who jumped
have just reached

799
01:05:05,984 --> 01:05:08,585
the end of
their Harga life-cycle.

800
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,356
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

801
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:15,093
- "Joy?"
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

802
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:17,462
it will be a great joy for me.

803
01:05:17,595 --> 01:05:20,064
- Fuck.
- We view life as a circle,

804
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:21,698
a recycle.

805
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:25,003
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

806
01:05:25,136 --> 01:05:28,206
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

807
01:05:28,338 --> 01:05:30,307
will inherit that name.

808
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,776
Instead of getting old

809
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:35,181
and dying in pain
and fear and shame,

810
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:37,481
we give our life.

811
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:39,417
As a gesture.

812
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,986
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

813
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:44,389
It does no good dying,

814
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:46,891
lashing back
at the inevitable.

815
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:49,494
It corrupts the spirit.

816
01:05:49,627 --> 01:05:52,898
I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

817
01:05:57,635 --> 01:05:58,971
You feeling okay?

818
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,908
I just really need to not be
here right now.

819
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,043
Yeah.

820
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:10,850
I'm gonna go.

821
01:06:10,983 --> 01:06:12,903
Just take some time
to yourself, okay.

822
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,060
- Hey, dude...
- Hey!

823
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:55,695
Holy shit, right?

824
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,998
Are you okay?

825
01:06:58,632 --> 01:07:00,001
Yeah, I'm fine.

826
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:01,836
Good.

827
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:09,176
Hey, listen. Um...

828
01:07:10,077 --> 01:07:11,479
I've been thinking
about something

829
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,046
that I wanted to ask you.

830
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,482
Or tell you, actually.

831
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:17,852
Um...

832
01:07:20,922 --> 01:07:24,191
I've been thinking
a lot about my thesis.

833
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,160
And, um...

834
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:29,630
I've decided I'm gonna
do it here. On Harga.

835
01:07:30,933 --> 01:07:32,366
And I wanted to
tell you first.

836
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:36,070
Just so it didn't seem like
I wasn't telling you.

837
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:41,876
I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

838
01:07:46,514 --> 01:07:47,950
I mean... I mean, you know

839
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:50,552
I'm doing my thesis on
midsummer. That's the reason

840
01:07:50,686 --> 01:07:52,054
- why I'm here.
- Yeah.

841
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:56,224
Yeah, but not
on this community.

842
01:07:56,358 --> 01:07:59,195
I mean, you're going
to Germany and England next.

843
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:03,565
Well, you knew I was
gonna wanna do this.

844
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:07,437
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

845
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:09,372
I mean, did you even know
until just now?

846
01:08:09,504 --> 01:08:10,664
Christian, of course you did!

847
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:12,174
Okay, do you think
I don't know

848
01:08:12,307 --> 01:08:13,976
what you're doing?

849
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:16,611
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

850
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:19,182
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

851
01:08:19,315 --> 01:08:22,617
I'm... I'm honestly
kind of impressed.

852
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:24,129
What the fuck, man?
What does that mean?

853
01:08:24,153 --> 01:08:25,487
Yeah, what the fuck!
This is what

854
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,924
I've been working toward
and you know it.

855
01:08:28,057 --> 01:08:30,135
That's why you look so guilty
right now, because you know.

856
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:31,560
You know
that what you're doing

857
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:33,796
is unethical and leechy
and lazy.

858
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,666
And, frankly,
it's kind of sad.

859
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,203
- Fuck you!
- No, dude, not fuck me!

860
01:08:39,335 --> 01:08:40,837
Find your own subject.

861
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,372
Or... Or your own passion.

862
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,073
And, because...
All right, look.

863
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,576
I am... I'm actually
invested in this.

864
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:47,978
This is not some
glorified hobby

865
01:08:48,112 --> 01:08:50,513
that I'm casually
dipping my feet into.

866
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:59,956
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

867
01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:02,259
If you're gonna
do it here too,

868
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:04,795
I'm open to collaborating.

869
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:07,365
And if not, I guess we can
both do separate theses

870
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:08,698
on the Hargas.

871
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:18,208
Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

872
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:19,777
What?

873
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:25,793
We're leaving
tomorrow morning.

874
01:09:25,817 --> 01:09:26,818
I know we are.

875
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,520
I told Christian this already,

876
01:09:28,652 --> 01:09:30,331
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea,

877
01:09:30,355 --> 01:09:32,166
- so if he comes up to you...
- Well, no,

878
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,892
wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt that

879
01:09:34,025 --> 01:09:35,870
the elders will approve of
anything being written down.

880
01:09:35,894 --> 01:09:37,295
They're extremely protective.

881
01:09:37,429 --> 01:09:39,040
Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

882
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:40,707
- Problem solved.
- Then what would be the point?

883
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,209
You couldn't even get it
peer reviewed.

884
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:44,302
And Christian did already
ask me this, by the way,

885
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:47,272
and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

886
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:49,674
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

887
01:09:49,808 --> 01:09:51,009
Ah, fuck. No.

888
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:53,312
Okay, look, uh,
I'll ask the elders.

889
01:09:53,446 --> 01:09:55,247
- Okay? Good.
- Yep.

890
01:10:06,492 --> 01:10:07,759
Dani?

891
01:10:09,428 --> 01:10:11,263
Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

892
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:13,375
Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

893
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:15,000
Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

894
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:16,777
I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

895
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:19,805
I mean, I know it looks
extreme. But we only...

896
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:21,841
I don't know
why I'm here, Pelle!

897
01:10:21,974 --> 01:10:23,214
I don't know
why you invited us.

898
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:24,843
I don't know.
I don't know why...

899
01:10:24,976 --> 01:10:26,555
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

900
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:28,156
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know and I can't...

901
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,940
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

902
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:31,260
Dani, please.

903
01:10:31,284 --> 01:10:32,818
Please sit down.

904
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:35,087
Dani.

905
01:10:37,389 --> 01:10:38,657
I invited my friends

906
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,069
because this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

907
01:10:40,093 --> 01:10:41,660
and I wanted to share it.

908
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:45,131
Especially with my friends who
I knew would appreciate it.

909
01:10:45,264 --> 01:10:46,264
Because I...

910
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:47,867
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

911
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,603
Okay, but I'm not
an anthropologist

912
01:10:49,735 --> 01:10:51,047
and I don't understand
any of this.

913
01:10:51,071 --> 01:10:52,449
- Yes, yes, yes. I know.
- I don't get it.

914
01:10:52,473 --> 01:10:53,639
I know. And, and yet,

915
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:56,042
I was the most excited
for you to come.

916
01:10:56,176 --> 01:11:00,080
Here. Here, smell this.

917
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:03,016
What is it?

918
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,918
- It calms you down.
- No, I'm fine.

919
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:07,120
I don't want it.

920
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:10,056
- Are you sure?
- No...

921
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:12,035
I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

922
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,427
Okay.

923
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,763
I know what
you're going through, Dani.

924
01:11:18,499 --> 01:11:20,134
What am I going through?

925
01:11:20,268 --> 01:11:21,802
Because I lost
my parents, too.

926
01:11:21,936 --> 01:11:23,770
- What? No, no, Pelle.
- Yes, yes, yes...

927
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,249
That is not what
I'm talking about.

928
01:11:25,273 --> 01:11:26,806
I'm not talking
about my family.

929
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:28,152
I know that's not what
you're talking about.

930
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:29,496
I'm not talking
about my family...

931
01:11:29,544 --> 01:11:30,754
I lost my parents
when I was a little boy.

932
01:11:30,778 --> 01:11:32,078
They burned up in a fire.

933
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:33,656
No, I wasn't talking
about that.

934
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,751
My parents,
they burned up in a fire

935
01:11:36,884 --> 01:11:39,053
and I became,
technically, an orphan.

936
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:41,956
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

937
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,193
Because I do,
I really, really do.

938
01:11:47,228 --> 01:11:50,765
Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

939
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:54,802
because I had a family here.

940
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:59,241
Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

941
01:12:00,509 --> 01:12:02,544
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

942
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:06,381
bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

943
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,917
That's what you were given.

944
01:12:09,652 --> 01:12:12,454
But I have always felt held.

945
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:19,927
By a family. A real family.

946
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,835
Which everyone deserves.

947
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:30,239
And you deserve.

948
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,649
Pelle, Christian
could walk in.

949
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:40,782
He's what I'm talking about.

950
01:12:43,453 --> 01:12:45,955
He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

951
01:12:47,123 --> 01:12:49,758
Dani, do you feel held by him?

952
01:12:52,328 --> 01:12:54,465
Does he feel like home to you?

953
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:37,941
Hey. How you doing?

954
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:40,911
Today was tough.

955
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:45,383
You gonna be okay?

956
01:13:48,018 --> 01:13:50,388
Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

957
01:13:50,954 --> 01:13:53,825
Yeah, of course I am.

958
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:56,594
That was really,
really shocking.

959
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,298
I'm trying to keep
an open mind though.

960
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,502
That's cultural, you know?

961
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:05,936
We stick our elders
in nursing homes.

962
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,273
I'm sure they find
that disturbing.

963
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:13,346
I think we really need to just
at least try to acclimate.

964
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,622
Hey, do you... Sorry.

965
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:26,459
Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

966
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:27,592
Yeah, sure.

967
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,860
Thanks.

968
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:57,624
You're gonna wake her.

969
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:00,478
Yo, Pelle.

970
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:17,094
What'cha doin'?

971
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,265
Just working in the garden.

972
01:18:26,004 --> 01:18:27,539
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

973
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:29,240
Any word?

974
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:31,644
Yeah, they said you can do it.

975
01:18:31,777 --> 01:18:34,245
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names.

976
01:18:34,379 --> 01:18:35,523
- Okay. Wow.
- Or the location

977
01:18:35,547 --> 01:18:36,581
is never even hinted at.

978
01:18:36,716 --> 01:18:38,149
- Okay.
- And you'll have to sign

979
01:18:38,283 --> 01:18:39,652
an agreement to that.

980
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,822
And you're splitting it
with Christian

981
01:18:42,956 --> 01:18:45,523
because he came to me first.

982
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:48,060
Well, that's... We'll...
We'll figure that out.

983
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:49,295
I gotta go take a leak.

984
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:51,999
Uh, here, can I
ask you something?

985
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:53,164
- Yeah.
- Uh...

986
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:56,335
Do you know what this is?

987
01:18:57,336 --> 01:18:59,873
I found it
under Christian's bed.

988
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:04,610
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

989
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:07,513
- A love rune. Huh.
- Yeah.

990
01:19:07,648 --> 01:19:09,716
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

991
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:14,320
What's going on?

992
01:19:14,453 --> 01:19:16,198
Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

993
01:19:16,222 --> 01:19:19,359
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

994
01:19:19,993 --> 01:19:21,029
Are you serious?

995
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:22,528
Yeah.

996
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:25,365
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

997
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:27,534
That is incredible news.
Thank you.

998
01:19:27,668 --> 01:19:29,148
You're splitting it
with Josh as well.

999
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:32,072
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

1000
01:19:32,204 --> 01:19:33,940
Okay. Well, I think my sister

1001
01:19:34,074 --> 01:19:35,943
Maja has taken
a liking to you.

1002
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:38,713
Yeah?

1003
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:41,048
The red head?

1004
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,919
Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1005
01:19:46,253 --> 01:19:48,856
It basically means that,
uh, you are...

1006
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,794
You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

1007
01:19:52,927 --> 01:19:54,394
- Okay. Good for her.
- Hey!

1008
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,470
Hey, whoa!

1009
01:20:04,105 --> 01:20:05,940
What? Okay, relax. Relax!

1010
01:20:06,075 --> 01:20:07,608
What did I do?

1011
01:20:07,742 --> 01:20:10,545
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened? What happened?

1012
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:15,717
What did I do? What did I do?

1013
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:19,587
Dude! Okay!

1014
01:20:20,455 --> 01:20:22,290
You pissed
on the ancestral tree.

1015
01:20:22,423 --> 01:20:24,026
- The tree... So what?
- Yes, yes.

1016
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,293
"So what?"

1017
01:20:26,562 --> 01:20:27,830
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

1018
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:29,464
That tree is tied
to all of our dead.

1019
01:20:29,597 --> 01:20:31,867
It's a dead tree, though.

1020
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,535
- It's dead.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1021
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:35,070
But it's important to us.

1022
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,372
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1023
01:20:54,356 --> 01:20:55,625
Hey.

1024
01:20:55,759 --> 01:20:57,594
Hey. It was
really nice to meet you.

1025
01:20:57,726 --> 01:21:00,329
I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

1026
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:01,663
What?

1027
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:03,500
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1028
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:05,678
Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

1029
01:21:05,702 --> 01:21:07,904
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1030
01:21:09,172 --> 01:21:10,539
Connie.

1031
01:21:11,306 --> 01:21:12,842
Oh, there.

1032
01:21:12,976 --> 01:21:15,745
Uh, Simon,
he told me to tell you

1033
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,380
that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

1034
01:21:18,515 --> 01:21:20,917
And after, uh,
Simon gets dropped off,

1035
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:23,686
he's sending the truck
back for you.

1036
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:24,621
What?

1037
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,857
You will meet him, uh, there.

1038
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:29,459
No.

1039
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,327
Why would he
just go without me?

1040
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:32,730
He... He wouldn't do that.

1041
01:21:32,863 --> 01:21:35,833
Well, the truck
only had room for two.

1042
01:21:35,966 --> 01:21:37,268
So...

1043
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,204
What does that mean?

1044
01:21:40,336 --> 01:21:41,380
That doesn't even
make any sense.

1045
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:42,773
He would have told me.

1046
01:21:42,907 --> 01:21:45,110
Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

1047
01:21:45,243 --> 01:21:47,711
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1048
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:49,914
So they didn't
want to waste time.

1049
01:21:50,047 --> 01:21:52,284
So I could have
sat on his lap.

1050
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,818
Yes, I imagined that, too,

1051
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:57,288
but, you know, we...
We don't break traffic laws.

1052
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,689
Okay?

1053
01:22:01,193 --> 01:22:03,061
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1054
01:22:03,195 --> 01:22:05,930
Now, Connie. There was
no room in the truck.

1055
01:22:06,063 --> 01:22:09,301
Yet, it is coming right back
for you. Yeah.

1056
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,505
This is bullshit.

1057
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:26,383
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1058
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:37,796
And how are jobs
or roles assigned?

1059
01:22:37,929 --> 01:22:40,766
That's based on traits
we show as kids.

1060
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,169
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. Sorry.

1061
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:44,669
Um...

1062
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,372
Simon left without Connie.

1063
01:22:48,207 --> 01:22:50,109
- Jesus, really?
- Yeah.

1064
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:51,711
What a dick move.

1065
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:54,579
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

1066
01:22:54,713 --> 01:22:56,091
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1067
01:22:56,115 --> 01:22:57,382
No, no.

1068
01:22:58,351 --> 01:22:59,852
That sucks.

1069
01:23:02,189 --> 01:23:05,490
On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

1070
01:23:06,626 --> 01:23:09,495
Is there ever an issue here
with incest?

1071
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,800
Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

1072
01:23:14,934 --> 01:23:17,503
Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

1073
01:23:17,637 --> 01:23:21,208
So, uh, the elders
must approve mates.

1074
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:23,709
Cousins can sometimes mate.

1075
01:23:23,843 --> 01:23:26,947
But we do respect
their incest taboo.

1076
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,751
So we often need to invite
outside people.

1077
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:54,574
Excuse me. Hey.

1078
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:57,544
Would you like
to help join us?

1079
01:23:59,347 --> 01:24:00,614
Uh...

1080
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:03,952
- Sure, yeah.
- Come.

1081
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:06,921
Do you...
Do you know, um...

1082
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:09,123
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1083
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:11,625
Yes. He was
driven to the station.

1084
01:24:11,758 --> 01:24:13,328
Did you not say goodbye?

1085
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:14,796
No. No, I didn't.

1086
01:24:14,929 --> 01:24:17,498
But, uh, that's okay,
that's okay.

1087
01:24:17,632 --> 01:24:19,700
Hi.

1088
01:24:24,605 --> 01:24:26,175
What are we making here?

1089
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:27,675
Meat tarts!

1090
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,777
Oh, wow.

1091
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,713
Oh, thank you.

1092
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:35,818
She said you're so beautiful.

1093
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:38,387
Oh, thank you.

1094
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:41,056
Um, she's so beautiful.

1095
01:24:44,693 --> 01:24:48,163
We describe it
like emotional sheet music.

1096
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:49,797
Hmm. What does it say?

1097
01:24:49,932 --> 01:24:52,500
Well, each runic letter

1098
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:55,338
stands for one
of the 16 affects,

1099
01:24:55,472 --> 01:24:59,507
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1100
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,977
This one, for example,
is about grief.

1101
01:25:02,111 --> 01:25:03,111
Hmm.

1102
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,215
You can see
at the end, however,

1103
01:25:05,348 --> 01:25:08,050
we have blank pages.

1104
01:25:08,183 --> 01:25:13,056
This is because the <i>Rubi Radr</i>
is a work forever in progress.

1105
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:14,189
Forever evolving.

1106
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:17,293
We have many,
many hundreds of these.

1107
01:25:18,627 --> 01:25:22,365
And who decides
what gets added?

1108
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:27,237
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

1109
01:25:29,973 --> 01:25:33,344
Uh, the disabled?

1110
01:25:33,477 --> 01:25:35,513
Since birth.

1111
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:39,649
He draws
and we, the elders, interpret.

1112
01:25:41,117 --> 01:25:42,153
You see, Josh,

1113
01:25:42,286 --> 01:25:45,554
Rubin is unclouded
by normal cognition.

1114
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,958
It makes him open
for the source.

1115
01:25:49,092 --> 01:25:55,565
Uh, what happens
when Rubin dies?

1116
01:25:55,698 --> 01:25:58,701
Do you just wait
for a baby that is...

1117
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:01,672
Not clouded?

1118
01:26:01,806 --> 01:26:03,040
No, no, no.

1119
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:06,343
Uh, Rubin was a product
of inbreeding.

1120
01:26:07,278 --> 01:26:08,278
All of our Oracles

1121
01:26:08,312 --> 01:26:11,249
are deliberate products
of inbreeding.

1122
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:16,087
Can I take a photograph?

1123
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:19,156
What?

1124
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,559
Uh, a photograph?

1125
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:24,095
- No. Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1126
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:26,897
Absolutely not.

1127
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,692
Oh, fuck, yep, that's her.

1128
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:02,300
Hey.

1129
01:27:09,775 --> 01:27:11,810
Oh, great. She's walking away.

1130
01:27:32,398 --> 01:27:33,666
Thank you.

1131
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,342
Thanks.

1132
01:27:43,075 --> 01:27:44,311
Thanks.

1133
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,119
Has anyone seen Connie?

1134
01:27:54,154 --> 01:27:55,889
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1135
01:27:56,823 --> 01:27:58,025
I'm sure I saw her trying out

1136
01:27:58,158 --> 01:27:59,692
for the sprinting
Olympics earlier.

1137
01:27:59,825 --> 01:28:00,994
What? Where?

1138
01:28:01,128 --> 01:28:02,930
Sorry, but I can say
what happened.

1139
01:28:03,063 --> 01:28:04,364
Her boyfriend
called the landline

1140
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:06,700
from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

1141
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:09,702
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1142
01:28:13,073 --> 01:28:14,908
Okay, well, that's a relief.

1143
01:28:15,043 --> 01:28:17,078
Why would Simon leave
without her?

1144
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:20,415
I'm sure it was just
a miscommunication.

1145
01:28:37,732 --> 01:28:39,934
I could see you
possibly doing that.

1146
01:28:44,973 --> 01:28:46,442
What the hell does that mean?

1147
01:28:52,715 --> 01:28:53,983
Never mind.

1148
01:29:00,656 --> 01:29:03,892
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1149
01:29:09,665 --> 01:29:11,467
Dude, is he going to kill me?

1150
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:16,904
Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

1151
01:29:22,978 --> 01:29:24,514
Oh, so now
you wanna collaborate?

1152
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:25,882
Okay, thank you.

1153
01:29:26,015 --> 01:29:27,125
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1154
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:28,284
...gave you a glimpse of it.

1155
01:29:28,418 --> 01:29:30,019
Thank you.
Sorry I brought it up.

1156
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:56,946
Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

1157
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,716
- Is that...
- What is that?

1158
01:29:58,848 --> 01:30:00,685
- Is that a fucking pube?
- Ew.

1159
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:01,818
It's just a hair.

1160
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:03,554
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1161
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:05,690
Dude, calm down.

1162
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:07,090
Why are you embarrassed?

1163
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:09,959
You're not the one
giving out hair pies.

1164
01:30:29,448 --> 01:30:32,250
Jesus Christ. He's still
fucking lookin' at me.

1165
01:30:32,384 --> 01:30:35,052
Hey. You'll come with me?

1166
01:30:36,187 --> 01:30:38,022
- What?
- You'll come?

1167
01:30:38,657 --> 01:30:40,158
- Uh...
- I'll show you.

1168
01:30:40,559 --> 01:30:41,860
Okay, sure.

1169
01:30:41,993 --> 01:30:44,328
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1170
01:30:44,462 --> 01:30:46,197
Um...

1171
01:30:46,331 --> 01:30:48,533
I'll be back. I guess
she's gonna show me.

1172
01:31:11,623 --> 01:31:13,860
Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

1173
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:15,595
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1174
01:31:18,531 --> 01:31:19,532
Thank you.

1175
01:33:08,309 --> 01:33:10,713
What the fuck, Mark?

1176
01:33:10,846 --> 01:33:12,491
What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door,

1177
01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:14,517
we're not supposed
to be in here.

1178
01:34:11,576 --> 01:34:13,710
Do you think Mark's
still up with that girl?

1179
01:34:14,878 --> 01:34:16,413
I wouldn't be surprised.

1180
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:20,618
What about Josh though?

1181
01:34:20,751 --> 01:34:22,820
I'm honestly
not too concerned.

1182
01:34:24,588 --> 01:34:25,656
Wow.

1183
01:34:26,557 --> 01:34:28,559
We, um,

1184
01:34:28,693 --> 01:34:31,897
have something regretful
to announce.

1185
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:35,666
This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

1186
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,269
was found missing
from the Temple.

1187
01:34:39,637 --> 01:34:42,473
We don't want
to point fingers,

1188
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,675
yet, we kindly ask
that whoever took it

1189
01:34:44,809 --> 01:34:47,012
to return it
to its original place.

1190
01:34:47,144 --> 01:34:48,680
You can leave it
in the Temple,

1191
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:51,650
<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

1192
01:34:51,783 --> 01:34:54,786
<i>Nobody needs to know
it was you.</i>

1193
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,134
Where is your friend, Josh?

1194
01:35:09,267 --> 01:35:12,504
I know. Uh, we have no idea.

1195
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:15,407
He and your other friend,

1196
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,276
they both disappears
the same day.

1197
01:35:19,879 --> 01:35:21,480
- You see how it looks?
- Yes, obviously.

1198
01:35:21,613 --> 01:35:23,615
But I swear to you
we're in the dark on this.

1199
01:35:23,749 --> 01:35:25,752
We're just as confused
as you are.

1200
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:29,622
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1201
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:32,424
- What girl?
- Inge.

1202
01:35:32,557 --> 01:35:34,192
Yeah, but Mark
wouldn't have done this.

1203
01:35:34,326 --> 01:35:36,062
Josh on the other hand,

1204
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:37,330
he came to bed with us

1205
01:35:37,463 --> 01:35:38,999
and when we woke up,
he was gone.

1206
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:41,333
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1207
01:35:41,466 --> 01:35:43,603
we don't associate
as friends of his

1208
01:35:43,736 --> 01:35:45,672
or collaborators or anything.

1209
01:35:45,805 --> 01:35:47,440
We would just be
so embarrassed

1210
01:35:47,573 --> 01:35:50,242
to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

1211
01:35:51,978 --> 01:35:54,614
Let's hope it gets returned.

1212
01:35:55,248 --> 01:35:56,249
I hope so too.

1213
01:35:56,382 --> 01:35:58,284
I feel responsible.

1214
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,254
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1215
01:36:01,387 --> 01:36:03,757
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1216
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:08,861
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1217
01:36:08,995 --> 01:36:10,329
Oh, hi.

1218
01:36:10,463 --> 01:36:13,467
And, uh, Siv wants to see you
in her house.

1219
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,943
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1220
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:24,678
Okay.

1221
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:27,414
Okay.

1222
01:37:08,523 --> 01:37:09,791
This is the big one.

1223
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:12,627
Okay. Thank you.

1224
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,966
Look into her eyes.

1225
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,567
Mmm-hmm.

1226
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:23,271
Um, can I ask
what this is exactly?

1227
01:37:23,405 --> 01:37:26,674
It's, um...
Tea for the competition.

1228
01:37:32,715 --> 01:37:36,384
- And then you, glass here.
- Mmm-hmm.

1229
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,121
And then we drink it.

1230
01:37:39,555 --> 01:37:40,956
- Okay?
- Okay.

1231
01:37:42,092 --> 01:37:43,292
Okay.

1232
01:37:47,596 --> 01:37:48,664
Mmm-hmm?

1233
01:37:50,133 --> 01:37:51,333
Uh-oh!

1234
01:37:51,467 --> 01:37:53,537
- Oh, God.
- Here we go!

1235
01:39:56,095 --> 01:39:57,530
Please. Come in.

1236
01:40:50,784 --> 01:40:51,984
First thing
I just have to say,

1237
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,521
I have no idea where Josh is.

1238
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,724
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1239
01:40:56,857 --> 01:40:58,859
How do you feel about Maja?

1240
01:41:03,531 --> 01:41:05,033
About Maja?

1241
01:41:10,205 --> 01:41:12,974
How do I
feel about her how?

1242
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:16,044
You have been approved
to mate with her.

1243
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:19,981
You're an ideal
astrological match.

1244
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:22,851
And she has
fixed her hopes on you.

1245
01:41:29,225 --> 01:41:32,361
I think I ate
one of her pubic hairs.

1246
01:41:32,495 --> 01:41:34,263
Sounds probably right.

1247
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,541
Stop!

1248
01:42:23,946 --> 01:42:25,916
Stay here.

1249
01:42:26,049 --> 01:42:27,760
Are you ready?

1250
01:42:27,784 --> 01:42:29,619
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1251
01:43:40,058 --> 01:43:42,127
Stop!

1252
01:43:46,131 --> 01:43:47,543
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1253
01:43:47,567 --> 01:43:48,577
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1254
01:43:48,601 --> 01:43:49,700
Eight! Eight!

1255
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:51,035
- There are eight left.
- What?

1256
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,963
Uh...

1257
01:44:17,096 --> 01:44:19,165
- For you.
- Uh...

1258
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,235
Thanks.

1259
01:44:22,936 --> 01:44:24,704
- What is it?
- Um...

1260
01:44:24,837 --> 01:44:26,574
It's... Sorry.

1261
01:44:27,974 --> 01:44:32,946
Spring water
with special properties.

1262
01:44:33,447 --> 01:44:34,615
Oh.

1263
01:44:34,747 --> 01:44:37,551
Okay.

1264
01:44:37,685 --> 01:44:40,119
- Okay.
- What does it do?

1265
01:44:40,254 --> 01:44:41,422
Oh, um...

1266
01:44:41,854 --> 01:44:43,090
It, uh...

1267
01:44:43,224 --> 01:44:45,759
It breaks down your defenses

1268
01:44:45,893 --> 01:44:49,829
and opens you
for the influence.

1269
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:51,966
Okay.

1270
01:44:53,535 --> 01:44:55,035
Thanks.

1271
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:57,071
You're welcome.

1272
01:44:58,005 --> 01:45:00,007
You know what? Um...

1273
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,509
I'm worried
I'll have a bad trip.

1274
01:45:01,643 --> 01:45:04,946
Oh, no, no. You won't.
You won't. Trust me.

1275
01:46:48,619 --> 01:46:51,887
- I don't speak Swedish.
- What?

1276
01:47:19,917 --> 01:47:21,986
What? What?

1277
01:47:30,829 --> 01:47:32,363
What's happening?

1278
01:47:34,332 --> 01:47:37,669
You are our May Queen.

1279
01:47:38,404 --> 01:47:39,937
- Me?
- Yes!

1280
01:47:40,071 --> 01:47:41,607
- Why?
- You won!

1281
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:44,443
What does that mean?

1282
01:47:44,576 --> 01:47:45,911
What? Oh.

1283
01:48:35,863 --> 01:48:38,164
Mom? Mom?

1284
01:48:39,466 --> 01:48:42,703
Oh, my God, Dani! May Queen!

1285
01:51:20,932 --> 01:51:21,933
Herring?

1286
01:51:22,366 --> 01:51:23,635
What for?

1287
01:51:24,669 --> 01:51:27,006
It's tradition. For good luck.

1288
01:51:27,138 --> 01:51:28,573
Yeah.

1289
01:51:28,707 --> 01:51:31,476
- What?
- And you must eat it whole.

1290
01:51:31,609 --> 01:51:34,145
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no!

1291
01:51:34,278 --> 01:51:36,081
You must try!

1292
01:51:36,214 --> 01:51:38,216
- You must try!
- Ahhh!

1293
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:50,595
Very good try.

1294
01:51:53,799 --> 01:51:55,166
Excuse me...

1295
01:51:56,468 --> 01:51:58,004
What's going on?

1296
01:52:06,578 --> 01:52:08,480
Why did you do that?

1297
01:52:15,387 --> 01:52:17,589
To our May Queen!

1298
01:52:20,793 --> 01:52:22,662
<i>Skal!</i>

1299
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,409
You are the family now! Yes?

1300
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:38,878
Yes, you are the family.

1301
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:40,613
Like sisters.

1302
01:53:53,387 --> 01:53:56,491
Your dance was amazing.

1303
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:59,294
I've never seen someone
dance like that.

1304
01:54:12,507 --> 01:54:14,944
Now, it's traditional
for the May Queen

1305
01:54:15,077 --> 01:54:17,980
to bless our crops
and livestock.

1306
01:54:19,415 --> 01:54:21,617
And after the luck
you just inherited

1307
01:54:21,751 --> 01:54:23,286
from that salt herring,

1308
01:54:23,418 --> 01:54:25,988
we should all be
doubly encouraged.

1309
01:54:39,535 --> 01:54:41,336
Can Christian
come with me?

1310
01:54:42,104 --> 01:54:43,206
Nay.

1311
01:54:43,339 --> 01:54:44,907
The Queen must ride alone.

1312
01:57:20,267 --> 01:57:21,802
Repeat after me.

1313
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:09,618
Breathe in.

1314
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:14,189
For your vitality.

1315
02:02:38,394 --> 02:02:40,430
We shall go now
to Siv's house.

1316
02:02:40,962 --> 02:02:42,230
What's this?

1317
02:02:42,364 --> 02:02:45,133
It is a special meeting,
only for the Queens.

1318
02:02:45,268 --> 02:02:46,736
And she will bless you.

1319
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:51,708
What's that?

1320
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,376
That's not for us.

1321
02:02:58,981 --> 02:03:00,350
I think you should not.

1322
02:04:49,662 --> 02:04:51,497
No, no, no.

1323
02:09:42,996 --> 02:09:44,364
Christian?

1324
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:46,967
Christian.

1325
02:09:50,037 --> 02:09:51,304
Hi.

1326
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,942
Hello, there you are.

1327
02:09:55,275 --> 02:09:56,643
Listen.

1328
02:09:56,778 --> 02:10:00,249
You can't speak.
You can't move.

1329
02:10:01,082 --> 02:10:02,449
All right?

1330
02:10:03,151 --> 02:10:04,451
Good.

1331
02:10:14,695 --> 02:10:19,735
On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

1332
02:10:19,868 --> 02:10:23,238
we gather
to give special thanks

1333
02:10:23,371 --> 02:10:25,373
to our treasured sun.

1334
02:10:25,506 --> 02:10:27,843
As an offering to our father,

1335
02:10:27,976 --> 02:10:32,647
we will today surrender
nine human lives.

1336
02:10:33,681 --> 02:10:37,986
As Harga takes,
so Harga also gives.

1337
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:42,791
Thus, for every
new blood sacrificed,

1338
02:10:42,925 --> 02:10:46,662
we will dedicate
one of our own.

1339
02:10:47,563 --> 02:10:50,833
That is four new bloods.

1340
02:10:51,432 --> 02:10:52,935
Four from Harga.

1341
02:10:53,902 --> 02:10:57,307
And one to be chosen
by the Queen.

1342
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:00,576
Nine in all to die

1343
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:05,148
and be reborn
in the great cycle.

1344
02:11:05,281 --> 02:11:09,219
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1345
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:14,557
As for our end, we have two
already dedicated

1346
02:11:17,493 --> 02:11:20,629
and two who have volunteered.

1347
02:11:21,496 --> 02:11:23,867
Ingemar and Ulf.

1348
02:11:27,037 --> 02:11:29,873
You have brought
outside offerings.

1349
02:11:30,773 --> 02:11:34,677
Plus volunteering
your own bodies.

1350
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:39,249
You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

1351
02:11:40,251 --> 02:11:44,554
And to Pelle,
who has brought new blood

1352
02:11:44,688 --> 02:11:46,824
and our new May Queen,

1353
02:11:46,957 --> 02:11:52,162
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1354
02:11:52,296 --> 02:11:56,901
And so,
for our ninth offering,

1355
02:11:57,035 --> 02:12:00,436
it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

1356
02:12:00,571 --> 02:12:02,773
between a preselected
new blood

1357
02:12:02,907 --> 02:12:06,577
and a specially-ordained
Hargan.

1358
02:12:32,504 --> 02:12:34,039
Turbeyon.

1359
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:38,576
Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

1360
02:12:43,115 --> 02:12:44,183
And...

1361
02:13:02,768 --> 02:13:04,970
Christian Hughes.

1362
02:13:07,773 --> 02:13:09,474
These are the candidates

1363
02:13:09,608 --> 02:13:12,011
for the ninth
and final offering.

1364
02:13:13,579 --> 02:13:16,682
We patiently await
your verdict.
