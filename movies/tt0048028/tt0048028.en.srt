00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,947
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

3
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,231
Thank you.

4
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,783
Good morning.

5
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,242
Deposit.

6
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,878
Another nice deposit.

7
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,043
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

8
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,713
I'm in a hurry, please.

9
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:54,593
Hi, Kate.

10
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,766
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

11
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,265
I haven't had time yet.

12
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,514
You should always do that one first.

13
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,612
Anne!

14
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:56,113
Come here.

15
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:03,000
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

16
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:05,588
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

17
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:06,874
Send Joe in.

18
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,049
Joe.

19
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,476
Hello, Pretty Boy.

20
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:25,019
- Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

21
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:28,943
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

22
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,840
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

23
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,387
- You want me?
- What's the idea of throwing that stone?

24
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,648
Any law against throwing stones?

25
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,442
You're tough? Come here!

26
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,863
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

27
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:18,746
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

28
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,169
What for? What do you want?

29
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,169
Just wanna talk to her.

30
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:30,586
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

31
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,090
You live around here?

32
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:38,094
- In Monterey?
- Salinas.

33
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:39,513
What's your name?

34
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:43,396
You're not talking? Now, look...

35
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,604
why are you following Kate around?

36
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:47,473
What's the idea, squirt?

37
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,523
Any law against following
around the town...

38
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,531
madam, whatever you call her?

39
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:56,867
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

40
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,160
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

41
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:02,616
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

42
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,034
Now come on. Now beat it.

43
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:06,872
Is that her real name?

44
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:12,836
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

45
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,928
What's her last name?

46
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,807
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

47
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:26,099
You tell her I hate her.

48
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,628
I should have gone right on in there.

49
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,001
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

50
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:22,156
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

51
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,868
- You know what the girls in class call him?
- No, what?

52
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,582
The Prowler.

53
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,661
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

54
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,129
- Promise me you won't.
- Why not?

55
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:32,502
Please don't. I don't want you...

56
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:35,550
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

57
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,177
Hello, Cal.

58
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,346
Excuse me for talking.

59
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:42,218
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

60
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,933
- Do you want to come?
- What icehouse?

61
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,307
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

62
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:49,148
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

63
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,477
Is Dad gonna be there?

64
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,606
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

65
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,065
I'll skip it.

66
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:59,065
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

67
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,994
- Come on.
- Hey, Aron.

68
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,027
Yeah?

69
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,156
- Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- Would you tell me?

70
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:10,622
- No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

71
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,832
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

72
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,084
He was worried.

73
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,340
Yeah, I bet.

74
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:24,175
You gonna come or not?

75
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,308
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

76
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:30,810
He's coming.

77
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,602
He's coming.

78
00:09:40,617 --> 00:09:43,155
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

79
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,914
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

80
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,496
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

81
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:50,533
Mastodon?

82
00:09:55,673 --> 00:09:58,081
What have you got to say for yourself?

83
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,339
This is my son, Cal.

84
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:07,391
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

85
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,098
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

86
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:13,853
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

87
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,817
Well, times change.

88
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,444
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

89
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,690
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

90
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:25,951
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

91
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:29,453
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

92
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,284
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

93
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:34,460
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

94
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:38,294
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

95
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:41,752
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

96
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:46,637
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

97
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,472
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

98
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,846
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

99
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,889
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

100
00:10:56,985 --> 00:11:00,567
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

101
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:04,320
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

102
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,734
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

103
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:08,108
- Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
- Hello.

104
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:09,367
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Dad.

105
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:13,619
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

106
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,786
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

107
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,120
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

108
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:20,207
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

109
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,379
Quite right, Son.

110
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:25,714
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
- 'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

111
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:30,717
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

112
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,554
- Where?
- New York City.

113
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,519
And they can't raise them there.

114
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,393
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

115
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,690
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

116
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,986
- Yeah.
- It's about time. Well?

117
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:48,700
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

118
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:51,740
that if we get into this war...

119
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,536
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

120
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:59,253
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

121
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,218
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

122
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,879
Beans are up to 3 cents.

123
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,926
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

124
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,006
And they keep, too, don't they?

125
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,384
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

126
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,900
Look here, Will.

127
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,938
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

128
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,187
but I know I have an idea here.

129
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:28,946
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

130
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:31,111
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

131
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:32,947
and the only one that ever made a dime.

132
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,197
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

133
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,292
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

134
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:46,168
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

135
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,834
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

136
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,804
I don't understand him. I never have.

137
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,642
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

138
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:58,928
Help me up.

139
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,393
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

140
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,113
No, Cal.

141
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,865
It's dark in here and spooky.

142
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,779
Why is he so alone all the time?

143
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,037
- He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

144
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:19,208
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

145
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:21,535
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

146
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,630
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

147
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,123
- I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

148
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:30,670
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

149
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:33,429
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

150
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,890
Sort of like an animal.

151
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,768
I don't know, he scares me.

152
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:41,189
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

153
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:45,144
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

154
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,695
I wish it was right now.

155
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:51,442
- So do I.
- Do you?

156
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:02,243
Abra.

157
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,795
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

158
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,453
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

159
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:09,379
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

160
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:37,616
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

161
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:40,539
- I hope so.
- You are.

162
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,001
A perfect one.

163
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:47,541
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

164
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,664
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

165
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:54,137
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

166
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,887
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

167
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:01,721
- Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

168
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,889
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is, too.

169
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,769
Let's move over here. Aron.

170
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,697
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

171
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,079
I love you, Aron.

172
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:31,918
Really, I do. Really.

173
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,509
Sure. I love you, too.

174
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:57,278
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

175
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,242
What are you doing? Stop it!

176
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:05,117
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven..."

177
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,787
"whose sin is covered."

178
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:11,627
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity..."

179
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:15,673
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

180
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,636
And you are forgiven, Cal.

181
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:24,600
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

182
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,971
only something I do not know.

183
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,569
Why did you push that ice down?

184
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:36,609
I don't know.

185
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:38,982
Was it...

186
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,989
Was it vengeance? Anger?

187
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:47,532
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

188
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:49,415
What was it?

189
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:54,127
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

190
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,093
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

191
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,505
No, it's for Cal to read.

192
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,757
Start at the fifth verse.

193
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:06,514
Verse 5.

194
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,664
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid."

195
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,502
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord..."

196
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,124
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

197
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:34,210
Go on.

198
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:40,925
Six.

199
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,220
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

200
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:45,845
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

201
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:50,225
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee."

202
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,390
"And surely in the floods of great waters..."

203
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:55,733
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

204
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,816
Seven.

205
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,398
Not the numbers, Cal.

206
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:02,529
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble..."

207
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:06,486
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

208
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:11,244
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

209
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,877
Through and through, bad.

210
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:15,797
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

211
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:28,301
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

212
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,348
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

213
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,597
Well, it's true.

214
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:36,477
Aron's the good one.

215
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,651
I guess there's just a certain amount...

216
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,730
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

217
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:43,231
- and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

218
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,784
Cal, listen to me.

219
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,486
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

220
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,905
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

221
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,572
That's where he's different from an animal.

222
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:57,626
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

223
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,633
My mother...

224
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,302
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

225
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,393
is she?

226
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:17,936
Why do you ask that?

227
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,313
She's not dead at all.

228
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:24,276
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

229
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,112
She's alive.

230
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:28,527
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

231
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:30,163
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

232
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,454
He was just passing through.

233
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:36,503
How come you told Aron and me she died?

234
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:39,161
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

235
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,676
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

236
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,802
I have no idea. She went East.

237
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,395
How do you know?

238
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:58,185
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

239
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,687
I heard she went East.

240
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,813
What was she like? Was she bad?

241
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,738
I guess she...

242
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,243
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

243
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,697
There was something she seemed to lack.

244
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:17,576
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

245
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:21,790
I never knew what she was after.

246
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:25,046
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that, either.

247
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:28,968
She was so full of hate.

248
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:31,726
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

249
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,559
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

250
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:40,312
No.

251
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,476
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

252
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,654
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

253
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:52,488
I've told you, Cal.

254
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:56,538
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

255
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:00,708
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

256
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,417
She had the most lovely hands.

257
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:06,920
Like ivory.

258
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,218
She took such good care of them.

259
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,974
Her mother had arthritis.

260
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,309
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

261
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,270
Talk to me, Father.

262
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:31,945
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

263
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:33,364
I got to know...

264
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:36,200
Where is she?

265
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,622
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

266
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,750
after she left, I never heard from her.

267
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,792
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

268
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,219
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

269
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:53,473
You coming home tonight, Cal?

270
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:56,677
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

271
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,342
Good evening, Cal.

272
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:02,854
High strung. Very high strung.

273
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:06,151
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

274
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:08,520
- He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.
- Good.

275
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,903
What do you suppose he meant by that?

276
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:26,879
Go on, beat it!

277
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,919
Your wife has called up three times.

278
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:34,961
- My wife's a...
- I know she is. Now beat it.

279
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:46,268
Joe!

280
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,819
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

281
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:55,783
Mr. Hawks.

282
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,247
- What do you want?
- I want...

283
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:05,869
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

284
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,808
Hey!

285
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,265
- Where's my drink?
- All right.

286
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,854
That's not very neat, is...

287
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,770
It's okay.

288
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,277
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

289
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:33,570
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

290
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:36,148
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

291
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:39,244
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

292
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,369
You can tell him if you want to.

293
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,079
You're just a kid, ain't you?

294
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:48,827
- I'm older than you are.
- Yeah, sure, but that isn't...

295
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,500
- Hey!
- All right.

296
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,255
Kid, please...

297
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,882
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

298
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,545
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

299
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,930
There's Joe.

300
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,270
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

301
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:10,393
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

302
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:14,358
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

303
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,909
- Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

304
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,120
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

305
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:29,955
I gotta go now, kid.

306
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:31,422
Is she nice?

307
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:33,299
Don't let Joe see you, please.

308
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,709
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

309
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:38,720
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

310
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,427
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

311
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:44,142
What's the matter, kid?

312
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,642
- She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
- Hands?

313
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:48,846
Did you look at them?

314
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:52,191
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

315
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,855
Where is she?

316
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,824
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,864
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

318
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:04,663
Back that way.

319
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,077
Will you show me?

320
00:25:09,753 --> 00:25:12,540
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

321
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:15,253
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

322
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:18,260
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

323
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:19,508
No, honest.

324
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:22,550
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

325
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:25,097
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

326
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:28,436
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

327
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:31,764
Come on, will you?

328
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,184
You can just show me where the door is.

329
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:35,851
Come on.

330
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,197
Be a sport.

331
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,828
Come on.

332
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,920
There's the door.

333
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:02,338
Thank you. You can go back now.

334
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,931
What are you gonna do?

335
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:08,055
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

336
00:26:09,605 --> 00:26:14,231
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

337
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:10,324
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

338
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,493
I gotta talk to you.

339
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:21,588
Joe!

340
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:25,968
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

341
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,305
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

342
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:35,478
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

343
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,357
I want to talk to her!

344
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:51,571
I want to talk to you!

345
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,658
Please, talk to me!

346
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:59,335
Talk to me, please! Mother!

347
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,335
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

348
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:06,670
No, I guess there isn't.

349
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:08,671
Here.

350
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:11,850
Put this on your cheek. Here.

351
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:18,893
Drink some coffee.

352
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,603
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

353
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:25,614
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

354
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:28,320
The one they call "Rabbit."

355
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:32,154
I thought so. He never was any good.

356
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:35,284
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

357
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:40,373
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

358
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,301
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

359
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:48,712
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

360
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,847
Get that through your head.

361
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:53,761
Shut up!

362
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:03,192
Does Adam know that you...

363
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,354
roam around over here at night?

364
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,785
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

365
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:15,196
way back in his ranch days.

366
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,492
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

367
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:23,088
that you might find out something
about Kate.

368
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:27,009
But then she was over here on the Bay...

369
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:30,427
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

370
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:34,512
- So I figured it'd be all right.
- You think he'll ever find out about her?

371
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:37,224
He'd never come over here.

372
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,316
Here. You might as well look at this now.

373
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:48,235
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

374
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:51,737
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

375
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:58,535
I knew it.

376
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,459
I knew it was true.

377
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:07,461
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

378
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,546
How did you know it was true?

379
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:15,889
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

380
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:18,645
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

381
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:27,816
I hate her.

382
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:30,403
And I hate him, too.

383
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,823
Come on, I'll take you home.

384
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,034
- You don't have to drive me home!
- I know I don't have to take you home!

385
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,407
Here.

386
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:45,004
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

387
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:46,751
Come on now.

388
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:02,180
How did Dad meet her?

389
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,231
Where did she come from?

390
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:08,689
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

391
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,863
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

392
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:15,487
Of all the people.

393
00:31:19,373 --> 00:31:21,033
How come he married her?

394
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:24,246
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

395
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:26,625
Young and full of spirit.

396
00:31:26,713 --> 00:31:29,418
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

397
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:31,500
He's not a worldly man.

398
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:44,935
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

399
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,109
How come?

400
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:50,940
I don't know.

401
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:55,571
Did he do something to her?

402
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,153
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

403
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:00,410
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

404
00:32:00,914 --> 00:32:05,243
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

405
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:11,377
He must have done something to hurt her.

406
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,839
No. No, sir.

407
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:17,261
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

408
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,973
You see, your father has more kindness...

409
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:27,731
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

410
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:42,236
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

411
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:10,314
It's going to work.

412
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,484
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

413
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,533
It's going to work.

414
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:45,098
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

415
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,607
All right, bring her on. Come on.

416
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:00,984
Now do you think it'll work?

417
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,676
- Good morning, Mr. Trask.
- Good morning.

418
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:29,885
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

419
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,471
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

420
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:33,645
It's this war in Europe.

421
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:37,316
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

422
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,313
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

423
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:40,983
- Is that where you're loading?
- Yes.

424
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,983
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

425
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,736
It's this war in Europe.

426
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,717
Do you know where Aron is?

427
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,093
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

428
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,295
Can I do something for you?

429
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,593
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

430
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,393
What have you got there?

431
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:14,812
I figured it would save some time. So I...

432
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,600
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

433
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,320
Yep.

434
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,861
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

435
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,609
and are working so well, Cal.

436
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,444
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

437
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,911
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

438
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:38,460
Hi, Cal.

439
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,422
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

440
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:47,384
- Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

441
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:01,562
Lydia, vamoose.

442
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:16,866
He'll be here in a minute.

443
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:20,662
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

444
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,335
No, thanks.

445
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:26,634
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

446
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:27,753
Who?

447
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:33,806
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

448
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:39,897
Girls follow you around, don't they?

449
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,985
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

450
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:45,020
Who is she?

451
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:49,859
I never saw her before in my life.

452
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:52,776
I'll bet.

453
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,828
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

454
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:01,129
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

455
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,966
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

456
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,710
Just about all he's got.

457
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,425
I like your father.

458
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:10,677
Do you?

459
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:18,141
I threw away about $3,000 once.

460
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:19,769
Yeah?

461
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,435
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

462
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:25,319
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

463
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,978
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

464
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:31,490
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

465
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,573
I reckon it would.

466
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:38,370
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

467
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,002
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

468
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:46,498
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

469
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:48,217
- That's right.
- And you forgave him?

470
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,927
That's right.

471
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:52,136
Is there an egg in this basket?

472
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:57,385
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

473
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:01,227
Girls love their fathers terribly.

474
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,097
Do they?

475
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:06,110
My mother died when I was 13...

476
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:09,399
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

477
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,448
No, I didn't know that.

478
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,783
Are you interested in hearing about me?

479
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:15,950
Yeah.

480
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:23,202
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

481
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:25,963
I just hated everybody.

482
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:28,875
I used to sit and just glare at people...

483
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,756
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

484
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,926
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

485
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,012
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

486
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:43,431
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

487
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,643
And it was awful.

488
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:52,823
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

489
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,995
- so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

490
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,289
I thought you'd like that.

491
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:03,578
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

492
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:07,249
They tried.

493
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:09,877
What'd they do to you?

494
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,803
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

495
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,509
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

496
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:19,098
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

497
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,764
But he didn't.

498
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:23,727
Isn't it funny?

499
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:26,606
I'm grown up now...

500
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:29,266
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

501
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:30,525
You're not so grown-up.

502
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,855
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

503
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:34,443
I'm very grown-up.

504
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:38,033
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

505
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:43,239
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

506
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,538
I felt better.

507
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,796
Now we get along fine.

508
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:59,886
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

509
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:02,977
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

510
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:10,232
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

511
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,237
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

512
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:30,211
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

513
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:33,499
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

514
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:36,298
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

515
00:40:39,265 --> 00:40:41,637
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

516
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:47,811
My, your hair's in a mess.

517
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:53,353
Dad, what's that?

518
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:56,780
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

519
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:59,025
Aron! I brought your lunch.

520
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:02,116
Looks like a coal chute.

521
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:04,246
Coal chute?

522
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,370
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

523
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:10,458
Cal!

524
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:16,958
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

525
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:20,387
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

526
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:31,272
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

527
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,980
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

528
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,359
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

529
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:41,984
- Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

530
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:45,245
- What'd you say?
- I said, it's a good idea if it works.

531
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:47,787
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

532
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,998
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

533
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,081
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

534
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:56,499
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

535
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:02,509
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

536
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,885
Good luck, Adam.

537
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,430
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

538
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:47,053
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

539
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:49,219
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

540
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:51,554
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

541
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:54,565
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

542
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,355
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

543
00:42:57,445 --> 00:42:59,521
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

544
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:01,357
and about time he learned to drive it.

545
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,987
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

546
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:06,069
Now pay strict attention, boys.

547
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:08,200
Don't touch that!

548
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,914
Wait till it's explained to you.

549
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:13,036
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

550
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:16,879
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

551
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:20,583
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

552
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:24,508
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

553
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:27,302
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

554
00:43:27,392 --> 00:43:30,428
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

555
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:33,472
This here's the ignition key.

556
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:37,234
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

557
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,485
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

558
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:42,611
- See where it says "bat"?
- Yes.

559
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:46,150
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

560
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,113
Thank you. Thank you very much.

561
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:49,746
First you gotta retard the spark.

562
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:53,531
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

563
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,204
Now remember that.

564
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:56,914
This here is the spark.

565
00:43:57,004 --> 00:44:00,255
You push her way up. Listen.

566
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:04,754
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

567
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:08,846
- You had lessons before.
- No, I just saw you do it.

568
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:12,561
- You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

569
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:15,136
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

570
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:17,565
Now, this here is the crank.

571
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,853
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

572
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:23,780
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

573
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:25,323
Push in till she catches.

574
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:26,902
See how my thumb is turned down?

575
00:44:26,993 --> 00:44:28,535
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

576
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:31,454
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

577
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,532
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

578
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:37,622
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

579
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:39,788
- That's kind of wrong way around.
- How's that?

580
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:43,131
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

581
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:46,719
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

582
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,386
Then you give her a hard spin.

583
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:53,016
- She caught, first time!
- Caught on what?

584
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:55,680
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

585
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:58,441
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

586
00:44:58,524 --> 00:45:00,398
So, there you are.

587
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:03,022
Isn't that wonderful?

588
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:05,650
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

589
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,771
That's the easy part.

590
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,740
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

591
00:45:08,826 --> 00:45:11,400
Spark up, gas down.

592
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:12,871
Switch to bat.

593
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:15,707
Crank to compression, thumb down.

594
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,749
You get that? Let's have it again.

595
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,911
Spark up, gas down.

596
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,210
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

597
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:25,252
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

598
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:28,047
Can see water running out of the cars.

599
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:44,020
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

600
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:46,021
Someday, somebody'll prove it.

601
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:50,237
- It was your idea.
- No!

602
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:53,161
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

603
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:58,083
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

604
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:03,335
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

605
00:46:04,757 --> 00:46:07,046
You don't understand him.

606
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:10,419
- You can't go in there.
- I gotta see Will Hamilton.

607
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:12,920
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

608
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,091
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

609
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:18,185
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

610
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:19,813
Right, left.

611
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,947
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

612
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:50,592
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

613
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,338
We better have a look.

614
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:58,014
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

615
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,431
- Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
- Hello, Cal.

616
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:03,396
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

617
00:47:03,482 --> 00:47:04,977
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

618
00:47:05,067 --> 00:47:06,099
Yeah. I had to see you.

619
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:08,151
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

620
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:10,562
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

621
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:13,569
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

622
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,945
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

623
00:47:17,038 --> 00:47:20,572
- You see, I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

624
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:25,204
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

625
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:26,576
you ought to raise beans?

626
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:28,914
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

627
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,250
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

628
00:47:31,344 --> 00:47:33,502
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

629
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:35,470
I don't see any way out.

630
00:47:35,556 --> 00:47:39,055
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

631
00:47:39,143 --> 00:47:42,642
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

632
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:46,688
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

633
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:49,938
I see.

634
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,272
You think you can make
all that money back?

635
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:54,741
I gotta.

636
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,735
You know, you're crazy.

637
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,533
Look, Cal, don't you know...

638
00:47:59,622 --> 00:48:02,409
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

639
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,826
- I'll get some money.
- How?

640
00:48:05,628 --> 00:48:06,790
I'll get it.

641
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,879
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

642
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:13,837
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

643
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:16,086
If you had $5,000...

644
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:21,763
$5,000?

645
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,564
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

646
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:31,026
I know you wanna help your father...

647
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:34,231
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

648
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:37,941
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

649
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:40,491
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

650
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,367
- I'll get $5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...

651
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:46,127
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

652
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,241
I'll get the $5,000.

653
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:49,329
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

654
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:52,670
Yeah.

655
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,131
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

656
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,972
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

657
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:01,974
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

658
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,395
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

659
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,935
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

660
00:49:08,023 --> 00:49:09,482
So will a lot of other farmers.

661
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:12,437
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

662
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,904
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

663
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:21,323
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

664
00:49:21,454 --> 00:49:23,327
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

665
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:25,656
We're apt to be in war any minute.

666
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,450
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

667
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:31,870
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

668
00:49:31,964 --> 00:49:34,372
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

669
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,625
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

670
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,506
That's what I want. That's it. See?

671
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:42,803
- How much will I make?
- Enough for what you want.

672
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:34,062
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

673
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:36,645
It's in the Bible.

674
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:41,938
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

675
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:44,820
That's in the Bible, too.

676
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,411
What's he like?

677
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:54,495
He looks like you.

678
00:50:56,715 --> 00:50:58,340
Is he like me?

679
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,501
No. He's good.

680
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,051
I'm more like you.

681
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:11,271
How's Adam?

682
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:13,558
How's your father?

683
00:51:15,192 --> 00:51:17,066
I don't wanna talk about him.

684
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,110
- You don't?
- No.

685
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:39,167
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

686
00:51:39,758 --> 00:51:41,585
I knew you didn't.

687
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:47,595
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

688
00:51:47,683 --> 00:51:50,221
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

689
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,601
What do you want?

690
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,901
Just to look at me?

691
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:08,361
I want $5,000.

692
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:24,380
All right, come on in. Sit down.

693
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:26,258
Come in.

694
00:52:27,932 --> 00:52:29,260
Try that chair.

695
00:52:32,353 --> 00:52:33,977
You got your father's eyes.

696
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:37,312
That's all I can see of him.

697
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:41,651
- You're a nice looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:52:45,783 --> 00:52:48,487
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

699
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:54,617
Caleb and Aron.

700
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,829
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

701
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,295
Them's just names.

702
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:02,460
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

703
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:04,459
Are you good in your studies?

704
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:08,260
I get by with them.

705
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:10,340
Does Aron get by with them?

706
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:11,595
He's bright.

707
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:16,392
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

708
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:18,310
Maybe.

709
00:53:18,774 --> 00:53:21,728
Or back to some ranch?

710
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:24,654
No, I don't like the ranch.

711
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:27,322
You take after me.

712
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,533
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

713
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:34,527
Sit down.

714
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,415
Thanks.

715
00:53:47,845 --> 00:53:50,133
What do you want with $5,000?

716
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:52,633
I want to go into business.

717
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:56,058
- You're a little young for that, aren't you?
- I'm old enough.

718
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:59,100
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

719
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:02,395
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

720
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:08,281
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

721
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:10,987
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

722
00:54:11,076 --> 00:54:13,863
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

723
00:54:13,954 --> 00:54:16,077
- Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

724
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,490
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

725
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:19,959
You see...

726
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,420
my father, he lost about all he had in...

727
00:54:25,507 --> 00:54:28,508
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

728
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:33,263
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

729
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:37,385
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

730
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:38,426
Yeah.

731
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:42,227
Only...

732
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:47,108
Only he's too good to bother with money.

733
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:51,445
Okay.

734
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:59,122
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

735
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:05,955
I don't know who else to ask.

736
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:10,216
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

737
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:13,173
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

738
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:21,224
It's a good business venture.

739
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:27,026
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

740
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:29,780
You're a business woman, ain't you?

741
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:31,357
One of the best, Son.

742
00:55:32,658 --> 00:55:37,485
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

743
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:44,871
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

744
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:51,089
This $5,000, now.

745
00:55:51,176 --> 00:55:54,011
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

746
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:55,839
I never thought about that.

747
00:55:56,682 --> 00:55:59,173
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

748
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:02,642
- I guess, maybe.
- It's not.

749
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:10,441
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

750
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:13,443
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

751
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:15,941
Father thinks you're in the East...

752
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,159
and Aron thinks you're dead.

753
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:24,197
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

754
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,459
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

755
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,614
What are you staring at?

756
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:39,071
How come you did it?

757
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,075
Did what?

758
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,077
Shot my father?

759
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:47,415
Did he tell you that?

760
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:53,174
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

761
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:56,593
- Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
- None of your business.

762
00:56:57,972 --> 00:57:00,344
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

763
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:03,930
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

764
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,262
I just wanted him to let me go.

765
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:10,439
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

766
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,440
He wanted to tie me down.

767
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:16,151
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

768
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,482
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

769
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:20,782
Nobody holds me.

770
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,328
- But he loved you.
- Love.

771
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,998
He wanted to own me.

772
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:30,248
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

773
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:34,038
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

774
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:38,885
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

775
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,803
Reading the Bible at me.

776
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,967
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

777
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:48,643
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

778
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,642
Always so right himself?

779
00:57:52,276 --> 00:57:53,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

780
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:58,321
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

781
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:03,571
Yeah, you got sense.

782
00:58:04,122 --> 00:58:07,372
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

783
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:11,207
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

784
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:14,380
I got the toughest house on the coast...

785
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:16,790
and the finest clientele.

786
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,508
Half the stinking city hall go there.

787
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,759
They sneak in at night...

788
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:27,768
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

789
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:30,603
And I built it up from nothing.

790
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:34,064
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

791
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:36,987
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

792
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:38,690
You know, that's funny.

793
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:42,450
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

794
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:44,907
No, but it's funny just the same.

795
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,199
Your father.

796
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,329
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

797
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:54,871
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

798
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:58,833
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

799
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:01,168
to save him his purity.

800
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:05,464
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

801
00:59:15,276 --> 00:59:16,272
Okay.

802
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:22,695
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

803
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,071
He's a good businessman.

804
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:34,123
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

805
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:35,874
I don't know.

806
00:59:37,423 --> 00:59:39,546
I do. Maybe he likes you.

807
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,756
Maybe.

808
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,720
You're a likeable kid.

809
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,941
You give this to him.

810
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,363
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

811
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:03,823
it's okay with me.

812
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:25,005
You're a likeable kid.

813
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,679
Go on, get out of here.

814
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:40,098
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

815
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:24,735
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

816
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:53,422
Hi, partner.

817
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,060
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

818
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:03,188
Kaiser.

819
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:06,563
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

820
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:16,778
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

821
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:33,889
Cal, stop it.

822
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,181
There's Cal.

823
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,860
- Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
- Hello, Cal.

824
01:02:46,404 --> 01:02:47,399
Thanks.

825
01:02:56,122 --> 01:03:00,166
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

826
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:02,791
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that.

827
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:03,993
Will you go?

828
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:06,164
I think the war will be over. I don't think...

829
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:09,875
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

830
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:11,593
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

831
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,671
No, I guess you didn't.

832
01:03:16,016 --> 01:03:18,472
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

833
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:28,358
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

834
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:32,105
I just don't believe it's right.

835
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:51,208
- Did you water them good?
- Sure, lots of water.

836
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:53,508
- Not too much, though.
- No, just right.

837
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:14,740
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

838
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,901
I remember the day we sent him off.

839
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,207
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

840
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,829
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

841
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:26,627
They're a military nation.

842
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:29,080
Go back where you came from, German!

843
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:30,797
Go on home, German!

844
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,635
This is just the start.

845
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:42,133
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

846
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:43,971
The German people don't want this war.

847
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:46,814
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

848
01:04:46,899 --> 01:04:48,975
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

849
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:52,401
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

850
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,777
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

851
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:59,032
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know...

852
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,619
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

853
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,952
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

854
01:05:08,963 --> 01:05:10,243
You tired, Dad?

855
01:05:11,882 --> 01:05:15,382
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

856
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:20,131
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

857
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:25,686
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

858
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:28,392
not much left after my great fiasco.

859
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,897
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

860
01:05:33,988 --> 01:05:36,064
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

861
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,569
Let's don't worry about money.

862
01:05:51,088 --> 01:05:52,879
Hey, Rantani!

863
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:55,918
Ain't this some sight?

864
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,468
Beans!

865
01:05:58,304 --> 01:06:00,261
Yeah, boy, some beans.

866
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:03,052
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

867
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:05,218
you gonna make them grow quicker?

868
01:06:14,695 --> 01:06:15,975
He's crazy.

869
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:26,162
Hey, where have you been?

870
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:29,083
Come on.

871
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:31,125
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

872
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,756
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

873
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:49,730
You wanna try one? No?

874
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:53,805
Pick up my cigar.

875
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,273
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

876
01:06:56,362 --> 01:06:57,393
No, I'm not.

877
01:06:57,488 --> 01:06:59,564
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

878
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:02,408
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

879
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:04,450
- Hello, Cal.
- What's the matter?

880
01:07:04,578 --> 01:07:07,912
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

881
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:10,952
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

882
01:07:11,043 --> 01:07:12,917
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- I hope not.

883
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:15,838
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

884
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:18,132
Here I am, lady.

885
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:22,127
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

886
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:24,926
- What're you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

887
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:27,969
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

888
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:31,559
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

889
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:34,730
- What time you gonna meet him?
- At 8:00.

890
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,936
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

891
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:39,059
Yeah, I know.

892
01:07:39,154 --> 01:07:41,313
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

893
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:48,283
8:00?

894
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:51,159
You got a half hour?

895
01:07:56,046 --> 01:07:58,335
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

896
01:07:58,424 --> 01:07:59,503
I'm around.

897
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:02,925
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

898
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:06,345
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

899
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,592
I feel awfully sorry for him.

900
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:17,771
You're terrible.

901
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,730
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

902
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:24,153
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

903
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:27,989
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

904
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:31,198
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

905
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:34,125
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

906
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,879
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

907
01:08:36,962 --> 01:08:38,871
I'll agree with that.

908
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,335
He's right.

909
01:08:42,676 --> 01:08:44,467
He's always right.

910
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:46,634
And he has always been right.

911
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,465
Now let's talk about something else.

912
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:49,636
All right.

913
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:52,383
8:00.

914
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:54,264
We got a lot to see.

915
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:57,557
Will we be back in time for Aron?

916
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,777
All right. I'd love to.

917
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:11,533
Easy.

918
01:09:36,188 --> 01:09:39,687
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

919
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:44,475
- Who was that?
- Who?

920
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:46,694
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

921
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:50,566
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

922
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:54,327
What are girls like that like?

923
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:55,994
All right, never mind.

924
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:59,000
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

925
01:09:59,086 --> 01:10:00,580
since the time of Julius Caesar.

926
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:04,336
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

927
01:10:04,424 --> 01:10:05,504
Look.

928
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:07,003
Would we have time?

929
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,295
...after the Germans had been through...

930
01:10:09,388 --> 01:10:11,843
- the women of the town...
- That German's here again.

931
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:15,016
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

932
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:18,887
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

933
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:22,603
Here we go.

934
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,991
It is lies, all lies.

935
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,618
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

936
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,826
See over there. That's Castroville.

937
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:41,662
Everything looks so small down there.

938
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:43,545
"Higher and higher and higher and higher"

939
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:44,709
What?

940
01:10:44,798 --> 01:10:47,123
"Growing and growing
and growing and growing"

941
01:10:47,217 --> 01:10:51,085
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

942
01:10:55,934 --> 01:10:57,642
Does Aron really love me?

943
01:10:59,771 --> 01:11:01,764
I seem to have sort of lost him.

944
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:05,641
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

945
01:11:05,736 --> 01:11:08,274
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

946
01:11:09,197 --> 01:11:10,775
I can't tell anymore.

947
01:11:13,577 --> 01:11:15,534
Cal, can I ask you something?

948
01:11:16,455 --> 01:11:17,735
Yeah, go ahead.

949
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,997
These girls that you always
go around with.

950
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:25,454
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

951
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,504
What are girls like that like?

952
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:33,545
You don't really love them, do you?

953
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:38,594
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

954
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,770
You're not angry, are you?

955
01:11:44,775 --> 01:11:48,274
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
- Do you think I'm bad?

956
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,031
I don't know.

957
01:11:53,283 --> 01:11:56,699
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

958
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:59,075
I mean, Aron is so good...

959
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:01,242
and I'm not.

960
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,409
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

961
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:05,874
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

962
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:08,871
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

963
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:11,635
and think about it
and that's all right, but...

964
01:12:12,803 --> 01:12:15,922
These girls that you go out with, do you...

965
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:19,803
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

966
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,060
I know love is good the way Aron says...

967
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,522
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

968
01:12:30,696 --> 01:12:32,854
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

969
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,190
but I don't know who else to talk to.

970
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,156
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

971
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:41,660
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

972
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:47,122
- Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

973
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,543
He's got to.

974
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,505
The way I figure it out...

975
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,508
Aron never having had a mother...

976
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:59,717
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

977
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,183
and that's what he thinks I am.

978
01:13:02,269 --> 01:13:05,104
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

979
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,851
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

980
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:13,106
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

981
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,694
Look at that star.

982
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:21,486
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

983
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:23,493
Probably.

984
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:31,880
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

985
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:35,383
She can just wait.

986
01:13:35,886 --> 01:13:37,380
She was pretty.

987
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:44,262
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

988
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:07,489
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

989
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:13,339
I do.

990
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:20,460
To give these fiends a lesson that...

991
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:22,050
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

992
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,255
Lies. All lies.

993
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,224
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

994
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,935
Gus, come on.

995
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:28,973
There's Aron.

996
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:31,975
You're a good shoemaker.

997
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,812
There's Aron, down there.

998
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,897
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

999
01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:39,187
Mr. Albrecht.

1000
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:43,360
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1001
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,490
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1002
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:49,286
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1003
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:50,325
Hey!

1004
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:00,794
Cal, don't!

1005
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,714
Watch yourself, get back!

1006
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:06,263
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1007
01:15:07,352 --> 01:15:08,811
Don't bother me!

1008
01:15:08,895 --> 01:15:10,603
Come on.

1009
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:21,280
- Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink.

1010
01:15:27,747 --> 01:15:29,455
What are you waiting for?

1011
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,666
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1012
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:36,830
Aron, you are a child.

1013
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:44,384
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1014
01:15:46,183 --> 01:15:47,262
Gustav.

1015
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,430
Silence.

1016
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:51,305
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1017
01:15:51,396 --> 01:15:53,389
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1018
01:15:53,481 --> 01:15:56,269
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1019
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:00,143
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1020
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,524
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1021
01:16:03,617 --> 01:16:06,155
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1022
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,289
- What is it?
- Let him come down and read it.

1023
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:12,243
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1024
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:14,168
Here, give it to me.

1025
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:22,295
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs..."

1026
01:16:28,516 --> 01:16:32,466
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April."

1027
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:35,973
"He died a hero and an American."

1028
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:43,271
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

1029
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,942
You're not sorry enough.

1030
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:48,367
- I don't think he's sorry.
- He's not sorry at all.

1031
01:16:48,453 --> 01:16:51,573
- Listen, why don't we all go on home...
- You're not sorry enough.

1032
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:53,741
Why aren't you in the war?

1033
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,541
This will make you sorry.

1034
01:17:25,782 --> 01:17:27,110
Hello, Charlie.

1035
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:30,441
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1036
01:17:30,537 --> 01:17:31,533
Get up.

1037
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:34,791
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1038
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:36,667
Evening, Rose.

1039
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,377
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1040
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:43,672
Somebody owes you an apology.

1041
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:54,511
How about you folks all going home now?

1042
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:56,643
I think this'll do for tonight.

1043
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,025
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1044
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:06,113
- May I?
- Come in.

1045
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:14,162
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1046
01:18:14,247 --> 01:18:17,367
- I'm gonna see to it.
- Ja. He will see to it.

1047
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:27,045
Where were you?

1048
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:31,715
Where did you get his coat?

1049
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,605
You all right?

1050
01:18:46,237 --> 01:18:49,938
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1051
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,110
You had to start slugging.

1052
01:18:52,702 --> 01:18:55,739
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1053
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:00,206
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1054
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:04,421
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1055
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:12,927
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1056
01:19:14,307 --> 01:19:18,471
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1057
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:19,806
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1058
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:22,387
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1059
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:32,981
Wait here.

1060
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:14,192
I was trying to help him.

1061
01:20:17,328 --> 01:20:19,404
Who am I kidding?

1062
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:21,831
I tried to kill him.

1063
01:20:24,335 --> 01:20:25,913
Mike, give me a drink.

1064
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,500
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1065
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:33,628
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1066
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:38,217
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1067
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:43,184
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1068
01:20:43,521 --> 01:20:45,846
It didn't mean anything, really.

1069
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:48,515
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1070
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:52,026
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1071
01:20:54,908 --> 01:20:59,451
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1072
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:01,534
What?

1073
01:21:03,374 --> 01:21:05,118
Someday he's gonna know.

1074
01:21:08,546 --> 01:21:10,788
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1075
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:17,173
- I know. I scare myself.
- Abra.

1076
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,902
Fix me another drink.

1077
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:49,455
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

1078
01:21:53,424 --> 01:21:54,420
Okay.

1079
01:21:55,218 --> 01:21:58,053
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1080
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:01,802
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1081
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:06,479
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1082
01:22:06,563 --> 01:22:08,769
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1083
01:22:08,856 --> 01:22:10,648
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1084
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:13,485
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1085
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:17,069
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1086
01:22:18,074 --> 01:22:22,535
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1087
01:22:49,105 --> 01:22:50,101
Abra.

1088
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:54,980
What?

1089
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:57,774
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1090
01:23:00,116 --> 01:23:01,231
- Cal?
- Yeah.

1091
01:23:02,827 --> 01:23:05,863
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I want to see you.

1092
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:09,079
Wait till I put something on.

1093
01:23:27,477 --> 01:23:30,561
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1094
01:23:31,105 --> 01:23:33,264
Yes. What is it?

1095
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,278
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1096
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,857
- I got it.
- What?

1097
01:23:45,828 --> 01:23:49,280
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1098
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:51,117
On that lettuce business?

1099
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,585
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1100
01:23:57,674 --> 01:24:00,461
- I've earned every cent.
- That's wonderful, Cal.

1101
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:08,096
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1102
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:12,052
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1103
01:24:12,897 --> 01:24:14,605
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1104
01:24:17,735 --> 01:24:19,894
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1105
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:27,860
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1106
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:30,407
to be there.

1107
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:36,250
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1108
01:24:36,796 --> 01:24:39,548
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1109
01:24:39,632 --> 01:24:42,467
- and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1110
01:24:43,803 --> 01:24:46,211
And we'll get balloons...

1111
01:24:48,933 --> 01:24:53,097
- and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1112
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,062
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1113
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,580
I'm sort of...

1114
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:26,678
Why did I hit Aron?

1115
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:31,637
Why did I hit him so hard?

1116
01:25:43,029 --> 01:25:45,650
Will you help me?

1117
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,065
Will you really help me?

1118
01:25:50,328 --> 01:25:51,822
I'll help you, Cal.

1119
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:57,949
Be careful.

1120
01:26:02,507 --> 01:26:04,001
How'd I get up here?

1121
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:18,599
- Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1122
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:21,726
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- I think it looks beautiful.

1123
01:26:22,235 --> 01:26:24,061
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1124
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,395
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1125
01:26:26,489 --> 01:26:28,149
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1126
01:26:28,241 --> 01:26:30,648
- Do you think this is childish?
- Not a bit.

1127
01:26:30,743 --> 01:26:33,779
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1128
01:26:34,831 --> 01:26:37,072
- How's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1129
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:39,325
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1130
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:42,752
- Aron didn't get him anything?
- He told me he had something.

1131
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,224
- What?
- He didn't tell me what it was.

1132
01:27:02,191 --> 01:27:04,861
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

1133
01:27:05,444 --> 01:27:07,152
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1134
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:08,862
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1135
01:27:08,948 --> 01:27:09,979
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1136
01:27:10,074 --> 01:27:11,153
Okay.

1137
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:14,780
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1138
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:16,448
You think it's pretty?

1139
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:19,909
Don't drink any more wine.

1140
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,505
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

1141
01:27:27,758 --> 01:27:30,629
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1142
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,836
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1143
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:38,467
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1144
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:41,598
The brooms.

1145
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:44,596
- Don't you do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1146
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,397
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1147
01:27:47,486 --> 01:27:51,531
- We'll act like it was any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

1148
01:27:54,076 --> 01:27:55,321
Cal.

1149
01:28:00,082 --> 01:28:01,826
You look wonderful.

1150
01:28:03,502 --> 01:28:04,498
Thanks.

1151
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:16,306
But I need my son.

1152
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,557
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1153
01:28:19,644 --> 01:28:20,972
I need him to work the farm.

1154
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,469
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1155
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:26,055
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1156
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:29,649
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1157
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:30,982
Everything cost so much now.

1158
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,741
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1159
01:28:33,824 --> 01:28:35,817
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1160
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,365
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1161
01:28:38,454 --> 01:28:41,490
- Come on, Poppa.
- I don't like it.

1162
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:44,953
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1163
01:28:49,465 --> 01:28:51,505
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1164
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:54,842
- Gonna stay to dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1165
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:58,843
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1166
01:28:59,558 --> 01:29:02,476
- Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

1167
01:29:02,561 --> 01:29:04,887
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1168
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:08,480
- We could use it.
- Let's go in.

1169
01:29:29,213 --> 01:29:31,669
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1170
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:34,295
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1171
01:29:34,385 --> 01:29:37,718
- Are you surprised?
- I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1172
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:41,589
- We knew you had, didn't we?
- Completely. I don't know what to say.

1173
01:29:45,521 --> 01:29:47,146
We got turkey.

1174
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:50,814
- And champagne.
- Champagne, and we got all the things.

1175
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:56,365
- We got the trimmings here.
- Isn't that pretty?

1176
01:30:01,412 --> 01:30:04,579
Got something for you.

1177
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:07,666
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1178
01:30:12,631 --> 01:30:15,004
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Yes.

1179
01:30:15,092 --> 01:30:19,470
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1180
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:24,715
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1181
01:30:28,105 --> 01:30:31,106
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1182
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,564
A lovely birthday present.

1183
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:39,111
- You have my blessings.
- Thank you, Dad.

1184
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:43,156
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No.

1185
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:48,451
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1186
01:30:49,627 --> 01:30:50,706
Excuse me.

1187
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:56,460
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1188
01:31:00,763 --> 01:31:01,925
What's this?

1189
01:31:04,016 --> 01:31:05,475
What is this?

1190
01:31:08,646 --> 01:31:12,975
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1191
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,356
You made it? But how?

1192
01:31:17,655 --> 01:31:18,686
Go on.

1193
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,569
- Beans.
- Beans?

1194
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:26,494
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1195
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:31,992
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1196
01:31:33,337 --> 01:31:36,671
So, that's for you.

1197
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:40,842
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1198
01:31:42,138 --> 01:31:43,418
It's for you.

1199
01:31:45,432 --> 01:31:48,303
- I made it for you.
- You will have to give it back.

1200
01:31:50,813 --> 01:31:55,689
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1201
01:31:56,402 --> 01:31:59,687
- You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

1202
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,481
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1203
01:32:03,576 --> 01:32:06,363
- I can't give it back.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1204
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:08,031
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1205
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:11,954
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1206
01:32:12,877 --> 01:32:16,376
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1207
01:32:16,922 --> 01:32:19,164
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1208
01:32:19,258 --> 01:32:21,167
Not one will come back untorn.

1209
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,673
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1210
01:32:27,349 --> 01:32:30,054
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1211
01:32:30,644 --> 01:32:33,479
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

1212
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:36,434
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

1213
01:32:36,525 --> 01:32:37,936
I'll never take it!

1214
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:41,360
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1215
01:32:41,447 --> 01:32:44,531
something like your brother's given me.

1216
01:32:44,617 --> 01:32:48,566
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1217
01:32:49,413 --> 01:32:52,414
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1218
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:54,534
That's something I could value.

1219
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:24,816
I hate you!

1220
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,627
What are you doing?

1221
01:33:51,016 --> 01:33:53,258
He doesn't want anything from me.

1222
01:33:53,686 --> 01:33:54,966
Cal, don't.

1223
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:58,888
Please, don't.

1224
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:09,071
Abra!

1225
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:32,799
Don't you ever touch her again.

1226
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:36,936
I don't trust you.

1227
01:34:39,815 --> 01:34:41,095
You're no good.

1228
01:34:42,067 --> 01:34:46,147
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1229
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,357
You know it, too, don't you?

1230
01:34:48,741 --> 01:34:51,232
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1231
01:34:51,327 --> 01:34:55,490
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1232
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:58,453
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1233
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:01,792
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1234
01:35:29,573 --> 01:35:32,408
- You want to go some place with me?
- Why should I?

1235
01:35:35,746 --> 01:35:37,573
I got something to show you.

1236
01:35:39,124 --> 01:35:42,908
- Think you'll find it very interesting.
- What are you talking about?

1237
01:35:44,046 --> 01:35:47,379
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1238
01:35:48,092 --> 01:35:51,046
- What do you mean by that?
- Maybe she didn't.

1239
01:35:51,136 --> 01:35:53,010
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1240
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,800
What are you up to now?

1241
01:35:56,892 --> 01:36:00,475
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1242
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:05,813
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1243
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:09,358
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1244
01:36:10,072 --> 01:36:12,029
You cried and you said...

1245
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:15,277
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1246
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:18,204
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1247
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:22,705
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1248
01:36:22,793 --> 01:36:24,121
What's the matter, you afraid?

1249
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:26,667
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1250
01:36:26,755 --> 01:36:30,883
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1251
01:36:33,303 --> 01:36:37,800
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1252
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:40,347
Come on.

1253
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:45,140
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1254
01:37:20,309 --> 01:37:21,507
Oh, Cal.

1255
01:37:23,729 --> 01:37:24,725
Hello.

1256
01:37:49,213 --> 01:37:53,756
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1257
01:37:55,928 --> 01:37:58,253
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1258
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:09,098
Say hello to your mother.

1259
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,823
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1260
01:38:26,959 --> 01:38:29,331
Joe!

1261
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,341
- Play another song!
- Quiet!

1262
01:38:45,936 --> 01:38:46,967
Five!

1263
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:51,311
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes"

1264
01:38:52,442 --> 01:38:55,693
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow"

1265
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:00,277
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1266
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:09,539
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1267
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:11,286
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1268
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:13,584
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1269
01:39:13,922 --> 01:39:16,757
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1270
01:39:17,092 --> 01:39:19,001
I like it. I think it's great.

1271
01:39:19,761 --> 01:39:21,884
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1272
01:39:21,972 --> 01:39:25,507
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1273
01:39:25,601 --> 01:39:29,729
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1274
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:32,648
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1275
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:36,027
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1276
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:39,275
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1277
01:39:39,364 --> 01:39:42,116
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1278
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,027
from what you thought was right.

1279
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:48,033
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1280
01:39:48,874 --> 01:39:50,950
I know why you didn't love me.

1281
01:39:51,043 --> 01:39:52,501
Because I'm like my mother...

1282
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:55,540
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1283
01:39:57,716 --> 01:40:01,714
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1284
01:40:01,803 --> 01:40:06,382
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1285
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,758
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1286
01:40:09,853 --> 01:40:11,680
She owns one of them houses.

1287
01:40:13,148 --> 01:40:15,853
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1288
01:40:16,818 --> 01:40:21,112
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1289
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:27,991
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1290
01:40:30,123 --> 01:40:32,163
But now I don't want it anymore.

1291
01:40:34,836 --> 01:40:38,585
- I can't use it anymore.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

1292
01:40:42,386 --> 01:40:44,674
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1293
01:40:46,598 --> 01:40:48,092
It doesn't pay off.

1294
01:40:48,642 --> 01:40:50,469
No future in it.

1295
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:54,723
Let him go if he wants to.

1296
01:40:59,778 --> 01:41:01,605
No, I won't.

1297
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:16,286
You hate me, too, don't you?

1298
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:19,207
I'm afraid of you.

1299
01:41:24,302 --> 01:41:27,921
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1300
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:33,090
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1301
01:41:34,646 --> 01:41:39,604
- Adam!
- Here. What is it?

1302
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:42,694
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1303
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:45,697
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1304
01:41:45,782 --> 01:41:46,861
Cal!

1305
01:41:53,623 --> 01:41:56,328
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1306
01:41:56,418 --> 01:41:59,585
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1307
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:01,877
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1308
01:42:01,965 --> 01:42:03,958
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1309
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:06,542
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1310
01:42:06,636 --> 01:42:10,219
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1311
01:42:10,307 --> 01:42:12,714
I think you better get down there.

1312
01:42:13,852 --> 01:42:15,726
- Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1313
01:43:14,871 --> 01:43:17,160
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1314
01:43:21,503 --> 01:43:24,670
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1315
01:43:24,756 --> 01:43:26,915
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1316
01:43:27,008 --> 01:43:30,009
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1317
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:33,342
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1318
01:43:34,558 --> 01:43:37,724
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1319
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,097
He might die tonight.

1320
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:50,439
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1321
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,579
Good day.

1322
01:43:58,665 --> 01:44:02,116
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1323
01:44:04,129 --> 01:44:07,046
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him."

1324
01:44:07,591 --> 01:44:11,719
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1325
01:44:13,805 --> 01:44:16,426
Now why don't you go away some place?

1326
01:44:30,822 --> 01:44:33,823
- He's right.
- No.

1327
01:44:35,785 --> 01:44:38,323
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1328
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:50,623
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1329
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:53,625
Thank you.

1330
01:44:55,972 --> 01:44:57,929
- There you are.
- How is he?

1331
01:44:58,016 --> 01:45:00,970
He's fine. He's my darling.

1332
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,934
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1333
01:45:03,021 --> 01:45:04,599
Can I go in there now?

1334
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:08,564
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1335
01:45:10,528 --> 01:45:14,312
- How is he, really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1336
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:17,233
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1337
01:45:17,327 --> 01:45:18,702
I didn't think so.

1338
01:45:18,787 --> 01:45:22,037
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1339
01:45:22,123 --> 01:45:26,335
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1340
01:45:41,059 --> 01:45:45,104
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1341
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:48,477
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1342
01:45:49,317 --> 01:45:51,606
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1343
01:45:51,695 --> 01:45:54,779
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1344
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:57,399
I'll report you to the doctor.

1345
01:45:57,742 --> 01:46:00,364
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1346
01:46:35,864 --> 01:46:36,859
Father.

1347
01:46:40,285 --> 01:46:41,613
Can you hear me?

1348
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:49,083
I did an awful thing.

1349
01:46:53,256 --> 01:46:54,335
I'm sorry.

1350
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:31,118
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1351
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:34,963
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1352
01:47:35,548 --> 01:47:36,959
Can you answer?

1353
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:41,507
I think you can understand me, though.

1354
01:47:42,388 --> 01:47:46,089
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1355
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:50,311
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1356
01:47:57,946 --> 01:48:01,778
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1357
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:06,447
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1358
01:48:08,665 --> 01:48:11,203
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1359
01:48:11,543 --> 01:48:15,243
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1360
01:48:15,338 --> 01:48:18,209
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1361
01:48:19,551 --> 01:48:22,670
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1362
01:48:24,472 --> 01:48:29,218
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1363
01:48:30,478 --> 01:48:32,601
You never asked him for one thing.

1364
01:48:33,731 --> 01:48:37,480
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes...

1365
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:43,777
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1366
01:48:44,242 --> 01:48:47,113
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1367
01:48:47,453 --> 01:48:49,363
or else he'll never be a man.

1368
01:48:50,081 --> 01:48:54,328
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1369
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:57,337
Please, help him.

1370
01:48:57,881 --> 01:49:01,581
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1371
01:49:01,676 --> 01:49:04,297
and you're the only one who can do it.

1372
01:49:04,387 --> 01:49:06,261
So try, please try.

1373
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,427
If you could ask him for something.

1374
01:49:12,228 --> 01:49:15,146
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1375
01:49:16,065 --> 01:49:17,725
Let him do for you.

1376
01:49:21,196 --> 01:49:26,107
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1377
01:49:31,873 --> 01:49:32,988
You've tired my patient...

1378
01:49:33,082 --> 01:49:36,665
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1379
01:49:38,963 --> 01:49:42,878
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1380
01:49:43,176 --> 01:49:45,928
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1381
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:47,554
- No.
- Then stop it.

1382
01:49:48,348 --> 01:49:51,467
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1383
01:49:51,559 --> 01:49:54,430
- I can't.
- Please try.

1384
01:49:55,146 --> 01:49:56,475
Get it straight.

1385
01:49:57,523 --> 01:50:01,652
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1386
01:50:08,326 --> 01:50:12,240
- Is there any coffee around here?
- I'll get you some in a minute.

1387
01:50:18,044 --> 01:50:19,075
Try.

1388
01:50:20,421 --> 01:50:22,710
Is there anything to read around here?

1389
01:50:24,217 --> 01:50:25,711
What would you like?

1390
01:50:25,802 --> 01:50:29,799
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1391
01:50:44,946 --> 01:50:48,694
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1392
01:50:48,783 --> 01:50:52,532
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1393
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:56,373
A man has a choice.

1394
01:50:56,624 --> 01:50:59,709
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1395
01:50:59,794 --> 01:51:01,372
You see, I remember.

1396
01:51:01,462 --> 01:51:05,163
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1397
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,135
You see, I do remember.

1398
01:51:09,595 --> 01:51:13,296
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Get out!

1399
01:51:24,152 --> 01:51:25,147
Look.

1400
01:51:33,494 --> 01:51:36,744
Do something...

1401
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:40,156
for me.

1402
01:51:40,251 --> 01:51:41,532
Yes.

1403
01:51:45,673 --> 01:51:48,710
That woman...

1404
01:51:49,344 --> 01:51:53,673
the nurse, can't stand her.

1405
01:51:55,892 --> 01:51:57,552
Get me another.

1406
01:52:13,409 --> 01:52:15,449
I can't stand her, either.

1407
01:53:07,839 --> 01:53:09,214
What did he say?

1408
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:19,346
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1409
01:53:20,893 --> 01:53:23,431
He said, "You stay with me..."

1410
01:53:24,814 --> 01:53:26,557
"and you take care of me."

1411
01:53:27,305 --> 01:54:27,316
