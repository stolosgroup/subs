3
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,937
I am a public
defender.

4
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,945
And there are only 15,000 of
me for the 10.5 million people

5
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:18,980
who were arrested last year in
America.

6
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,022
I work for a machine,

7
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,223
that is the U.S. Criminal
Justice System.

8
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:37,065
Once you fall in, it's
almost impossible to get out.

9
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,269
For most of the prosecutors,

10
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:45,974
the defenders,

11
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,078
cops,

12
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:53,748
and everyone else caught up in
the system,

13
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:02,023
that's just the harsh
reality of the machine.

14
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,359
Punk ass.

15
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,531
All right, what do we
have here?

16
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,034
But what
if reality isn't fixed?

17
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,471
What if you can shape it?

18
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,310
What if, hear me out, with a
little help,

19
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,345
you can beat the system at its
own game?

20
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:34,822
Okay, Mr.

21
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,192
Ah-Chot, Ah-Chat.

22
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,963
Yes, me, Ah-Chut.

23
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,196
Were you selling batteries

24
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,867
without a license on
the Downtown Six train?

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,868
Huh?

26
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,636
Batteries, license, you sell?

27
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,841
Can we get a translator?

28
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,475
No problem, what do you need?

29
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,378
Chinese, Cantonese.

30
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,279
Dreams are nice.

31
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,214
I had them once.

32
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,384
Oh damn, what am I
supposed to do with this?

33
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,252
Home?

34
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,423
No home, here, just overnight,
sorry.

35
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,659
Home.

36
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:16,964
Okay.

37
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,566
One chance, you say nothing.

38
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,466
The judge ask you anything.

39
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,835
You nod, okay?

40
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,770
As in now, nod if you
understand, sir.

41
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,841
Judge ask, nod, okay?

42
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,843
Right okay, that's it, all
right.

43
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,312
People versus Ah-Chut, let's
go.

44
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,982
People are fine with
a charge of 240 and 20

45
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,416
and community service.

46
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,919
That's our offer.

47
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,588
Your Honor, my client has
been in the system 29 hours.

48
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,156
The fine for discount alone,

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,358
would ensure he's right back
out there selling Energizers.

50
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,694
I believe it was
Duracell.

51
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,495
Whatever, let's just do an
ACD.

52
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,897
Send this gentleman back home

53
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,999
where we could all go to
bed with a clean conscience.

54
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,266
From the looks of you,

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,235
bed isn't somewhere you
land often, Counselor?

56
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,270
Sleep is for lawyers
who lose, Your Honor.

57
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,740
Cute, but not really.

58
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,827
Mr. Ah-Chut, do you understand
what your lawyer just said?

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,370
- Approach please.
- No, no, no, no.

60
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,371
He just nodded, Your Honor.

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,206
It was subtle.

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,273
He's a got a weak neck,

63
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,375
- so let me just-
- Please, approach.

64
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,244
Okay.

65
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,480
Trying to slip your client by?

66
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,817
- No, I'm not.
- Do not interrupt me.

67
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,153
Like I would just rubber stamp
his plea.

68
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,320
My client doesn't
speak a romance language,

69
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,791
which leaves him stuck
in here another 12 hours.

70
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,425
Then we'll just have
to see him tomorrow,

71
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,762
and the constitution survives
another day.

72
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:17,852
Next.

73
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:30,031
I like them nails,
like Mona Lisa with bite.

74
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,202
What's this?

75
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,605
My buddy's car got jacked.

76
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,273
I'm not sure whatever
it take to get it out,

77
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,909
but, and that's the plate
number.

78
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,885
Do you have the notarized
letter

79
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,353
from the owner authorizing
you to pick it up?

80
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,489
See, that's the thing that
dude's not exactly available.

81
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,160
He's in Rikers.

82
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,196
Yeah, I can't help you.

83
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,802
Can you at least let me know
it's there.

84
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,737
No paperwork, no car.

85
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,605
Next!

86
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
I thought we were hitting it
off here.

87
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,044
I didn't know we were on a
date.

88
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,249
Maybe we should be.

89
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,056
Casi, my man, 50 grand.

90
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,760
- Why so nonplussed, baby?
- Jimmy, what are you?

91
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,061
- You look-
- Good?

92
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:34,996
Good, yeah.

93
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,565
It's all you, baby.

94
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,867
The doctor you sent me to,
put me on your cocktail.

95
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,370
Got me those transfusions,
to beat back the Hep C.

96
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,505
I played two sets at Small's
last night,

97
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,173
didn't have anything
stronger than the Sprite.

98
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,407
Mr. Clean.

99
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,010
Jimmy, I got him to
delay your sentencing

100
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,410
based on you being sick.

101
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,512
You got me well, baby.

102
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,847
If the judge sees you this
way-

103
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,749
- The T-count up to 800, check
it.

104
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:57,952
Liver's looking good.

105
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,189
Christ, you're healthier than
I am.

106
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,091
That possession thing is
ancient, right?

107
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,127
Ain't no way they're
gonna push for real time,

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,962
now that they see I'm on the
narrow.

109
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,197
They might, Jimmy.
Let me figure this out.

110
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,132
Wait here, okay?

111
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,774
From the previous
judge's files,

112
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,977
I'm shocked to see Mr.
Coates so hale and hearty,

113
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,445
- or breathing.
- Thank you.

114
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,981
Mr. Coates looks fine to me.

115
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,285
You have a recent medical
report.

116
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,154
It's right there, Your Honor.

117
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,423
It's from 90 days ago.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,258
When was the last
time you had a checkup?

119
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,498
10-minute break, Counselor, in
chambers.

120
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,971
- Casi, what's happening?
- I'll take care of it.

121
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,739
She's saying that I
should've stayed sick,

122
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,741
otherwise I go to jail?

123
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,842
What's her plan?

124
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,744
I hear Cuba's good this time
of year.

125
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,979
I'll be right back, I got this.

126
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:58,980
We're good, okay?

127
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,452
It's a death sentence sending
him straight

128
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,254
to a mandatory one and a half to
three.

129
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,323
Do you get that this isn't a
contest?

130
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,659
Your Honor.

131
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,128
Showing up here with outdated
medical records,

132
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,197
and the belief woefully
misplaced,

133
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,199
that if you just talk fast
enough

134
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,134
and flash those shiny veneers-

135
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,702
- Now, they're real, I wore
braces-

136
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:25,006
- Hey, hey, hey, I've
cited better PDs than you

137
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,874
for a whole lot less.

138
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,009
Can I speak frankly?

139
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,512
Can we agree that treatment
is a better option

140
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,780
than jail time?

141
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,682
And why would we do
that, start agreeing?

142
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,050
Sending a man to jail

143
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,852
because he isn't dying
fast enough seems petulant.

144
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,153
Even for you, Your Honor.

145
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,522
Oh, I see that we're
still speaking frankly.

146
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,290
Okay, I get what this is.

147
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,625
You don't like me, that's
awesome.

148
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,826
I probably agree with you
mostly,

149
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,162
but Mr. Coates, shouldn't be a
casualty.

150
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,564
There are treatment
options inside the penal-

151
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:53,868
- He's working his treatment
on the outside and well,

152
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,303
very well, sending him back to a
box.

153
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,039
Treatment is not punishment.

154
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,473
Yeah, unless you're white,
ex-urban,

155
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,975
and the gateway drug was
introduced by a big pharma.

156
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:01,909
It's so funny

157
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,577
- how that works out.
- Get out.

158
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,812
Okay, Your Honor, I just-

159
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,781
- Unless you'd like an officer
to help.

160
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:09,950
No, no, no.

161
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,426
Sure Mr. Coates will be right
back?

162
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,061
Oh, I have no doubt.

163
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,096
That's the beauty of bench
warrants.

164
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,909
And now, it's
that mysterious blackout

165
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,345
that is leaving thousands of New
Yorkers-

166
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,181
- Lock anyone away
tonight, chief?

167
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,482
I work with the bad guys.

168
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,419
My friend

169
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,389
how can you defend someone
you know is guilty?

170
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,697
Hundreds of people
are stuck in elevators,

171
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,866
others stranded on the subway.

172
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:41,335
Angus!

173
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,489
Hey.

174
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:03,424
My hero.

175
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,393
Make thyself comfortable.

176
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,195
That doesn't sound promising.

177
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,231
Well, I'm worried about you.

178
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,899
This place actually looks clean
for once.

179
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,269
- Celebrating, the ripple.
- The what?

180
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,737
Space time.

181
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,205
They finally detected it.

182
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,542
The fabric that binds us all
together.

183
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,143
- Your friends at LIGO.
- Fucking bastards.

184
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,412
A-ha.

185
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,248
- Please say-
- No, false alarm.

186
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,782
Great, and there I was this
close

187
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:32,219
to the greatest sleep I've never
had.

188
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,288
- How do you know?
- Know what?

189
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,923
It's a great sleep.

190
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,560
Let alone the greatest if you're
asleep.

191
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,696
I know, my body knows.

192
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,699
Your body is an imperfect
instrument for evaluation.

193
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:45,734
The fact is, you don't know

194
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,101
what's on the other side of
sleep.

195
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,537
Oh work, in four hours.

196
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,971
Hence, my need for those twin
set of keys

197
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,773
I entrusted you with.

198
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,074
A show of confidence

199
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,776
and that feels woefully
misplaced, my friend.

200
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,478
It's not what they
think it is, you know?

201
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:58,713
Not exactly.

202
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,247
- We still on sleep?
- The ripple.

203
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,716
- Black hole.
- Right.

204
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,085
We can now see the
unseeable and it's not stable.

205
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,155
These blackouts we've been
experiencing are proof.

206
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,927
What would you say if I
told you that the bindings

207
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,930
of our universe are unraveling,

208
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,301
that worlds we couldn't
previously conceive of

209
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,102
are crashing into our own.

210
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,606
I'd say, I'm fucking
sleeping on your couch tonight.

211
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,674
And you'd be wrong.

212
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,080
The shadow kingdom, what the
fuck?

213
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,951
By all means, use my personal
computer.

214
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,854
Oh Jesus fucking Christ!

215
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,888
What are you doing?

216
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,056
- Me?
- Yeah.

217
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,192
Who said you could
get all up into my shit.

218
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,193
I couldn't sleep.

219
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,800
You didn't strike me
as a fan of the royals.

220
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,401
The opposite, actually.

221
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:34,908
Check it out.

222
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,979
You notice anything funny?

223
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,247
I don't even know what I'm
looking at.

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,516
- Look!
- What?

225
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,052
Her eyes, oh my God.

226
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,755
She's got reptoid eyes.

227
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:47,988
You're not serious.

228
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,189
You know, House of Windsor,

229
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,892
isn't the only bloodline bred
into power.

230
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,061
But these people, if
you can call them that,

231
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,063
they control everything.

232
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,499
And look, it takes time to
absorb, I know.

233
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,067
You seem like a nice guy,
Craig.

234
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,536
Really.

235
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,437
And I'd be happy to help you
get your friends car out,

236
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,574
- but-
- So you checked?

237
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,275
What?

238
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,846
The uh, the Navigator's still
there?

239
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,714
Yeah.

240
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,552
Hey, you're lucky the city
hadn't auctioned it off yet.

241
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,486
All right, okay.

242
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,556
Thanks for the fuck.

243
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,590
It's time to bounce.

244
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,963
No, no, we still have
unfinished business between us.

245
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,766
Any business you got
left can be taken care of

246
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,300
by your hand.

247
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,168
I'm tired.

248
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:36,771
Okay.

249
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,441
Let's start to bounce.

250
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,747
Get the fuck out.

251
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,316
I'm serious.

252
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,924
You know, so am I.

253
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,131
You catch anything
yesterday?

254
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,668
Dead, like two class Cs.

255
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,101
Oh, except for this guy.

256
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,838
We had to stand around
waiting for the EMS guys

257
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:10,971
to haul him off.

258
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,407
Broken jaw, blood everywhere,
crying.

259
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,776
Some old Chinese guy.

260
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,710
What's his name?

261
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,312
I don't know, Charlie Chan.

262
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,581
What's his fucking name?

263
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,448
Back off, asshole.

264
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,350
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,018
Look, I think he's a guy of
mine.

266
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,788
He owe you money or
something?

267
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,121
His name, please?

268
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,525
Choo-Choo.

269
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,026
Something like that.

270
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,029
Dick.

271
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,518
Tell me you didn't just
try to beat up two ADAs.

272
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,285
- No.
- Holy shit.

273
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,386
I would kiss you.

274
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,688
- I would kiss you-
- What do you want?

275
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:01,556
If I didn't have this little
sore.

276
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,490
I can't quite ID, what I want?

277
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,026
Well, I need you to do me
a little bit of a favor.

278
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,862
I just caught an arraignment.

279
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,697
Oh, a whole Office of
the Public Defender thing

280
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,900
at the bottom of your paycheck
means something today.

281
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,001
- Interesting.
- Right.

282
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,402
Well, she's a former client of
yours

283
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,738
and she wants you, slugger,

284
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,072
which judging by her
ears is a mission I would

285
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,508
dutifully accept.

286
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,977
- Her ears?
- Her ears.

287
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:24,746
I mean, they were so pretty.

288
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,315
And you could say that they
bordered on sexually attractive,

289
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,483
and it wasn't so much the lobe

290
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,718
that was pretty either, Casi.

291
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,720
- It was-
- So why didn't you?

292
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,690
- What?
- You know, accept.

293
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,693
Well, you and I both know

294
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,662
that I'm likely to phone in a
defense

295
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,697
if I feel that my client
doesn't share a belief

296
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,066
in my unequivocated brilliance.

297
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:51,940
And Lea Deleon, just so
happens to be an unbeliever.

298
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,676
- What, Lea, Lea, Lea?
- Yeah.

299
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,544
- She's back?
- Back.

300
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,979
First name basis.

301
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,015
It was meant to be.

302
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,450
She was arrested last night
of possession of heroin.

303
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,553
She wants to strike deal with
the cops.

304
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,622
Okay, just leave it on my
desk.

305
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,423
I'll deal with it later.

306
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,860
Actually, she's already
at the DA's office.

307
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,062
Are you fucking serious?

308
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,262
You might actually
be a few minutes late.

309
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,531
Fuck you Dane.

310
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,132
- This is, really, now?
- I couldn't find you.

311
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,602
I've been looking all over.

312
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:23,370
Like now, like right this
second now?

313
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,138
As soon as you can get there.

314
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,808
- Thanks, buddy.
- You owe me one.

315
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,155
Well, if it isn't my fresh out

316
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,591
of law school sensation.

317
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,993
Three years ago maybe,

318
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,028
but in public defender time
one year is like 75, so.

319
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,598
You don't look a day over 110.

320
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,135
So, what'd you tell the AO?

321
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,006
Nothing the H they found on me
didn't.

322
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,406
- Jesus, Lea.
- It was total bullshit

323
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,009
- how they picked me up.
- So what are you?

324
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,811
You're muling for a
sketchy boyfriend again?

325
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:04,679
Boyfriend, no.

326
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,615
Sketchy is being generous.

327
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,018
And technically, last time
I only went rented the cars

328
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,486
for the mules, which as you
know,

329
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,656
I had no idea about.

330
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:15,623
But this you did?

331
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,825
Yeah, I can't front on that.

332
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,193
This guy, if he finds
out, I've been picked up,

333
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,432
I need to walk out of here.

334
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,534
I wish it was that easy.

335
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,971
- I need to walk. Right now.
- Okay.

336
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:34,207
Lea, if you violate your
promise after they let you out,

337
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,543
you'll be begging for
the four to nine years,

338
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:36,544
they're currently offering you.

339
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:37,812
Four to nine.

340
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,113
I might've plead you
down at two

341
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,648
if you kept your mouth
shut about cooperating.

342
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:43,183
Right, let the system do its
magic.

343
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,485
You know how hard it is to live

344
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,187
with a rap sheet hanging over
you?

345
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,124
How hard I had to hustle

346
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,060
to even get a shit job at the
tow pound?

347
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,329
I have to get out, I have to get
out.

348
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,397
All right, all right.

349
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,900
So plead not guilty, and drop
bail.

350
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,367
Look, if you're right about
this questionable stop,

351
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,836
we have a shot at getting
this thing dismissed.

352
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,270
- I promise you.
- Bail.

353
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,740
Jesus, if I had 50,000,

354
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:06,841
you'd think I'd be

355
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,042
- in this mess?
- Whoa, whoa, 50,000?

356
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,877
What judge set that number?

357
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:12,345
- Some fat guy.
- That narrows it down.

358
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,186
Okay, these baddies you're
rolling.

359
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,321
Tell me everything.

360
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,657
No lies, please.

361
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:27,562
Early bird.

362
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,100
Spread the wealth.

363
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,072
So this guy, Craig,
approached me a few days ago,

364
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,307
asking questions about
a car that was towed.

365
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:42,944
Before he came in,

366
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,579
he Googled everyone at the tow
pound,

367
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,047
guess whose mugshot came up.

368
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,851
Knowing I had a record,
he offered me 100 grand

369
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:50,885
if I'd help him out.

370
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,855
Help him, how?

371
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,056
By grabbing a sample of the
heroin

372
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,091
that was stashed inside that
Navigator.

373
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,106
I thought it'd be easy money.

374
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,742
Instead I was arrested
coming back from the preview.

375
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,212
Preview for what?

376
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:20,615
Craig needed the
sample to set up a deal.

377
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,750
He plans to buy the car
at the tow pounds auction,

378
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,652
before anyone else finds out
about it.

379
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,288
So who did the drugs
belong to?

380
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,624
A Mexican cartel.

381
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,458
Jesus, Lea.

382
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:34,494
Their mule lost the
cargo

383
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,864
while he was visiting
his girlfriend in Queens.

384
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,235
And the girlfriend
told Craig about it?

385
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,038
Yeah, she was hooking
up with Craig on the side.

386
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,407
Why?

387
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,310
Why risk it?

388
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,513
I was tired of my life.

389
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:53,514
You're late.

390
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:54,682
Just getting my game face on.

391
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,083
There are other ways to the
game

392
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:58,519
if you wanna trade that window
for a desk.

393
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,855
And I saw an
opportunity to change it.

394
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,859
So, I jumped.

395
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:22,810
You warned me.

396
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,345
About?

397
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:29,550
The people I let into my life.

398
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:31,953
I'm always letting myself be
chosen,

399
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,920
I need to choose.

400
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:39,126
Here come the detectives.

401
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,828
Be careful of what you say,
okay?

402
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,176
Okay, your story checks out.
Dates.

403
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,712
When is the Navigator
set to be auctioned off?

404
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:58,713
A week from Wednesday.

405
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,480
You sure about that?

406
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:03,217
Wednesday is the day it all
goes down.

407
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,417
Win the car, win the dope.

408
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,188
- What's the play?
- Play?

409
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,357
There's a ton of
fucking dope in that car.

410
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,092
You're selling it to someone,
who?

411
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:13,194
It's a weird name.

412
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,427
I can't tell you if he made it
up.

413
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,428
I don't give a fuck
if the name is weird,

414
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,365
- what's the fucking name?
- The Golem.

415
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,203
That mean something to you
boys?

416
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,874
What do you say?

417
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,776
This is some Popeye Doyle level
shit.

418
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:35,116
15 million and a big fish like
the Golem.

419
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,251
Guess the risk is worth the
walk, I think.

420
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,975
Hey baby, where you
been?

421
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,644
What happened to radio
silence?

422
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,445
The interweb was wonky
at my fleabag motel.

423
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,714
So I figured I'd tap yours.

424
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,849
Had a big Skype I couldn't miss.

425
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,752
- Wanna know who with?
- Not really?

426
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,588
- Guess.
- Meryl Streep.

427
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,557
Reptoid, next.

428
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,426
I'm not playing this game,
Craig.

429
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,162
The Grand Resistor.

430
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:23,496
- I don't know who that is.
- That's the thing.

431
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:24,365
No one does.

432
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,868
I took a screenshot of our
convo.

433
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:30,371
Check it out.

434
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,273
Freaky, right?

435
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,209
I can't believe I swiped
right.

436
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,850
Anyway, you still haven't told
me

437
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,218
where you were last night.

438
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,954
I slept over at a friend's.

439
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:47,788
Friends, huh?

440
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:49,557
Mm-hmm, yeah.

441
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:51,659
Who is he?

442
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:53,627
She.

443
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,197
And who I fuck is my business.

444
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,064
Nice.

445
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,872
Come on, hop in.

446
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:07,541
We got somewhere to be.

447
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,713
You think I'm getting
in there with that?

448
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,281
You're nuttier than I thought.

449
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,349
Let's go.

450
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,217
I ain't asking.

451
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,519
You let her walk?

452
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,887
I detect a note of skepticism.

453
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,789
I worked in corporate America.

454
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,157
I know a con when I see one.

455
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,494
You're gonna find me
after like three days.

456
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,862
A month, don't knock it.

457
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,167
Whatever.

458
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,972
Now, come on,

459
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,207
how many felonies are you
handling?

460
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,042
Right now?

461
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,210
Oh, 80 something.

462
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:46,247
All right, and how many
actually go to trial?

463
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,882
I don't know, none.

464
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:51,520
Booya motherfucker!

465
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:52,887
Exactly, exactly.

466
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,754
50 grand.

467
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,323
Then I'll tap your ass out.

468
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:57,158
I'll take that back.

469
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:57,992
No, asshole.

470
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:59,427
That's the bail they set.

471
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,929
Instead of going to trial
and fighting a clean slate,

472
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,398
the Lea's of the world plea,
why?

473
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,835
Life's a bitch, and now it's
in heat?

474
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,603
Did you believe in anything?

475
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,610
All the sainted ones that
you lose so much sleep over,

476
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:18,712
like that hottie you just helped
out.

477
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:23,451
The only thing that can save
them, you don't have. Money.

478
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,123
Your client, Mr. Coates, was
allowed

479
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:33,127
to remain out pending
intermittent medical updates.

480
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,796
The last of which revealed
him to be stable enough

481
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,566
to appear for sentencing.

482
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,734
During which, he left at great
delay

483
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,803
and aggravation to the court.

484
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:45,372
Per the statutory sentencing
requirements,

485
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,741
the court will recommend
three to six years,

486
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,910
pending the approval of the
Department of Probation.

487
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:50,911
Your Honor, you have the power

488
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,480
to waive a mandatory minimum

489
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:53,747
- if you could just authorize-
- One more word

490
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,816
while I am speaking.

491
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,719
Are you aware of

492
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,722
what Mr. Coates told the
court before your arrival?

493
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,090
No, Your Honor.

494
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:04,825
Mr. Coates claimed that you
told him

495
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:07,294
to leave the courtroom on his
last visit.

496
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,830
No, I did not.

497
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,465
You suggested he jumped off to
Cuba.

498
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,733
That was a joke.

499
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:16,170
Ah, hence the jocularity
which has ensued.

500
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,671
He'd just been told he's
rewarded

501
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,173
for staying clean, for not
dying,

502
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,641
was going to jail.

503
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:24,812
But he inferred that you
meant for him to jump bail.

504
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,915
I'm sorry, is that what
you believe, like personally?

505
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:31,118
I'm sorry, Casi, she was
yelling at me.

506
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:33,154
Got me all jammed up,
and I said, whatever,

507
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:34,021
you mad?

508
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,759
How could I be mad at
someone who plays like you?

509
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,028
Ask me how many days I last
used?

510
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:43,831
How many?

511
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:46,967
105.

512
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:51,640
One going in.

513
00:27:57,978 --> 00:28:00,447
Well, now that that's out of
the way,

514
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,817
the only thing left to consider
is your conduct, Counselor.

515
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,352
Am I being cited?

516
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:07,721
A contempt proceeding is
career-ending

517
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:09,490
for such a young attorney.

518
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,292
With all due respect,

519
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:13,994
- I've done this-
- Oh, why start now?

520
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,163
You haven't done yourself
any favors before me.

521
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,567
There are no complaints I'm
aware of.

522
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,000
No?

523
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:23,003
Then I would read the formal
complaint very closely,

524
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,673
when it's submitted to your
superiors.

525
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,643
Next docket.

526
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,442
Come on, chop chop.

527
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,111
Not until you tell me what's
going on.

528
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,412
The Golem got in touch.

529
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,415
I thought we were good to go.

530
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,417
There's been a wrinkle.

531
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:11,720
He says, I gotta show
up with who was with me

532
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:12,654
at the preview.

533
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:14,589
Aka you.

534
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,957
- Come on.
- No.

535
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,962
What is this place?

536
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,298
We have a partner, remember?

537
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:25,933
The reason we know what we know.

538
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,435
The mule's girl?

539
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,272
I know.

540
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:33,508
It's time you two had
a little face to face.

541
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,278
You, stay put.

542
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:40,649
Not with him.

543
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,817
Just you and me, that's it.

544
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:30,765
Hey.

545
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:36,904
Shut the fuck up!

546
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,139
Shut up.

547
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:42,677
The guys behind this shit,

548
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:44,311
they must have paid her a visit.

549
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,649
She was dead when I found her.

550
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,383
I didn't want the cops
asking any questions

551
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,819
that might derail this
motherfucker,

552
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:52,554
so I stashed her here.

553
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:53,387
You hear me?

554
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:58,092
They know my name, and you.

555
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:02,996
Okay?

556
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,168
I take this away, you won't
scream?

557
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:10,772
Get the fuck off me.

558
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:13,874
I'm just trying to bring you

559
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,275
into the cone of shit going down
here.

560
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,113
So we all know the stakes.

561
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:35,095
- One million.
- One million what?

562
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,065
- That's my new cut.
- Blow me.

563
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:40,134
I did, very underwhelming.

564
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:44,405
You need me at a drop I
wanted nothing to do with.

565
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,073
The crew we're ripping
off, leaving bodies behind,

566
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,041
so I need one fucking million.

567
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,244
That's the cost to get your 14.

568
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,179
Plus a promise I don't
have to see your face again

569
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:54,248
until the day of the auction.

570
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,449
250, final offer.

571
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,018
It's not gonna cut it, Craig.

572
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:58,887
Come on.

573
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,622
I'm not ending up like her.

574
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,257
One million is a figure it takes
to get me out of this life,

575
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,124
on my terms.

576
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,601
All right.

577
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:43,163
Thanks for meeting me.

578
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,466
I don't usually meet clients
outside the courthouse.

579
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:48,435
Professional, though some
judges might disagree.

580
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:56,109
- You okay?
- The plan.

581
00:32:56,143 --> 00:33:00,648
When I got back, Craig said
something that has me freaked.

582
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,853
Like?

583
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:09,156
I think something happened
to the mule's girlfriend.

584
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:14,929
Okay, you have to tell
Winston.

585
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:15,763
Yeah, right.

586
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:16,865
I'm being serious.

587
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:19,132
It's the only way to protect
yourself.

588
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,135
Assault, impersonating a
police officer, grand larceny.

589
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,973
Craig Bayonne's illustrious
body of work goes on and on.

590
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,812
- No charges of murder?
- Not yet.

591
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,884
Anything else?

592
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:44,391
In the tow pound, on the
wall in the waiting room,

593
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,728
there's this picture of a
mountain,

594
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:48,462
like Everest or something.

595
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,364
Years ago, it must have been
put up to take the edge off.

596
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,399
Like a plant you didn't have to
water.

597
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:57,337
I asked the lady at window
five who has been there forever

598
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,542
if she knew where it was
or who put it up or why?

599
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:04,512
Not a clue, not a clue.

600
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,046
She never even thought to ask.

601
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,853
That's why I knew I had to
get the fuck out of there.

602
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:16,089
And when I did, I'd find that
mountain.

603
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,693
You know, most thieves pick a
beach,

604
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:21,495
you know, nice views,
kayaking, all that stuff.

605
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:26,233
- I'm not most thieves.
- Right.

606
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,069
And I don't wanna live my life
looking

607
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,370
at lost opportunities.

608
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:36,711
I'm with you.

609
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,081
It's crazy to think

610
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,284
someone's gonna see 15 million
dollars,

611
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:48,488
all in one room, all at once.

612
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,061
Think of the lives that could
change.

613
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,569
- Be right back.
- All right.

614
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,317
Need a refill, hun?

615
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,351
Thank you.

616
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:58,960
- Little more?
- I got it.

617
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,668
Should you get back to grinding
the gears of bureaucracy?

618
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,268
Mm-hmm.

619
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,806
- All you had to do-
- I know.

620
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,640
I told you.

621
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:14,408
Did I not tell you, Casi?

622
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,345
You couldn't just shut up and do
your job?

623
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,814
Selling mattresses is a job.

624
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,214
Mmm, Lord.

625
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:23,551
My guys, I gotta look out for
them.

626
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:26,654
By making me do this
thing I don't wanna do?

627
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,455
It's not about letting me down.

628
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,626
Your clients, what about them?

629
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,226
This is a bullshit
complaint and you know it.

630
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,228
Then apologize to the
judge.

631
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:36,130
To Cymbeline?

632
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:37,197
Fuck that.

633
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,900
I'd rather eat her fucking ankle
weights.

634
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:41,936
Six months suspension.

635
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,742
I don't think they'll disbar,
maybe.

636
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,283
Casi.

637
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,460
What are you gonna do?

638
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,262
I hear Cuba's nice.

639
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:11,264
And now you're just being an
asshole.

640
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,499
What do you want me to say?

641
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:13,735
This is what I do.

642
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,570
Excuse me, for busting my ass,

643
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:16,938
trying to level the playing
field.

644
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,707
You can't fight everyone,
every step of the way.

645
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:23,177
We're all on the same side.

646
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,545
Maybe that's the problem.

647
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:35,223
You were right.

648
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,991
Of course I was.

649
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,260
About what?

650
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:41,929
The strong will always eat the
weak.

651
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:44,132
No, however could that be.

652
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,435
Tough week for you, champ?

653
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,639
All right, come on,

654
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:55,243
a night of heroic drinking
and revenge fantasies, on me.

655
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,517
Who wants this job anyway?

656
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,990
Bright side? At least now you
can see if wonder ears likes

657
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:10,323
you for more than your docket.

658
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:15,263
Lea Deleon used me, she lied.

659
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,565
Stop the presses.

660
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,100
- Bigfoots a fiction?
- Oh no, no,

661
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,101
deal's going down all right.

662
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,603
Just not the date she told vice.

663
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:30,611
Huh.

664
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,748
This is crazy.

665
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,415
I don't know if you're
serious or just smoking crack.

666
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:38,019
- I'm 100% both.
- Then obviously, no

667
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:39,654
Don't be fucking so
close-minded.

668
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:42,322
No, no, let me save you time.

669
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:43,825
I will, under no circumstance,

670
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,194
participate in an attempt
to steal millions of dollars

671
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:50,164
in drug money Lea Deleon
has told the DA about, no.

672
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:51,265
Why not?

673
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:52,867
Because it's the definition of
fantasy.

674
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,136
Hey, even if you acknowledged
that we,

675
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,337
properly armed with the
pertinent facts,

676
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,439
could devise a plan that would
enable us

677
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:02,510
to steal said monies
without detection or harm?

678
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:07,281
Listen, as long as the Golem
gets his cut

679
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,983
and the buyers get their
product,

680
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,118
the list of who we're
actually stealing from,

681
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,553
is pretty fucking short and
sexy.

682
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:13,955
Oh now you know.

683
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:17,158
We know literally more
than anyone else involved.

684
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,027
It's the perfect setup
for the perfect crime.

685
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:21,896
Still needs to be perfectly
executed.

686
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,164
You know, excuse me if I don't
think

687
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,565
we're the men for that job.

688
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:27,134
So it's fear of failure?

689
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,203
- Amongst other things.
- Like?

690
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:30,071
I don't wanna go to jail,

691
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,572
and I don't wanna get shot.

692
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,974
Both distinct probabilities.

693
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:35,076
- What if we're caught?
- By who?

694
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:36,978
I suppose by whose job
it is to catch criminals

695
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,379
- who steal money.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

696
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:40,815
We know these people.

697
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,350
They couldn't catch a cold

698
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,152
in a freezer wearing wet sponge
pajamas.

699
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,821
Fuck off, buddy.

700
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:47,588
Get outta here.

701
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:52,360
Okay, let me pose this hypo.

702
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,263
What if I was in a position
to guarantee success?

703
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:56,496
Do you have a ring?

704
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,365
That you could put on and
become invisible?

705
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,933
'cause I love that, love that.

706
00:39:58,966 --> 00:39:59,934
That's the spirit.

707
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:00,935
- What then?
- I still wouldn't do it.

708
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:04,505
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong.

709
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,007
- It's wrong?
- It's wrong.

710
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,874
It's wrong?

711
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,377
Casi!

712
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,178
You can't ignore this, Casi.

713
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:13,714
- Wake up to your disease.
- Go home.

714
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:16,217
You're diseased as am I,

715
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,785
as are the majority of the
schmucks

716
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:19,120
who come herding through that
meat grinder

717
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:21,222
- of so-called justice.
- What disease is that?

718
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,757
Poverty is the medical term,

719
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,926
- also known as slavery.
- Oh, slavery now.

720
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,060
Yes, because in this world,

721
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,361
you have money or money has you?

722
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:30,298
And we both know what
category you fall into.

723
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:33,401
- You're dying.
- I'm 26, bitch.

724
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,468
It should serve as not
the slightest consolation

725
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:38,306
that your disease is in a
temporary remission, okay?

726
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,740
It's drug money, Dane.

727
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,810
- Blood money.
- So what?

728
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,112
Nobody cares where the money
comes from,

729
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,647
just what it can do.

730
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:48,049
Think about it Casi,

731
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,651
I'm offering you a cure here.

732
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:52,887
- What, to my disease?
- Yes.

733
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,790
Look, I'm dying too, all right.

734
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,658
And the worst part is not
knowing what you have.

735
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,760
I don't know if it's brain
cancer,

736
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:02,663
a gunshot or a fucking
Acme safe to the head.

737
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:05,733
All I know for sure is it's
coming, okay?

738
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,901
It's fucking coming.

739
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,336
Then go climb Kilimanjaro or
something.

740
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,770
Go find yourself-

741
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,272
- Do I look like a
fucking dilettante to you?

742
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,307
- No.
- This is it, man.

743
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:15,076
This is our chance.

744
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,279
Our chance to carve our
names across the back ass

745
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,313
of the universe.

746
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:22,083
Legacy time.

747
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:26,120
Now, are we reaching in to this
wormhole

748
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,089
that the universe has opened up
for us

749
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:33,828
and pulling out 15 million
tax-free dollars or what, huh?

750
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,850
- Oh, you been busy lately.
- Jesus.

751
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,620
And I see some red lights
blinking.

752
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:02,223
What the fuck are you talking
about?

753
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:05,159
- Your friend.
- I have lots of them.

754
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:07,028
Well, this one's a public
defender,

755
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:09,930
and your defender.

756
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,207
- He was worried about me.
- What do you mean?

757
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:22,309
After you dragged me with
the sample to the Golem,

758
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,512
I got tossed by NYPD

759
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,979
- on my way home.
- The fuck?

760
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:27,081
With my priors, I had no
choice but to cooperate.

761
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:28,716
- Look, I told them everything.
- The fuck!

762
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,052
- But the dates.
- You fucked me.

763
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:32,219
Are you listening to me?

764
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,020
I'm gonna do you like the
other girl.

765
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,321
I lied to them.

766
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:36,057
- They think it's next week.
- I don't wanna do.

767
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,359
What did you say?

768
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:43,697
- What did you say?
- Hey, what did you,

769
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,366
what did you say?

770
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,168
That you gave them a head fake?

771
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:47,935
You killed her?

772
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,842
Jesus, I knew it,

773
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,310
I knew you were a psycho.

774
00:42:58,813 --> 00:42:59,647
No.

775
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,784
Well, I handled my side of
things,

776
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,787
and you handled yours.

777
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,217
Whoa.

778
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,318
You should see the
other guy.

779
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:40,087
- Dale.
- Something like that.

780
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,591
What's up?

781
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,192
I'm liminal down there on a
new proof.

782
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,364
See if you can help a guy out.

783
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,736
Batteries, candles, canned
gazpacho.

784
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,240
This is quite an apocalypse-y
list you have here.

785
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:01,775
Does it have something to do
with that ripple of yours?

786
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,445
Let's just say that I hope you
know

787
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,213
how to use that thing.

788
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:11,685
I took fencing junior year.

789
00:44:13,988 --> 00:44:14,889
It was pass, fail.

790
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:18,192
I passed.

791
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:24,533
- Just get this stuff.
- I will.

792
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,834
Mm-hmm.

793
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:44,553
Hello?

794
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:46,655
Golden boy, bad
time?

795
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:47,656
How'd you get my number?

796
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,658
'Cause I'm a fucking
detective.

797
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,158
Heard you spoke to my informant.

798
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:52,693
Anything I should know?

799
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:53,562
Beyond the continued existence

800
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:55,896
of client attorney privilege?

801
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,632
You are no longer her lawyer.

802
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:00,034
First of all, I'm sorry, what a
shock!

803
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,135
Neither of those things are
true.

804
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,572
Second, remember you vouched for
her.

805
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,040
Any part of that story
turns out to be bullshit.

806
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,875
Or that little lady of
yours does something stupid,

807
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:11,045
and that dope ends up on
the street, it is on you.

808
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:14,649
You'll be responsible for any
of the damage that she does.

809
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:16,016
You got it?

810
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,418
Now, get the fuck off my phone.

811
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:29,557
36th Street.

812
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:30,424
36th Street.

813
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,694
Step aside and let 'em off.

814
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,263
Attention, passengers.

815
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:38,600
This line is no longer in
service.

816
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,669
Due to a city-wide power outage,

817
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,771
this line is no longer in
service.

818
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:47,474
Please move safely and
swiftly to the nearest exit.

819
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:48,510
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:53,147
- This your stop?
- No.

821
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,618
Safely and swiftly,
ladies and gentlemen.

822
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:57,752
It's a power outage.

823
00:46:57,786 --> 00:46:59,621
Line's out of service.

824
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:06,160
No one likes to admit it,

825
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:09,129
but people love the danger
of nights like this.

826
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:11,832
People or you?

827
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:17,404
Five bucks?

828
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:28,817
How do I look?

829
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,884
All we need is a baseball
bat and a grocery cart,

830
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:32,587
and we can go shopping right
now.

831
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:35,889
This is me.

832
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:38,425
Okay.

833
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:44,031
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, shoot.

834
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,501
What do you get out of it?

835
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:51,171
What?

836
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,709
Defending people like me.

837
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:59,581
Ah, I mean there's so much.

838
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:00,414
The shit pay.

839
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,883
The professional disrespect.

840
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:05,486
In all honesty, I have a
masochistic side that believes

841
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,623
everyone deserves a
second chance, even you.

842
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:13,494
- Okay.
- Okay.

843
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:14,361
Great.

844
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,363
Well, thank you.

845
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:22,269
Night.

846
00:48:24,572 --> 00:48:26,574
What, you're not coming?

847
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:38,952
There's some candles in the
kitchen, under the sink.

848
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:39,821
Okay.

849
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,780
How'd you get that?

850
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,314
Looks like a burn.

851
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:44,117
Pot of water on the oven.

852
00:49:46,554 --> 00:49:47,956
I used to get nosebleeds.

853
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,123
It's embarrassing.

854
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:52,794
Like a humidifier.

855
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,564
Foster family I lived
with used to do that.

856
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,300
Must've hurt.

857
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:04,973
Not as much as seeing
my mother get dragged away

858
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,341
and sent back to Columbia
for putting it there.

859
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:10,512
I'm sorry.

860
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:22,590
That mountain, at the tow
pound,

861
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,094
it's not real, is it?

862
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:39,172
I know you lied to them, the
cops.

863
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:42,342
I know the auction's on
Saturday.

864
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,278
It's not Wednesday like you
testified.

865
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,983
Lea, look, what I don't
understand is

866
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:50,752
how you can think you can play
all sides

867
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:52,219
without getting hurt.

868
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:53,922
I don't care how smart you are.

869
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:56,189
Since when do lawyers
stalk their clients?

870
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,091
You're way in over your head.

871
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:04,699
Go back to Winston, and
just say the dates changed.

872
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:08,536
No.

873
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,039
You're a part of this, aren't
you?

874
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,439
The exchange.

875
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:13,608
You told me to protect myself.

876
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,709
I'm doing the best I can.

877
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,209
But you know

878
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:18,546
what will happen the second
Craig gets his cash, right?

879
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,413
You know.

880
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:23,785
Come clean on this.

881
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:26,888
And then what?

882
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:29,757
Go back to a dead end job and
blow my boss for a pension

883
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,892
that'll never pay off?

884
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,028
Maybe I just quit.

885
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:35,964
Let a whole new crop of
people sit in judgment

886
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:37,832
of my criminal record and reject
me?

887
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:39,934
Fuck that.

888
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:46,574
If I am what everyone
already thinks I am, then

889
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:47,775
excuse me

890
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:48,810
if I'm just thinking
the only future I have

891
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,277
is one I take for myself.

892
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:55,315
I tell Winston if you won't.

893
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,151
I don't think you will.

894
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:00,287
How do you know?

895
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:03,958
Because you don't think
I deserve any of this.

896
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:08,295
And you wouldn't be
here if you didn't care.

897
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:11,331
Just help me, Casi.

898
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:22,175
Sorry.

899
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:29,517
Hey, that's my wallet.

900
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:31,786
Yeah, so it is.

901
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,624
Hey, Casi, huh?

902
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,860
Hey, you know who I am,
Mr. Public Defender?

903
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:41,529
Huh?

904
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:47,501
No?

905
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:49,436
I know you,

906
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,204
you better not be trying to
get in the middle of something

907
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:53,440
that has nothing to do with you.

908
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,175
For her sake.

909
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,010
- No.
- No?

910
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:02,944
You realize it's
not a fencing sword, right?

911
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:07,247
Yeah, client gift.

912
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,618
My first trial victory.

913
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:13,521
The samurai used it to
protect the innocent.

914
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:15,288
Now, I use it as a wall
decoration.

915
00:54:18,126 --> 00:54:19,093
What am I doing?

916
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,898
It's six am, you tell me.

917
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:26,934
The time and temperature sign

918
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:29,269
on the building outside
the courthouse this week.

919
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:31,639
You know what the temperature
was?

920
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:34,809
- Hot.
- 150 degrees.

921
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:40,181
And how am I the only person
who noticed this is broken?

922
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:44,819
Maybe it's not the clock
that's broken.

923
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:48,222
You're familiar, I'm
sure, with singularities.

924
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:51,324
And not the man merges
with computer singularity

925
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,629
as rehearsed by Kurzweil
and other futurists, but,

926
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:04,005
but singularity involving
the laws of physics.

927
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:07,942
Yes, somehow my law school
missed that.

928
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:09,944
Okay.

929
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,413
Picture a star turning into a
black hole

930
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,448
which happens from time to time.

931
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,318
It starts to shrink,

932
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:21,923
the pull of gravity
accelerating until nothing,

933
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,391
not even light can escape.

934
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,196
And what is at the
center of that black hole

935
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:29,697
into which we can't see?

936
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:32,066
A singularity.

937
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:35,903
Give that man a steak.

938
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,541
The universe is collapsing.

939
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:45,012
Suddenly, and all around
us, too much matter.

940
00:55:46,214 --> 00:55:47,715
And you're seeing signs of it.

941
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,618
Right.

942
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,520
That isn't the first spliff
you've had tonight, is it?

943
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:55,723
I'm telling you, things
that used to have no mass,

944
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:58,159
now, suddenly do.

945
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,695
Like punishments that don't fit
the crime.

946
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,101
Laws, Casi.

947
00:56:08,736 --> 00:56:10,838
People like to think they're
fixed,

948
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:14,308
be it in physics or that
courthouse of yours.

949
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:17,879
It comforts them to know
what props up their world.

950
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:21,182
Especially, when they see it
falling apart, all around them.

951
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,518
Like you, my friend.

952
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:30,191
And whatever it is, it's
scaring you, don't let it.

953
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,666
One can break the law, my
friend,

954
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,101
and still believe in justice.

955
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,055
Okay, I'm in.

956
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:03,524
In what?

957
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:07,460
You know, that brainstorm of
yours.

958
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:10,865
I'm a man of many storms of
the brain.

959
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,733
It's like fucking Jupiter in
here.

960
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:13,868
Which one again?

961
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,403
You're fucking with me, right?

962
00:57:17,138 --> 00:57:18,039
Ah.

963
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,540
You know what, forget it.

964
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:20,374
This was a mistake.

965
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:21,776
You're an asshole.

966
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,044
All right, all right.

967
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,211
All right, all right.

968
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:25,079
I'm an asshole.

969
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,952
So what's the plan, huh?

970
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:33,220
We sneak into the tow
pound,

971
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:35,890
replace the NYPD trackers with
our own.

972
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,291
And follow Lea to the Golem.

973
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:42,997
She doesn't know yet,
but she'll get her cut.

974
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,864
Asshole.

975
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:48,769
And we'll make sure
those drugs never end up

976
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:49,637
on the street.

977
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:15,495
Hey.

978
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:40,688
Hey.

979
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:45,226
Eagle two taking flight.

980
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:51,198
Eagle one landed yet?

981
00:58:55,236 --> 00:58:56,537
Eagle two getting worried.

982
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:01,308
Eagle's in his nest.

983
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:02,443
Shut the fuck up, Dane.

984
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,213
Okay, first
vehicle

985
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:09,216
on the block is a 2006 Honda
civic.

986
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,419
Fair condition, but bidder
beware,

987
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:14,155
the bloodstains might not
be able to come out, okay?

988
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:15,356
We'll start at 15.

989
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,515
Hey, you're the guys from
Narcotics?

990
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:42,116
Yeah.

991
00:59:42,149 --> 00:59:43,884
She's been missing since last
Friday.

992
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:45,786
- Boyfriend?
- Big time weirdo,

993
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,588
small time dealer.

994
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,091
Thought you guys might
know him, Craig Bayonne.

995
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,972
You still thinking about my
offer?

996
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:05,840
Every night.

997
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:10,978
Do I hear 2,750 anyone?

998
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:13,914
2750, all right,

999
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:15,616
I see someone in the back.

1000
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:16,917
Can we go higher?

1001
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:17,751
What about three?

1002
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:19,954
Three, anyone three, huh?

1003
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:22,056
No, all right.

1004
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:24,925
Going once, going twice, 2,750
sold

1005
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,795
to my man over there
with the hat, all right.

1006
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:28,629
Next.

1007
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:43,444
Next.

1008
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:47,516
Excuse me.

1009
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,183
Help, my car was towed.

1010
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:52,019
It's on the wall there,
in 96 different languages.

1011
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:53,287
It's kind of pointless

1012
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,523
if you guys don't speak
every one of the 96.

1013
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:55,956
License and registration.

1014
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,159
It's a rental, the
contract's in the car.

1015
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:04,665
Not an easy task for you in
this little glass box of yours.

1016
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:06,467
Must feel like a prison in
there.

1017
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:09,670
Not that you've ever been to
prison.

1018
01:01:10,572 --> 01:01:12,973
- Do I know you?
- No, I doubt it.

1019
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,643
I have that kind of face.

1020
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,179
Resting asshole face.

1021
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:19,213
Bring that around the corner,

1022
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:20,314
and bring the paperwork back to
me

1023
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:21,315
and we'll get you processed.

1024
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,350
Ooh, I love getting processed.

1025
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:48,876
I don't know.

1026
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,044
Sure as shit something though.

1027
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:53,013
Shit.

1028
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:56,116
- Tow pound?
- Yup.

1029
01:01:57,918 --> 01:02:01,656
Next, we have a 2015 Lincoln
Navigator.

1030
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,558
Black, excellent condition.

1031
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:05,359
We're gonna start the bidding at
15.

1032
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:06,727
Can I get 15?

1033
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,663
Right up front for my decisive
gentleman,

1034
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:10,331
15 right off the bat.

1035
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:11,198
All right.

1036
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,669
Here she is.

1037
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:15,537
Oooh, yo.

1038
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,815
Can I get 16?

1039
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:30,851
16 from the gents in the back.

1040
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,953
- Do I hear-
- 17 grand.

1041
01:02:32,987 --> 01:02:34,623
Sir, you need to hold your
paddle up.

1042
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:36,023
Your paddle up, sir.

1043
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:42,697
18 from the back.

1044
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:44,231
Can we get 19?

1045
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:46,900
19 from my friend upfront.

1046
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:50,304
- 25.
- 25,000, all right.

1047
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:51,573
Can we go higher?

1048
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:53,073
Can we get 26?

1049
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,311
26, anybody?

1050
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:59,079
40 fucking grand.

1051
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:00,881
Sir, you understand-

1052
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:02,717
- Come on, just say it, all
right?

1053
01:03:02,751 --> 01:03:04,918
Going once, going twice, sold.

1054
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:08,088
Okay, $40,000, going once,
going twice.

1055
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:08,989
60,000.

1056
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:19,133
Ah, thoroughly processed.

1057
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:24,238
- Let me guess, Sagittarius.
- Seriously?

1058
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:27,107
What, you don't believe in
the great astrological arts?

1059
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:29,076
Only what they tell
me about guys like you.

1060
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,845
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- Run.

1061
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:41,690
Okay.

1062
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:45,993
If we're gonna do this,
let me just warn you,

1063
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:48,028
I will dedicate myself almost
exclusively

1064
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:50,799
to achieve the removal
of one of your eyeballs.

1065
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,099
Now, this will be done
without consideration

1066
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,436
of my own safety or the
result of this combat.

1067
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,404
Are you willing to live with
that, sir?

1068
01:04:03,977 --> 01:04:06,347
Hey, what are you doing in
here?

1069
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:14,121
I thought we were keeping a
low profile.

1070
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,724
- I know they're here.
- Who?

1071
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:18,158
The guys whose stuff
we're trying to shanghai.

1072
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:20,894
Right fucking outside now.

1073
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:22,697
Please, don't tell me they
outbid you.

1074
01:04:22,731 --> 01:04:25,165
Who knew I needed to
roll with 60 fuckin' Gs?

1075
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:29,002
Give me your driver's license.

1076
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:30,304
Huh?

1077
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,271
You heard me, give me
your driver's license.

1078
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:38,178
Take this, and wait in the
room around the corner.

1079
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,748
What are you gonna do?

1080
01:04:39,781 --> 01:04:41,181
Earn my million.

1081
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:48,122
Thank you.

1082
01:04:56,598 --> 01:04:58,265
Anyone else here from the
auction?

1083
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,772
Can I have your license
please, Mr-

1084
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:04,639
- Ballena.

1085
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,080
Sorry, it doesn't look like-

1086
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:14,849
- It's here.
- Don't worry, I'm sure.

1087
01:05:14,883 --> 01:05:16,116
This happens all the time.

1088
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:19,621
Let me just check with my guys
in the lot.

1089
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,008
Eagle One, what the
fuck happened to you?

1090
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,210
Remember when I said
the strong eats the weak?

1091
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:51,946
I just ran into the thing
that eats everything.

1092
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,847
I have no idea what that
means.

1093
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,214
All right, it doesn't matter.

1094
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:55,617
It's over, they know.

1095
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,518
The Mexican cartel?

1096
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:57,384
Fucking Lea and Bayonne.

1097
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:58,920
And that big whale, he has...

1098
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:03,791
Dane, what Mexican cartel?

1099
01:07:03,825 --> 01:07:05,425
The dudes who lost the heroin.

1100
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:08,796
And they won the auction, I
think.

1101
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,731
- Goddamn.
- Guess they weren't

1102
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,131
as in the dark as we thought.

1103
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,867
Are you fucking kidding?

1104
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:15,737
- I'm done, I'm done.
- Take a deep breath.

1105
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,238
Casi, Casi, hey, hey, hey
we can still salvage this.

1106
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:19,541
This we're not prepared for.

1107
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:20,742
The last time I fucking bled
like this,

1108
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,677
- I had a paper cut.
- And you gutted it out.

1109
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,678
Fuck you, Dane.

1110
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:24,879
- Fuck you.
- Okay, just breathe.

1111
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:25,914
Take a deep breath.

1112
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:26,915
Maybe not through your nose.

1113
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:28,348
Take a breath, okay?

1114
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,723
Okay, looks good.

1115
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:36,591
Thanks.

1116
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:45,399
Can I help you?

1117
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:48,335
Yes.

1118
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:52,406
Oh fuck, here he comes.

1119
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,273
Fuck.

1120
01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:02,584
No no no no.

1121
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:05,085
Start the car, start the car.

1122
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,895
Start the car!

1123
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,462
Goddammit, I lost my
car!

1124
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:39,152
You, that Navigator better
still fucking be here.

1125
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:51,966
They're close.

1126
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:55,603
Shit, I think they pulled over.

1127
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:05,980
I thought you said no one
carries.

1128
01:09:06,014 --> 01:09:07,314
Yeah, guns.

1129
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:08,616
This here is 10,000 volts

1130
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,652
of grade A certified reptoid
repellent.

1131
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:15,089
Don't fuck this up for me,
Craig.

1132
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:18,026
You realize we can call
this thing off, right?

1133
01:09:18,059 --> 01:09:19,326
That's still an option.

1134
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,160
An option?

1135
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:21,963
What are you, David Lewis?

1136
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:23,931
Professor, formerly of
Princeton,

1137
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:26,801
and recently admitted into
the great nothing, philosophy,

1138
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,636
- know him?
- David Lewis, okay, sure.

1139
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:29,704
Didn't think so.

1140
01:09:29,737 --> 01:09:31,204
But surely, you know Leibniz,
right?

1141
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:33,541
And his concept of many possible
worlds

1142
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:35,143
as alluded to in Voltaire's
"Candide."

1143
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,343
And Dane, I know Lewis too.

1144
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:37,477
What's your point?

1145
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:38,680
My point is,

1146
01:09:38,713 --> 01:09:41,448
if we accept his form of
modal realism as true,

1147
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,217
and we agree that we could
just walk away from our plan,

1148
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:45,820
then we must acknowledge

1149
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,623
that there is a world out there
where you and I do pussy out

1150
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:49,524
and go home.

1151
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:50,792
But that means-

1152
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,093
- There's world where we don't.

1153
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:53,761
Okay.

1154
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:57,532
Oh shit.

1155
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:42,476
All right.

1156
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:46,047
Are we doing this or what?

1157
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,097
I mean, it's kind of annoying

1158
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:04,632
to think there's someone
out there that looks like me

1159
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:06,266
who goes around calling himself
Casi, who comes this close

1160
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:09,036
to achieving the perfect
heist, then bails.

1161
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,872
All right, fuck that guy.

1162
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:13,440
I mean, even if there's only
one of all possible worlds

1163
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:16,944
in which we succeed,
shouldn't that we be us?

1164
01:11:24,519 --> 01:11:26,521
Leave the key and the opener
in the car.

1165
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:51,979
All right.

1166
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:58,318
What is that?

1167
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:00,855
- What is what?
- That.

1168
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:01,956
I thought we said no guns.

1169
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,490
This, it's not a gun.

1170
01:12:03,524 --> 01:12:05,293
Oh, it looks like a fuck ton
of gun.

1171
01:12:05,358 --> 01:12:07,528
You told me to get tear gas.

1172
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,263
Yeah, like canisters, so we
can roll.

1173
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:11,199
We're taking out literally
one guy, not Falluja.

1174
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:13,768
It's exactly the same effect,

1175
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:15,368
plus it looks badass as shit.

1176
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:16,436
- Dane-
- Appearances matter.

1177
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:19,040
- We are not using this.
- We are.

1178
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:19,874
We are.

1179
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:21,341
Look in my eyes.

1180
01:12:21,374 --> 01:12:24,411
Look in my plastic eyes.

1181
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:27,380
Colin fucking Powell.

1182
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:28,850
Colin Powell what?

1183
01:12:28,883 --> 01:12:32,352
Clear objective, overwhelming
force, exit strategy.

1184
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:36,624
You brought two of the three,
I completed the trinity.

1185
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:38,059
Now, if you have another way

1186
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:43,130
to neutralize our wildcard
lizard worshiper, I am all ears.

1187
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,688
Okay, we're good then.

1188
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:16,297
Wait here.

1189
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:36,449
We're all good to go.

1190
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,831
Okay, this should
lead them right to it.

1191
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,604
- Someone spot it?
- Even Better

1192
01:13:57,805 --> 01:14:00,908
It looks like Lea Deleon
had a change of heart.

1193
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,825
Craig, I'm pretty sure they
counted it.

1194
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:19,927
Like I trust the guy
dressed like a vampire

1195
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:22,763
on the hottest day of the year.

1196
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:24,265
No offense.

1197
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,533
When we leave, you can go.

1198
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,035
Yeah.

1199
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:46,988
- Give me the keys.
- I can drive.

1200
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:48,622
The fuck you will.

1201
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,871
See what the fuck is going on.

1202
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:18,819
- Keys.
- Craig.

1203
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,054
- Now!
- Craig.

1204
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:23,457
Come on.

1205
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:38,973
Fuck it.

1206
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:40,741
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1207
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:42,209
- What are you doing?
- We're going in.

1208
01:15:42,243 --> 01:15:43,744
Wait a minute.

1209
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:45,880
Two minutes ago, and you wanted
to abandon ship, remember?

1210
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:48,517
Just because it's taking a
little longer than expected,

1211
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:51,352
now you wanna fucking storm the
beaches.

1212
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,020
You said it yourself.

1213
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:54,355
Colin fucking Powell.

1214
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:57,425
Fuck yeah.

1215
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:27,955
Fuck you, bitch.

1216
01:16:27,988 --> 01:16:31,692
Where do you think you're going,
huh?

1217
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:37,765
- Now, freeze motherfuckers!
- Yes!

1218
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:34,321
No, don't puke.

1219
01:17:34,355 --> 01:17:36,357
DNA, DNA is the evidence.

1220
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,292
- Is he dead?
- He's dead.

1221
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:39,160
Go.

1222
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:43,831
You boys have no reason to
hold me.

1223
01:17:43,864 --> 01:17:45,332
Well, we are,

1224
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:48,369
until you tell us why you bought
that Navigator for $60,000.

1225
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,937
Sight unseen.

1226
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,005
We're almost to it.

1227
01:17:58,412 --> 01:17:59,813
Get off of her right now.

1228
01:18:04,752 --> 01:18:06,854
Damn if you don't bring
the idea of public defender

1229
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:08,122
to a whole new level.

1230
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:09,423
I would do what he says.

1231
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,460
I said, get up!

1232
01:18:13,494 --> 01:18:14,828
I swear to God.

1233
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:15,896
Now, get the fuck up.

1234
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:21,536
Help her.

1235
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,243
- Okay, I got you.
- Thanks.

1236
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,586
You know how I knew
we were being overrun?

1237
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:41,989
Lady Justice, it's like
a CT scan of everything

1238
01:18:42,022 --> 01:18:43,357
that's wrong with America.

1239
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:46,695
One set of laws for the slaves,

1240
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:50,431
one for the slavers.

1241
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:03,110
You've seen it,

1242
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:05,980
haven't you?

1243
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,114
There it is.

1244
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:25,687
You know, I kinda feel sorry

1245
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,722
for the other Casi and
Dane who didn't make it.

1246
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:30,525
Fuck 'em.

1247
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,395
Fuck 'em.

1248
01:22:01,155 --> 01:22:02,590
You're welcome.

1249
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:21,643
I guess I chose well.

1250
01:22:23,177 --> 01:22:24,011
Just not me.

1251
01:22:44,532 --> 01:22:45,999
Thanks for second chance.

1252
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:58,847
Hey, make it count.

1253
01:23:00,682 --> 01:23:02,517
You too.

1254
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,301
I'd say I'm surprised
to see you back here,

1255
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:57,805
but it's too late in the
day for me to fake it.

1256
01:23:57,839 --> 01:23:58,640
Go ahead.

1257
01:23:58,673 --> 01:24:00,207
Tell me your tale of woe.

1258
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,209
My client pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

1259
01:24:02,242 --> 01:24:04,846
Mr. Gartrell is an honor
student at Bronx Science,

1260
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:08,248
a good kid, and sitting on
his stoop before sundown

1261
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:09,751
is not a good enough reason

1262
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:12,419
for an arresting officer to
fracture his orbital socket.

1263
01:24:12,452 --> 01:24:14,689
The defendant resisted
arrest, Your honor-

1264
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:16,658
- It's not illegal to ask a
police officer

1265
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:18,560
why he's demanding your ID.

1266
01:24:18,593 --> 01:24:20,227
I left the copy of my
Fourth Amendment home,

1267
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,897
but you should take my word for
it.

1268
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:25,533
There's the 220 marijuana
possession.

1269
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:29,169
A civil violation that
deserves a fine, rightly so,

1270
01:24:29,202 --> 01:24:32,540
but it was also discovered
after he was beaten.

1271
01:24:34,107 --> 01:24:36,176
My office will be filing a
wrongful imprisonment suit

1272
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,779
against the city at the very
least.

1273
01:24:37,812 --> 01:24:40,582
Are the other attorneys in
your little firm like you?

1274
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:46,420
It's just me at the
moment, but I'm hiring.

1275
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:47,387
If you know anyone.

1276
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:52,827
Mr. Gartrell, I'm gonna
ask you this one more time.

1277
01:24:53,895 --> 01:24:56,463
Your lawyer, recently
reinstated,

1278
01:24:56,496 --> 01:25:00,233
perhaps suffering some
residual enmity at this bench

1279
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:04,072
for his much deserved and long
vacation.

1280
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:07,041
And yet, still shouting into the
wind,

1281
01:25:07,075 --> 01:25:09,142
is taking your case to trial.

1282
01:25:10,845 --> 01:25:13,548
If that doesn't fill you
with complete confidence,

1283
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:16,784
now is your chance to
speak on your behalf.

1284
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:23,958
Like he said, not guilty.

1285
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:30,330
- People.
- People request $25,000 bail

1286
01:25:30,364 --> 01:25:32,299
and electronic monitoring.

1287
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:34,401
I can't, how am I gonna pay
that bail?

1288
01:25:34,434 --> 01:25:35,670
What'd I tell you?

1289
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:39,172
That legal fund you were
talking about?

1290
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:40,775
Yeah.

1291
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,309
Bail's fine, Your Honor.

1292
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,176
I got you.

1293
01:25:44,277 --> 01:25:46,179
Court sets the bail at 25,000,

1294
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:49,017
plus electronic monitoring
and house arrest.

1295
01:25:50,183 --> 01:25:51,019
Couldn't be this easy.

1296
01:25:51,052 --> 01:25:52,553
It must be a dream, Counselor.

1297
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:57,892
Just the best of all
possible worlds, Your Honor.

versus Antonio Guiterriez.

1300
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:08,368
What happens now?

1301
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:12,239
We go to trial and we win.
