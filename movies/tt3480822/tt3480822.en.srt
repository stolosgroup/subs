00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,609
Hey, Nat!

3
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,682
We're both upside down.

4
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,934
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

5
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,644
No, you will.

6
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,439
You can't hold it much longer.

7
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,860
Told you you'd fall down first.

8
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,322
I told you! I told you!

9
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,950
Told you so!

10
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,412
Mommy!

11
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,505
What happened?

12
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,424
She fell on her knee.

13
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,551
- Oh, you bump your knee?
- Mmm-hmm.

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,844
Oh...

15
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,807
Kiss it better. There we go.

16
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,936
Oh, come on, little one.

17
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,729
Get up. You're okay.

18
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,899
Come on. You're a brave girl.

19
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,610
Your pain only makes you stronger.

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,196
- Right, you?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,507
- Yeah?
- Look!

22
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,491
Forest stars.

23
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,778
Yeah. You know what?

24
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,579
Those are actually
part of the Lampyridae family.

25
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,291
And the glow, the glow that you see,

26
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,920
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

27
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,631
bioluminescence.

28
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,716
Come on, time for dinner.

29
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,094
Bio-goomin-feasants?

30
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,638
"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

31
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,516
Dinner!

32
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,852
Come on, dinner, big girl!

33
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,897
I want mac and cheese.

34
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,693
Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,778
caviar and champagne.

36
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,780
Grab the napkins.

37
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,324
You take this. Thank you.

38
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?

39
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,708
Okay.

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,686
Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.

41
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,671
Dad's home!

42
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,967
Hey, Dad.

43
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,552
Hey, baby.

44
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,647
Everything okay?

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,903
How was everybody's day?

46
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,074
- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,785
- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

49
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,069
And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

50
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,122
That was my favorite part

51
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,248
- of the whole day.
- No.

52
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,768
Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.

53
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,793
How long do we have?

54
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,463
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

55
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,009
I don't wanna go.

56
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't say that.

57
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,393
Girls...

58
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,023
you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

59
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,903
- Today's the day.
- Yay!

60
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,866
All right, let's go.

61
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,818
- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,069
- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.

64
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,803
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

65
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,222
- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?

66
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,765
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

67
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,777
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

68
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,619
- You have it?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,830
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

70
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,301
Where are we going?

71
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,261
Home.

72
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,722
Mommy, you're silly.

73
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,473
We just left home.

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,653
I want my song.

75
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,117
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie

76
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,289
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry

77
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,835
Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye

78
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,256
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die"

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,594
"This'll be the day that I die"

80
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,959
Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

81
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,253
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

82
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,879
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

83
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,141
Come on. Honey, honey.

84
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,327
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

85
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,831
- Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!

86
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,064
Okay. Seat belts.

87
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,985
Okay.

88
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,128
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

89
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,872
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

90
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,530
Mom?

91
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,791
Mom!

92
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,795
I need you up here.

93
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,257
- Okay.
- Okay.

94
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,301
I need you to pull right.

95
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,057
Mom, you've got blood on you.

96
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,225
It's okay, baby.

97
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,954
Hit the accelerator there.

98
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,173
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

99
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,802
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

100
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,303
Let's count together.

101
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,931
45, 50...

102
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,737
Pull back.
You can do it!

103
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,948
Pull back.
All your strength.

104
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,870
Okay.

105
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,129
Get up, Mommy.

106
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,508
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

107
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,727
The Red Guardian returns.

108
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,355
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

109
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,567
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

110
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,778
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

111
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,946
I wanna get back in it.

112
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,490
General Dreykov,
it's been over three years.

113
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,972
Never let them take your heart.

114
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,625
Did you get it?

115
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,591
And the North Institute?

116
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,218
Ashes.

117
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,761
It's gonna be okay.

118
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,972
How is Melina?

119
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,432
She'll live. She's strong.

120
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,771
- Mommy?
- Mom?

121
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,898
- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

122
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,692
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!

123
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,402
- Daddy!
- Get away from her!

124
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,238
Don't touch her!

125
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,284
Don't touch her!

126
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,953
I will kill you all!

127
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,624
Honey.

128
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,897
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

129
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,051
I don't wanna go back there.

130
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,304
I wanna stay in Ohio.

131
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,056
You can't take her.

132
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,185
You can't.

133
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,978
She's only six.

134
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,345
You were even younger.

135
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,024
It's okay.

136
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,943
Come here.

137
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,655
You're gonna be all right.

138
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,386
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

139
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,042
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

140
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,253
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

141
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,090
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

142
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,359
That one, she has fire in her.

143
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,029
What was her name?

144
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,448
Natasha.

145
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,412
Ah... Natasha.

146
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,147
No!

147
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,077
Remove all the defects.

148
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,251
That one

149
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,003
and her.

150
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,588
No!

151
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,755
Yelena!

152
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,096
Take it! Take it! No!

153
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,647
No!

154
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,197
The Red Room is your home now.

155
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,616
Get off me! No!

156
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,889
Undercover spies in our communities.

157
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,725
They took on false identities,
even raised families...

158
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,472
- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has LOS!

159
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,308
We've got all exits covered.

160
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,477
All right. Stay alert.

161
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,312
I'm sending in alpha squad.

162
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,615
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the Sokovia Accords.

163
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,700
She assaulted the king of Wakanda.

164
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,160
Make an example out of her.

165
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,168
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

166
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,545
Do what?

167
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,547
Come after me.

168
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,900
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

169
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,718
Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.

170
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,555
'Cause from my vantage point,

171
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,014
it's the federal fugitive

172
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,266
who's desperate.

173
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,394
From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.

174
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,354
What is this, your second triple bypass?

175
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,731
I wouldn't worry about me.

176
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,150
We got Barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

177
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,111
the incredible shrinking convict.

178
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,989
Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.

179
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,615
Where you gonna go?

180
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,118
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

181
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,871
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

182
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,540
Romanoff?

183
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,526
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

184
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
Her tracker, sir.

185
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,383
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

186
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,888
I have sights on collateral one.

187
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,352
Firing in place of three.

188
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,145
Five, four...

189
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,233
She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

190
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,944
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

191
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,270
Oksana.

192
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,732
Oh, no.

193
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,692
What did I do?

194
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,652
Free the others.

195
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,247
Yelena, we need a status report.

196
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,629
Yelena,
we need a status report.

197
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,804
Converge on team leader.

198
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,062
General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.

199
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,649
Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?

200
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,966
Smile.

201
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,666
You're in my bed.

202
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,793
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

203
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,229
Did you get everything on my list?

204
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,467
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

205
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,054
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

206
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,847
Fanny Longbottom?

207
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,807
- What?
- What, are you 12?

208
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:14,561
That is a legitimate name.

209
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,022
We've got a generator outside.

210
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,293
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

211
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,117
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

212
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,072
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

213
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,283
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

214
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,952
Nice.

215
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,870
Are you okay?

216
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,163
Why wouldn't I be?

217
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,250
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

218
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,544
Ugh. It's fine.

219
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,327
I'm actually better on my own.

220
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,421
Are you sure?

221
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,173
Yeah.

222
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,950
Because you can tell me, you know.

223
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,810
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

224
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,721
I know. I have friends.

225
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,766
People who have friends don't call me.

226
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,899
And I don't pay you to worry.

227
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,332
Oh, hey.

228
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,626
What's all this junk?

229
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,880
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

230
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,798
Budapest?

231
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,967
Yeah. Budapest.

232
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,303
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

233
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,554
Budapest.

234
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,806
- It's "Budapest."
- Whatever.

235
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,185
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

236
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,788
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

237
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,939
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

238
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,610
You're not
a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

239
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,403
Why did you break up the encounter

240
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,512
with my pet python?

241
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,139
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

242
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,661
Moonraker 1
on preset launch program...

243
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,770
Oh, great.

244
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,396
...minus two minutes.

245
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,981
Retract crew access...

246
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,792
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

247
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,048
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

248
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,863
You're not here for me.

249
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,306
Oh, shit.

250
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,503
I know you're out there.

251
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,285
I know you know I'm out here.

252
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,586
Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?

253
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,713
'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

254
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,799
Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.

255
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,013
So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

256
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,725
Is that what we are?

257
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,779
Put it down before I make you.

258
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,030
You put yours down.

259
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,367
Watch your step.

260
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,722
Stay down. Stay down.

261
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,308
Stay down.

262
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,908
Stop.

263
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,557
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

264
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,482
I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.

265
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:47,361
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

266
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,782
Not bullets. Arrows.

267
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,033
Ah, right.

268
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,370
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

269
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,413
You brought it back here?

270
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,603
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

271
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,045
It's a synthetic gas.

272
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,589
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

273
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,466
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

274
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,630
from external manipulation.

275
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,010
Maybe in English next time?

276
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,785
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

277
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,935
They can explain it to you.

278
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,603
Tony Stark, maybe?

279
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,273
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

280
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,400
Great. Perfect timing.

281
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,652
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

282
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,820
I don't wanna be here.

283
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,239
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

284
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,991
Well, what was I supposed to do?

285
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:37,077
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

286
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,039
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

287
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,586
I kept checking the news,

288
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:50,174
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

289
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,345
What?

290
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,891
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

291
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,642
It's been gone for years.

292
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,644
Dreykov's dead.

293
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,188
I killed him.

294
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,440
You don't actually believe that, do you?

295
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,155
You really do believe that.

296
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:14,740
Dreykov's dead.

297
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,302
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

298
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,053
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

299
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,704
Tell me exactly.

300
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:22,664
We rigged bombs.

301
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,333
- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.

302
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,544
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

303
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,089
Simple as that?

304
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,177
Yeah, sure, "simple."

305
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,801
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

306
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,933
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.

307
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,144
Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.

308
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,896
And you checked the body?

309
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,648
Confirmed the kill?

310
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,986
There was no body left to check.

311
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,782
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

312
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,861
Where are we trying to get?

313
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,887
Motorbike! East side
of the building.

314
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,294
I got you!

315
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,007
No!

316
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,777
Hey.

317
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,987
Don't move. You're hurt.

318
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,364
Let me help you.

319
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,464
I don't wanna do this.

320
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,760
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

321
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,625
Do you believe me now?

322
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,545
How many others?

323
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,088
Enough.

324
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,973
Which one's yours?

325
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,478
Black. Brown seat.

326
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,522
Where are my keys?

327
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:20,986
Any day now.

328
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,880
You can't just steal a guy's car.

329
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,824
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

330
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,870
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

331
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,573
Okay, you got a plan,

332
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,199
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

333
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,766
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

334
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,202
That's a shit plan.

335
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,091
You're welcome.

336
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,647
Oh, shit. He's back.

337
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,286
Put your seat belt on.

338
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:35,662
You're such a mom.

339
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,112
Natasha, no.

340
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,323
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

341
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,285
No. Not now, trust me.

342
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,839
You okay?

343
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,717
Yeah. Great plan.

344
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,470
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

345
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,432
This is cozy.

346
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,185
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

347
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,936
That must have been fun.

348
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,064
Who the hell is that guy?

349
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,608
Dreykov's special project.

350
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,152
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

351
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,445
It's like fighting a mirror.

352
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,281
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

353
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,116
This doesn't make any sense.

354
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,745
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

355
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,873
What is that supposed to mean?

356
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,000
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

357
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,711
You killed her.

358
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,755
I had to.

359
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,716
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

360
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,651
We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.

361
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,705
His car is pulling up now.

362
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,576
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

363
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,413
I needed her to be sure.

364
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,187
Natasha, we clear?

365
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,418
All clear.

366
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,050
And here you are, not so sure.

367
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,719
I needed out.

368
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,028
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

369
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,196
I have no idea.

370
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,116
He moves location constantly.

371
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:03,745
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

372
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,458
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

373
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,171
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

374
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,506
I mean, the clue is in the name.

375
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,966
Dreykov kills you,

376
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,886
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

377
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,387
Wait, what are the big ones?

378
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:24,933
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

379
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,605
Where did you think I was all this time?

380
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:36,695
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

381
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,115
And you just never made contact again?

382
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,159
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

383
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,870
Bullshit.

384
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,706
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

385
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,673
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

386
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,710
You weren't really my sister.

387
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,591
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

388
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,278
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?

389
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,763
The thing you do when you're fighting.

390
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,265
The... Like, the...

391
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,185
This thing that you do

392
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,395
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

393
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,022
with the arm and the hair.

394
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,525
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

395
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,151
It's a...

396
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:18,028
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

397
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,113
I'm not a poser.

398
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,115
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

399
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,952
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

400
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,119
all the time.

401
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,623
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

402
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,210
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

403
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,754
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

404
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,051
Well, then you were fooling yourself

405
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,556
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

406
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,934
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

407
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,311
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

408
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,831
That gas,

409
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,250
the counteragent,

410
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,169
it was synthesized in secret

411
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,005
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

412
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,550
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

413
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:25,554
and I killed the widow that freed me.

414
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,306
Did you have a choice?

415
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,267
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

416
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,813
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

417
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,191
They're two completely different things.

418
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,612
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

419
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,405
I'm still not sure.

420
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,875
- Is that all there is left?
- Mmm-hmm.

421
00:47:55,834 --> 00:48:00,047
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

422
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,134
He takes more every day.

423
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,095
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

424
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:08,542
Just like us when we were small.

425
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,642
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

426
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,185
The rest, he kills.

427
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,146
To him, we are just things.

428
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,567
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

429
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,488
Because there is always more.

430
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,325
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

431
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,118
Alexei?

432
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,330
"Dad."

433
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,927
Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?

434
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:52,766
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

435
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,271
What about you?

436
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,942
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

437
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,070
My parents still live in Ohio.

438
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,073
My sister moved out west.

439
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,157
Is that right?

440
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,868
You're a science teacher.

441
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,873
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

442
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,709
Your husband, he renovates houses.

443
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,170
That is not my story.

444
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,046
What is your story?

445
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:30,012
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

446
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,935
Did you ever wish for kids?

447
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,274
I want a dog.

448
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:49,948
Where you gonna go?

449
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,700
I don't know.

450
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:56,455
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

451
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,123
so I guess anywhere.

452
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,465
- Don't.
- Don't what?

453
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,092
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

454
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,177
I can feel it.

455
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,096
Speeches aren't really my thing.

456
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,181
Huh.

457
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,558
It was more like an invitation.

458
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,187
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

459
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:21,813
Yeah.

460
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,233
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

461
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:26,360
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

462
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,569
Yeah.

463
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,572
That sounds like a shitload of work.

464
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:31,949
Yup.

465
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,954
Could be fun, though.

466
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,373
Yup.

467
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,422
I saw where he put the keys.

468
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,009
Top drawer, green cabinet.

469
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:03,021
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

470
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,606
I've ever bought for myself.

471
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:07,985
That?

472
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,570
Yeah. You don't like it?

473
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,280
Is that like a...

474
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,365
Is it army surplus, or...

475
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,992
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

476
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,703
But I use them all the time,

477
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:20,080
and I made some of my own
modifications.

478
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,874
- Oh, yeah?
- Whatever.

479
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,251
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

480
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,713
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

481
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,548
I want to do things.

482
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,508
Hmm...

483
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:32,968
I like your vest.

484
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,846
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

485
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,139
It's good. Yes. I like it.

486
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,684
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

487
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,875
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

488
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,984
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

489
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,987
But I think I know somebody who does.

490
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,155
Oh, yeah? Who?

491
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,490
We're gonna need a jet.

492
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,619
I said we needed a jet.

493
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,538
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

494
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,290
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

495
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,018
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

496
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,043
Like a real pro.

497
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,450
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

498
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,426
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

499
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,131
- not to your liking?
- Ha!

500
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,883
Don't let her wind you up.

501
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,469
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

502
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:19,473
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

503
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,892
You, too, huh? Tag team.

504
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:25,145
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

505
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,772
Where's the rest?

506
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,613
Voilà.

507
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,448
Ooh.

508
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,214
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

509
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,496
How is it?

510
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,874
It's dry.
It's really dry.

511
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,519
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

512
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,135
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

513
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,846
all my prices go up.

514
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,049
What's that supposed to mean?

515
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,185
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

516
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,313
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

517
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,399
I'm a private contractor.

518
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,402
You are sensitive.

519
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,112
You're a very annoying individual.

520
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,241
- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

521
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,160
That's what you say every time.

522
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,627
So, I have the nuclear code.

523
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:34,256
But there he is.

524
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,969
- Captain America!
- America.

525
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,267
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

526
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,645
I grab hold of his shield

527
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:54,526
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

528
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,825
Oh... Oh, no.

529
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,703
Oh...

530
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,207
That guy think he going to beat me.

531
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,876
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

532
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:13,837
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

533
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,173
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

534
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,540
and I push him out the window.

535
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,052
And I make my escape. Huh?

536
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,262
What year was this?

537
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,891
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

538
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:27,059
I know.

539
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:30,437
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

540
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,777
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

541
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,792
Oh, no.

542
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,961
Uh-oh.

543
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,464
Aw, look at the big bear.

544
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,299
Gonna cry, little girl?

545
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:14,166
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

546
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,444
Move to the door on the south wall.

547
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,318
Go left.

548
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:43,820
Just don't make a scene.

549
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,255
You made a scene, didn't you?

550
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,893
What now?

551
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,955
We're gettin' you outta here.

552
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,360
Go to the upper level.

553
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,131
Move your ass, super soldier.

554
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:57,686
He's never going to make it.

555
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,271
Get me closer.

556
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:01,815
You got a better idea?

557
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,029
Natasha.

558
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,209
Such a poser.

559
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,276
Seriously?

560
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:48,862
Whoo!

561
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,739
Sorry!

562
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,118
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

563
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,954
Back up!

564
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,790
We're both doing
a really good job.

565
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,926
No.

566
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,721
Okay. Enough of this.

567
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,364
Ha!

568
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,249
Whoa...

569
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,423
This would be a cool way to die.

570
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,470
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

571
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:56,763
Move your ass!

572
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,831
Get us outta here!

573
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,625
Huh.

574
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,420
Wait!

575
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,115
Yes!

576
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,452
I need some help up here!

577
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,342
Oh, that was exciting.

578
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:02,556
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

579
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,143
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

580
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,312
Okay.

581
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,523
Ah...

582
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,150
Wow.

583
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,197
Okay.

584
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,283
Why the aggression, huh?

585
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,535
Is it your time of the month?

586
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:27,122
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

587
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,498
Or ovaries.

588
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,019
Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room

589
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,563
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

590
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:37,174
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

591
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:40,802
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

592
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,948
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

593
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:46,475
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

594
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,143
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

595
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,479
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.

596
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:56,860
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

597
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,614
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

598
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:02,282
Huh.

599
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,159
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

600
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:05,744
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

601
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,957
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

602
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:13,252
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

603
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,379
'Cause they treated me like family.

604
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,381
Really? Family?

605
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,842
Well, where are they now?

606
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,678
Where is that family now?

607
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,847
Tell me where the Red Room is.

608
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,977
I have no idea.

609
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,228
Okay?

610
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,860
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

611
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:39,027
- Dreykov?
- Yeah.

612
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,530
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

613
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,032
Gives me glory...

614
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,202
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

615
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:50,539
I could have been more famous
than Captain America.

616
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:54,126
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

617
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,711
Three years!

618
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,839
So tedious, boring me to tears.

619
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,260
No offense, huh?

620
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,763
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

621
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,449
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

622
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,143
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

623
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,954
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

624
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:14,372
and I say something casually about that.

625
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,397
Maybe, you know,

626
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,524
I want the Party
to feel actually like a party

627
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,068
instead of this sourpuss organization.

628
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,404
But instead, no.

629
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,574
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

630
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,868
He just runs off and hides, huh?

631
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,788
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

632
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,792
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

633
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,063
Can we throw him
out the window now?

634
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,065
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

635
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,090
All right.

636
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,112
Wait, Mom Melina?

637
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,138
We thought she was dead.

638
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:51,016
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

639
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,351
- Ew.
- What?

640
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:57,105
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

641
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,775
She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.

642
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:03,403
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?

643
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,822
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

644
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:07,741
Uh...

645
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:10,661
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

646
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:12,412
No, we're good. We'll make it.

647
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,039
Okay.

648
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,603
You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.

649
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,734
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

650
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,141
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

651
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,822
Natasha.

652
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,365
Natasha. Natasha.

653
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,451
Come here, I want to ask you something.

654
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,537
- Come, it's important.
- What?

655
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,626
Did he talk to you about me?

656
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,004
What?

657
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,175
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

658
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,485
Who? What are you talking about?

659
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,761
Captain America.

660
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,892
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

661
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,894
Not so much a nemesis.

662
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,979
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

663
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:21,499
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

664
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,567
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

665
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,277
and you're gonna ask me about you?

666
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,572
What is with this tension?

667
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,825
Did I do something wrong?

668
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,995
Is that a serious question?

669
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,248
I only ever loved you girls.

670
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:40,918
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

671
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,920
to achieve your fullest potential,

672
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,898
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

673
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,299
Yes. For you, yes.

674
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:51,428
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

675
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,973
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

676
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,350
the world has ever known.

677
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:00,479
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

678
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,606
And Natasha,

679
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,653
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

680
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,947
destroying empires from within,

681
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,282
but an Avenger.

682
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,161
You both have killed

683
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,705
so many people.

684
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,960
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

685
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,712
I couldn't be more proud of you.

686
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,468
Okay. You can... No.

687
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,387
Let go of me now.

688
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,347
You smell really bad.

689
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,229
So, are we there yet?

690
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,439
You'll know when we're there.

691
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,151
Slight right.

692
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:50,696
Straight on.

693
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,531
Right.

694
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:56,159
Slight right.

695
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,496
Oh, very good, my darling.

696
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:02,833
Yes, very good.

697
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,086
Yes, very good, my darling.

698
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:21,727
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

699
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,570
Honey, we're home.

700
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,500
Come on, girls.

701
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,304
Welcome to my humble abode.

702
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,723
Make yourself at home.

703
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,936
Let's have a drink.

704
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,452
Hey, no funny business.

705
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,873
I am putting away my weapon.

706
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:30,999
Are there
any booby traps around here?

707
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,250
Anything we need to know about?

708
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,914
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

709
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,819
You didn't raise us at all.

710
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,448
Oh, maybe so.

711
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:43,118
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

712
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,351
Let's drink.

713
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,437
Okay.

714
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:22,991
Still fits.

715
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,203
Oh, my God.

716
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:30,624
I never washed it once.

717
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,376
Come and drink.

718
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:38,340
Rise, you workers of salvation

719
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,220
Family

720
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,848
back together again.

721
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,642
- Mmm.
- Seeing as our

722
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:49,893
family construct

723
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,855
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

724
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:57,359
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

725
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,987
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

726
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:03,282
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

727
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:04,533
And, uh...

728
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,119
I want to say something
right off the bat.

729
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,413
You haven't aged a day, huh?

730
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,710
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

731
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,671
You got fat.

732
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,966
But still good.

733
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,886
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

734
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,366
- I have a lot of energy.
- Oh!

735
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,349
Please don't do that.

736
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,437
So, here's what's gonna happen.

737
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,022
Natasha, don't slouch.

738
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,900
- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.

739
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,984
I don't slouch.

740
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:40,336
You're going to get a back hunch.

741
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,671
- Listen to your mother.
- Oh, my God, this...

742
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:42,696
Up, up.

743
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,198
All right, enough. All of you.

744
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,116
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

745
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:47,844
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

746
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,013
Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

747
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,997
You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.

748
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,504
You know, it's like when you told them

749
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,714
that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

750
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:03,026
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls.

751
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,384
"Look out. Where is he?"

752
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:07,346
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

753
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:09,389
then you see he's there.

754
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,433
No, no. What? I want them

755
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,237
- to follow their dreams.
- No good.

756
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,354
Reach for the stars, girls.

757
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,023
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

758
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:22,069
You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.

759
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:26,114
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

760
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,616
Nor did you.

761
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:34,498
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

762
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,631
Come in.

763
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,515
Did that pig just open the door?

764
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,767
Yes. It did.

765
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,687
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

766
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:59,481
You named a pig after me?

767
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,859
You don't see the resemblance?

768
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,281
See, he sits just like dog.

769
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:09,700
Amazing. Now, watch.

770
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,267
It's a little weird, to me.

771
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,828
Stop breathing.

772
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:21,545
We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.

773
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,314
It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

774
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,592
Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.

775
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,444
In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,

776
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,346
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

777
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:36,185
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

778
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,769
Was the hub for cognition.

779
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:41,231
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

780
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,528
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

781
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,531
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

782
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,371
What are you doing?

783
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:00,167
Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

784
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,544
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

785
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,588
and has no choice but to obey.

786
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:06,355
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

787
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:09,301
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

788
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:12,054
11 more seconds without oxygen.

789
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,015
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

790
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:18,644
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

791
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,063
Good boy, Alexei.

792
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,858
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

793
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:29,404
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

794
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,698
And do you know who they test it on?

795
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,116
Hmm...

796
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,952
No. That's not my department.

797
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,912
Ah, come on, come on.

798
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,956
- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.

799
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:40,582
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

800
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:41,750
What were you?

801
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,561
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

802
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:44,687
You were his business partner.

803
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:46,064
No, no, no. I was patsy!

804
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,382
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

805
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,859
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

806
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,678
Shut up! You are an idiot.

807
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:58,767
And you're a coward.

808
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:02,729
You're a coward.

809
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:07,025
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

810
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:09,820
We're moving on.

811
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:12,322
Never family, huh?

812
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,158
In my heart, I am simple man.

813
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:19,329
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

814
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,540
I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?

815
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:25,169
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

816
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,005
Who cares? That wasn't real.

817
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,716
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

818
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,634
Don't say that.

819
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,721
Please don't say that.
It was real.

820
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,433
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

821
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,352
You were my real mother.

822
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:45,147
The closest thing I ever had to one.

823
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:49,109
The best part of my life was fake.

824
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:52,946
And none of you told me.

825
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,035
And those agents

826
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,829
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

827
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,458
That was me.

828
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:07,753
Mmm.

829
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:12,633
And you, you got out.

830
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,177
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

831
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,055
Are you gonna say anything?

832
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,601
No.

833
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,062
Don't touch me.

834
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,399
Yelena.

835
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:30,984
No.

836
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,324
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

837
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,368
I'll go talk to her.

838
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:57,928
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

839
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:00,764
Okay.

840
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,934
We, uh... We just sit.

841
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,274
We just sit.

842
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:20,993
Where are you going?

843
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,495
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

844
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,998
I wish I could believe that you cared.

845
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,001
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

846
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,295
No, you weren't abandoned.

847
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,422
You were selected by a program

848
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,507
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

849
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:47,144
I was taken?

850
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:51,064
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

851
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,109
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

852
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:57,196
She was like you in that way.
She was

853
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:58,906
relentless.

854
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,283
What happened to her?

855
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,745
Dreykov had her killed.

856
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,874
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

857
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,336
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

858
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,619
wouldn't warrant an execution,

859
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,381
but, as I said, she was relentless.

860
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,970
I thought about her every day of my life.

861
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:29,394
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

862
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:34,233
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

863
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,870
Then why did you save this?

864
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,723
I remember this day.

865
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,853
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

866
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,480
- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.

867
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,486
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

868
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:21,321
I wanted to open every single one...

869
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,536
so just for a second it would feel real.

870
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,496
Let's stop this.

871
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,547
Why you doing this?

872
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:43,635
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

873
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,430
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

874
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:49,099
four times before you were even born?

875
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:50,684
Those walls are all I know.

876
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,687
I was never given a choice.

877
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,398
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

878
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:02,029
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

879
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,952
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

880
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,085
Pain only makes us stronger.

881
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,005
Didn't you tell us that?

882
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,426
What you taught me kept me alive.

883
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,140
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

884
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,267
They'll be here any minute.

885
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:39,733
So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

886
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,945
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

887
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,404
Cold even for Russia, you know?

888
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,324
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

889
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,617
Please stop talking.

890
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,802
- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.

891
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:50,887
Please, I don't want to talk.

892
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,454
Please. Please.

893
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,791
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

894
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,460
I am reaching for fish.

895
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:02,923
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

896
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,007
Splash!

897
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,009
My hands go in the river.

898
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:10,180
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

899
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,351
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

900
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:15,644
Oh, my God.

901
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:20,607
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

902
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,276
How is this relevant?

903
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,361
You know,

904
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,154
fathers.

905
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:31,285
No. No.

906
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:35,455
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

907
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,835
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

908
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,503
To me?

909
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,756
To me, you were everything.

910
01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:50,804
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

911
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:53,724
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

912
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,144
as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

913
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,652
It's the Red Guardian.

914
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:06,904
Get out.

915
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:08,864
Get out!

916
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:20,876
I can't remember

917
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,881
If I cried

918
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,678
When I read about his widowed bride

919
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:36,934
Something touched me deep inside

920
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,268
The day

921
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:42,231
The music

922
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,483
Died

923
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,694
And they were singing

924
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,906
-Bye
-Bye

925
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,659
-Miss American Pie
-American Pie

926
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:56,745
Drove my Chevy to the levee

927
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,540
-But the levee was dry
-Was dry

928
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,459
Them good old boys

929
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,962
Drinking whiskey

930
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:07,881
Singing

931
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,261
"This will be the day that I die"

932
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,472
"This'll be the day..."

933
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:36,368
Get down.

934
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,210
They think...

935
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:46,438
I'm sorry.

936
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,540
Let's not keep him waiting.

937
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,068
Request clearance for landing.

938
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,655
Melina?

939
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,375
We're touching down in one minute.

940
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:46,123
Then why are we still going up?

941
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,795
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

942
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,709
My God.

943
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,419
Look at you.

944
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:18,382
So, uh,

945
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,592
how was the family reunion?

946
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,636
Oh, it was awful.

947
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:23,887
They were clingy,

948
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:26,098
and too emotional, and needy.

949
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:28,642
- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.

950
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,227
Yelena Belova.

951
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:32,104
What's the deal with her?

952
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,523
She was the only one affected, right?

953
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,233
As far as I know, yes.

954
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,361
These gasses and antidotes,

955
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:42,614
it's a pain in my ass.

956
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:46,159
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

957
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,578
Hmm. I have nine pigs

958
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,805
that will require attending to
in my absence.

959
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:52,040
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

960
01:28:58,255 --> 01:28:59,506
Cut her brain out...

961
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:03,010
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

962
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:15,105
This is a much less cool way to die.

963
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,490
Alexei.

964
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,001
What about Romanoff?

965
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,461
She's a traitor.

966
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:42,424
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

967
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,344
She had nothing.

968
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:49,306
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

969
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,100
Put that thing in her you do.

970
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,353
You know, uh, chemicals.

971
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:58,524
Turn her into one of your pigs.

972
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,654
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

973
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,281
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

974
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:09,868
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

975
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,413
no mask in the world can hide that.

976
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:28,470
Welcome home.

977
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,140
Now, now.

978
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,602
Don't go breaking my new toy.

979
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,772
Natasha.

980
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:42,943
I can't save us.

981
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,741
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

982
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:47,781
I pledged my life to a cause.

983
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:50,284
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

984
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,577
Possibly the bravest.

985
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:54,246
But I wasn't being brave.

986
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:55,956
I was coward.

987
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:03,213
In Cuba,

988
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:07,050
when they came
and took you away from me...

989
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,929
No cause is worth that.

990
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,851
You should only sacrifice yourself

991
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,270
for something...

992
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,988
How did you do that?

993
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,033
I designed these cells myself.

994
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:35,412
What?

995
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:38,248
What?

996
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:42,127
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

997
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:45,881
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

998
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,051
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

999
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:52,179
You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.

1000
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:53,347
What?

1001
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,519
What are you going to do to me?

1002
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:00,893
Outside right hip.

1003
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,217
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1004
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,385
Don't throw a fit.

1005
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:32,904
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

1006
01:32:32,928 --> 01:32:34,179
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1007
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:37,140
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

1008
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:41,979
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

1009
01:32:42,646 --> 01:32:45,566
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1010
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,776
You don't have earpiece.

1011
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:49,486
What?

1012
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:50,779
No, she can't hear you.

1013
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:52,386
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

1014
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:53,931
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1015
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:55,534
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1016
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:57,387
So, once we're inside,

1017
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:59,451
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1018
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:02,666
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1019
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,627
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1020
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:10,090
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1021
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:12,926
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1022
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,511
we can descend within the hour.

1023
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,263
Ah, problem.

1024
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,016
I only have one earpiece set.

1025
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:20,934
I'll give it to Yelena.

1026
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:22,722
Where did he take the vials?

1027
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:24,771
Probably down to cold storage.

1028
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,274
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,

1029
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:30,027
so you have to expose them
to this antidote.

1030
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:33,405
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1031
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:35,908
Is this your plan?

1032
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:37,701
My plan is to kill you.

1033
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:39,286
I'm alive.

1034
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,122
So, what do we do now?

1035
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,501
What was my mother's name?

1036
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,172
Ah...

1037
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,342
Where we buried her,

1038
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:55,844
there was a tree...

1039
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,888
Um...

1040
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,848
A pink blossom.

1041
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,725
Beautiful.

1042
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:03,644
And there was a tombstone

1043
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,438
with her name engraved on it.

1044
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:08,732
What was her name?

1045
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:10,317
Ah.

1046
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:16,031
"Unknown."

1047
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:20,369
You don't feel anything?

1048
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,914
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1049
01:34:24,081 --> 01:34:27,334
Is this your haunted past?

1050
01:34:29,419 --> 01:34:31,421
Really?

1051
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:43,642
Thank you, Natasha.

1052
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:50,482
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1053
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:55,320
Say hello.

1054
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:13,005
When your bomb exploded,

1055
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,716
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1056
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:23,307
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1057
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:25,809
In the back of her neck.

1058
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:28,187
Look at her.

1059
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,898
You find it difficult to look at her?

1060
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,150
I do.

1061
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,653
She... She watches everything

1062
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:38,739
and she can do it.

1063
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,325
She's a perfect mimic.

1064
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,246
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1065
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:52,503
Can she hear me?

1066
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,090
What?

1067
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:01,303
You want to make her feel better?

1068
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,933
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1069
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:11,146
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1070
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:15,692
But enough of all this bullshit.

1071
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:18,153
Go to work.

1072
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,364
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1073
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:24,159
Go.

1074
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,339
Well, that was a mistake.

1075
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:39,091
Was it?

1076
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:42,636
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1077
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:45,389
Try, then.

1078
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:46,765
Do it.

1079
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:53,063
Is the safety on?

1080
01:36:58,151 --> 01:36:59,152
No.

1081
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,825
Try your knife.

1082
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:06,785
Ah...

1083
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:14,877
You're in trouble.

1084
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:16,378
How are you controlling me?

1085
01:37:16,545 --> 01:37:18,589
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1086
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:20,632
Well, not yet.

1087
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:23,427
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1088
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,182
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1089
01:37:32,728 --> 01:37:35,397
I'm very upset with Melina.

1090
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:37,441
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1091
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:39,836
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1092
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,695
press buttons and hack computers...

1093
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:42,922
- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.

1094
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:44,048
There's nothing for me to do.

1095
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,867
I want to...
I want to break something.

1096
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,951
Oh, you do?

1097
01:37:49,703 --> 01:37:52,331
Oh, there is something you can break.

1098
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,932
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1099
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,769
Ah, damn it.

1100
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:28,575
That was disgusting.

1101
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:43,131
Okay.

1102
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,656
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1103
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:12,870
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1104
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:17,708
Oh, no, no, no.

1105
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:26,550
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1106
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:27,718
Pathetic, huh?

1107
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,553
Yeah, what would you call it?

1108
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,947
- I would call it...
- When was the last time

1109
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:32,407
that you had a conversation with somebody

1110
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,266
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1111
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:37,394
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1112
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:41,315
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1113
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:43,066
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1114
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:44,443
You hid in the dark.

1115
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,405
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1116
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:50,991
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1117
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:52,492
You're nothing.

1118
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:54,786
- Hmm.
- You have nothing.

1119
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:56,872
There are 50 people on this planet...

1120
01:39:57,039 --> 01:39:58,290
Oh, stop it.

1121
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,084
Don't tell me to stop!

1122
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,171
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1123
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,259
Come on.

1124
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:11,261
Think I can't take a punch?

1125
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,429
Oh.

1126
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:17,434
- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?

1127
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,913
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1128
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,563
That's enough.

1129
01:40:31,657 --> 01:40:33,283
You wouldn't be so glib

1130
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:37,120
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1131
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,333
I own this world. Me.

1132
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,252
You seem desperate to impress me.

1133
01:40:43,418 --> 01:40:44,753
I don't need to impress you.

1134
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,422
I don't need to impress anyone.

1135
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:51,802
These world leaders, these great men,

1136
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,472
they answer to me and my widows.

1137
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:00,310
Look at them.

1138
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:04,815
These girls were trash.

1139
01:41:05,941 --> 01:41:08,026
They are thrown out into the street.

1140
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:11,780
I recycle the trash.

1141
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:13,824
And I give them purpose.

1142
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,452
I give them a life.

1143
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:26,920
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1144
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:30,299
I've had a slight setback.

1145
01:41:32,384 --> 01:41:34,094
You'll need to get to the widows.

1146
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:55,199
It's my network of widows

1147
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:58,410
that help me control the scales of power.

1148
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:02,831
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1149
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:07,085
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1150
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:10,380
My widows can start and end wars.

1151
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:13,342
They can make and break kings.

1152
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:19,890
You control all of that from here?

1153
01:42:20,641 --> 01:42:22,518
And with you,

1154
01:42:23,185 --> 01:42:26,230
an Avenger under my control,

1155
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:30,067
I can finally come out of the shadows

1156
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:35,948
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1157
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:38,909
Girls.

1158
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:51,588
All from that little console?

1159
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:53,549
Yeah.

1160
01:42:57,886 --> 01:42:59,638
Oh, you find this amusing?

1161
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,473
Why are you smiling?

1162
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,184
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1163
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,564
Thank you for your cooperation.

1164
01:43:09,022 --> 01:43:13,235
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1165
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:15,946
you won't be able to take it from him.

1166
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:19,491
For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1167
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:21,493
in all widows, even me.

1168
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,248
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1169
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:28,041
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1170
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:29,668
Not enough.

1171
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:31,545
This is basic science.

1172
01:43:31,712 --> 01:43:34,965
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1173
01:43:35,132 --> 01:43:37,176
you have to sever the nerve.

1174
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:40,345
I can handle that.

1175
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:43,640
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1176
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,268
I'll have to finish it myself.

1177
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:48,395
What are you going to do?

1178
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:51,648
Sever the nerve.

1179
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:16,465
Melina!

1180
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:29,489
Precisely what I was thinking.

1181
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:43,867
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1182
01:44:44,034 --> 01:44:47,354
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1183
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:51,375
Fantastic.

1184
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,043
I'm heading to the widows now.

1185
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:55,546
No.

1186
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,751
We have to go.

1187
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,718
Not so talkative now, are you?

1188
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:45,470
You took my childhood.

1189
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:49,641
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1190
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,888
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1191
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,867
Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1192
01:46:07,034 --> 01:46:09,203
Make her suffer.

1193
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:12,831
I don't wanna hurt you.

1194
01:46:13,415 --> 01:46:14,833
You don't wanna hurt me.

1195
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:10,073
Hey.

1196
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:11,769
Are you okay?

1197
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:13,869
That looks like it hurts.

1198
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:16,246
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1199
01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:18,415
I'm sorry.

1200
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:26,364
Get as far away
from here as possible.

1201
01:48:27,132 --> 01:48:28,717
You get to make your own choices now.

1202
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,979
We gotta get outta here.

1203
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:42,290
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1204
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:43,524
I'm right behind you.

1205
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,534
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1206
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,825
Yes!

1207
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,509
Do you see the girls?

1208
01:50:36,386 --> 01:50:37,387
No!

1209
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:11,839
We need to go back.

1210
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:40,784
We've lost control.

1211
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:06,310
Antonia.

1212
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:11,315
No!

1213
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:14,318
I'm gonna open the door.

1214
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,945
You're gonna come after me.

1215
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:19,323
It's okay. It's okay.

1216
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,619
I know you're still in there.

1217
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:28,457
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1218
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:43,866
Yelena!

1219
01:53:45,409 --> 01:53:46,910
She's on the wing!

1220
01:53:47,077 --> 01:53:49,454
Move! What are you waiting for?

1221
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:51,999
Don't do it!

1222
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:54,626
This was fun!

1223
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:55,836
No!

1224
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:45,320
Okay.

1225
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,031
Let's go.

1226
01:56:02,838 --> 01:56:04,089
Enough.

1227
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:56,892
I'm sorry.

1228
01:56:57,059 --> 01:56:58,477
I'm sorry.

1229
01:57:01,688 --> 01:57:03,273
Is he gone?

1230
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:09,071
He's gone.

1231
01:57:26,713 --> 01:57:28,090
Yelena!

1232
01:57:38,934 --> 01:57:40,227
Yelena?

1233
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:49,152
We're both upside down.

1234
01:58:04,168 --> 01:58:05,603
I should've come back for you.

1235
01:58:05,627 --> 01:58:06,795
You don't have to say that.

1236
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:08,172
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

1237
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:10,299
It was real to me, too.

1238
01:58:24,563 --> 01:58:25,564
Thank you.

1239
01:58:40,662 --> 01:58:41,788
Everybody good?

1240
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:44,374
I am clearly injured.

1241
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,711
You got something to say?

1242
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:50,088
I'd just mess it up.

1243
01:59:04,436 --> 01:59:06,355
Here comes the cavalry.

1244
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,777
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1245
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:16,448
So, what's our plan?

1246
01:59:17,366 --> 01:59:19,952
You guys go. I'll stay.

1247
01:59:20,118 --> 01:59:22,079
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1248
01:59:22,162 --> 01:59:24,098
- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.

1249
01:59:24,122 --> 01:59:25,808
We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1250
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,001
- You guys, go.
- Oh, my God.

1251
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:30,921
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1252
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:33,507
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1253
01:59:33,674 --> 01:59:34,967
Little bit.

1254
01:59:35,133 --> 01:59:39,054
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1255
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,765
I know how much you like it.

1256
01:59:41,932 --> 01:59:43,725
Shucks.

1257
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,060
It does have a lot of pockets.

1258
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:47,229
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1259
01:59:48,355 --> 01:59:50,524
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1260
01:59:50,691 --> 01:59:52,568
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1261
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,990
but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

1262
02:00:14,756 --> 02:00:16,675
You came back for us.

1263
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,810
Thank you.

1264
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:33,108
Hey.

1265
02:00:33,775 --> 02:00:36,570
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1266
02:00:36,737 --> 02:00:37,863
Don't worry. I got this.

1267
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,489
I know.

1268
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,794
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1269
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,797
Come. Come with us.

1270
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:31,602
You ever not sleep?

1271
02:02:32,769 --> 02:02:36,148
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

1272
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:37,608
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1273
02:02:37,774 --> 02:02:40,235
What, are you scrapping together
some parts?

1274
02:02:40,402 --> 02:02:43,947
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1275
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,413
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

1276
02:02:57,419 --> 02:02:59,046
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

1277
02:02:59,213 --> 02:03:01,840
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

1278
02:03:03,091 --> 02:03:04,259
I'm impressed.

1279
02:03:04,426 --> 02:03:06,094
Well, yeah.

1280
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,348
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

1281
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,017
That's what every man wants to hear.

1282
02:03:12,809 --> 02:03:13,977
Where you gonna go?

1283
02:03:15,312 --> 02:03:17,981
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

1284
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:20,317
Turns out I got two, so...

1285
02:03:20,817 --> 02:03:22,253
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1286
02:03:22,277 --> 02:03:25,072
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

1287
02:03:25,572 --> 02:03:28,075
see if I can't help patch things up.

1288
02:11:14,917 --> 02:11:17,252
Come on, Fanny.

1289
02:12:35,998 --> 02:12:38,500
Wow. Sorry.

1290
02:12:39,585 --> 02:12:41,920
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1291
02:12:44,423 --> 02:12:47,259
What this woman did,

1292
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:50,262
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1293
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,516
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1294
02:12:54,683 --> 02:12:56,185
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1295
02:12:56,268 --> 02:12:58,812
I'm just here paying my respects.

1296
02:12:58,896 --> 02:12:59,980
Hmm...

1297
02:13:00,397 --> 02:13:02,691
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

1298
02:13:06,028 --> 02:13:07,070
Okay.

1299
02:13:07,237 --> 02:13:08,322
I want a raise.

1300
02:13:08,488 --> 02:13:09,823
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1301
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,451
