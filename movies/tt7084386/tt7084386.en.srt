2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Papa?

3
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,875
Papa!

4
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,583
What?

5
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,875
It's Tweety. He's gone again.

6
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,083
Okay.

7
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,750
Tweety? Tweety?

8
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,833
Mama?

9
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,750
Hey, last three boys
to breakfast,

10
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,291
toilet cleaning duties for a week.

11
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,517
Oh my God! Venegas!

12
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,916
Oh! Oh!

13
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,041
- And, and, and...
- Whoo!

14
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,166
Goal!

15
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,666
<i>Oye! </i>I just mopped that floor.

16
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,500
Guys, no soccer in the house.
I already told you.

17
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,041
No respect, huh?

18
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,833
Becca, you can't expect street kids
to learn manners overnight.

19
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,708
You've had 20 years to learn, Omar.

20
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:56,958
Mmm. Okay.

21
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,017
Okay, I gotta go into the city
to pick up some things for the truck.

22
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,083
Need anything?

23
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,416
Eggs and a few onions.

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
Eggs? I just bought eggs.

25
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,166
Should I stop feeding the kids
then? I didn't know that was an option.

26
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,690
I'm just saying, eggs are expensive.

27
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,291
I mean, maybe we can find
something cheaper to feed them.

28
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,666
How about sand?

29
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,291
See, that's what I love about you.

30
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,583
You're a problem solver.

31
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,625
Hey, Tweety.

32
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,541
- Hey, Papa Omar.
- Hey, <i>mijo</i>.

33
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,375
<i>Mijo, </i>um...

34
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,541
you can't keep running away, <i>mijo</i>.

35
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,833
I know it's hard.
Your mom's not coming back.

36
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,791
Hey.

37
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,416
You wanna know what helps me
when I'm having a hard time?

38
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,541
A nail?

39
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,500
This isn't just some nail.

40
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,041
This is a miracle nail.
Do you wanna know how it works?

41
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,041
Mmm, okay.

42
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,166
Okay, so,
when I'm struggling with something,

43
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,958
you know, I just... I write it down
on a piece of paper, okay?

44
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,500
And then I just take this nail,
and I hammer it up against the door.

45
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,583
And pow!

46
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,083
God hears me every time.

47
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,916
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah. I mean it. I mean it.

48
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,541
Next time you're having a hard time,

49
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,500
you just pray to God,
ask him for help, and pray hard, okay?

50
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,333
And pretty soon, all that bad stuff,

51
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,208
it'll start to feel like a dream.

52
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
Like it never happened.

53
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,083
I never seen you hammering notes anywhere.

54
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,958
Do you want the nail or not?

55
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,416
I mean, I guess.

56
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,541
All right. Just take it.
Come on. Go. Yeah. Go play.

57
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,541
Why don't you get in the truck?

58
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,208
I'll be back, okay? I'll be right back.

59
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,833
- Omar.
- Berto.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,625
<i>Este huerco, </i>pretty sure he's an orphan.

61
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,208
Caught him down at the marina
stealing some <i>gringo </i>fisherman's watch.

62
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,500
- Mmm.
- Trying to get it back for him, <i>sabes?</i>

63
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,708
You know how these kids are.
Thought maybe he'd talk to you.

64
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,416
I'll talk to him.

65
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,166
Did you hit this kid?

66
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
I questioned him.

67
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Hey, you already ate, I'm sure,

68
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,833
<i>pero </i>my wife, Becca,
made some chilaquiles.

69
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,392
And I'm not gonna lie,
they were a little crispier than I like,

70
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,541
and the cheese
was a little saltier than usual.

71
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,958
But, nah, you probably
don't even like chilaquiles.

72
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,375
Yeah.

73
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,333
Even if you did, it would be hard for you
to eat 'em with that watch in your mouth.

74
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,250
All right, the way I see it,
you got one of two choices.

75
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,416
You can either come with me
and return the watch and apologize,

76
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,541
or you can go with Officer Berto.

77
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,833
I want my chilaquiles.

78
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:08,916
Mmm.

79
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,041
I'm Omar, but the boys call me Papa Omar.

80
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,500
I ain't calling you "papa," <i>güey.</i>

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay. So, what's your name?

82
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,833
Moco.

83
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,083
Like...

84
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,166
...boogers?

85
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,755
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

86
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,333
Okay, Moco.

87
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,875
You know, you could join us.

88
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,250
- Join you?
- Yeah. At Casa Hogar.

89
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,666
I could really use your help
with the younger boys.

90
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,625
I ain't no babysitter.
I only look out for myself.

91
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,625
- Mmm. By stealing.
- Stealing is bad.

92
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,500
So is interrupting, <i>escuincle.</i>

93
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,916
Out of curiosity,

94
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,333
what were you gonna do with that watch?

95
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,583
- I was gonna sell it, <i>güey.</i>
- Mmm.

96
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,375
I want some Nikes.
Nice ones with the red laces, <i>a huevo.</i>

97
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,541
With a matching red hat. <i>Bien padre.</i>

98
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,083
Oh, sounds like you're trying
to impress the wrong people.

99
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,625
What you know about it, <i>fresa</i>?

100
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,750
All I'm trying to say is,
if you wanna make your life better,

101
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,833
you gotta do what you know is right
every single day.

102
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,375
I mean, no matter what anybody thinks,
even when it's hard.

103
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,458
And that is how you get ahead.

104
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:27,125
<i>Sí. </i>And maybe if I work really hard,

105
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,375
I'll be able to drive around the orphans
in a broke-down truck like you.

106
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,875
I want blue Nikes.

107
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,625
There is a calling inside every man.

108
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,958
In his heart. A call to greatness.

109
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,541
Now, most men,
they don't follow that call.

110
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,833
They pretend it isn't there.

111
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,458
They drown it out with game shows,
or quarterly reports,

112
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:03,625
or kids' Little League baseball games,
but that's not you, is it, Greg?

113
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,416
You follow that call.
I can tell that about you.

114
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,125
It's Gary, actually.

115
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,041
Yeah. Well, I can tell you right now

116
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,833
that you're the kind of person
that likes to stand out.

117
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,500
You see those trophies there?

118
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,875
Those are first-place trophies
from the Bisbee Black & Blue,

119
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,083
the most prestigious fishing tournament
in the world.

120
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,125
And you know what
those trophies tell people?

121
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,541
- That you're a good fisherman.
- Mm-mm.

122
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,708
Those trophies tell people

123
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,083
that I am the best
at whatever I choose to do.

124
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,166
That I'm a winner.

125
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,041
Now, isn't that the message
that you're trying to send, hmm?

126
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,791
Isn't that why you're here today?

127
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,500
So that you could catch
one of those big blue marlins

128
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:51,166
and mount that beast on the wall
behind your mahogany desk, huh?

129
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
- Am I right?
- That's right.

130
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:57,708
Now, while those other hedge fund managers
are eating dragon rolls

131
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,291
or working on their golf game,

132
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:03,166
you're gonna be able to strut
into that conference room Monday morning,

133
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
and you're gonna be able to say, "Hey!"

134
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:10,208
"I did battle with that leviathan
this weekend, and I won."

135
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,458
"What'd you do?"

136
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,041
Huh?

137
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,125
That's money in the bank.
You understand what I'm saying?

138
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,125
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

139
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,125
- I do.
- You ready to do this?

140
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,750
This is it. This is exactly it.

141
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,142
- This is what I want.
- All right.

142
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,041
I need you to sign this.
I'm gonna get you a pen.

143
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,875
Now, look, I take full payment upfront.

144
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,583
And I'm... I'm guaranteed
to take home a marlin, right?

145
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,875
I will give you the best odds of anybody
in Cabo. How about that?

146
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,750
Right, right. I just mean that...
'Cause I heard that some other captains,

147
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,166
you know, they... they can guarantee
that I take home a marlin,

148
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,541
you know, whether or not we catch one, uh...

149
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,750
Well, for more money, of course.

150
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,916
Wait. You want me to get you a fish
that somebody else caught?

151
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,726
- Well, I mean, just like you said...
- I don't do that.

152
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,750
- It's about perception.
- That would be cheating. I don't do that.

153
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,833
- Okay, I'm sorry. Forget it.
- I need... Get off my boat.

154
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,916
- Can we just...
- Get off my boat, Gary.

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,250
Forget I said that. Okay? Just forget...

156
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,726
- Get off my boat, Gary.
- All right, all right. Please.

157
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,875
Get... Get off the dock, Gary!

158
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,083
Get back to your country club!

159
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,833
That's him.

160
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,458
Excuse me.

161
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,208
- Not interested.
- What?

162
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,708
Whatever you're selling,
you're hassling the wrong<i> gringo.</i>

163
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,708
"Oh Captain. My Captain"?

164
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,791
Give me that.

165
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,291
You keep that punk off my boat.

166
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,208
Hey, man. He returned the watch.

167
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,051
If you just give him a chance
to apologize...

168
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,000
He also pissed in my favorite coffee mug.

169
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,291
He... He'll get you a new mug.

170
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,916
Let me tell you something.

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,416
You can return the watch,

172
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,041
you can replace the mug,
but you can never ever un-drink urine.

173
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Hey.

174
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,083
Hey, look, man. I'm trying to teach
this kid about owning his mistakes.

175
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,541
So if you could just
let him apologize, man. I really...

176
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,000
You better get out of here.

177
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
Storm's coming.

178
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,508
<i>Big development
this afternoon.</i>

179
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,833
<i>We told you yesterday that Hurricane Odile
was heading west out into the Pacific.</i>

180
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,601
<i>According to reports,</i>

181
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,875
<i>it looks like the storm
has changed directions</i>

182
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>and is actually heading right towards us,
probably reaching land later tonight.</i>

183
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,125
<i>And with winds up to 100 miles per hour,</i>

184
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>they're saying this could be
the biggest storm we've seen in decades.</i>

185
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:57,500
<i>So buckle up, Cabo San Lucas,
because it looks like we're in for a ride.</i>

186
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,625
I'll serve you more when I come back,
okay? But I have to serve everyone.

187
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,500
- Hey, Wiki, you kept count? He kept count.
- Why are you asking Wiki?

188
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,142
- He's smart.
- He's not smart, I'm smart.

189
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,267
- You know the definition?
- My name's Wikipedia.

190
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,208
<i>Caray.</i> Tuna again?
I'm growing fins eating in this place.

191
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,166
Hey, Geco, I'm right here.

192
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,166
<i>Oye,</i> beats eating from a dumpster, <i>verdad?</i>

193
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,625
Technically, this is mackerel.
A close relative of tuna.

194
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,375
"Technically, this is mackerel."
Ain't nobody cares, freak.

195
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,583
Hey! He ain't a freak, <i>baboso.</i>
But for real, Wiki, nobody cares.

196
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,875
Okay, okay. <i>Atención!</i>
All right. Listen up, guys.

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,333
It is time to earn your keep.
As some of you guys have heard,

198
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,726
there's a storm that's
gonna reach the coast in a few hours

199
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,625
and it's gonna hit us
a little later tonight.

200
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,916
But there's nothing to be scared of.

201
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,708
But Casa Hogar is our home,
so we have to do our part to protect it.

202
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,958
That's why I've got good news,
and I've got great news.

203
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,101
We never have to eat mackerel again?

204
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,958
The good news is we're gonna skip chores
today to prepare for the storm.

205
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,750
The great news is we just received
a donation of 500 sandbags.

206
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,625
So after we get done eating,

207
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,708
we can line them up around the building
to protect from flooding.

208
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,625
You think that carrying bags of sand
is great news to us?

209
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,958
<i>Oye,</i> we're orphans, not idiots.

210
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,743
He looks like
he has a "narcolupes," <i>güey.</i>

211
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,500
Do you mean narcolepsy?
And no, I don't think so.

212
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,916
<i>Sí, güey.</i> He's like those goats
that pass out when they get scared.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,291
I ain't scared, <i>idiota.</i>

214
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,434
I just don't wanna stare
at your ugly face all night.

215
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

216
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,833
But we're all safe here.<i> Verdad, </i>Omar?

217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,041
Yeah, that's right.

218
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,125
But what about Chico and Burro?

219
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,208
What, <i>mi amor?</i>

220
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,625
They're his little street friends.
They live under a tarp.

221
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,166
<i>Caray. </i>A tarp<i>?</i>

222
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,375
<i>Oye,</i> Tweety, your friends
are on a magic carpet ride right now.

223
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
Geco.

224
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,083
For real though.
There are a lot of kids out there.

225
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,416
I mean, it doesn't seem fair
that we get to be in here

226
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,541
while they have
to be on the streets, <i>verdad?</i>

227
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,250
I mean, why did we get so lucky?

228
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,875
Well, maybe we ain't.

229
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,851
- What does that mean, <i>güey?</i>
- I mean, as far as I can tell,

230
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,475
there ain't a lucky person in this room.

231
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,541
Geco.

232
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,375
Maybe God just wanted to get

233
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,583
all the unluckiest kids into one building
so he could crush us all at once...

234
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,976
Yeah, Geco...

235
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,625
Papa!

236
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,708
Oh, watch out for the glass, guys.

237
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,958
<i>- Ay, caray. </i>That's really disappointing.
- What?

238
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,875
The mackerel didn't get ruined.

239
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,208
<i>Caray.</i>
How are we gonna play soccer?

240
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,791
- We don't even play soccer.
- We do play soccer.

241
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:22,916
I'm the best one here.

242
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,666
No. I'm... I'm way better.

243
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,208
Maybe we can fix this,
and then we can one-v-one.

244
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,570
I turned off the breakers.

245
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,101
I'll keep the kids

246
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,458
out of the standing water.

247
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,333
- How much food do we have left?
- Hello?

248
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,642
- About a week.
- This is Tweety.

249
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,333
Maybe two with the cans in the shed.

250
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,456
- Yeah, he's right here.
- Who is it, Tweety?

251
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,875
<i>- Sí.</i>
- We can fix this.

252
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,000
It's for you.

253
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,166
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

254
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,291
Hello, this is Omar.

255
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,875
Oh, hello, Mr. Castillo.

256
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,666
Yes, sir. I meant to call you back,
but it's just been d...

257
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,083
Yes, I did get the letters.

258
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,041
What does that mean?

259
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Geco.

260
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Hi.

261
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,500
All right, you guys hang here.

262
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,708
Wiki, what's the Bisbee?

263
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,750
Bisbee Black & Blue.
The world's biggest fishing tournament.

264
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,291
Best teams in the world
compete for millions in prizes.

265
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,684
Bisbee's Black & Blue's
never canceled in 30 years.

266
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,500
We're not gonna start now.
Storm or no storm.

267
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,103
Yeah, yeah. I've got him here.
He's just finishing another call.

268
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,125
- Yeah, okay. Just hold on one sec.
- Yeah.

269
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,708
- Forget about the website.
- Hey, Omar. The kids okay?

270
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,583
Oh, yeah, they're great, they're great.
What... What's going on here?

271
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,666
Oh, you know, the storm just scared away
some of our international teams,

272
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,458
and so my brother decided to waive
the entrance fee for the local fishermen,

273
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,666
which makes my life...

274
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,958
That's why I'm calling you myself,
so you can hear it directly from me.

275
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,250
The tournament will proceed as planned.

276
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,541
Tricia, I can come back if...

277
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,625
- Give me Fitzpatrick's cell number.
- No, hold on.

278
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,375
Omar, what do you need?

279
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,125
We have flooding in the house.

280
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,125
You know, if we could borrow a bilge pump,

281
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,958
it'd be really... We'd appreciate it.

282
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,416
Bilge pump? I mean, yeah. Sure, of course.
Let's go talk to Quique.

283
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,250
I really hate to ask you this, but...

284
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,208
Omar, is everything okay?

285
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,625
What do you mean? What's going on?

286
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,333
I was wondering
if you could talk to the bank for us.

287
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,416
The bank?

288
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,250
We just need a little more time
to pay what we owe.

289
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,125
And if you could put in a good word
at the bank...

290
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,750
How much do you owe exactly?

291
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,291
$117,000.

292
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,250
Oh boy.

293
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,500
Okay. All right.
Well, how much time do you need?

294
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:29,125
They... They gave us 30 days,
but, uh, we lost some donors and...

295
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,555
- I'll look into it and see what I can...
- How's the storm?

296
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,583
- Oh no.
- Oh.

297
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,375
A little late.

298
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,875
Wade?

299
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,541
Hey, Biz. Feels like old times.

300
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,208
Only you're older and fatter.

301
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,208
Wade, old buddy, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you don't qualify for this list.

302
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,916
What are you talking about? The radio said
no entry fees for local captains.

303
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,833
Local fishermen.
You're from San Diego, Wade.

304
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,500
You cannot be serious.

305
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,208
That was 25 years ago.

306
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,416
Well, just look at this list.

307
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,416
Do you see anybody on this list
that's won the Black & Blue twice?

308
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,541
Do you? Well, there's me.

309
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:17,000
Hey, anybody in this room
won the Black & Blue twice?

310
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,208
What about anybody in this room
ever won it even once?

311
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,208
Anybody in this room? Hmm?

312
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,916
- No? No?
- Let's go see Quique about that pump.

313
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,309
- Come on.
- Oh, that's odd.

314
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,916
That makes me the only name on that list.

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,083
And you know why?

316
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:36,208
Because I am the only person on the planet
to ever win it two years in a row.

317
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,291
Look, Biz...

318
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,735
I know that we've had
our differences over the years,

319
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,831
and I think I apologized
for the fireworks incident.

320
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,375
- No, you didn't.
- Then well...

321
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,041
We have always respected each other
as captains.

322
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,333
And I'm gonna level with you.

323
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:58,625
I... I have been a little down
on my luck lately, financially speaking,

324
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,625
- and if you could just waive my entry fee...
- Wade...

325
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,958
But I know
that if you bend the rules for me,

326
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,041
you've gotta bend the rules
for every lawyer with a fishing boat,

327
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,416
but let's get creative here.

328
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,500
What if you team me up
with a local fisherman so I can qualify?

329
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,875
Just, you know,
doesn't have to be anybody even good.

330
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,583
Heck,
it doesn't have to be a fisherman.

331
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:27,291
Just, you know, just a warm body
that can reel the fish in after I hook it.

332
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,375
That's all.

333
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,541
You know, that's a good story.

334
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,333
Some local wild card
that has a shot at the big time.

335
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:39,083
Now that is good press. Hmm?

336
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,875
- Good press, huh?
- Yeah.

337
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,875
Oh, I really appreciate this, Biz.

338
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,958
You know, I think this is
gonna be my year. I really do.

339
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,291
"Captain Wade Malloy
comes back to defend his title."

340
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,916
Great.

341
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,083
Respect. Who's that?

342
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,000
Casa Hogar.

343
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,041
What, them? Those kids?

344
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,208
No, I cannot work with those kids.
I can't work with kids.

345
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,416
They're thieves, those kids.

346
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,416
Just open the windows.

347
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,541
Dude, do you even know
how water works?

348
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,500
Papa Omar?

349
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,583
Yeah?

350
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,041
Ah! Yeah, okay.

351
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,875
All right. But listen. Remember, Tweety...

352
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,333
God is always listening,

353
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:45,041
but he doesn't always answer our prayers
the way that we think he should.

354
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,750
So, he gets...

355
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:55,458
All right. Here's the deal. You and three
of your least annoying orphans

356
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,684
will be on my boat for the duration
of the competition.

357
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,791
Not him. He's too little.

358
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,166
You'll do everything I say,
and you will say nothing.

359
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,333
And when I catch the winning fish,
we'll split the earnings 80/20.

360
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:08,583
Eighty, me, 20, you.
<i>Comprende?</i> See you next week.

361
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,916
Look. Hey.

362
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,541
Hey, I... I don't even know
what you're talking about!

363
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,333
It worked!

364
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,166
Everybody, my prayer worked!
I can't believe it.

365
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,541
It's a distraction, Becca.

366
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,708
Yes.

367
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,791
And... And a waste of time.

368
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,708
I don't have three days
to be spending on some fishing boat.

369
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,333
<i>Claro.</i>

370
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,375
And the boys are gonna be disappointed.
Yes, but that's life.

371
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,666
They'll... They'll get over it.

372
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,000
Life is very disappointing. That's exactly
what you should tell the kids.

373
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,291
Are you being sarcastic
right now?

374
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,041
Because that's not helping.

375
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:03,375
Okay, let's talk straight, then.
We have a month to raise $117,000.

376
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,458
Plus, the repairs.

377
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,083
And suddenly, you have the chance
to make all that money at once.

378
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,041
Omar, all you have to do is catch a fish.

379
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,166
Okay. All I have to do is...
That's <i>loca,</i> Becca.

380
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,083
I don't know
the first thing about fishing.

381
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:16,291
- But Captain Wade does.
- Captain Wade is washed up.

382
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,333
All right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right.

383
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,791
The odds of you winning
that tournament are very, very small,

384
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,041
so we'll stay with your plan instead.

385
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,541
You have a plan, right?

386
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,166
<i>It has been called
the Super Bowl of fishing tournaments,</i>

387
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,708
<i>where the best anglers
from all over the world</i>

388
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,833
<i>come with dreams of riches and glory.</i>

389
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,250
<i>And in the wake of Hurricane Odile,</i>

390
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,666
<i>today is proof that the spirit of Cabo
will not be broken.</i>

391
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>And after 33 years, the Bisbee dream,
stronger than ever before.</i>

392
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

393
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,708
<i>welcome to day one of Bisbee's
Black & Blue fishing tournament.</i>

394
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,083
And what a year it is shaping up to be.

395
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,166
That's right, Larry.

396
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,083
Part of what makes this year so special

397
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,750
is a host of newcomers
from around the Cabo area.

398
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,125
<i>We got first-timers like Team Casa Hogar,</i>

399
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,291
<i>made up of orphans
from the local boys' home</i>

400
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,916
<i>and led by none other</i>

401
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,875
<i>than legendary two-time Bisbee Champion,
Captain Wade Malloy.</i>

402
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,458
<i>Wow, it's gonna
be an exciting three days.</i>

403
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,291
It's H-O-G-A-R.

404
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,291
Okay, and you said
there are five members on your team?

405
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,000
It's... It's six, actually.

406
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,375
Okay.

407
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,583
Him.

408
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,541
Expensive watch.
He's big. Never catch you.

409
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,708
- Look, I'm just chilling, all right?
- No. Her.

410
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,791
Flimsy purse strap.
One pull, bam, you're gone.

411
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,541
- Man, what do you want from me?
- Join us.

412
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,000
I told you, I'm not living
in some broke-down orphanage.

413
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:10,333
No, man, for the tournament.
Join Team Casa.

414
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,000
- Me?
- Yeah.

415
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,375
- It'll be fun.
- "Fun"?

416
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,000
- Yeah.
- Oh man.

417
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,916
Man, you're really crazy,<i> güey.</i>

418
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:26,083
That one's mine, <i>güey.</i> That one's mine.

419
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,708
No, no. That one. That one, yeah.

420
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,416
All aboard the SS Hollywood.
Welcome, ladies.

421
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,625
There's tanning oil by the DJ stand.

422
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,790
Yeah. How are we gonna win
against a boat like that?

423
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:42,083
Actually, that's a motor yacht.
It's not designed for sports fishing.

424
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,208
Yeah, read a book, stupid.

425
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:48,125
Besides, we got a two-time
Bisbee champion on our team.

426
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,750
I bet you Captain Wade's got one of those
two-time champion speedboats,

427
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,208
the long-bullet-looking kind,

428
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,416
the ones that fly over the water
like a rocket.

429
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,458
Vroom, vroom, vroom!
Dolphins racing to keep up with us.

430
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,708
But we're going so fast,
we can barely hold on to...

431
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,458
Son of a...

432
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,458
Oh, it has nothing to do with a fuel line.

433
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:11,291
If I wanted a deckhand
with useless opinions,

434
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,875
I would have hired my ex-wife.

435
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:13,958
Captain Wade?

436
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,125
Oh, you're here. Good.

437
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,416
Good, good, good, good.

438
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,791
What's your name?

439
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,833
- Omar.
- Omar, okay.

440
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,000
This is Hollywood.

441
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,500
I'm sure Omar told all of you.

442
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,541
My name is Captain Wade Malloy,

443
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:32,833
and I am the only two-time champion
of Bisbee's Black & Blue Tournament.

444
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,833
And you're about to step on
theKnot Enough.

445
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,916
This is a legendary boat
that carried me to both victories.

446
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:42,416
So, in essence, you are stepping
onto a piece of sport-fishing history.

447
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,291
- It's a piece of something.
- Hey.

448
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,583
This is Chato.

449
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,791
Chato was with me 11 years ago
when I won my first tournament.

450
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,791
<i>- Hola, amigos.
- </i>He's not very good, but he's cheap.

451
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,226
I'm gonna drown him
at the first opportunity.

452
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,375
What?

453
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,375
I said I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.

454
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,541
Oh, yeah.

455
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,416
All right. Well, just get on board.
Give 'em a life jacket.

456
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,333
Stay out of the way.

457
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,625
- Hey, changed your mind?
- Yeah, man. Whatever. Is this our boat?

458
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,583
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.

459
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,458
Wait a minute. No. No. No, not him.

460
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,791
Okay, look,
he's sorry for what he did, right?

461
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,333
- Ah, super sorry.
- Don't care. He's not getting on my boat.

462
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:34,833
Well, he's part of our team,
so you take all of us or none of us.

463
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,958
All right, here we go. Take a seat.

464
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,666
Here we go!

465
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,250
Yeah!

466
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,333
Hey, hey!

467
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,041
Chato, check the fuel line!

468
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,125
Yes, Captain.

469
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,541
Chato!

470
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,541
<i>Putamales!</i>

471
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,125
Almost ready.

472
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,541
So, Moco, where are you from, <i>güey?</i>

473
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
El Zacatal.

474
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,583
- Wait. What?
<i>- Aye yai yai.</i>

475
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,916
Why would you bring
some Zacatal punk to our team?

476
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,833
<i>- Oye,</i> where you from, <i>baboso?</i>
- El Chaparral, <i>güey!</i> South Side.

477
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:50,791
Cut it out!

478
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,791
<i>Sí, tranquilo. </i>You cool, right?

479
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,291
Yeah, I like your hair.

480
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,458
Is he messing with me?

481
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,041
No, seems like a guy
who gives compliments.

482
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,708
Wait.

483
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,833
Are you messing with me?

484
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,458
Hey, what are you doing?

485
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,017
- Don't touch that.
- Hey, chill.

486
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,208
- Chato!
- Yeah?

487
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,458
You keep these kids away from our gear.

488
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,416
<i>- Oye, </i>what's his problem?
<i>- Tranquilo.</i>

489
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,038
He doesn't like anyone
touching Adeline.

490
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,541
It's his lucky lure.

491
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,750
The one he used to win both tournaments.

492
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,666
Okay, the line is set.

493
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,250
But first, I want
to clarify a few things, all right?

494
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,666
First, I want to apologize

495
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,791
if my friendly demeanor
gave any of you the impression

496
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:57,208
that I like you
or that I'm happy to be here with you.

497
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,333
I don't, and I'm not.

498
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:03,625
So from now on, do not touch anything.

499
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,500
Two, do not open your mouth

500
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,125
unless I explicitly tell you to do so,

501
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:15,000
or tomorrow, I am going to revoke
your totally symbolic crew positions

502
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,333
and replace you
with some other nameless orphans.

503
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,625
All right.
Now, once we get a fish on the line,

504
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,583
Bisbee made me agree

505
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:26,000
that I need to let one of you
do all of the reeling.

506
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,333
Oh, oh, me, me, me.

507
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:31,416
- So, Omar, you be ready.
<i>- Putamales.</i>

508
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,291
I'm gonna put you in this fighting chair,

509
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:40,250
and I'm going to instruct you
how to reel it in.

510
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,333
All right?

511
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,500
Any other questions?

512
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,375
- We have names.
- What?

513
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,083
You said we were nameless orphans,
but we have names.

514
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,833
Yeah. And we're not orphans, <i>güey.</i>

515
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,875
We're, like,
between families at the moment.

516
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,208
- Captain Wade?
- Yeah.

517
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,916
- Do you live in here?
- What do you want, Mr. Venegas?

518
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,541
Well, I'd rather not reel in the fish,
if that's okay.

519
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,875
Why not?

520
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,583
Well, I just think it would be
a lot more fun for one of the kids,

521
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,958
you know, and meaningful.

522
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,958
"Fun for the kids."

523
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,541
Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,875
I was thinking that, you know,
maybe Moco could do it.

525
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,291
Yeah, I know you guys had that issue,
but he's older,

526
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,250
and I think it'd make him feel
like he's more part of the team.

527
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:41,833
Sure. Yeah, whatever.
That's fine. Anything else?

528
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,208
No. No.

529
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh good. Great.

530
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,333
Actually, there's... there's one more thing.

531
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,208
What?

532
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:58,166
I was kind of hoping that you can help me
manage their expectations a little bit.

533
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,291
How's that?

534
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,375
Come on. You know.

535
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,666
I mean, they're excited to be here,
which is great.

536
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,125
Right? But it's no secret
that the odds are against us here, right?

537
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,166
I know you used to be
a great captain once, but...

538
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,583
That's not what I meant.

539
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,083
What I'm trying to say here

540
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:18,333
is that I just want them
to be realistic about this. That's all.

541
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,750
You're right. You're absolutely right.

542
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,166
- Okay.
- Okay.

543
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,250
- Great.
- Good.

544
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,416
- Perfect. Great.
- Um...

545
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,166
So maybe you could just...
you could just say a few words.

546
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,458
Oh, of course. Yeah.

547
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,833
Just whenever.

548
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:40,916
Thank you.

549
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,041
Yeah.

550
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,083
All right, team. Everybody, listen up.

551
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,750
Change of plans.

552
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,291
You.

553
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,333
You're gonna reel in the fish.

554
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,000
- Me?
- Why him?

555
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,958
Yeah. That punk ain't even part
of this team.

556
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,250
Maybe you guys could trade off
when we get tired.

557
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:06,583
No, no, no, no, no, no.
<i>Capitán,</i> remember Team Blackjack.

558
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,875
You can't trade off.

559
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:12,416
First one to touch the rod
has gotta reel in the fish all by himself.

560
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,166
Why? What's Team Blackjack?

561
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,593
It's a winning team.
Didn't follow the rules.

562
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,083
One million dollars...

563
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,916
- Nah.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,291
So?

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,708
Well, you wanna do it or not?

566
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,208
<i>Dale.</i> Whatever.

567
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,875
Oh wow.

568
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,416
That's so inspiring.

569
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,791
All right!

570
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,750
Listen, I know you boys are excited,

571
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,916
but I want you to keep one thing
in mind, all right?

572
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,458
Fishing is a very hit-and-miss thing.

573
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:43,500
You can make the best of plans.
You can make informed decisions.

574
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:46,875
But there's a lot of variables
you can't control.

575
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,083
And I've been fishing these waters
for...

576
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,708
...25 years,

577
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,791
and I don't catch a big marlin every day.

578
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,125
Oh, well, Captain Wade,

579
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,875
I think I speak for all of us
when I say that we're just...

580
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:04,125
But I have never gone three days in a row
without catching something,

581
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:07,625
and I sure as hell
am not about to start right now.

582
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,916
And I'm telling you boys,
do not get discouraged

583
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,375
because we are going
to catch the winning marlin,

584
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:19,791
and you boys are in
for the ride of your life.

585
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,208
- Give me five! Give me five! Give me five!
- <i>Putamales, güey.</i> You hear that?

586
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,892
- Down low, too slow.
- Yay!

587
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,291
Get ready.

588
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,791
<i>Putamales, güey.</i>
You hear that?

589
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,791
Yeah!

590
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,166
Hey.

591
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,166
What was that?

592
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,684
Well, if you wanna teach those kids
how to be losers their whole life,

593
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,916
that's your problem.
I don't want any part of it.

594
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,416
I'm a winner. That's the way I roll.

595
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,166
Are you joking me?

596
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,416
Mr. Venegas, I am not a joke.

597
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,083
All good?

598
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,458
Oh yeah. It's good.

599
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,458
You ready, Moco?

600
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,541
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,916
Man, forget this.

602
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,541
<i>Oye, </i>what's his problem, man?

603
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,583
Eh, they shot his brother in your hood
back in the day. No big deal.

604
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,166
Man, I can't believe we might
actually win this thing.

605
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,666
I love fishing,<i> güey.</i>

606
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,708
I hate fishing.

607
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,166
Hey.

608
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,875
Looks like you're the only one
that isn't sick.

609
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,791
- Have you done this before?
- No.

610
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,916
I mean, I don't know. Maybe.

611
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,958
Ah, that's normal.

612
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,525
You know, most people remember things
by looking at pictures,

613
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,166
and their family tells them stories.

614
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,208
But, you know, since you never had that...

615
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,416
No, I have parents.

616
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,250
Oh.

617
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,500
I told you, man. I'm not an orphan.

618
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,750
Mmm.

619
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,083
Well, where are they?

620
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,000
My mom's in Texas.

621
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,458
Maybe Arizona. I don't know.

622
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,083
And your father?

623
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,750
As far as possible, I hope.

624
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,809
- When's the last time you saw him?
- What's with all the questions?

625
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,375
Hey. I mean, I'm just asking.
Just talking, man.

626
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,750
Yeah, well,
talk about the weather or something.

627
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:53,000
I mean, you wanna talk about
the last time you saw your parents?

628
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,166
That's what I thought.

629
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,250
It was on a boat.

630
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:58,958
What?

631
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,708
Yeah, I don't remember my mom,

632
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,625
but the last time I saw my father,
we were on a boat, and...

633
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,833
Yeah, it was my eighth birthday.

634
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,476
I mean, neither one of us knew anything
about fishing,

635
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,333
but I begged him to take us, but...

636
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,791
I don't know.
The memory's a little foggy, <i>pero...</i>

637
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,833
He must've hit his head
when the boat flipped over.

638
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,208
<i>Pero,</i> nah, you know...

639
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:23,875
I'm... I'm lucky.

640
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,809
These boys, they never got a chance
to meet their fathers at all.

641
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,333
Your father's dead, man.
You don't have to act all happy about it.

642
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,041
I'm not happy about it, all right?

643
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,333
I'm just grateful,

644
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,166
you know, that I had a chance
to meet my father.

645
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,083
Somebody to show me the ropes, <i>sabes?</i>

646
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:48,916
And, hey, that's what I am for these boys.
That's why they call me Papa Omar.

647
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,916
I told you I ain't calling you papa, <i>güey.</i>

648
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:59,416
A little bit, but it's okay,
Papa Omar.

649
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,125
Wow.

650
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,333
- Captain Wade.
- Yeah?

651
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,916
Hey, come and join us.
We got some extra tacos.

652
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,500
No. I'm okay. Thanks.

653
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,458
No, <i>sí.</i> Come sit with us. Don't be rude.

654
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,125
Mmm.

655
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,583
Okay.

656
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,333
The boys were wondering
about that fish you caught.

657
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,916
What fish?

658
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,750
When you won the tournament.
That must have been crazy, <i>güey</i>.

659
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,208
We wanna hear all about it.

660
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,583
Oh, well, yeah, that fish.

661
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,500
Yeah, that was something.

662
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,875
Wow. You got a real gift for stories,
Dr. Seuss.

663
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:41,375
<i>Ándale, Capitán</i>. Show them the scar.

664
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,708
<i>Órale!</i> We love scars!

665
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,958
All right. Yeah.

666
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,125
The big marlin,

667
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,583
his bill went right through my calf,
right there.

668
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,375
<i>- Oye!</i>
- Almost took off my leg.

669
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,708
- Yeah, that was a rookie move.
- "Rookie"?

670
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:59,541
- Whatever. You won two years in a row.
- Could have been luck.

671
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,958
Actually, not true.

672
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,958
The chances of that are about
one in 10,000.

673
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,125
At least from the number of boats
in the tournament.

674
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:11,875
Well, I ain't scared of no marlin,
and I ain't scared of no scars.

675
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,833
<i>Mira! Mira! </i>Look, look, look.

676
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,750
I got in a fight
with some <i>vatos</i> in my hood.

677
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,250
Oh!

678
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,333
Your uncle hit you
with a coat hanger.

679
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,934
My <i>tía </i>used to do the same thing to me.

680
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,000
Whatever.

681
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,125
You stupid, <i>güey.</i>

682
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,041
I'll show you a real scar.

683
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,291
- A screwdriver.
- Ooh!

684
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,500
Big rusty one. My foster dad stabbed me
for spilling his <i>cerveza.</i>

685
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,750
Oh! That's cold.

686
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,125
Hey, Wiki, show him the scars
on your back, <i>güey</i>.

687
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,791
- Yeah.
- Hollywood, <i>déjalo.</i>

688
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:42,375
What? We all got 'em.

689
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,166
Hey, Moco.

690
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,375
You for sure got some scars,
am I right, <i>güey</i>?

691
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,458
Let's see 'em.

692
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,000
No, I'm good.

693
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,083
Yeah, he got those Zacatal scars.

694
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,791
Tripping on shoelaces.
Running into glass doors.

695
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,916
<i>Oye</i>, keep talkin', I'll give you
some new scars you can brag about.

696
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,125
Fish on!

697
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,208
Oh yeah! All right.

698
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:09,083
Come up here. Get in the fighting chair.
Come on. Take the rod.

699
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:11,041
Ready? Go.

700
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,250
Pull it. Don't let go. Put it in. Good.

701
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,000
Good, good, good. Reel forward.

702
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,875
That's it. Get a rhythm.

703
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:17,958
- Chato.
- Yeah?

704
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,333
- Chato, you got a visual?
- Yeah!

705
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:22,458
Blue! Blue-green! <i>Grande!</i>

706
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,250
Blue-green? Is that... Is that good?

707
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,250
It's a blue marlin. That's what we want!

708
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:35,375
Chato, Chato, call the tower.
Tell 'em we got a fish on!

709
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,708
<i>Gigante!</i>

710
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,208
Oh!

711
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,291
Pull, pull, pull!

712
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,666
Fish on! <i>Aquí!</i> Casa Hogar Team!

713
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,000
Team Casa Hogar!

714
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,375
- That's it. Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
- Team Casa Hogar! Fish on!

715
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,708
<i>¡Grande!</i>

716
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,125
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

717
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:21,958
So, should we take a team photo?

718
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,541
And there's
your first-place fish for day one.

719
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:45,125
From Team Deep Blue Something,
a 368-pound blue!

720
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,541
<i>Oye</i>, can I drive?

721
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,458
- Get in there.
- Yeah, whatever.

722
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,875
You should come stay with us tonight.
Got plenty of beds.

723
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,041
Yeah. Come on,<i> güey.</i>

724
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:01,666
What do you say?

725
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,541
I told you. I ain't no helpless orphan.

726
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:09,000
- Well, you coming back tomorrow?
- I don't know.

727
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,166
Be at the docks at 7:00.

728
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,583
Hey.

729
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:20,125
Today was pretty cool, right?
I mean, we didn't catch fish, but...

730
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,375
Yeah, I mean, that was fun,

731
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:27,625
but it isn't gonna save Casa Hogar
unless we win, right?

732
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,458
Hollywood heard Becca talking to the bank.

733
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,166
Hey, you don't have to worry
about that stuff, okay?

734
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:41,125
<i>Es que, </i>I can't go back to the streets,
Papa Omar.

735
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,625
I mean, the other <i>tipos,</i>
Geco and Hollywood, I mean, they're tough.

736
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,708
They can handle it.

737
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,875
But it's just, I'm different.

738
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:51,250
Hey, nobody's goin' back on the streets.
All right?

739
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,333
I promise.

740
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,500
Check out this ride, <i>güey.</i>
Look at the lights!

741
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,041
Whose car is this?

742
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,541
It's nice.

743
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,916
Papa Omar!
Look what your brother brought me.

744
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
My brother?

745
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,416
I told them
we were like brothers. Ah?

746
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,666
But I am obviously too handsome
to be related to you.

747
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,750
Hector! What are you doing?

748
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,791
- Come here, man!
- Oh!

749
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,375
Look at you, man! You look good!

750
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:56,875
You haven't changed a bit.

751
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,750
Well, you haven't either. You look great.
You've got all your hair.

752
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:05,375
And when the TV announcer said
Team Casa Hogar,

753
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,250
I... I said to myself, <i>"Ay, Dios."</i>
Omar Venegas on a fishing boat.

754
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:14,291
No! He must've been drugged.
He must have been taken at gunpoint.

755
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,333
<i>Chavos, en verdad, dígame.</i> Was he nervous?

756
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,041
<i>- </i>He was super nervous, <i>güey.</i>
- Ah.

757
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,083
<i>A huevo! </i>He was terrified.

758
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,642
Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys.
We have an early morning tomorrow.

759
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,226
- Hey. <i>Un momento.</i>
- So let's get to bed.

760
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,708
I know that Team Casa Hogar may not have
a million-dollar fishing boat,

761
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,041
but that don't mean that
they cannot look like a million bucks!

762
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,125
And for you. <i>Mira!</i>

763
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:38,708
No way!

764
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,416
Yeah. Okay, okay, boys.

765
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,708
You heard Papa Omar.
It's time to go to bed. Come on.

766
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,585
- Come on, come on.
<i>- Gracias, Hector.</i>

767
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,458
<i>Gracias, Señor Hector.</i>

768
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,208
<i>- Gracias, Señor Hector.
- De nada.</i>

769
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,500
God, <i>güey,</i> this is like silk!

770
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,625
You guys be good, okay?

771
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,000
<i>Oye.</i> Let's get out of here, bro.

772
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,416
You could see the flames
from two streets away.

773
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,125
Okay, <i>mira.</i> I remember the fire,
but are you sure that was us?

774
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:17,166
<i>Oye.</i> Three <i>vatos </i>staring at a burning car
with the smell of gasoline on them.

775
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,041
It doesn't take a detective.

776
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,125
Hey, <i>mira.</i>
That's how Kacho lost his eyebrows.

777
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,958
Wait, you mean Humpty?

778
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,625
<i>Exacto. </i>Humpty Dumpty.
That's how he got his nickname.

779
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,208
<i>- </i>Humpty Dumpty. Remember?
- Oh.

780
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,833
With his... With his burnt eyebrows.
<i>Gracias.</i>

781
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:38,916
His shaved head and his light skin?
He looked like a big egg, bro.

782
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,958
- Man. Right, that was us.
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,208
- Wow. That was bad.
- Mmm.

784
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:48,458
- Do you think they still call him Humpty?
- Kacho? Nah, he's dead.

785
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:53,791
But you're doing really good. Huh?
Becca. Wow.

786
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,458
I never thought
that you would settle down.

787
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:59,416
Yeah, well, people change.

788
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,208
Oh,<i> sí, sí, </i>you're a new man now.

789
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,250
Papa Omar.

790
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,291
Yeah, what are you doing here, Hector?

791
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,375
I mean, you see us on the news

792
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:11,875
and then you decide to come
and visit us after ten years?

793
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:15,416
<i>Eh, oye, tranquilo.</i>
I'm just checking in on an old friend

794
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,375
to see if there's anything
that you need from Papa Hector.

795
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,125
Yeah. No, I'm good. We're good.

796
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,166
<i>A huevo.</i> That's a big relief.

797
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,708
'Cause I heard
that you owe the bank 117 grand.

798
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:29,375
But they must have you confused
with some other Papa Omar.

799
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,083
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

800
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,333
Okay, okay. With a fishing tournament?

801
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,125
<i>A poco? Perdón.</i>
I don't mean to laugh, okay?

802
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,125
<i>Pero,</i> wow.

803
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,375
I hope you got something better than that.

804
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,541
I mean, the boys that I met tonight,

805
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,166
they're soft now, Omar.

806
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,458
You remember
what it's like on the streets.

807
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,500
You send them back out there,

808
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,250
they're gonna get eaten alive.

809
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:04,958
You wanna work again?

810
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,458
- I can give you a few easy runs a month.
- Forget it.

811
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,059
Come on, you could pay off the loan.
You could fix up the place.

812
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,125
- A new soccer field for the <i>chamaquitos</i>...
- I said forget it.

813
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,416
I'm not like that anymore.

814
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,958
- Like what?
- Like you.

815
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,708
I'm sorry, <i>güey.</i> I...

816
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,875
It's okay, Omar, you know.

817
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:31,208
At least I'm honest about who I am.

818
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,208
What does that mean?

819
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,250
It's easy to be the patron saint
of orphans

820
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,083
when everything is going good, huh?

821
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:42,125
Well, you let me tell you something.

822
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,125
Sooner or later,
you're gonna run into a problem

823
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,958
that you can't solve
with hopes and prayers,

824
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,708
and then we'll see what
the real Papa Omar is made of.

825
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,791
Lina!

826
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:12,000
<i>Another beautiful morning here
in Cabo San Lucas</i>

827
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:15,416
<i>as we begin day two of Bisbee's
Black & Blue fishing tournament.</i>

828
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,875
<i>Now, Team Deep Blue Something
is the team to beat today</i>

829
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:21,333
<i>with a 368-pound beauty
they reeled in yesterday.</i>

830
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,791
He ain't comin'.

831
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You're late.

832
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,375
- Brought you a jersey.
- <i>Qué menso.</i> I'm not wearing that thing.

833
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,833
How much longer does it take,<i> güey?</i>

834
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:12,166
This is not boring.
This is great!

835
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,666
You'd rather be back at the orphanage?

836
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,583
How does this boat smell like fish
when there's absolutely no fish?

837
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,750
This cabin is a no orphan zone.

838
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,083
Yeah. <i>Dale.</i> Sorry.

839
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,958
Hey, um, is that a Bristol knot?

840
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,208
Yes, it is.

841
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,208
Yeah, I just read about it.
It looks really complicated.

842
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,333
Well, it's complicated to read about,
yeah, but not to do.

843
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,966
- Oh.
- Come here, come here, come here. Look.

844
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:44,208
I got my line. I got my loop.

845
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:48,708
I wrap my line around the loop six times,

846
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:52,500
take one end of the line,
put it back through the loop,

847
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:55,375
and then I'm gonna
pull both sides of the line...

848
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,708
And then the tension
holds the knot in place.

849
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,333
<i>Correcto.</i>

850
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,875
Awesome. Thanks.

851
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,041
Congratulations, <i>muchachos,</i>
on your new uniforms.

852
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:20,500
You look like you should be
selling cell phone plans at a strip mall.

853
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:26,625
Hey, Wiki, you're up for reeling today.

854
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,916
Hey, that's a great idea.

855
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Hey, Wiki? <i>En serio?</i>
My<i> abuelita </i>is stronger than him.

856
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:35,125
<i>No manches, güey.</i>
You ain't got no <i>abuela.</i>

857
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,184
It's a finger of speech, <i>idiota.</i>

858
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,375
<i>Cállate.</i>

859
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,125
Wiki, what do you think?

860
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:46,166
I don't know.
Geco's probably better suited.

861
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,750
Okay, Captain Wade, what do you think?

862
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:52,500
Reeling in marlin is hard.

863
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:55,375
But I've talked younger kids than you
through the whole thing.

864
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,958
Everything was just fine.

865
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,416
- You'll be all right.
- You mean your son?

866
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,083
Yeah.

867
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,916
I saw the photo in the cabin.

868
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,375
Wait, you have a son?

869
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,791
- Yeah.
- Where? How old is he?

870
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,916
Uh, he's about your age.

871
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,375
Uh, lives with his mother in Dallas.

872
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,083
- He...
- Why aren't you with him?

873
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,416
Uh, well, uh, I'm a marlin fisherman.

874
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:25,166
- What does that mean?
- There's no marlin fishing in Dallas.

875
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got that part, <i>güey.</i>

876
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,500
But for real. Is that what you're saying?
You picked fishing over your own son?

877
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:37,098
- Well, that's not the way I'd put it.
- Then how would you put it?

878
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,625
- Geco.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

879
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,958
Look...

880
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,500
I believe every man has got inside him

881
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:48,208
this call to greatness,

882
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:52,916
to be able to do something better
than anybody else.

883
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,708
And, uh, most men, they're afraid of that.

884
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:03,458
And they make any excuse they can,
including their family,

885
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:04,833
to play it safe,

886
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,125
not to answer that call.

887
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,583
But I'm not that way.

888
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,125
I'm out here, and I'm doing it.

889
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,041
And my son,

890
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,791
maybe one of these days,
he's gonna be able to hold up my trophies,

891
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:24,750
and he's gonna be able to say,
"Hey, my dad was special."

892
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,250
"My dad was somebody."

893
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:34,458
And then maybe he'll have the guts
to pass that gift on to his own son.

894
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,291
A fishing trophy?

895
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,375
<i>Oye.</i> We all lost our dads
for stupid reasons.

896
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,458
Bullets, drugs, prison.

897
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,250
But right now, I'm feeling kind of lucky
compared to your son.

898
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,250
- Set the line, would you?
- Yes, sir.

899
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,125
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

900
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,583
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

901
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,458
- Uh, Chato.
- <i>Qué pasó, mijo?</i>

902
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:49,625
Fish on! Captain, fish on!

903
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,083
No way! No way!

904
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,708
Wiki, get in the chair.

905
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,458
Good, good, good. All right. You got it.

906
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,791
Is it seaweed?

907
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,208
Next, I want you to set the drag.
Very slow.

908
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:03,958
Hey. You got a visual on it?

909
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,583
- Yeah!
- Good. Good.

910
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,791
All right. I want you to reel! Reel!

911
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,375
That's it.
Few clicks at a time. That's it.

912
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,375
Back. Okay, reel, reel, reel, reel.

913
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,875
Oh! Oh!

914
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,791
Did you see that?

915
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:17,958
Oh!

916
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,041
Hang on! Hang on, Wiki! Good!

917
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,041
<i>Oye</i>, Moco. Don't feel bad, <i>güey.</i>

918
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,416
Catching seaweed is still a big
accomplishment where you're from.

919
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,375
I guess we all can't be as successful
as your brother,<i> güey</i>.

920
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:30,500
What did you say?

921
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,000
You heard me, orphan boy!

922
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,041
Keep coming back! Keep coming back!

923
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:43,291
Help!

924
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,958
Geco! Hold on! Omar!

925
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,958
Reel forward! Reel, reel, reel, reel!

926
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,291
Come on, Wiki! Pull, pull, pull!

927
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:55,166
- You're doing this. Reel, reel, reel!
- Omar!

928
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,666
Hey! I got you!

929
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:04,291
Get a rhythm. Come on, come on.
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

930
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,041
Geco!

931
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,767
Okay. You're doing good.

932
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:09,666
You're doing great.

933
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,375
- Hold on, boys!
- Captain!

934
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,416
Captain!

935
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,791
Jump in!

936
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,583
No, I don't know how to swim!

937
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,833
Chato, jump in!

938
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:22,916
I can't swim!

939
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:23,958
Goddamn it!

940
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,166
Captain Wade!

941
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:31,500
Captain Wade!

942
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,416
God!

943
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,875
Hey.

944
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:15,833
Just lost my shoe, <i>güey!</i>

945
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,000
Your shoe?

946
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,833
Do you have any idea
what I just lost, you little punk?

947
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:24,375
Hey! They're just kids, man!

948
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:25,625
I don't care!

949
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,583
This is why I didn't want kids
in the first place!

950
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,291
I said no kids!

951
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,875
<i>It's the end of day two</i>

952
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:56,166
<i>and a couple of new additions
to the leaderboard,</i>

953
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,875
<i>but still no challenger</i>

954
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,500
to the 368-pound marlin

955
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:02,666
brought in by Team Deep Blue Something
yesterday afternoon.

956
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,291
That's right.
With just one day left of competition,

957
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,335
the other teams are starting
to feel the pressure.

958
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,541
But when you got
the world's greatest fishermen

959
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,750
all in one spot,
well, it ain't over until it's over.

960
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:17,708
<i>Mañana?</i>

961
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,208
Maybe not.

962
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,166
Moco!

963
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,375
Are you gonna walk home with one shoe?

964
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,875
Sure you don't wanna stay for dinner
before I take you back?

965
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,666
Probably got an extra pair of shoes too.

966
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,791
Uh... Nah, man. I'm... I'm good.

967
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,208
<i>Ándale. </i>Don't be rude. Come inside.

968
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,666
I got some shoes you can borrow.

969
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,541
<i>Dale.</i>

970
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:23,333
All right. All right. Ready?

971
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:28,208
Okay. One, two, three.
Who can jump? Ooh! Ooh!

972
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:33,333
- Looks like you caught a big one today.
- Yeah.

973
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,375
Mr. Bisbee called.
Told me to tell you no luck with the bank.

974
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:46,708
Okay.

975
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:53,041
And someone came by
and took pictures of the whole property.

976
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,416
I'm not gonna lie, Omar.

977
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:01,625
The possibility of losing this place
in two weeks is starting to feel real now.

978
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,083
Papa Omar.

979
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,625
Oh, wow, <i>mijo!</i> This is awesome.

980
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,125
It's Captain Wade.

981
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,458
Yeah, I see that.

982
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,625
Did I spell it right? Becca helped.

983
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,250
Yeah, you did.

984
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,666
Can you nail it above my door tonight?

985
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,333
Yeah, of course.

986
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

987
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,750
Okay, boys. Time to bed.

988
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,666
Group one, you have five minutes
to get your teeth brushed

989
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:44,291
with toothpaste, okay?

990
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,083
- What?
- Captain Wade.

991
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,333
It's me, Omar.

992
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:00,625
What do you want?

993
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:02,500
Brought you some dinner.

994
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,541
Come in.

995
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,708
Take a seat.

996
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:13,125
This is a torta ahogada.
It's an old hangover remedy...

997
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:16,833
Whoever said that "a bad day of fishing
was better than a good day at home"

998
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,625
didn't have a day like today.

999
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:22,250
Hey, look, sorry about the lure.

1000
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,416
I... I know that it meant...
Adeline. That's what you called it, right?

1001
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,833
Yeah. Adeline, that was my wife's name.

1002
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,625
It was my son's idea.

1003
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,166
The last time you saw 'em?

1004
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,916
October 28, 2009.

1005
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,750
They were on their way to Dallas.

1006
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,291
Do you ever think about going after 'em?

1007
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,416
Well, there was a day left
in the tournament.

1008
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:49,791
Yeah.

1009
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,625
You think I'm a terrible father,
don't you?

1010
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,000
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

1011
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,125
No. No, no. Look.

1012
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:59,875
I think that we're all just trying
to do the best that we can, you know?

1013
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,500
But look, I'm gonna be honest with you,
I think Geco's right.

1014
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:07,291
You know, like, kids, they don't need
a father with fishing trophies.

1015
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:11,000
They need a father
that's gonna be with them every day.

1016
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,833
No matter what. Like an anchor.

1017
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:16,291
"Anchor." That's really clever.

1018
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,375
Mmm.

1019
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, well, my son...

1020
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,833
...he wanted to be just like me.

1021
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:26,041
First time I brought home
that Black & Blue trophy,

1022
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,875
he just thought I walked on water.

1023
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:31,166
And she was like butter in my hands.

1024
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,625
Just easy.

1025
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:39,416
She used to call me,
"Oh, Captain. My Captain."

1026
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,708
And then I lost.

1027
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,375
I lost again, lost again.

1028
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,125
And then I lost everything.

1029
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,500
So, this was my shot.

1030
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,333
You know?

1031
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,000
Chance to be a champion again.

1032
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:01,250
I thought if I could pull it off,

1033
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,833
I'd be Mr. Wonderful.

1034
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,333
Maybe they'd come back. Who knows?

1035
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,416
That doesn't sound crazy.

1036
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,083
But if we're gonna have a shot,
you gotta get something in your stomach.

1037
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,166
Oh.

1038
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:15,833
We don't have another shot.

1039
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:17,791
Lightning doesn't strike twice.

1040
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:20,041
- Come on. You don't know that.
- Yeah. Yes, I do.

1041
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,125
No, you don't.

1042
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:24,416
Look, I was skeptical
about this whole thing,

1043
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:28,291
but then I see that marlin on the line,
and I...

1044
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,750
I don't know. Just, crazy things happen
all the time, right?

1045
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,541
Look, we never dreamed
of being in the Bisbee.

1046
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,916
- The bank's got us by the throat, and...
- What bank? What bank?

1047
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,625
- Nothing.
- Wait...

1048
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,875
- No. Look, I'm not trying to pressure you.
- Oh no. You're not.

1049
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:46,791
What?

1050
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:50,041
Are you... Are you using this tournament
to save your orphanage?

1051
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,916
- That's exactly what's going on here.
- Look, I'm just... Look...

1052
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,958
Oh, don't you put that guilt on me.

1053
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,166
Okay, look,
I... I know that tomorrow's a long shot.

1054
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,416
This is so screwed up.

1055
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,750
All I'm trying to say is
that we still have a chance.

1056
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,583
We never had a chance.

1057
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,458
You might be right,

1058
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,250
but we still have to try.

1059
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,250
It's over.

1060
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,791
Yeah. Yeah.

1061
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,875
One of the younger boys made this for you.

1062
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:38,958
Hello?

1063
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,625
What's going on?

1064
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:57,750
A local fisherman
caught this this morning.

1065
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,375
He's not in the tournament.

1066
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,291
He's gonna sell it to us
for a pretty good price.

1067
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,416
What? Sell it to us? For what?

1068
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,833
Well, this is a 270-pound blue marlin.

1069
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:09,916
It's... It's not first place,

1070
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,500
but it's third place, maybe second.

1071
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,958
That's really good money.

1072
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:17,958
Wait, you... you wanna cheat? Why?

1073
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:21,625
Well, you wanna win
this tournament, don't you?

1074
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:25,208
This is how we do it.
There's no other way.

1075
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:26,750
So look...

1076
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,291
...when you get to the dock
with the boys,

1077
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,625
this fish is gonna be
all wrapped up already,

1078
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:36,375
and it's gonna be tied under the boat
at the back just under the water, okay?

1079
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:39,458
Nobody's gonna see it
unless they're looking for it.

1080
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,208
And then, when we get out to sea,

1081
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,708
you're gonna help me
put this fish on our lines

1082
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:47,625
so that one of the boys can reel it in.

1083
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,583
Wait. Me? But...
Does Chato know about this?

1084
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:54,958
Chato... Chato doesn't really approve,
but he knows it's for a good cause.

1085
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,708
He's gonna help us distract the boys.

1086
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,708
Oh. Okay. Look, man. I...

1087
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,583
What are you doing?

1088
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,291
I didn't mean to tell you about the bank.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you.

1089
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:10,458
But... But this isn't the only way. I mean,
dude, you won this thing twice in a row.

1090
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:13,916
- Okay? No. If anybody can do it, you can...
- Omar. Omar, I cheated.

1091
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,291
I cheated.

1092
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:17,750
What?

1093
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,041
The second time that I won,

1094
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,833
this is what I did.

1095
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,625
You won it once before, right?

1096
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,708
- That means something, right?
- Yes.

1097
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,125
Some days it does.

1098
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:38,708
Most days...

1099
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,208
I don't know. I don't know.

1100
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:43,291
Look, I can't do this without you.

1101
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:47,500
So if you wanna back out,
you gotta give me the word right now.

1102
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,916
But if you wanna save those boys,

1103
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,458
this is what you gotta do.

1104
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,166
Get some rest.

1105
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:54,333
<i>Mijo,</i> I already told you.
This isn't for little kids.

1106
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,750
It's okay. God told me to come.

1107
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,375
Oh yeah? How'd he do that?

1108
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,875
Didn't he tell you too?

1109
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:05,166
All right. Come on.
Just get in the front seat.

1110
01:12:06,041 --> 01:12:08,833
Didn't know you were listening to God
all of a sudden.

1111
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:16,083
<i>It's the third and final day of
Bisbee's Black & Blue fishing tournament.</i>

1112
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:19,250
<i>368 pounds is still the number to beat,</i>

1113
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,458
<i>and with just nine hours left to go
in this competition,</i>

1114
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:26,833
the rest of the teams
are feeling a new sense of urgency.

1115
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,041
Hey.

1116
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,041
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1117
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,583
- This kid's too little.
- Captain Wade, this is Tweety.

1118
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,346
He drew that picture
I gave you last night,

1119
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:37,416
and he's very excited to be here.

1120
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,958
I know why my mom left me now.

1121
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,041
Oh God. Here we go.

1122
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,208
So I could help you win this tournament.

1123
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:46,333
Of course she did. Yeah.
Just get him a life jacket.

1124
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,833
And let's get out of here.

1125
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,083
Come on.

1126
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,083
On the boat.

1127
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,291
Here we go!

1128
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,333
Chato. Fuel line. Check the fuel line.

1129
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,666
- Chato.
<i>- Que? Capitán!</i>

1130
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,041
Y'all need a hand?

1131
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
We're okay.

1132
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,458
No. We're... We're good!

1133
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,333
- You sure? I can take a look.
- Yeah.

1134
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,416
- Yeah! We're good!
- Great.

1135
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,208
Okay. You got it. Happy fishing.

1136
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,375
All right. Thanks.

1137
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,333
Adios!

1138
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:51,791
Hey, <i>muchachos, vengan.</i>
I got something for you. Come on!

1139
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:52,750
For us?

1140
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:53,833
Yes.

1141
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,541
- Hey, Omar. Uh...
- Yeah.

1142
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,750
Help me out with the fuel line,
will you, here?

1143
01:14:58,833 --> 01:14:59,833
Yeah.

1144
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,541
<i>Miren.</i>

1145
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:09,375
Is that Don Miguel's restaurant?

1146
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,458
That's right.

1147
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,208
<i>Tenemos </i>tortas, quesadillas, elotes.
All you can eat.

1148
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,000
Tweety. You like it?

1149
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,125
Okay.

1150
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:38,625
I'm gonna reel in the lure.
We can hook the fish.

1151
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:22,583
What did you do?

1152
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,333
You stupid, dumb...

1153
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:16,916
Hey, guys.

1154
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,708
Listen up. I, uh, I just wanted
to say that, uh...

1155
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:25,458
Thank you, Captain Wade and Chato
for bringing us out here.

1156
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:28,791
Gave us an opportunity
that we never expected

1157
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:31,666
and an experience that we'll never forget.

1158
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:38,125
The reality is that
we didn't catch the fish that we needed,

1159
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,000
and all of you know what that means.

1160
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,250
Now, I've always said
if you straighten yourselves out

1161
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:48,958
and you... you do the right thing
every chance that you get,

1162
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,750
that things will work out in the end.

1163
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,958
But that isn't exactly true.

1164
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,833
Sometimes things don't work out.

1165
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:01,291
Oftentimes, actually.

1166
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:06,083
You take the hard paths,
you make all the right sacrifices,

1167
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,916
and then at the end of the day,

1168
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,750
you find that you're just standing
in the same place,

1169
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,166
and it'll all feel like
it was all for nothing.

1170
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,208
But it isn't.

1171
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:21,333
Because when life knocks you down,
which it often does,

1172
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,416
you'll be able to face it with character.

1173
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,708
Now, I'll always love you.

1174
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,291
And no matter what happens,
you'll always be my sons.

1175
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,416
And I will always be your papa.

1176
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,541
So you lied.

1177
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,583
You promised us you would never
let us go back on the street.

1178
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,541
Yeah, but didn't you hear him?

1179
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:48,625
We got character now,
so it's gonna be great.

1180
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:49,708
Geco...

1181
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:57,166
Don't worry, Papa Omar.
I know what you're saying. I get it.

1182
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,291
Good things do happen.

1183
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,750
Just not to us.

1184
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:11,583
So, we're not gonna catch a fish?

1185
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,583
Well, look, hey, Chato.

1186
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,083
Why don't you go set up some rods
at the front

1187
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:21,833
and show these kids
how to catch some mackerel. All right?

1188
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:42,625
No, no, no, no, no.

1189
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,291
Timing, you know?

1190
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,500
Fish on! Fish on!

1191
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,041
Wait. No.

1192
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,541
- Here. No, no, I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Don't hand that thing to me.

1193
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,958
- Please. I can't.
- No, no, no, no, no. Hey, turn around.

1194
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,934
That's the gimbal. There you go.

1195
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,791
All right, I'm gonna talk you
through this. You got a visual?

1196
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,125
Yeah! Blue! Blue!

1197
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:53,833
It's a marlin!
We got a marlin on the line!

1198
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,666
All right. I want you to set the drag.

1199
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,550
Nice and easy,
'cause you don't wanna snap it.

1200
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,601
- Good, good, good.
- Okay.

1201
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,666
All right, breathe. Breathe.

1202
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,250
Now I want you to reel forward.

1203
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,583
Come on. Reel. Come on. It's all you.

1204
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,166
Reel forward, pull back.
Okay, you've got him.

1205
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,250
- Call him. Chato, call him in.
- Yes, sir!

1206
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,791
Reel forward.

1207
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,083
Pull back.

1208
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,684
- Bisbee? Bisbee?
- Forward.

1209
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,500
And that's why we always say
the Black & Blue is way more

1210
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,000
than just a fishing tournament.

1211
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,583
- It's a way...
- Wayne! Wayne!

1212
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,583
Casa Hogar hooked a blue. It's a big one!

1213
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:24,583
You... You, come with us.

1214
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:26,458
<i>And another potential billfish
on the line,</i>

1215
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:28,750
<i>this time from local team Casa Hogar,</i>

1216
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:32,083
<i>the team comprised of orphans
from around the Cabo area.</i>

1217
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,583
<i>Definitely unexpected.</i>

1218
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,458
Get us a radio in the office, please.

1219
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,250
Reel, reel, reel, reel, reel!

1220
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:42,458
Okay.

1221
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:44,708
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

1222
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:46,511
- Chato, move the boat back.
- Yeah!

1223
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,041
Just a few cranks. Give him some water.

1224
01:21:55,791 --> 01:22:00,208
Chato! Our location is 20 degrees north.

1225
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,750
Twenty degrees north,

1226
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,666
<i>one-four-nine degrees west!</i>

1227
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:05,625
<i>Fish on!</i>

1228
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:07,875
<i>Well, if they manage
to pull this off,</i>

1229
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:10,916
Team Casa Hogar will be
the first-ever Mexican team

1230
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,958
<i>to win the Bisbee's Black & Blue.</i>

1231
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,625
It's on. You're gonna lose him. Oh, easy!

1232
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,684
It's been 40 minutes since Team Casa Hogar
first called in the initial hook,

1233
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,083
