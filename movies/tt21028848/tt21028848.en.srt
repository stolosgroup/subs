00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,142
Go. Go.

3
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:21,559
Hurry up.

4
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:23,850
Keep up.

5
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:25,308
Go down. Move.

6
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:26,225
Move.

7
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,100
Keep up. Faster.

8
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:29,975
Hurry up.

9
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,058
Hurry. Move.

10
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,184
Get on the bridge.

11
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,225
Move. Fast.

12
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:38,392
Hurry.

13
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,809
Get down.

14
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:40,934
Get down.

15
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,975
Get down.

16
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:50,184
Move.

17
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,309
Move. Keep up.

18
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,350
Some are dead.

19
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:11,684
Mr. Stark,

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,809
you're bringing me so few piglets,

21
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,142
less than the previous times.

22
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:19,684
To make up for my losses,

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,349
why don't you

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,892
offer them for free this time?

25
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:36,684
The Chinese believe

26
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:39,600
that greed

27
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,225
is the bane of life,

28
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,850
and an endless desire

29
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,309
is the greatest sin.

30
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:49,184
Don't bullshit me
with the Chinese cliche.

31
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,100
So, have you heard of

32
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,517
Bartitsu?

33
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:01,725
Of course.

34
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:04,475
That's gymnastics in England.

35
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,224
The Chinese teachings

36
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,933
are warnings for the weak.

37
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,767
For me,

38
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,974
they lack imagination.

39
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,516
What nonsense!

40
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,934
I've had enough!

41
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:19,934
Newspapers!

42
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,309
Days off!

43
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,059
Move.

44
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,433
Days off!

45
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:25,933
Race to the Queen's Road.

46
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,349
Fireworks and rewards for the winners!

47
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,142
I'm certain we'll make it.

48
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,142
Ip Man, hurry up.

49
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,808
I got this!

50
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:38,892
We're counting on you!

51
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:42,683
Sorry.

52
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:43,725
What the hell?

53
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,849
Sorry. I'm Sorry.

54
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,142
Hurry up!

55
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,725
Don't worry. We'll win.

56
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,684
Don't let him win!

57
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,225
You can't win.

58
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,267
Hurry up.

59
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,684
Hurry.

60
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,059
Are you okay?

61
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,184
Wait.

62
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,684
Sorry.

63
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:22,559
You know kung fu?

64
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,059
Give me the bag! Do you hear me?

65
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,183
- Stop it!
- Let go!

66
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,474
Mom, let it be. Give it to him.

67
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:41,683
What are you doing?

68
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,809
Give me that.

69
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,225
Sit down.

70
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:46,642
Mom.

71
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,600
Mom, let go.

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,725
Don't move.

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,059
Mom.

74
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:53,892
Tell her to let go.

75
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:55,600
Just give it to him.

76
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,350
A robber in the daylight!

77
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,809
Let him go.

78
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,225
Bro, come on.

79
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,684
There you go.

80
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:29,975
Stop it there.

81
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,892
Guys, teach him a lesson.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,767
Give me the bag.

83
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,850
Sorry for the trouble
we've caused you, sir.

84
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,850
Don't go.

85
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:24,934
Try again.

86
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,434
Bro, let's get him.

87
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,475
Come on.

88
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,059
Hurry.

89
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,934
- This station?
- Yes.

90
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,224
Is it your mom's first time in Hong Kong?

91
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,142
Yes. First time.

92
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:44,975
Run!

93
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,058
- Thief!
- Stay out of it!

94
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,642
Feng, thief!

95
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,434
Keep an eye on my mom!

96
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:57,392
Mom.

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,183
Auntie! Auntie!

98
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,809
Don't go there!

99
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:05,225
Go.

100
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,766
Stop it.
You shouldn't kill him.

101
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,247
It's none of your business. Get lost.

102
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,474
Play with fire

103
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:38,934
and this is what you get.

104
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:43,517
Mr. Hu, Mahjong again?

105
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,350
Look.

106
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,100
How can you
miss out on Mahjong, sir?

107
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:49,517
It seems

108
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,309
you've won.

109
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,934
Stop pretending. Get up.

110
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,684
Pay up to fix the problem.

111
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,099
What about my share?

112
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,892
That's all.

113
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,684
- That's all?
- Yeah.

114
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,267
Get lost.

115
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,309
Now I've won. Dinner's on me.

116
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:23,059
Go home.

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Go home. Go. Go.

118
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:26,559
Alright.

119
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,642
See you, sir.

120
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,725
- Feng.
- Mom.

121
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,517
Chan, are you okay?

122
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,267
This brave young man saved us.

123
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:37,350
It's nothing.

124
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:38,975
Thanks, man.

125
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,267
It's a small world.

126
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,267
See you around.

127
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,975
I'm Feng. Mention my
name if in any trouble.

128
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,642
Excuse me.

129
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,975
Have you been to Foshan?

130
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,724
Liu, what's taking you so long?

131
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,642
Coming.

132
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:56,767
Give it here.

133
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,475
Thanks.

134
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,309
Look at you.

135
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,558
Young master,
those losers deserved a good beating

136
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,642
for bullying the weak.

137
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:10,517
Let's be lenient wherever possible.

138
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:13,767
Alright.

139
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,434
Enjoy.

140
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,559
Here you are.

141
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,350
Young master,

142
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,892
it's been eight years,

143
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,197
and you still remember my favorite dishes.

144
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,517
Of course.

145
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,975
What brought you here?

146
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,809
My mom needs a doctor.

147
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,100
Is she okay?

148
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:43,184
Same old, same old.

149
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:47,642
Here.

150
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,433
Young master,

151
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,434
that's enough.

152
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:54,184
I thought you loved spice.

153
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,558
We fed on peppers because we lacked food.

154
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,684
Not anymore.

155
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,809
I see.

156
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,225
Have you seen my daughter, Cuihua?

157
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:08,850
No.

158
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,934
- Okay, thank you.
- Cigarettes.

159
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,475
Sir, cigarettes?

160
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,809
Cigarettes.

161
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,100
Cigarettes.

162
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,558
It happens all the time here.

163
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,767
You can't help all of them.

164
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,767
Is that

165
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,267
what everyone believes?

166
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,391
Young master,

167
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,766
stay at my rickshaw yard tonight

168
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,225
if you're not going back to Foshan.

169
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,474
A friend got me this work five years ago.

170
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,891
Now, I have my own business

171
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:44,974
with many buddies.

172
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,599
Come with me and stay

173
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,975
for the Spring Festival.

174
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
Alright.

175
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:50,725
Deal?

176
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,767
Deal.

177
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,684
Alright.

178
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:55,600
Bottoms up!

179
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,059
Cigarettes.

180
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,850
Awesome.

181
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:07,975
Watch it.

182
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:10,184
I can't wait anymore.

183
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,767
Sweetheart.

184
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:13,975
Come on.

185
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,184
What are you doing?

186
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:18,100
Let me go!

187
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:19,809
Come on.

188
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:21,559
What's wrong with you?

189
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,350
You rascal, let's go home.

190
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,434
You rascal, where are you?

191
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,434
Hello?

192
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,559
Auspiciousness brings a bright future.

193
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:55,975
Great name!

194
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,142
I must

195
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,266
redo the paint one day.

196
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,391
I don't want to ruin my bright future.

197
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,474
Very funny.

198
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,933
What an honor to have you here

199
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,391
at my rickshaw yard!

200
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,559
Hello, Feng.

201
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,224
Shui, be careful up there.

202
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,225
Alright.

203
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,641
Young master, how do you say it?

204
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:13,767
It's an "honor"?

205
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,350
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:16,934
Feng.

207
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,559
Why are you up so late?

208
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:22,892
I've been waiting for you.

209
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:25,684
Young master.

210
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:26,725
Let's go.

211
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,517
Mind the steps.

212
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,974
Bufeng,

213
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:32,434
you're doing well.

214
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,809
Thanks.

215
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,974
Chan, this is Young Master,

216
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,184
Ip Man.

217
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,059
Young master,
this is Chan, my sister.

218
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,474
Talk while I get my room

219
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:42,684
ready for you.

220
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:48,684
Hello, Ip Man.

221
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,225
Call him young master.

222
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,809
Don't listen to him.

223
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,100
Call me Ip Man.

224
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:07,517
Nice to meet you, Chan.

225
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,059
The upper bunk is yours.

226
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,684
Alright.

227
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:23,642
Tomorrow,

228
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,974
young master and I will take you around

229
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:26,934
to show you the world.

230
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:27,725
That's great!

231
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,517
Let's see paintings and go to malls.

232
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:30,725
Alright.

233
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,620
I hope you don't mind my humble place.

234
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:34,267
Not at all. It's very nice.

235
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,184
Miss Butterfly!

236
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:39,850
Silly you! What are you doing?

237
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:41,475
Don't hide it.

238
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,725
I didn't know you were a fan.

239
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,892
It's just for the humidity.

240
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,600
I don't know her.

241
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,891
Alright. It's getting late.

242
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:52,974
Let young master rest.

243
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,641
See you. Let's go.

244
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,142
Young master, see you.

245
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,850
Ip Man, thank you for saving us.

246
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,183
- Don't mention it.
- Were you scared?

247
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,267
No.

248
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,892
80 YUAN

249
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,475
So pricy!

250
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:27,849
Miss, would you like to be an actress?

251
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,809
A-actress?

252
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,891
We're talent scouts for a movie company.

253
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,266
This is our business card.

254
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:34,475
Here you are.

255
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,266
Come for an interview when you're free.

256
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,975
We'll pay you.

257
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,308
Chan.

258
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,642
Ip Man.

259
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,267
Let's go.

260
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,308
Nice paintings.

261
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,309
Your friends?

262
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,933
They're talent scouts.

263
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,475
Talent scouts?

264
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:57,225
Where's my brother?

265
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,767
Ice cream.

266
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,184
Ice cream incoming.

267
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,767
Here, Chan, young master,

268
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,059
take it.

269
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,099
Alright.

270
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
I just heard

271
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,684
that Miss Butterfly is coming.

272
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,974
Are actresses popular?

273
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,934
Of course! They're popular
and they make big money.

274
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:15,559
Young master...

275
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:17,641
Miss Butterfly is here!

276
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,099
Miss Butterfly! She's here!

277
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,183
Hold it. Hold it. Miss Butterfly!

278
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:21,892
Bufeng.

279
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,142
Miss Butterfly.

280
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,225
Miss Butterfly is here!

281
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,100
Miss Butterfly!

282
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Miss Butterfly!

283
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:30,975
Miss Butterfly!

284
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,184
Miss Butterfly!

285
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,809
Miss Butterfly!

286
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,267
Miss Butterfly!

287
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,558
Even the yellow faces can be stars as well.

288
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,767
There are two types of people,

289
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,100
expensive

290
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,725
and cheap.

291
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,058
Check it out! Join our movie company

292
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,516
and you'll be the next star.

293
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,434
Check it out!

294
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,099
Join us to be an actress.

295
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,475
We're talent scouts.

296
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:11,099
How are the new buyers?

297
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,934
They need it in one week.

298
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,892
Excuse me.

299
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,016
Young master,

300
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:24,516
even though kung fu helps,

301
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,809
you're carrying too much weight.

302
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:30,392
Just say that you want to drop me off.

303
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,266
He's using twice the strength

304
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,683
for a single job.

305
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,225
What would you do if you were him?

306
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,305
Madam, don't listen to him.

307
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,392
Young man, you don't
look like a rickshaw man.

308
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,850
He's not!

309
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:43,725
Listen,

310
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,933
this is
my young master serving you.

311
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,850
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

312
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,892
Here we are.

313
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:52,975
Here.

314
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:54,392
Alright.

315
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,225
Mind the steps.

316
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,684
Okay, thank you.

317
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,017
Young man,

318
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,599
this is my business card.

319
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,933
I'm Sis Liu.
Come to me for help if needed.

320
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,267
I got your back.

321
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:09,725
Let me see.

322
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:10,975
Get lost.

323
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:14,725
Hurry.

324
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,099
Okay, I'm Ip Man.

325
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,183
Nice to meet you.

326
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,392
See you.

327
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,517
Young master,

328
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,392
only you have that kind of luck.

329
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,725
I'm working for you.

330
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:32,934
And you're making fun of me!

331
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:33,850
Are you making fun of me?

332
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:34,975
Are you?

333
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,392
I also know Wing Chun.

334
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,850
S-stay back.

335
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:38,559
Let's go.

336
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,684
Go. Go.

337
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,017
Here we go.

338
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,809
Young master, easy.

339
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,142
Young master,

340
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,309
you should teach us Wing Chun.

341
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,600
Young master,

342
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,142
let's go.

343
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,434
Quiet!

344
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,224
Young master,

345
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:15,517
those at the port

346
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,392
work for the British.

347
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:19,267
Don't mess with them.

348
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:21,392
Or we'll get into trouble.

349
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:22,684
Let's go.

350
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,225
Young master.

351
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,809
Young master.

352
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:39,809
Move.

353
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,184
Behave.

354
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,016
- Over there.
- Let go!

355
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:43,767
Over there.

356
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,225
Wait.

357
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,392
Who is that?

358
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,267
Why are they tied up?

359
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,224
Help me.

360
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,516
Quiet.

361
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:56,808
It is none of your business.

362
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:57,975
Get lost.

363
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,725
Stand up.

364
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,684
I'm talking to you.

365
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:15,392
You asked for it.

366
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,475
Help.

367
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,350
Mr. Liu.

368
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:39,100
Mr. Liu.

369
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,517
I've been looking for you.

370
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,224
Stop fooling around.

371
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,225
Secretary Li asked me to get you home.

372
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,684
Let's go.

373
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,184
Who are you?

374
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,434
Me?

375
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,517
I'm the head servant of the Liu family.

376
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,517
Detective Liu is waiting for you at home.

377
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,183
Young master, let's go home.

378
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,100
Your dad is the detective?

379
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,599
He...

380
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,225
What? Does he have to
wear a name tag?

381
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:06,767
Young master,

382
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,184
let's go.

383
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:12,100
Help us! Help us!

384
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,683
Help us!

385
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:15,892
Please!

386
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:18,975
Let them go.

387
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:24,767
Otherwise,

388
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,850
I'll put you all in jail!

389
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,017
Thank you.

390
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:42,767
Drop it.

391
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:43,808
Drop it now!

392
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,100
Drop it.

393
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:50,016
Young master.

394
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,225
The detective's son?

395
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,141
Can you tell me

396
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:04,392
where the detective lives?

397
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:09,309
Detective...

398
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,517
Let's hear from you.

399
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:27,642
Detective...

400
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,267
- Feng.
- Young master.

401
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,142
Are you hungry?

402
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:51,309
Let's end this fast and go for food.

403
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,392
It's on Mme.

404
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,142
Young master.

405
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:27,309
Young master.

406
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,809
The girls are safe. Let's go.

407
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,684
Go.

408
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,434
You think the police don't know about this?

409
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:49,434
I know what you're trying to say.

410
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:50,684
I...

411
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:57,892
Slow down.

412
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,684
Someone must stand up against injustice.

413
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,309
There are rules to follow in Hong Kong.

414
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,766
We should mind our own business.

415
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,809
Are we still human
if we give up on justice?

416
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:14,642
We can't give up kindness
and promote evil deeds.

417
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,891
I know those teachings.

418
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,850
But we have to be aware of our status.

419
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,392
Those port people...

420
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:22,975
Never mind.

421
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:25,392
You bookworms are so stubborn.

422
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,724
I'll take sole responsibility.

423
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:31,975
If it bothers you, I'll leave.

424
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,766
Don't even think about it.

425
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:37,475
Let's go.

426
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:38,724
I've got something nice for you.

427
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:39,767
Sir.

428
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,059
What is it?

429
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,266
I'm not telling you.

430
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,100
You'll find out.

431
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,809
Mr. Hu, have some food.

432
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:45,934
Rain check.

433
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,308
Young master, let's go.

434
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,142
Go.

435
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:49,392
Come on.

436
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,725
Young master,

437
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,642
race you there!

438
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:58,267
Step aside.

439
00:26:58,268 --> 00:26:59,725
You're cheating!

440
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,059
Watch out.

441
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:02,434
Look.

442
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,642
Go. You're leading.

443
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:05,808
Let's go.

444
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:06,974
Wing Chun

445
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:09,141
is a woman's fist,

446
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:10,474
but it's so powerful.

447
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:11,475
Huh?

448
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,934
Huh?

449
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:14,974
Lu,

450
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:17,434
it's 10 pounds for one.

451
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,641
So,

452
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:21,225
it's 60 pounds for six.

453
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,225
Find them

454
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,309
or I'll sell your families
to make up for it.

455
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:30,142
Do you hear me?

456
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,267
I made it. I made it.

457
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,434
Hurry up.

458
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,600
Young master,

459
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,809
how about this?

460
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:12,350
Ip Man.

461
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,809
Happy Minor Spring Festival!

462
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:19,017
Happy Minor Spring Festival!

463
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:21,642
When did you set this up?

464
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,392
Happy Minor Spring Festival!

465
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,099
Chan,

466
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,684
why's the stake dressed up?

467
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,725
I...

468
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,684
I thought it might hurt Ip Man's hands.

469
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,059
Ip Man,

470
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:38,475
teach us Wing Chun!

471
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:40,349
- Yeah.
- Please teach us.

472
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,100
Come on.

473
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,309
Show us.

474
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:43,933
Show us, please.

475
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:44,809
You want to learn?

476
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,016
Yeah. Ip Man.

477
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,017
We do.

478
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,434
Show us! Show us!

479
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:49,892
Let me show you, then.

480
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,225
Come on.

481
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:52,559
Show us.

482
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,724
Wing Chun has three forms.

483
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:57,766
Sinking Bridge.

484
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,141
Thrusting Fingers.

485
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,517
Little Idea.

486
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,892
Watch it.

487
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,142
Watch it. It's lit.

488
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,684
Sweet dumplings!

489
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,100
Come and have sweet dumplings.

490
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,266
Chan,

491
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,225
you should be impartial.

492
00:29:58,226 --> 00:29:59,850
Ip Man is more worthy.

493
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,016
Stop it,
or I'll teach you a lesson!

494
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,099
- Bah!
- Come here!

495
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,225
- Come here!
- Hey,

496
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:05,184
watch it.

497
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:06,516
Ip Man, help.

498
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,267
You're spilling the soup!

499
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,600
A poem dedicated to this bowl of soup.

500
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:47,100
The Kitchen God is
reporting to heaven today.

501
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:48,559
Please enjoy.

502
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,892
Mr. Stark,

503
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,892
you're going wild with your piglet business

504
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,850
by snatching people in public.

505
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:01,474
You're making things

506
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:03,309
really hard for us.

507
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,308
You've been doing a good job.

508
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,766
And I believe

509
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,600
you'll do even better.

510
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:22,559
I'm afraid the new superintendent
disagrees with you.

511
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:24,517
Are you referring to

512
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:27,142
Superintendent Weston?

513
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,433
The Governor of Hong Kong
has been concerned about

514
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:32,099
the disappearance of Chinese recently.

515
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,475
You're paying too little in management fees

516
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:36,684
to cover our expenses.

517
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,433
Superintendent Weston said that

518
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:41,100
if you want to continue doing
business in Hong Kong,

519
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:43,392
you should show some sincerity.

520
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,808
He has felt

521
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:48,809
my sincerity.

522
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,642
Superintendent Weston's ring!

523
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,517
Calm down.

524
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:16,017
Peace makes prosperity.

525
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:17,892
Let's eat.

526
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:25,517
I didn't notice how pretty it is.

527
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,184
Look. There.

528
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,475
Chan, isn't it pretty?

529
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:29,725
Yeah.

530
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,933
Ip Man,

531
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,225
have some water.

532
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:34,017
- Thanks.
- Feng.

533
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:35,474
Thanks.

534
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,058
- Chan.
- Listen, Bufeng.

535
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,683
We've been

536
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,766
so busy with day-to-day life.

537
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:41,434
Look.

538
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:42,808
Sometimes, we should look

539
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:44,934
at the sky and the world faraway.

540
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,433
Our ancestors said

541
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,641
that we should be down to earth

542
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:51,183
and focus on

543
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:52,517
living our lives well.

544
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,684
Our ancestors
were too conservative.

545
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,474
That's why the foreigners

546
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,808
have taken over Hong Kong.

547
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,892
We came from over there.

548
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,975
I just want to

549
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,058
provide for my family and friends.

550
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,934
I won't seek to cause trouble.

551
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,724
I don't care who's taking over.

552
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,184
It's all the same.

553
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,684
Is it?

554
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:19,434
Isn't it?

555
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,059
I guess it is.

556
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,224
How can I miss the clean-up

557
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:33,600
of the Minor Spring Festival?

558
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:35,600
Honey,

559
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:38,100
what a nice disciple of yours!

560
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,350
If he shuns the work,

561
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,100
I won't teach him kung fu.

562
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:45,475
Watch it.

563
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,975
Ip Man, give me a hand.

564
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:25,474
Ouch. Be gentle.

565
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,934
Don't overdo it. Be moderate.

566
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,059
Follow the move, not your hands.

567
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:47,808
Use your mind, not your eyes.

568
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,349
Practice your hearing.

569
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,391
So slow!

570
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,600
Honey, come out and help.

571
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,225
Coming.

572
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,642
Master,

573
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,517
why are you so afraid of her?

574
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,892
It's called respect.

575
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,225
Yeah, whatever.

576
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:12,725
Newspaper?

577
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:13,809
Sure.

578
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:14,684
Please.

579
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,100
Spare me some coins.

580
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,434
Thank you.

581
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,267
Check it out.

582
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,559
Check it out.

583
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,559
Check it out.

584
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:29,517
Newspapers. Newspapers.

585
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,267
Get a newspaper.

586
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,266
Get a newspaper.

587
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,475
Newspapers.

588
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,059
Feng.

589
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,975
- Are you okay?
- Here.

590
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:45,892
Feng.

591
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:47,766
Feng, are you okay?

592
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:48,392
I...

593
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:49,600
- You...
- Shui.

594
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:53,142
Stay back.

595
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,100
This...

596
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:00,725
This is my own business.

597
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,767
Stay out of it.

598
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:05,433
Who the hell are you
trying to be a "hero"?

599
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:06,474
Are you risking your neck?

600
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,474
How many times have I told you

601
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,808
to mind your own business?

602
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:11,266
I was trying to help.

603
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:11,892
Yeah, right.

604
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:12,974
You weren't helping.

605
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:14,224
You were nothing

606
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:15,434
but a punching bag.

607
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:16,600
Alright. Alright.

608
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:18,225
Go home.

609
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,683
What's going on?

610
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:21,767
They're fighting.

611
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:28,475
Stop it.

612
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,642
Isn't he the rickshaw guy?

613
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,809
Now I will pay for one.

614
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:42,267
Shut up.

615
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:53,517
What do you want?

616
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,559
Feng.

617
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,892
- Stay back.
- Are you okay?

618
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,642
Stay back.

619
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:00,267
They want money.

620
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,891
I did it, not them.

621
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:05,474
How much do you want?

622
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,600
A thousand pounds.

623
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,392
Do you have the money?

624
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,309
This is blackmail.

625
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,725
If not,

626
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:14,434
you're dead.

627
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,349
That foreigner

628
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,850
is a boxer.

629
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,766
He's using British Bartitsu.

630
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:47,975
What's Bartitsu?

631
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:50,058
Mr. Barton-Wright combined

632
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,224
boxing, Jujutsu, and
wrestling into Bartitsu,

633
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:56,184
a martial art practiced
by the British upper class.

634
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,600
Wreck this place.

635
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,267
Excuse me.

636
00:40:58,642 --> 00:40:59,642
Feng.

637
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,392
Shui.

638
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:07,934
Let's go.

639
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,767
Let's go.

640
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:28,059
Shui.

641
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:29,392
Help.

642
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:30,434
Help!

643
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:31,975
Shui.

644
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Come.

645
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,475
Mom, are you okay?

646
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:37,891
Take Shui to the hospital.

647
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:38,559
Shui.

648
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,642
Stop!

649
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:46,559
This is what you get for seeking justice.

650
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:49,684
Look at this.

651
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,142
Ip Man.

652
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:56,767
Is this justice?

653
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:58,641
Is this righteousness?

654
00:41:58,642 --> 00:41:59,808
Bufeng,

655
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,849
I started this.

656
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,141
I'll take sole responsibility.

657
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:03,142
How?

658
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:05,350
What can you possibly do?

659
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:12,225
Come, this way.

660
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:14,725
Feng.

661
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,475
He's looking for you.

662
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,183
Y-your sister

663
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:21,267
is in danger!

664
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,434
Stop crying!

665
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:41,809
Another dead.

666
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:02,974
Liu, Liu.

667
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,142
Do you remember
the young rickshaw man?

668
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,850
Big news!

669
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:09,391
Don't let the news spread.

670
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:13,975
EXTRA: BRITISH BOXER DEFEATED BY
WING CHUN MASTER

671
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:19,059
You didn't find all of them.

672
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:21,600
As long as I found them...

673
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:34,767
Freeze.

674
00:44:50,975 --> 00:44:52,184
Let my sister go.

675
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:39,392
I've heard that you're quite the fighter.

676
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:41,934
I ruined your business.

677
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:43,142
Take me.

678
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:44,309
Let his sister go.

679
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:54,434
Okay.

680
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,184
Either he

681
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,309
or your sister dies.

682
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:14,600
Stop.

683
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,058
We should let the Chinese

684
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,892
admire the Bartitsu of Great Britain.

685
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,683
In three days,

686
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,517
we'll hold a fight in public.

687
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,934
If you win,

688
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,642
I'll let her go.

689
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,016
Bufeng.

690
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:14,392
Have faith.

691
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,309
We can save Chan for sure!

692
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:18,725
How?

693
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,184
By beating them.

694
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:27,559
Thank you, young master.

695
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:38,517
It's cold.

696
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,849
Let's go home.

697
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,850
Your mom is waiting.

698
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:21,934
Go tell her the news.

699
00:49:23,017 --> 00:49:24,683
I'm getting some medicine for my buddies.

700
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:25,642
Okay.

701
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:27,392
The bill, please.

702
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:30,100
Bufeng.

703
00:49:32,517 --> 00:49:33,725
Let me chip in.

704
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,059
See you.

705
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,725
I know

706
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:06,642
that it's our fault.

707
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,059
I promise

708
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:11,559
I'll pay you back.

709
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,184
Please let us off.

710
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:25,017
I have savings.

711
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:27,975
It may not be enough.

712
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:30,559
I also have a business.

713
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:33,392
I can give you everything.

714
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:36,225
Please

715
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:38,309
let us off.

716
00:51:26,892 --> 00:51:28,309
Enough.

717
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,767
It's not about money anymore.

718
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:43,225
To know oneself is true knowledge.

719
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,725
You know what I want.

720
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:05,684
Okay.

721
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,142
My promise is under one condition.

722
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,684
Let Ip Man off

723
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,892
as well.

724
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:20,600
Mr. Stark,

725
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:22,892
what made you launch this contest?

726
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,766
Some people have said

727
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,641
that British Bartitsu

728
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:31,891
is no match for Chinese Wing Chun.

729
00:52:31,892 --> 00:52:35,267
I must prove that it's a misunderstanding.

730
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,224
Master,

731
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:39,642
look at this.

732
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:43,891
You must remember

733
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:46,684
to hold your camera real tight.

734
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,766
I'm afraid I'll win so fast

735
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,267
you won't even get to click the shutter.

736
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,850
Wing Chun against Bartitsu?

737
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,724
News! News!

738
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:02,683
Wing Chun against Bartitsu!

739
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:03,933
News! News!

740
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,392
Get a newspaper.

741
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,517
Check it out.

742
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,392
Guys.

743
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,225
Here.

744
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,225
Wing Chun against Bartitsu.

745
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:11,933
That'd be interesting.

746
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:13,309
Not necessarily.

747
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:38,975
This contest

748
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:43,517
between Bartitsu and Wing Chun

749
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:47,100
is a friendly exchange.

750
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,474
This contest

751
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:53,058
between Bartitsu and Wing Chun

752
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:55,392
is friendly communication.

753
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,099
Whoever

754
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,809
gets off the stage

755
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:03,142
or

756
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:05,350
Pounds on the ground three times

757
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:07,059
loses.

758
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:09,517
Just surrender if you can't

759
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:10,767
take it.

760
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:13,642
We'll find another way to save Chan.

761
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:15,642
I got this.

762
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:19,225
The contest

763
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:20,766
may lead to death

764
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:22,100
or injury.

765
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,808
No one

766
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:25,349
shall take

767
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,225
any legal responsibilities.

768
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:28,934
It's quite hot.

769
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,100
Wipe your sweat.

770
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,183
The contest may lead to death or injury.

771
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:35,142
No one shall
take any legal responsibilities.

772
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,433
I hereby announce that

773
00:54:37,434 --> 00:54:40,474
the contest between Wing Chun and Bartitsu

774
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:41,767
starts now!

775
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:45,142
Yeah!

776
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:48,059
Yeah!

777
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:53,974
Yeah!

778
00:54:53,975 --> 00:55:00,559
Ip Man! Ip Man!

779
00:55:01,184 --> 00:55:03,309
Bartitsu!

780
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:36,516
- Go!
- Go!

781
00:55:36,517 --> 00:55:40,100
Go!

782
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:42,350
Wing Chun, Ip Man.

783
00:56:08,392 --> 00:56:09,725
This is not good.

784
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:39,100
Bravo! Bravo!

785
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:39,975
- Bravo!
- Not bad.

786
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,225
Well done!

787
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,309
Well done!

788
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,850
Sit tight.

789
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:07,142
Master Ip, what's wrong?

790
00:57:07,143 --> 00:57:08,183
Don't push it.

791
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:09,184
Look.

792
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,016
Something's wrong.

793
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:13,100
No. Rest assured.

794
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:16,849
There's something wrong with Master Ip.

795
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,850
Yeah.

796
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:31,684
Bravo!

797
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,100
Get up, Master Ip.

798
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:37,725
Get up, Master Ip.

799
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,892
Young master, stop it.

800
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,850
Master Ip.

801
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,600
Young master.

802
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,309
Get up.

803
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:45,434
Master Ip. Master Ip.

804
00:57:45,934 --> 00:57:50,350
Master Ip. Get up.

805
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,684
Stop it, young master.

806
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:56,392
Master Ip.

807
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,808
Come on, Master Ip! Get up!

808
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,892
Fight him!

809
00:58:02,267 --> 00:58:04,350
Bartitsu!

810
00:58:05,225 --> 00:58:06,350
Stop!

811
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:08,225
Just stop!

812
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,559
Young master!

813
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:15,725
Yeah!

814
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:16,975
That's the spirit!

815
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,225
Kill him!

816
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:53,975
You're here!

817
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,350
Host,

818
00:59:23,475 --> 00:59:24,558
we give in!

819
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:25,849
Stop it now, please!

820
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,017
We give in!

821
00:59:45,684 --> 00:59:47,434
Stand up!

822
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:52,891
Come on!

823
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:54,059
Master Ip!

824
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,184
Young master.

825
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:04,434
We give in!

826
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,475
We are done fighting!

827
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:08,892
Young master!

828
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:11,184
Get up!

829
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,224
Get up, Ip Man!

830
01:00:13,225 --> 01:00:15,058
Come one, Ip Man!

831
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:18,850
Ip Man, get up!

832
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:24,975
Hello, Ip Man.

833
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:26,975
We can save Chan for sure!

834
01:00:28,267 --> 01:00:29,684
Ip Man, help.

835
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,474
Young master, this is all my fault!

836
01:00:32,475 --> 01:00:33,767
It's my fault!

837
01:00:34,517 --> 01:00:35,767
Young master!

838
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:48,809
Young master!

839
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:51,183
Young master, please! Stop now!

840
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:53,392
Do not continue!

841
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:57,558
There you go! Get up!

842
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,142
Get up, Ip Man.

843
01:00:59,684 --> 01:01:02,349
Young master!

844
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,642
Ip Man! Ip Man!

845
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:07,184
There you go!

846
01:01:08,184 --> 01:01:13,267
Ip Man! Ip Man! Ip Man!

847
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:18,974
Ip Man! Ip Man!

848
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,100
Yeah!

849
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,267
That's the spirit!

850
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:24,184
There you go, Ip Man!

851
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,934
Follow the move, not your hands.
Use your mind, not your eyes.

852
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:28,267
Ip Man, hit him! Hit him!

853
01:02:29,975 --> 01:02:37,975
Ip Man! Ip Man! Ip Man!

854
01:02:48,892 --> 01:02:52,475
We won!

855
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:56,309
He did it! We won!

856
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:02,225
Nice win, Master Ip!

857
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:03,309
Hooray!

858
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,558
Great! We won!

859
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,475
Ip Man!

860
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,975
Yes! We won!

861
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:13,184
Yeah!

862
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:24,892
Bufeng!

863
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,392
Bufeng!

864
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,100
Control the fire!

865
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,183
Bufeng! Bufeng! Bufeng!

866
01:04:41,184 --> 01:04:42,684
Man!

867
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,267
Master!

868
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:45,600
Where is Bufeng?

869
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:50,933
- Move!
- Move aside!

870
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:52,434
Move! Move!

871
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,892
What is it?

872
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,059
They are here.

873
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,225
What...

874
01:04:58,934 --> 01:05:00,184
Move aside! Move!

875
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,100
Get lost!

876
01:05:02,892 --> 01:05:04,059
Have you seen this guy?

877
01:05:04,225 --> 01:05:05,225
No.

878
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:07,100
Find him!

879
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:08,267
Go go go!

880
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,724
Over there!

881
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:12,725
Quick!

882
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:13,725
Move aside!

883
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:14,934
Move!

884
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,559
Move!

885
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:22,350
What are you doing?

886
01:05:28,017 --> 01:05:29,100
Go go!

887
01:05:29,434 --> 01:05:30,517
Amen!

888
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,559
Let's go.

889
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:41,767
Over there!

890
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:43,017
Quick!

891
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,891
Get them!

892
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:00,892
They are on the run!

893
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:02,309
Go get him!

894
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:14,100
Master,

895
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:16,684
is this my fault?

896
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:21,267
If asking for justice is wrong,

897
01:06:21,684 --> 01:06:23,850
then this world would be hopeless.

898
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:27,767
Righteousness

899
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,392
can be either forgotten

900
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,767
or awakened.

901
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,684
Forgetting is easy,

902
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:37,267
but

903
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,266
for awakening,

904
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:41,767
that's where you always pay the price.

905
01:06:47,184 --> 01:06:48,892
Chinese kung fu

906
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:51,684
is not just about the moves.

907
01:06:52,184 --> 01:06:53,391
It contains

908
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:56,225
the wisdom and spirit of Chinese Culture.

909
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:59,892
You have learned the spirit of justice,

910
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,975
but pleading for justice

911
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:05,975
requires good timing and chance.

912
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:08,016
Moreover,

913
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:10,725
wisdom and resourcefulness are needed.

914
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:26,934
Feet!

915
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:28,809
Feet!

916
01:09:14,142 --> 01:09:18,392
RICKSHAW YARD MYSTERY EXPLOSION

917
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,642
To my dearest master,

918
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,475
What happened recently is all my fault.

919
01:09:58,184 --> 01:10:00,309
My actions were definitely not wise.

920
01:10:02,267 --> 01:10:04,017
As you have said before,

921
01:10:04,892 --> 01:10:08,058
asking for justice and
awakening righteousness

922
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:11,267
require wisdom and resourcefulness.

923
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:13,099
I, Man,

924
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,892
shall heed your words.

925
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:18,600
I have decided to go save the others.

926
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,725
Master, please do not worry about me.

927
01:10:21,642 --> 01:10:23,183
A true warrior

928
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:25,058
shall have both wisdom and bravery,

929
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:27,100
and let his spirit last long.

930
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:29,434
IP MAN

931
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,600
Ms. Liu, this is Ip Man.

932
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,559
We are all Chinese.

933
01:10:57,017 --> 01:10:58,142
I don't want to hurt you.

934
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:08,224
You are the first Chinese

935
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:10,017
who dares to confront me.

936
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,725
And you will be the last.

937
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:36,934
Ip Man!

938
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:17,934
Go on, go!

939
01:15:18,267 --> 01:15:19,766
What are you looking at?
Behave yourself!

940
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:20,434
Go!

941
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:22,850
Speed up!

942
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,391
Ms. Liu, this is Ip Man.

943
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:42,224
Ip Man, you are awesome.

944
01:15:42,225 --> 01:15:43,266
Move move move!

945
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:44,892
Maybe you are trustworthy.

946
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,391
The British have been selling our people

947
01:15:47,392 --> 01:15:49,059
at Dock B3.

948
01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:51,517
That place was run by the British.

949
01:15:52,059 --> 01:15:52,850
That's right.

950
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,850
This is a tough situation.

951
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,642
Yeah, I know that.

952
01:15:54,642 --> 01:15:55,434
Breaking news! Breaking news!

953
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:57,517
No other papers will
dare to report this piece!

954
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,517
I wonder if you can work this out.

955
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:04,058
Give back our liberty!

956
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,183
All men are created equal!

957
01:16:07,184 --> 01:16:10,724
Give back our liberty!

958
01:16:10,725 --> 01:16:13,808
No violence!

959
01:16:13,809 --> 01:16:16,599
No oppression!

960
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,934
No hegemonism!

961
01:16:25,017 --> 01:16:28,308
We will thoroughly investigate
the dock and evil forces,

962
01:16:28,309 --> 01:16:30,767
and return the truth to the people.

963
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:34,141
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE

964
01:16:34,142 --> 01:16:38,392
RICKSHAW YARD
CAUGHT ON FIRE

965
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:46,850
Master, this way.

966
01:16:47,059 --> 01:16:48,785
What a bustling day!
People are waiting for you!

967
01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:50,058
Young master,
join us for the ribbon-cutting later!

968
01:16:50,059 --> 01:16:50,725
Sure.

969
01:16:50,726 --> 01:16:52,517
Chan, mom! Come on!

970
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,683
Here, here!

971
01:16:55,684 --> 01:16:56,684
Here!

972
01:16:56,892 --> 01:16:57,684
Get around!

973
01:16:57,725 --> 01:16:58,974
Come one, let's cut the ribbon together.

974
01:16:58,975 --> 01:16:59,850
Come here, master!

975
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,100
Come out!

976
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:14,600
Okay.

977
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:15,850
Ms. Liu,

978
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,309
how did you manage
to get people to the dock?

979
01:17:19,684 --> 01:17:22,044
I told them that Miss Butterfly was there,
shooting a movie.

979
01:17:23,305 --> 01:18:23,167
