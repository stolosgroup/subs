00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,469
Doctor Carl Anderson at Seoin Research Institute

4
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,556
was killed in a terrorist attack this morning.

5
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,395
Are you sure about this?

6
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:38,445
The problem is the grave danger it poses
from this experiment.

7
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,742
Okay.

8
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,745
I will get back to you soon.

9
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:52,125
Just let me remind you,
we don't have much time.

10
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,089
It's been confirmed.
It was a terrorist attack.

11
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,341
Who could they be?

12
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,094
{\an8}We don't have any leads yet,

13
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,972
but we're certain
the project has been exposed.

14
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,143
What are you going to do?

15
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,354
The project needs to be moved
to a safer location.

16
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,691
Moved? That's out of the question.

17
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,821
- We're in the final stages.
- Isn't project security the top priority?

18
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,449
The chance of another attack is high

19
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,410
and the target is obvious.

20
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,954
You need to make a decision.

21
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,419
Okay, but under one condition.

22
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,149
You can't just show up like this.

23
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,360
I haven't slept in two days
because of the headaches.

24
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,906
A man needs to sleep to live, okay?

25
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you...

26
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,840
- If you keep on this way...
- Fuck, I'm not going to die!

27
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,136
I won't let this kill me.
So don't worry about me.

28
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,144
What...

29
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,647
- What the...
- Mr. Min Ki-hun?

30
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,065
I'm with the company.

31
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,412
Where are you taking me?

32
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,040
Who sent you?

33
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,962
WARNING
WATER SOURCE CONSERVATION AREA

34
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,808
This way.

35
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,102
You're still alive.

36
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,772
Did you miss me?

37
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,901
I guess that's a no.

38
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,280
It's been two years.
You're not happy to see me?

39
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,075
You brought me here? What is it?

40
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,036
What the hell do you want?

41
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,832
Don't get all jumpy. It's not a good look.

42
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:05,170
By the way, you look like shit.

43
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,589
Just tell me what you want.

44
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,717
I'm not the one who called you.

45
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,148
Ki-hun.

46
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,904
Long time no see. How are you feeling?

47
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,032
I'm fine.

48
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,952
I see. That's good to hear.

49
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,914
I need you to do a job for me.

50
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,626
What kind of a job?

51
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,838
A job for your country, of course.

52
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,552
I don't work for the company anymore.

53
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:59,016
Of course that's because
I need someone I can trust.

54
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,644
Can you trust me?

55
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,108
Can't I trust you?

56
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,453
Remember the day Hyun-soo passed?

57
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,290
It's been three years, hasn't it?

58
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,502
Time flies, right?

59
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,306
What is the job?

60
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,601
It involves a classified project
of national importance.

61
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,020
That's all you need to know.

62
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,917
Director Ahn told me about you.

63
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,294
You must be Mr. Min.

64
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,214
I'm Dr. Shin Hak-sun.

65
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,220
We raised the security level
due to a recent terrorist attack.

66
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,473
We don't think they hit their real target.

67
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,841
Sir, the data is out.

68
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,441
What is all this?

69
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,693
Research for the future.

70
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,908
So this ship is a research lab?

71
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,326
Correct.

72
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,706
Why would you carry out
work like this on a ship?

73
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,709
Consider it a kind of ark.

74
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,763
Let me introduce you to Dr. Lim.
She's in charge here.

75
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,768
Ten years ago,

76
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,730
we successfully cultured genetically
manipulated embryonic stem cells.

77
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,317
We inserted the hematopoietic stem cells

78
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,529
into a fertilized egg
through nuclear replacements,

79
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,907
then the egg was implanted into a womb.

80
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,161
After a seven-month pregnancy,
the specimen was created.

81
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,664
The male specimen grew
at a speed twice the regular rate

82
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,084
- of an average human--
- Hang on.

83
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,630
Specimen?

84
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,925
What is that?

85
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,177
Can you open the window?

86
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,363
This boy is the first-ever
human specimen created

87
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,448
through stem cell cloning
and genetic manipulation.

88
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,954
Are you saying he's a cloned human?

89
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:53,083
I don't know if we can call him human.

90
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,044
If potato roots sprout
from a tomato plant,

91
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,672
what should we call them?

92
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,676
He has special genes that are
nonexistent in humans.

93
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,722
He's a new species, if you like.

94
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,190
He's our first successful case.

95
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,861
In the early days, cloning was simply
creating exact copies of the original DNA.

96
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,614
But Seobok is different.

97
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,118
His genes were entirely modified
through genetic manipulation.

98
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,079
Seobok?

99
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,958
Oh, that's the specimen's name.

100
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,589
Emperor Qin sent off his servant

101
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,885
to search for the elixir of immortality
2,500 years ago.

102
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,430
That servant represents humanity's
desire to overcome death.

103
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,975
Seobok was named after him.

104
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,316
Seobok is an undying being.

105
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,200
His bone marrow produces IPS cells,

106
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,370
which are dedifferentiating stem cells.

107
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,999
His IPS proteins can cure
any and all human diseases.

108
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,962
Through him, humans can conquer death.

109
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,926
With Anderson gone, Seobok is the
only existing source of this technology.

110
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,428
He must be protected at all costs.

111
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,643
Damn it. This is...

112
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,938
I know it's hard to believe.

113
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,484
I mean, this is ridiculous.
Don't you think so?

114
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,195
It's not like you can see
that he doesn't die.

115
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,573
He looks like an ordinary kid.

116
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,576
He's anything but.

117
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,161
Let me show you something.

118
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,291
You may begin.

119
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,016
It's an unexpected side effect.

120
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,229
We don't fully understand
how it's possible.

121
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,650
Seobok has brainwaves
far more powerful than us,

122
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:09,112
so we can only assume
he controls the pressure around him.

123
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,449
That's far from ordinary.

124
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:19,623
I guess it's interesting,
sort of like magic.

125
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,423
You can stop now.

126
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,529
I guess it happens frequently.

127
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,740
And it gets worse
when stressed or fatigued?

128
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,119
Loss of consciousness
due to a brain tumor.

129
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,873
Is it glioblastoma?

130
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:06,461
I guess you have about
six months to a year at best.

131
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,046
Mind your own fucking business.

132
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,132
I'm offering a clinical trial.

133
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,802
I can treat you using Seobok.

134
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,682
I can save your life.

135
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,190
When the Hwang scandal destroyed
the stem cell research environment,

136
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,816
Seoin approached us.

137
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,320
They'd help us if we help them
with their human cloning research.

138
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,405
Help you with what?

139
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,408
You know what happened that year.

140
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,746
The government then
didn't think much of it.

141
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,541
They could use the money from Seoin

142
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,920
and take credit for the work
if it succeeded.

143
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,548
But it produced an unexpected outcome.

144
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,510
An undying specimen.

145
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,599
They had to study the specimen
to determine its nature,

146
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,936
and ten years passed just like that.

147
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,065
Frankly, we had forgotten about it

148
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,694
until Anderson was killed last night.

149
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,990
He was due to submit
the final report next month.

150
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,868
Who's behind it?

151
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,828
It could have been anyone.

152
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,705
After all, this is a powerful weapon.

153
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,666
Weapon?

154
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:29,336
What do you think a weapon is?

155
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,631
The essence of a weapon is fear.

156
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,843
The fear that it can kill you.

157
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,513
A technology of immortality

158
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:43,725
is a powerful weapon
for everyone who fears death.

159
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,104
And all men die,

160
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,315
just like you.

161
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,154
We're moving the specimen
to a secret bunker in Wonju.

162
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,366
Seoin wants to conduct
a clinical trial there.

163
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,202
We need a participant for the trial,

164
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,080
someone who's not a security liability.

165
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,958
That's why I contacted you.

166
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,255
So, what do you say?

167
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,681
I'll do it.

168
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,975
Let me be a part of it.

169
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,619
What are they injecting him with?

170
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,495
An inhibitor.

171
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,830
What for?

172
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,877
To suppress cell division,

173
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,962
which is too rapid.

174
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,551
Like an anticancer drug?

175
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,012
Yes, exactly.

176
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,392
He needs one every 24 hours.

177
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,895
He gets one every day?

178
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:14,858
Yes, otherwise the cell division process
will spiral out of control.

179
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,318
What happens then?

180
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,737
He'll die.

181
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,532
But you said he can't die.

182
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,492
Of course he can.

183
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,412
Wouldn't he die
if he was shot or hit by a car?

184
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,498
He's not invincible.

185
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,301
I heard you'll take part in the trial.

186
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,889
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

187
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,937
I don't know if it's something
to be congratulated for. By the way...

188
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,984
How likely are the chances of success?

189
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,988
Since it's the first trial, no one knows.

190
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,282
If it fails,

191
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,702
what happens to me?

192
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,749
Worst case scenario,

193
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,502
you will die, which will happen anyway.

194
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,214
Preparation for relocation ready.

195
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,717
Preparation for relocation ready.

196
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:31,268
People are so easily scared, aren't they?
And greedy as well.

197
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,319
What the hell is she saying?

198
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,948
And she's smoking in a room and shit.

199
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,008
Don't worry, we'll be there soon.

200
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,764
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together. I'm Min Ki-hun.

201
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,601
Mr. Min Ki-hun?

202
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,735
You don't have to be formal.
Just call me Ki-hun.

203
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,198
Have you ever used that before?

204
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,701
This? Of course.

205
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,830
I'm quite a good shot.

206
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,625
On a person?

207
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,795
Did he die?

208
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,465
How many have you killed?

209
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,135
Why do you want to know?

210
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,435
What's going on?

211
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,022
It's an ambulance. We'll give way for it.

212
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,571
Are we changing routes?
Why are you not taking the expressway?

213
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:09,950
There's been an accident,
so we're making a detour.

214
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,535
Copy.

215
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,958
Mr. Min's onto us. What should we do?

216
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
Don't worry about him.

217
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,962
How much longer?

218
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,714
We'll be arriving in 30 minutes.

219
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,592
Keep him distracted.

220
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,969
The Americans will be waiting for you.

221
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,305
They'll take it from there.

222
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,225
Get out of there after contact
and report to me right away.

223
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,729
What do we do with Mr. Min?

224
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,440
Hand him over too.
The Americans will take care of him.

225
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,275
Yes, sir.

226
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:50,991
What the hell?

227
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:09,885
What's going on?

228
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,816
Who the hell are those men?

229
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,614
No!

230
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,045
Hey Mr. Min?

231
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,840
Are you okay?

232
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:48,924
What?

233
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,217
Good.

234
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,777
- No one's answering?
- They're offline, sir.

235
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,487
Dammit...

236
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:30,716
Are you there?

237
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:31,967
Yes.

238
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,637
Where are we?

239
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,598
I don't know.

240
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,474
Who were those men?

241
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,812
- I don't know.
- You saw nothing? What the hell happened?

242
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,773
You fell asleep, Mr. Min.

243
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,208
Who's that?

244
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,335
The men from earlier.

245
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,045
Who the fuck are you?

246
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,473
No.

247
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:20,933
What's happening?

248
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,768
I said no.

249
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,644
What?

250
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,189
No, no! He said no!

251
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,064
John.

252
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,275
You okay?

253
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,409
John, come in.

254
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:35,651
Hold on!

255
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:01,969
And the specimen?

256
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,220
He's fine.

257
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,681
What's your location?

258
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,895
- Near Boeun, in Chungbuk Province.
- What's the nearest safe house?

259
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:13,522
Now!

260
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,025
- Point 14, sir. Five kilometers away.
- Show me.

261
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,820
Jangam-ri 585, Deungcheon.

262
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,865
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, Jangam-ri 585.

263
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,701
Go there. I'll dispatch backup right away.

264
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:26,660
Yes, sir.

265
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,337
Where are we going?

266
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,715
It's still dangerous.
We need to get to safety.

267
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,301
- Why is it dangerous?
- What?

268
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,720
Shit!

269
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:55,397
We'll have to walk.

270
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:02,529
- Come on, what are you doing?
- Why is it dangerous?

271
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,826
There's no time for this.

272
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,205
Hey...

273
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,331
Hey!

274
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,376
Why am I in danger?

275
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,420
You saw everything earlier.

276
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,465
- Bad guys are after you--
- Why?

277
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:24,134
Why are they after me?

278
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,011
What do you mean why?
Because you're the...

279
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,348
Because I'm the specimen?

280
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,311
Because I don't die?

281
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,946
I guess you already know.

282
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:49,076
The bad guys are trying to
steal the technology from you.

283
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,954
That's why you're in danger. Okay?

284
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,251
Men are so foolish.

285
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,503
What are you talking about?

286
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,798
We don't have time for this. Let's go.

287
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,637
How do I know you're not a bad guy?

288
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:14,893
- Do I look like one?
- You don't look like a good guy either.

289
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,564
Why do you think
I'm going through this shit?

290
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,107
Why?

291
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,818
To protect you! Can't you see that?

292
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,989
Why are you trying to protect me?

293
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,703
Because my life depends on it.

294
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,831
Are you going to do this?

295
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,584
- Come at me, then!
- Come here!

296
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:27,883
Hurry up already.

297
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,954
We can't just stop.
We need to keep moving.

298
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,838
Can't we go slower?

299
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,047
What for?

300
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:11,217
- So I can look around.
- Look around?

301
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,016
Look, we don't have time for that.
Just hurry up.

302
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:34,783
Hey.

303
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,120
Hey!

304
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,924
Holy crap.

305
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,559
Who are you?

306
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,271
- Who is it?
- What?

307
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,441
Yes. Just some kid.

308
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,990
He looks like he's not all there.

309
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,996
Where do you live?

310
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:25,167
Where is your mom?

311
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,671
What the hell are you doing?

312
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,256
Oh, you're with your brother.

313
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,551
You should take better care of him.

314
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,512
He looks like he needs it.

315
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,515
Don't let him walk around
looking like a lost puppy.

316
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,433
Come with me.

317
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,817
Damn it. Hey.

318
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,376
Hello?

319
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,545
Anybody?

320
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,551
Good thinking.

321
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:19,513
He'll look much better in nice clothes.
You're a good brother.

322
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:21,431
Try on whatever you like.

323
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:29,648
It's 74,000 won,
but let's call it 73,000 won.

324
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,900
Your little brother is so handsome.

325
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,125
He knows his fashion too.

326
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,495
Hey! Get away from the window.

327
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,343
Don't touch anything.

328
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,387
Just stay put.

329
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,000
What are you doing?

330
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,713
You told me to stay put, Mr. Min.

331
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,132
Well, be quiet. You're distracting me.

332
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,305
And stop calling me Mr. Min.

333
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,182
I'm not your teacher.

334
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,184
Unbelievable.

335
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,688
I have a question.

336
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:17,983
What is it?

337
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,195
Why are you always angry, Mr. Min?

338
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,864
Since when was I angry?

339
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,503
Hey, are you hungry?

340
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:40,255
Yes.

341
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,435
Why aren't you eating?

342
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:59,983
- Can't you use chopsticks?
- I don't know how.

343
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,785
Use this instead.

344
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,682
Good?

345
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,120
You've already had three!

346
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,969
I don't know what the hell I'm doing...

347
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,347
This is why you should watch
what your kids eat.

348
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,851
What do they feed him, anyway?

349
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,895
I get a special supplement.

350
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:22,441
Shame on them
for treating a kid like that.

351
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:30,365
Not yet. Give it a couple of minutes.

352
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,089
How did you know?

353
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,467
Know what?

354
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,302
That you're a specimen.

355
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,513
Mom told me.

356
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,265
You have a mom?

357
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,185
You met her.

358
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:05,150
Oh... Dr. Lim is your mom?

359
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,861
So you have a mom.

360
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:11,573
What? You don't have one?

361
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,202
No.

362
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,331
That's too bad.

363
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,673
You've lived there your whole life?

364
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:32,261
- Yes.
- What do you do all day?

365
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:35,889
I get tested.

366
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,392
Eat.

367
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,312
And I read.

368
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:44,940
That's it?

369
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,277
You get tested and eat?

370
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,279
That's your whole life?

371
00:42:57,077 --> 00:43:00,163
It's okay, you're doing great.

372
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,750
What else, then?

373
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,507
Go on, eat. Your noodles will get soggy.

374
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,266
But you must be doing something
in your free time

375
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,852
besides just sitting around.

376
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:25,022
- I keep on thinking.
- About what?

377
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,067
About my fate.

378
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,592
Mr. Min, we're from the company.

379
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:54,718
Punch in the code.

380
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:06,605
Identify yourself.

381
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:10,943
Yum Kyung-jae from Domestic Team 3.

382
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,156
Are we leaving now?

383
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,741
Yes, please get ready.

384
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,875
Is that the specimen?

385
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:31,755
Hey, hey!

386
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,759
- What's this?
- We have orders to take him out.

387
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,720
- Who the fuck told you that?
- I can't say.

388
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,848
I can clear everything up,
just put the gun down.

389
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,015
Step aside.

390
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,601
I said put the gun down!

391
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:47,813
If you won't step aside,
we have no choice.

392
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:52,359
Go on then. Shoot me.

393
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,194
Shoot.

394
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,561
Is it done?

395
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,021
This is Ki-hun.

396
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,149
Explain yourself.

397
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,319
Ki-hun...

398
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:21,031
I'll tell you everything,
but right now, listen to me.

399
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:27,037
Take out the specimen immediately.

400
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,791
Did you hear me? Kill it now.

401
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,836
That's an order.

402
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:40,300
- What about me?
- What?

403
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,261
Am I supposed to just die?

404
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:46,181
Wake up, Min. This is for the country.

405
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:48,892
How is this for the country?
It's just for you.

406
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,520
You think I'll fall for that shit again?

407
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:53,146
Are you disobeying my order?

408
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,148
Order, my ass.

409
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,401
Do you want to die, you fucking asshole?

410
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:01,321
No, dumbass. I want the exact opposite.

411
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:02,781
Fuck off.

412
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,665
Is Seobok okay?

413
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:14,960
- Yes, he's fine.
- What are you going to do?

414
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:17,212
You should bring him to the lab.

415
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:20,424
You can't go to intelligence now.

416
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:24,761
We can offer you protection here.

417
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:36,023
- He's bringing him in.
- Good. Then...

418
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,193
We should get ready for our guests.

419
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,320
Now, sir?

420
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,697
Why? Is there a problem?

421
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,532
Preparation will take time and--

422
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:46,742
You idiot.

423
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,161
Look what they are doing.

424
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,496
I didn't do all this
so someone could take it from me.

425
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:04,885
Come on, get in.

426
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,638
Where are we going now?

427
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:10,807
To the lab.
It's the only place we can trust.

428
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,810
No. I don't want to go there.

429
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,109
Then where?

430
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,195
I need to go somewhere.

431
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,281
You have no place to go.

432
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,033
Ulsan.

433
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,577
Why?

434
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,498
You don't have to know.

435
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,878
You little shit. Get in the car!

436
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,218
You don't have to come with me.

437
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,221
I can go on my own.

438
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:55,477
And how will you do that?

439
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:01,191
With this.

440
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:05,612
- Where did you get that?
- From the house.

441
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:06,738
That's not yours.

442
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,657
It's not yours either.

443
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,876
I don't know what you're thinking,

444
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,420
but you can't keep running like this.

445
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:23,714
There's no time.

446
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,966
I know.

447
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:30,345
And you need your injection.
We need to get back.

448
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,764
I know.

449
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,516
What do you know?

450
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:37,978
I said I know.

451
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,195
Tell me.

452
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,699
What's in Ulsan?

453
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,492
At least give me that.

454
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:56,705
Do you really want to know?

455
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,166
I want to know what we're going for.

456
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:03,170
By any chance,

457
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:07,382
do you know someone there?

458
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:12,763
Yes.

459
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,723
Who?

460
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,105
Who is it? Tell me.

461
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,030
No. It's better you don't know.

462
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,129
Back at the safe house...

463
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:52,553
Did you bend the bullets and smash things?

464
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,473
Yes. Why?

465
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,853
Nothing. Just curious.

466
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,274
Why didn't you step aside?

467
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,483
What?

468
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:08,902
When they pulled their guns,

469
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:12,781
why didn't you step aside?

470
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:20,956
Because... if you die, I die.

471
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,087
Of course.

472
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,260
But why are you dying?

473
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,222
It's a punishment.

474
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:57,951
- What's wrong?
- It's okay.

475
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,662
- No, you're not!
- I'm fine.

476
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,634
It's been a long time, Mr. Chairman.

477
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:15,511
You've been well?

478
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:16,929
Why are you trying to kill it?

479
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:17,888
Sorry?

480
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,015
The specimen.
Why are you trying to kill it?

481
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,808
What are you talking about, sir?

482
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,769
You met with the Americans, didn't you?

483
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:28,232
Come clean. Only then can we talk.

484
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,610
What did they want?

485
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:41,119
Futurists from the scientific communities
have been warning about this

486
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:45,123
Life Revolution Hypothersis
for quite a long time.

487
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,627
In fact, humans are the only species

488
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,131
that are aware of their own inevitable mortality,
and are afraid of it.

489
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:58,804
That very fear of knowing
that life someday will end

490
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:02,933
is what makes them pursue a meaning in life.

491
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:07,604
However, if life does not end,

492
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:15,487
people will lose that human element.
And what will be left is nothing but greed and desire.

493
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:20,284
Immortality will produce unsatisfiable desires

494
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,786
and continuous conflicts.

495
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:28,917
Paradoxically, death is the fundamental
element holding life together.

496
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:35,090
In other words, if people become immortal,

497
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:40,179
mankind will lead itself to extinction.

498
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:45,767
We must prevent Seoin
from conducting this experiment.

499
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,812
We will take over the specimen
under our protection

500
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:52,900
until this technology is proven
to be safe and validated.

501
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,487
Will Seoin agree to this?

502
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:03,035
Well, that's exactly why we need you
to hand over this specimen to us by any means,

503
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,370
regardless of how you do it.

504
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:09,750
And we will handle it afterwards,
as we see fit, accordingly.

505
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:15,422
I mean, how am I supposed to?

506
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:20,719
Well, if you cannot fulfill our request,

507
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:25,974
then it leaves us no other choice
but to initiate the second protocol.

508
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:32,231
Starting with the eradication of all the personnel
and materials from this experiment.

509
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:36,693
That's the only way to prevent it
from being exposed to the outside world.

510
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:43,450
So you know, I can't say for sure
you're not on that list.

511
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:53,001
So you planned to give it
to the Americans from the beginning.

512
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,461
You lied to me.

513
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:56,672
That's the only way to end this quietly.

514
00:54:56,713 --> 00:55:00,634
And you actually trust them?

515
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,970
They want it because
they want it for themselves.

516
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:06,265
Sir, one thing I know for sure is that,

517
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:09,142
if this experiment is revealed,
none of us will make it out.

518
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:13,021
You little useless coward.

519
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:16,775
If we destroy the specimen, everyone
goes home happy. Please listen to me.

520
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,026
Not happening.

521
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,363
You think your dirty look will kill me?

522
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:24,658
You think I'll sit back
and watch you screw me over?

523
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,620
What are you going to do, then?

524
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,416
You've got the money,

525
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,085
but that's it.

526
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,087
Listen to me.

527
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,260
Do as I say if you still want
that sad old life of yours.

528
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,929
This is the state affairs,

529
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:49,183
and you're just a businessman.
So just stay in your fucking lane!

530
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:54,438
You stupid fool.

531
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,465
- How much?
- A full tank.

532
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:22,424
Yes, sir.

533
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,843
Give me some money.

534
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,137
- Why?
- We're out of gas.

535
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,140
Pay the guy when he's done.

536
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,644
- Can I use your restroom?
- It's in the back.

537
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:44,446
Can I use your phone?

538
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,740
You still don't have their location?

539
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,993
The search area is too big.

540
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,207
This country has all the CCTVs
in the known world.

541
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,585
Scan every one of them

542
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,505
and find them no matter what!

543
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:13,267
Do you want a receipt?

544
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,026
It's me.

545
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,195
Where are you?

546
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,155
We're on our way

547
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:30,993
but Seobok vomited blood. Is that okay?

548
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,745
He's been off his inhibitor for two days.

549
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,164
His brainwaves must be off the charts.

550
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:40,544
You need to bring him in right now,

551
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,546
or his life's at risk.

552
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:45,424
Okay. I'll get there as soon as I can.

553
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,563
Who's he?

554
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:03,692
I don't know,
but the creep's been staring at us.

555
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:14,119
Can't you talk? He must be a fucking mute.

556
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,455
He's stressing me out.

557
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:18,457
What?

558
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:22,252
Hey! I'm talking to you!

559
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,802
What the fuck are you?

560
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:49,363
Sir, security footage
from Uiseong at 1:10 p.m.

561
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,823
Put out a search warrant.

562
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:56,828
Ki-hun and the specimen are
terror suspects. Shoot both on sight.

563
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:02,334
But that'll put the specimen
at risk of exposure.

564
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,879
Do you have a better idea?

565
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:11,009
I told you to stay put.
Why won't you listen to me?

566
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:13,303
You almost killed that kid!

567
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:15,556
He hit me first.

568
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,474
So what you did was right?

569
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,935
I can't believe this...

570
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,361
If you're just going to do as you please,

571
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,030
then you're on your own.

572
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,334
I'm sorry.

573
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,867
Where are we?

574
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,620
We'll lay low here for a while.

575
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,373
There will be checkpoints
all the way to the lab and...

576
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:27,211
The lab?

577
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,837
Hey.

578
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:32,966
Hey!

579
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:36,637
You need your injection
or God knows what might happen!

580
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,764
Why are you so concerned?

581
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,141
What?

582
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:43,060
I see...

583
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:46,104
You need me for your life.

584
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:56,740
You're right. It's for my life.

585
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:59,409
So I'm begging you, okay?

586
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,870
And why should I do that?

587
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,915
All men die anyway.

588
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,001
Why should you get to live?

589
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,131
Are you worthy of being saved?

590
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,777
You're right, every word you said.

591
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:37,823
I'm not worth it.

592
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,285
I deserve to die.

593
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,746
But I'm doing
every damn thing I can to live.

594
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,331
Is that so wrong?

595
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:48,625
Tell me!

596
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,627
Is it so wrong to want to live?

597
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,881
Why me? What did I do?

598
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,592
What else should I do?

599
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,135
Tell me!

600
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,180
What did I do so wrong?

601
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:03,682
Fuck you. You don't know anything...

602
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,852
What do you know, you little shit?

603
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:29,935
Mom, what does forever mean?

604
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,688
It means there's no end.

605
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,776
What's that like?

606
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:43,824
Imagine there's an apple.

607
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,619
You cut it in half and eat it,

608
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:50,455
then you cut the other half in half
and eat it.

609
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:53,250
Then you eat half of the remaining half.

610
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,880
Like the sun comes up in the morning
and goes down at night,

611
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,216
forever is like that.

612
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:05,637
Then...

613
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:09,558
what's it like to die?

614
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:17,399
It's like falling into
a very deep sleep forever.

615
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:23,447
Open up.

616
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:28,285
You have to eat all of it.

617
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,287
Why?

618
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,542
So you can be healthy.
What do you mean why?

619
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,586
Why should I be healthy?

620
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:40,506
For me? Or for your experiment?

621
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,967
- Stop it.
- But it's true.

622
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,469
You made me for the experiment.

623
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:47,221
No, I didn't.

624
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:50,599
Then why? Why did you make me, Mom?

625
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:56,021
Because of Kyung-yoon?

626
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:14,748
I must have dozed off...

627
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,564
Did you put me there?

628
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,148
Yes.

629
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,069
And you stayed here?

630
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,029
Yes.

631
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:51,994
Why didn't you sleep?

632
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,037
I don't sleep.

633
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:56,248
I don't know how to.

634
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:02,546
You've never slept in your whole life?

635
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,257
No.

636
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:14,308
Well, nothing surprises me anymore.

637
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:21,106
I'm sorry.

638
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:26,278
It was wrong of me to lie to you.

639
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:28,906
I'm sorry.

640
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,620
I thought you were really going to die.

641
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:42,252
At this point,
that would hardly be a surprise.

642
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,547
What does it feel to be dying?

643
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:51,887
Not good.

644
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,934
- It sucks, actually.
- Why?

645
01:06:57,893 --> 01:06:59,728
Because you're dying. Why else?

646
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,981
Then did it feel good to live?

647
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,702
There were good times and bad times...

648
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:19,540
and definitely some shitty times.

649
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:27,506
I'm confused now.

650
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,345
I can't tell if I want to live or
if I'm just scared to die.

651
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,266
I don't know anymore.

652
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,691
So I'm regretful.

653
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:50,904
Of what?

654
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:58,370
Of how I've lived my life.

655
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,882
I've been a coward.

656
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:32,821
What did they say?

657
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:35,991
They told me to lay low for now.
They will clean it up after a bit.

658
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:38,535
It's a goddamn mess they can't clean up.

659
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:41,955
I think the company ditched us.

660
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,125
Aren't you mad at them?

661
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:48,545
Why should we take the fall?

662
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,219
It's all in here.

663
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:58,095
Take it to the press or blow the whistle,

664
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:01,725
but we have to reveal ourselves
if we want to live.

665
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:02,975
You know that.

666
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:20,536
So what are you going to do?

667
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:57,531
This is not what we agreed on.

668
01:09:57,573 --> 01:09:59,283
You said you only needed her phone.

669
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:02,202
If this is to go away,
someone has to take the blame.

670
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:04,246
You know how this works.

671
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:07,165
You fucking bastard!

672
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,418
How can you do this?

673
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:14,715
Watch who you're talking to.

674
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,260
Would you like to take her place?

675
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,098
If so, get in the car.

676
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,608
You stupid coward.

677
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:10,479
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

678
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:21,365
I stood there and watched.

679
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,119
I should've been in that car.

680
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:33,043
I ran...

681
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:36,880
to save myself.

682
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:43,846
I was scared.

683
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,683
I was scared, so I ran.

684
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:59,820
I'm sorry, Hyun-soo. I'm sorry.

685
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,780
I'm so sorry.

686
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:09,037
I'm sorry...

687
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:46,051
Take me to Imhyun church.

688
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,805
It's in Ulsan.

689
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:55,853
Please, Ki-hun.

690
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:17,476
HOUSE OF BETHANY

691
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,940
HAN KYUNG-YOON
1996 ― 2006

692
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:07,609
That's me. Kyung-yoon.

693
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:14,992
And my dad.

694
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:21,248
I wanted to come and see it for myself

695
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,294
because it's the reason I was created.

696
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:33,427
After Dad and I died in a car accident,
Mom got sad, so she made me.

697
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,557
She shouldn't have done that.

698
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:43,228
That doesn't make me Kyung-yoon.

699
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,191
HAN KYUNG-YOON
FALLS ASLEEP ON OCTOBER 20, 2006

700
01:16:47,566 --> 01:16:48,775
Do you think

701
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,112
dying is really like sleeping?

702
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,034
Maybe.

703
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:03,207
Then how come people
aren't afraid of falling asleep?

704
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:05,667
It's like dying for a while.

705
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:09,004
Because they'll wake up the next day.

706
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,632
How do they know that?

707
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,346
They just believe it.

708
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:22,434
They believe
they'll wake up in the morning.

709
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,029
It scares me to think of dying.

710
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,157
However,

711
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:43,539
living forever is scary too.

712
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:52,089
What should I believe to not be scared?

713
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:03,475
You can cry if you feel sad.

714
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:05,894
It's okay to cry.

715
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:22,596
It's beautiful.

716
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,306
What is?

717
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,935
To be alive.

718
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,201
Where do we go now?

719
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:46,745
Well...

720
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:49,414
I don't know anymore.

721
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:54,253
Let's go to the lab.

722
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,384
I have nowhere else to go.

723
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,806
I was born there

724
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:08,767
and my mom is there.

725
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,521
That's my home.

726
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:16,275
And that way,

727
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:19,903
you can live too.

728
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,832
I was born for that reason.

729
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:37,546
So I will go to sleep for it too.

730
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:44,928
What do you mean?
You said you never sleep.

731
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,669
Sir, we heard back from Interpol.

732
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,923
The men are from
a private military company.

733
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:22,841
Mercenaries?

734
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:26,637
Based in Southeast Asia,
they fought in the Filipino Civil War.

735
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,847
VIP protection, assassination...

736
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,850
They're war thugs
who take any job for money.

737
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,656
What the hell?

738
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,200
Stop, pull over!

739
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:53,497
Request to run a plate. 36 N 5705.

740
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:55,082
We located Mr. Min.

741
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:57,584
- The police are on him.
- Get it up on the screen.

742
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:02,548
From the police black box camera, sir.

743
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:10,556
Stop, 5705, 5705!

744
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:12,307
Pull over!

745
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:35,873
Shit!

746
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:02,357
Shoot. Just Kill them all!

747
01:23:27,758 --> 01:23:29,551
Hey, Mr. Min.

748
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:31,845
Are you okay?

749
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:33,889
Good.

750
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:55,369
How far will you take this?

751
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:58,038
As far as I can.

752
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,790
You leave us with no choice.

753
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,416
Do as you will.

754
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,793
We have guns too.

755
01:24:02,835 --> 01:24:05,337
You saw them earlier.
Ours are foreign made.

756
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:06,922
I paid a lot of money for them.

757
01:24:07,965 --> 01:24:10,133
I'm asking you out of genuine curiosity.

758
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:12,386
Are you senile?

759
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:15,097
My mind is as clear as crystal,
you damn punk.

760
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:18,934
You thought I wouldn't know?
I knew all along.

761
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:23,063
I knew from the beginning
you would hand it over to the Americans.

762
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:26,733
I knew Anderson was spying on us.

763
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:29,278
Is that why you killed him?

764
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:32,865
And you pulled off a terrorist attack
using mercenaries?

765
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:35,492
Quite a job, Mr. Chairman.

766
01:24:35,576 --> 01:24:38,370
I have a serious condition.

767
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,706
Doctors tell me I don't have much time.

768
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:43,834
I'm sitting around waiting to die.

769
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:46,837
What could I be afraid of?

770
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:09,610
Mom...

771
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:17,034
You became a doctor
because you wanted to become one.

772
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:22,080
What about me?

773
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:27,503
What can I become?

774
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,384
Can I...

775
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:42,267
want to become something too?

776
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:52,694
Can I?

777
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:07,417
I'm sorry.

778
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:10,587
I'm so sorry.

779
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:51,170
Gosh. You brought a whole army.

780
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:54,882
This is your last chance.
What are you going to do?

781
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:56,592
This is what I'm going to do.

782
01:26:57,301 --> 01:27:01,013
{\an8}I'm sending it to the press later.
What do you think?

783
01:27:01,638 --> 01:27:03,390
Who would believe this?

784
01:27:03,432 --> 01:27:05,684
They will at least want to.

785
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,937
Who wouldn't want to believe
that you can overcome death?

786
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:13,692
You believed it.
It's why you brought an army.

787
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:20,574
I'm not trying to save all of humanity.

788
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,492
Why would I do that?

789
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:27,331
I'll let some live and let some die.

790
01:27:27,706 --> 01:27:29,499
I get to make the call.

791
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:31,376
What do you think?

792
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,547
Isn't this what you call God's power?

793
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,944
What's all this?

794
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:59,321
You're up.

795
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:01,698
Why didn't you rest more?

796
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:06,954
We'll begin the extraction process soon.

797
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:09,915
All thanks to you.

798
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:15,587
We'll collect Seobok's bone marrow
and extract the IPS cells.

799
01:28:16,421 --> 01:28:18,841
If we collect 40ml per day,

800
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,135
we'll have one liter in a month.

801
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:23,512
Then your clinical trial...

802
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:25,305
You'll do this for a month?

803
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:30,435
No, forever.

804
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:32,271
Seobok doesn't die.

805
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,996
But isn't that cruel?

806
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:56,044
Cruel?

807
01:28:56,086 --> 01:29:00,090
It's like collecting insulin from a pig.

808
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:02,676
Seobok isn't human.

809
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,178
You know that.

810
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:06,847
What?

811
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:10,684
Don't tell me you grew attached to him.

812
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:24,948
Where do we go now?

813
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:28,911
Let's go to the lab.

814
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:31,997
I have nowhere else to go.

815
01:29:34,374 --> 01:29:36,126
I was born there

816
01:29:37,336 --> 01:29:39,087
and my mom is there.

817
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:41,757
That's my home.

818
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:45,135
And that way,

819
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:48,639
you can live too.

820
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:55,896
I was born for that reason.

821
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:02,528
So I will go to sleep for it too.

822
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,999
Wait.

823
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:24,091
I don't think this is right.

824
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,009
What do you mean?

825
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:27,928
Just stop.

826
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,221
What is this nonsense?

827
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,561
Are you crazy?

828
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,354
Stop it right now.

829
01:30:37,646 --> 01:30:41,233
If we stop, you'll die. You know that.

830
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:56,832
We're going.

831
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,293
Do what you will.

832
01:31:07,092 --> 01:31:08,343
Get out, all of you!

833
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:25,611
What's going on?

834
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:32,159
How do you stop it?

835
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:34,745
Stop the machine. Stop it now!

836
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:37,122
That's enough.

837
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:40,584
No one can stop this.

838
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:43,837
Where is Dr. Lim?

839
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:49,218
Where is she?

840
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:15,160
What are you doing?
Calm down and lower the gun.

841
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,877
We preserved her body.

842
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:27,130
She's the only human who has Seobok's DNA.

843
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:29,341
She may be useful as well.

844
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:34,805
Shit...

845
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:37,641
You're all insane.

846
01:32:54,032 --> 01:32:56,743
If scum like you live forever,

847
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:00,747
it will be a living hell.

848
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:15,470
That's enough.

849
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,726
We don't want to damage a test subject.

850
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,966
You shouldn't have.

851
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,888
It wouldn't have ended this anyway.

852
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:29,253
Please... don't... Help...

853
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:46,937
No! Don't kill him!

854
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:13,172
No! Don't kill him!

855
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,175
Don't shoot! No!

856
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:19,344
Hey! Don't shoot!

857
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:24,016
Grab him, you morons!

858
01:35:44,745 --> 01:35:45,829
Go away.

859
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:48,790
Don't come near me!

860
01:37:45,157 --> 01:37:46,200
Open fire.

861
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:48,160
I said open fire!

862
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:01,752
Hey, are you all right?

863
01:40:02,836 --> 01:40:04,296
Are you?

864
01:40:08,425 --> 01:40:09,801
We need to get in the car.

865
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,111
Run.

866
01:40:28,278 --> 01:40:29,655
You have to run.

867
01:40:31,073 --> 01:40:33,575
- To where?
- What?

868
01:40:35,077 --> 01:40:36,453
You know.

869
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:40,791
I have nowhere to go.

870
01:40:48,549 --> 01:40:49,633
Hey...

871
01:40:53,011 --> 01:40:54,638
Hey! Stop!

872
01:40:55,889 --> 01:40:56,974
Hey!

873
01:40:57,724 --> 01:41:00,477
No, stop!

874
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:11,340
Go up!

875
01:42:12,549 --> 01:42:14,510
Climb, you idiots!

876
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:36,448
That's enough, it's over.

877
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:40,160
What's over?

878
01:42:50,754 --> 01:42:52,506
What are you doing? You'll kill them all.

879
01:42:52,548 --> 01:42:53,966
What's wrong with that?

880
01:42:54,007 --> 01:42:56,093
All men die anyway.

881
01:42:57,052 --> 01:42:58,428
I said stop!

882
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:13,235
Why did you do it?

883
01:43:14,903 --> 01:43:17,322
Why did you come back
when you knew everything?

884
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:25,831
I wanted to become something.

885
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:32,462
Something meaningful to someone.

886
01:43:40,137 --> 01:43:42,055
That was all.

887
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:50,814
But this will never end.

888
01:43:56,236 --> 01:43:59,948
It'll never end as long as I live.

889
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:05,287
It will only end when I'm gone.

890
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:14,171
So end this for me.

891
01:44:31,396 --> 01:44:34,566
No... I can't.

892
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:38,654
Please don't do this.

893
01:44:45,035 --> 01:44:46,286
Why not?

894
01:44:48,622 --> 01:44:51,792
Because you're scared you'll die too?

895
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:58,131
But you know now.

896
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:03,303
No matter how scared you are,

897
01:45:04,805 --> 01:45:06,515
you can never run away.

898
01:45:08,517 --> 01:45:09,685
Am I wrong?

899
01:45:57,691 --> 01:45:58,859
Right.

900
01:46:00,569 --> 01:46:01,778
You're right.

901
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:07,367
I know now.

902
01:46:57,709 --> 01:46:59,002
Ki-hun.

903
01:47:05,467 --> 01:47:07,135
I'm sleepy.

903
01:47:08,305 --> 01:48:08,649
