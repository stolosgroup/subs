not thinking about it.

334

But now that I am thinking about it,

335
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,033
I should go
and do something about it.

336

all this work yourself.

You're welcome.

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,273
Well, where to begin?

371
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,549
Well, this was the hardest part.

372
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,480
There was so much damage.
The treads were gone,

373
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,312
the railing, even the skylight.

374
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,696
So I had to get a lot of new material,

375
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,856
but I tried to save as much...

376

Isn't it a lot harder
than just starting fresh?

How do you mean?

378
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,388
Why didn't you just
build a new house?

Well, it's...

380

Can I ask you a question?

384
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,319
Why don't you want kids?

I saw how you reacted earlier.

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,109
I know what it's like
when you're just starting out,

389
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,800
and you think you have
all the time in the world.

390
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,751
You know, you're not going
to be so young forever.

391

Have kids.

392

Then you'll be creating
something together.
