00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,312
[Karin] So nice
to see you again.

163
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,479
[Patrick] Hey, man.

164
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,145
[Louise]
What a beautiful place.

165
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,279
[Karin] Thank you.

166
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:42,579
[laughing] Oh no, you can leave
them on. Or take them off.

167
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,546
Leave them on.

168
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,645
Or take them off.

169
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,622
Leaving 'em on, taking 'em off,
whatever you want.

170
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:47,845
- Thank you.
- [both giggle]

171
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,713
- Give me your coat.
- Thank you.

172
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:50,822
[Karin] Sorry for the mess.

173
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:51,945
[Louise] Oh, it's nothing.

174
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,079
It's gonna get much worse. Come
on!

175
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
So, come in.

176
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,380
Wow, very comfortable.

177
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,646
Yeah, that's the way we like it.

178
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,067
Oh, and we brought you something.

179
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,113
[Karin] Oh!

180
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:05,746
It's a little souvenir
from Denmark.

181
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,514
[Bjørn] It's Louise who bought
it, so...

182
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:08,946
Thank you.

183
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,813
[Karin] Uh, where's Abel?

184
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,681
- Uh, downstairs maybe?
- Oh.

185
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,146
He's been cooking all day.
He's making Wild Boar.

186
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:16,562
- [Bjørn] Wow!
- [Patrick laughs]

187
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:18,547
[Karin] Come on.
This is your room.

188
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,547
- Wow.
- Ah, that's wonderful.

- [Patrick] Bjørn?
- Yes.

191
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:26,514
- You want a beer?
- [Bjørn] Yeah.

192
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:27,847
I want to show you my pool.

193
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,590
- You have a pool?
- [Patrick] Uh-huh.

194
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:36,815
[Karin speaking foreign
language]

195
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,047
Hi Abel.

196
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:47,115
Look, Agnes, we made you a
little bed.

197
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:53,182
- [Karin] Do you like it?
- Yes, she likes it.

199
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:59,849
[Karin] I forgot the presents.
I'm so sorry.

200
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,716
[Louise] No, it's fine.

201

[television in foreign language]

202
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,383
Wow... it's coffee cups.
That's sweet.

203
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,616
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

204
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:15,049
And... a mermaid?

205
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:19,783
Yes, it's something that I think
represents Denmark very well.

206
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:21,584
- It's The Little Mermaid.
- Yeah.

207
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:22,684
I know it.

208
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,417
I've heard it's quite small
and disappointing.

209
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:26,784
[all chuckle]

210
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,884
Well, actually there are some
anecdotes about it

211
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:30,084
that are really nice.

212
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,950
Oh yeah, you know what is also
nice?

213
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,318
- Louise...
- Hmm?

214
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,617
This is for you.

215
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,285
Oh, no-no, that's fine...

216
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,551
I insist.

217
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,585
- [Louise laughs]
- I insist.

218
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,418
[laughs] No-no, I'll wait till...

219
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,585
- It's my favorite part.
- Okay.

220
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,217
It's delicious. It's crispy and
soft at the same time.

221
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,951
- Yes.
- [speaking foreign language]

222
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,485
Yeah.

223
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,118
- Hmm.
- It's good, right?

224
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,486
Very good.

225
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,887
Oh, hi Abel.

226
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:03,388
[wind rustling in background]

[Abel running]

230
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,423
But it is really lucky we've got
the GPS,

231
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:34,456
because otherwise we'd have got
lost like 20 times

232
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:35,656
I had it under control.

233
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,756
No, [laughing] the GPS had.

234
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,623
- I had.
- [both chuckle]

[Abel crying in background]

236
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,323
It's frightening sometimes,

237
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:48,523
how we lose our ability to find
our way through life.

238
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:52,324
Because we hand over the
responsibility to technology.

239
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:53,723
That is so true.

240
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,557
I mean, people nowadays don't
have a clue how to read a map.

241
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:02,291
I must admit that driving in a
car like that,

242
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:07,391
with GPS and all these
modern things, you...

243
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:11,157
I-I want to turn it off sometimes.

244
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:13,100
And, as you were saying,
Patrick...

245
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,591
Is he all right?

246
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:19,924
No, no, he's fine. He's fine.
He'll fall asleep in a minute.

247
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:25,057
He just does this sometimes.
It's part of his disease.

248
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,957
Oh yeah, what is that?

249
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,725
Abel has what you call
"congenital aglossia".

250
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,392
Meaning basically, he's born
without a tongue.

251
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:37,158
Or... a much smaller tongue than
you and me.

252
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,558
But is he in pain?

253
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,792
Oh no, no pain.

254
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,025
He just has a hard time
making himself understandable.

255
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:46,526
Oh no, I understand everything
he says.

[Louise] Excuse me
for just one second.

262
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:26,363
Um, Abel, do you think you could
move away?

263
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,730
Uh, because Agnes really wants
to try it.

Agnes really wants
to try the slide.

And do you think it is possible

268
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,431
to ask Abel to move away
just for one second?

269

Patrick, it's all right.
He doesn't have to.

No, he wants to say
"I apologize".

he really wants to.

It reminds me
of what we call a Mazarin?

Who needs a doctor, right?

645
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:11,380
- [Bjørn] Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

646
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:16,146
[Patrick sighs] Bread? Yes.

647
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:20,113
You know, it's a shame

648
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:24,013
that Holland is not really
being recognized

649
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:26,246
as a producer of fine
and high quality cheese

650
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:29,081
like Italy or France
for example.

651
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,114
Oh, here.
[speaking foreign language]

652
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:33,447
I mean, we are a cheese nation.

653
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:36,147
We export more cheese than any
other country in the world,

654
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,047
besides Germany, of course.

655
00:56:38,147 --> 00:56:39,382
But I sometimes feel...

656
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:43,214
that Dutch cheese is not getting
the respect it deserves.

657

[speaking in foreign language]

658

[speaking in foreign language]

659
00:56:57,282 --> 00:57:00,248
Everyone should come with Bjørn
and me to the market

660
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,282
and try some of Johan's cheese.

661
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:05,383
Then they will give Dutch cheese
the respect it deserves.

662
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:06,882
Johan said it himself.

663
00:57:06,982 --> 00:57:08,716
Forget Stilton,
forget Gorgonzola.

664
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:12,215
Dutch cheese, Dutch cheese
is the number one, right?

665
00:57:12,383 --> 00:57:13,416
- Bjørn.
- Hmm?

666
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:15,258
The cheese at the market,
it was good, right?

667
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:17,783
- It was fantastic.
- It was number one.

668
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:20,483
- [Bjørn laughs]
- Johan said it himself, cheers!

669
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,549
- Cheers.

[speaking foreign language]

671
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,717
Stop telling my daughter what
to do.

672
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:39,283
It's not up to you to tell
my daughter what to do, okay?

673
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,384
Okay, relax. I'm sorry.

674

00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,619
[Patrick] Sorry about that.

679
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:22,452
- [Louise] No, it's okay.
- [Patrick] Okay?

680
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:27,219
One, two, three, four.

[Patrick speaking

683
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,019
It's okay.
They're both really good.

684
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,553
Yes, but he has no rhythm.
And he's messing up the routine.

685
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,487
No, but they are just kids.

686
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,053
Yes, but if he wants to reach
his potential,

687
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:49,120
he has to concentrate,
right? Right.

688
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,920
[speaking foreign language]

689

[Patrick stops music, yells
in foreign language at Abel]

691
00:59:22,522 --> 00:59:24,754
No, she has to stay
because it's a duet.

692
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,188
[Louise] No,
she doesn't want to.

693

[Patrick] No, she has to stay.

694
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:28,954
She doesn't want to dance anymore.

Uh, what's the problem?

703
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:48,825
You cannot... he's only a child
for Christ's sake.

704
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:55,258
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? [stammers]

705
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:58,593
Can't you see he's crying?
He's in pain?

[speaking foreign language]

707

You can't talk to him that way.
What is wrong with you?

708
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,993
Oh my god, what's wrong?

709
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:08,826
Because we do things
differently?

710
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:11,893
This is not about doing things differently.

711
01:01:11,993 --> 01:01:13,259
It's not about that.

712
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:15,959
No! This is about doing
what is right.

713
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:20,394
This is really...
to do what is right for you.

714
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,169
Like showing your son some love
when he is crying

715
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:23,660
instead of shouting at him.

716
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,394
Yeah, and Patrick,
what the fuck?

717
01:01:25,494 --> 01:01:27,394
Why can't you just
let him dance?

718
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:29,827
Oh, that wasn't dancing.
