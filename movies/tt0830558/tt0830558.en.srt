00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,370
Hi David, this is Charlie. I call to you
a happy birthday wish

3
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:33,400
Sorry to those tickets
could not give.

4
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:37,010
I know you counted on me,
but my brother said ...

5
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,944
Call you next week.
We can also agree.

6
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,839
Have a good birthday.

7
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,956
You can reach me on my cell ...

8
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:39,330
You think you know all about pain?

9
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,071
Talk again with my second wife.

10
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:47,216
When she was 19, she became
between two fighting cats.

11
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,946
One attacked her, climbed on her,
like a tree.

12
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:56,331
Comments left on her thighs, breasts
and belly, you can still see.

13
00:01:56,378 --> 00:02:00,986
There were 30 stitches needed.
She had high fever for days.

14
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:05,022
That is real pain, says my second wife.

15
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,920
If I replace the man
under the car could reach ...

16
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,524
I would have done that.

17
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,580
But also can feel his pain,
might have mitigated the mine.

18
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,170
It was the fiftieth.

19
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:36,064
A period of foreign
suppressions and secrets.

20
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:39,354
A period in which even the guilty
showed a rare innocence.

21
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,035
Remembering what happened.

22
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,771
Remembering what we had done.

23
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,105
I am now on the wrong side
of the fifty.

24
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,548
I earn $ 300,000 per year
Wall Street ...

25
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:56,230
twice married, no children ...

26
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:59,432
a house in the countryside,
a flat of the firm in the city

27
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:03,693
My current wife knows nothing af
of what happened many years ago.

28
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,030
I do not know whether I had ever
will tell.

29
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,599
Why should I?

30
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:24,689
Nothing in my life was still good
Since the summer of 1958.

31
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:31,892
When Ruth, Donnie, Willie, and we all
met with Meg Loughlin ...

32
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,530
and her sister Susan.

33
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,302
What are you looking for?

34
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:13,413
Crayfish.
- Can I look?

35
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:16,806
I'm Meg.
- I'm David.

36
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:21,631
What they are beautiful.

37
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,674
I catch them, look for some
and let them go.

38
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,132
Bite?

39
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,569
Sometimes.
Usually they try to run away.

40
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,382
Have you ever seen a crayfish?

41
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:46,041
There are none in New York.
Well lobsters. They can hurt you.

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,587
Can you as a pet?

43
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,775
They are there to eat.

44
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,878
Crayfish are also eaten.

45
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:55,478
In Louisiana and Florida and such.

46
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,819
So much to eat is not.

47
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,298
We will try some large
to catch.

48
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:02,697
Can I try it?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,378
What is that?

50
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,955
We have had an accident.

51
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,567
Do you have more scars?

52
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,406
A few, but this is the worst.

53
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:38,416
I have one.
A big one.

54
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,480
In my first attempt.

55
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:47,695
Good catch.
Did you know that they sometimes kill each other?

56
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,646
You could she recover?
- I always do.

57
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,325
I must go back.

58
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,801
But I wanted to look around.

59
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,280
We had never
talked.

60
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:02,717
Thanks, David, it was fun.

61
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:04,990
Where you going now?

62
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,535
We stay with our family,
the Chandlers.

63
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,221
The Chandlers? We are their neighbors.
- Goodbye, David.

64
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,353
BASED ON TRUE FACTS.

65
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:37,146
Yet one days longer with your sister
and you could call the mad house.

66
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:58,667
Will you help, David?

67
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,947
Hello, Woofer.
- Hi, Dave.

68
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,834
What's in that can?
- Pier.

69
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,862
Donnie is here somewhere?

70
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,524
You're crazy, Woofer.
Seriously disturbed.

71
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,626
I'm black too.

72
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:37,341
I will complete this stabbing
to an ant war.

73
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,845
Want to bet who will win?

74
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,732
The red will win.
Red ants always win.

75
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:06,068
In there without calling.

76
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,511
Hey buddy, I am.

77
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,316
Are you there?

78
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:03,627
That was not funny.
- The face that you drew was.

79
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,463
Help me out with this.

80
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,131
In order to fastest.

81
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,633
Dwarf.
- Mormel.

82
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,096
So you've met her.
- Who?

83
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:27,521
Oh, your cousin.
Yes, in the rock.

84
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,750
She caught a crayfish
at her first attempt.

85
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,285
Yes, she is quite good at things.

86
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,245
She is beautiful, no?
- She's your cousin?

87
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,060
Step-niece. Ma says
The one difference.

88
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:41,720
She has one sister, huh?
- Susan? That is disabled.

89
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,140
She did thanks
that accident.

90
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:46,920
They should always very cautious steps.

91
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:50,348
She wears those things,
such as polio patients.

92
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,619
Both parents are dead.

93
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,939
Ma said that they were killed.

94
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,534
Ma says she does not know
who had aanreed.

95
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:02,370
In fact they were
hit by a Chrysler.

96
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:05,032
Therefore they are now with us.

97
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:09,937
Ma says Meg lucky.
That she has come good.

98
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:12,974
What do you louts here?

99
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:18,335
We go to the carnival.
They have them up this morning.

100
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,433
We shall see.

101
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,009
Another summer between children
and fairs. It can not go wrong.

102
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,892
There's dumb and stupid.

103
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,302
Keep your big mouth,
before I do that for you.

104
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:37,262
Dad wants to know where you go.
He says you've grounded.

105
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,252
Tell Dad to hell runs.

106
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,942
Now you're in trouble well.
I'll tell him.

107
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:47,597
Then tell him what you and Cheryl
you did yesterday with pillow.

108
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:50,286
Hey, fellas.
- Hello Willie.

109
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,137
How was the dentist?
- Shut up, idiot.

110
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,596
Ma was mad at you. She says that
it was your turn to babysit.

111
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,467
I am on, guys.
Time for some real action.

112
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:08,509
It is summer.
Why we played the game yet?

113
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:30,200
Are you sure she sees nothing?
- She sees no balls.

114
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:33,341
Ready to run away?
The big tree is the safe zone.

115
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,910
Stop it, Eddie. I know it's you.
- Shut up.

116
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:12,988
Hey, bitch.

117
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,698
Walk Donnie!

118
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:38,484
I got you.

119
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:49,751
What happens now?
- Now they tell the truth.

120
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,827
A person may ask. The rest looks on.
- I first.

121
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,191
Tell the truth.

122
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,285
Have you kissed a boy?
- No. But you do.

123
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,606
Tell us how you and Cheryl
playing with yourself.

124
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,101
We did not.
- Liar.

125
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,590
Have you ever sucked?

126
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,622
A thick, long, hot dick?

127
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,579
Hold on.
I tell Dad.

128
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,084
What is that?

129
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,891
Tell us what you bitches
those pillows did.

130
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,924
High, huh.

131
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,505
Beautiful.

132
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,114
Are we agreed on?

133
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,571
If you want me.

134
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:47,811
If you're afraid
it is not very.

135
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,118
Sure.

136
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:53,314
Forward.

137
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:05,421
It seems like I can fly
and the whole world.

138
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,229
My parents.

139
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:17,479
They always like to
bring to an amusement park.

140
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,702
That will now no longer come.

141
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:25,230
I heard what happened.

142
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,563
Sorry.

143
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:37,054
This is great, David.

144
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,800
You look as if you do
whole days doing.

145
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:42,968
Are you serious?

146
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:44,338
Of course.

147
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:48,066
I have two tickets,
if you want again.

148
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,643
Very happy.

149
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:54,589
But I had asked home
of Ruth.

150
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,472
Sometimes she's very funny.

151
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,793
Ruth is great,
exactly one of the gang.

152
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:21,729
What that whole fair miss,
hoochiecoo is an old-fashioned.

153
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,074
What is a hoociecoo?

154
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:27,252
Hoochiecoo.
You know, the hoochiecoochie ...

155
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:30,497
Dancing girls, Ralphie.

156
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:31,989
And the oddities show.

157
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:34,841
When I was as old as you,
those things still existed.

158
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:38,444
I once saw a man with three arms.
- Something does not exist.

159
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,589
Speak to your mother.
I really saw that.

160
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:43,506
I saw a man with three arms.

161
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:49,069
One was a tiny stump,
that came here.

162
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,737
What else did you see?

163
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,652
Things in bottles.

164
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,446
Stillborn babies.

165
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,652
Little things shrunk.
Cats and goats, everything.

166
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,573
When I was a little girl,
The fair was worthwhile.

167
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,382
Tell me more
hoochiecoo about that.

168
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:09,685
I still do not understand it well.
What should the proposals?

169
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:13,421
Dancing girls, I said.

170
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:18,532
Some were half naked.
In a very short skirt ...

171
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:20,602
and a tiny bra.

172
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:26,202
Or a jewel in the navel.
And painted dark circles.

173
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:28,978
Here and here.

174
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,570
What do you think that?

175
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:40,689
But something will our social committee
no sponsors. Not at all.

176
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,844
They would like to do that.

177
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,426
She would really like to.

178
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:49,500
But they all have one woman.

179
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,395
Drink your beer, boys.

180
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,610
Time to go to the carnival to leave.

181
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:59,728
We may not last night
not miss.

182
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,994
I go with the boys
get an ice cream at the fair.

183
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:07,015
Stay here for your
sister to care.

184
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,290
And stay out of the ice box.

185
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:10,944
You may not be too thick.

186
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,904
Especially if you once
hoochiecoo to the dance.

187
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,184
That I had heard.

188
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,989
Maybe I read it in Playboy.

189
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,083
You read that in Playboy
and I screwed all the bunny's.

190
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,793
My father buys every month
Playboy, asshole.

191
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,713
Have you seen that with Jane Mansfield?
- Yeah, I saw that.

192
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:44,408
The biggest tits I ever saw.
- Bigger than that of Carol Baker?

193
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,129
Greater than that of June Wilkinson?
- Bigger than Willie.

194
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,798
Where is Donnie?

195
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,746
He may not out of ma
before he has finished eating.

196
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,102
One of you has already seen a woman?

197
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:01,874
A real woman, I mean.
- Counts Meg them?

198
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,636
See anything?

199
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,182
I'm not even elbow.

200
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,491
Hey, wait.

201
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,111
To hell with her.

202
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,411
Maybe get her
to join the game.

203
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,930
Fucking assholes.

204
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,351
Piers.

205
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,069
I do this.

206
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:04,582
Look closely again, then
you do the rest.

207
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,738
Looks nice.
Greasy and flavorful.

208
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,380
Take this down.

209
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:32,027
Note that I want to keep the garden.

210
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:37,923
And not in the woods.
The wood for themselves.

211
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:42,014
I will not.

212
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,003
Are you dissatisfied because of
some worms, darling?

213
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:49,112
No, I just do not ...
- Have you ever.

214
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:54,464
Here we get a lesson
of femininity, boys.

215
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:57,039
The sensitive Meg.

216
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,756
You know how girls do
sensitive, not?

217
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:06,060
And Meg is a lady.
Without doubt.

218
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:11,141
What am I in hell?

219
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:14,798
Am I not a lady you think then?
- No, I just wanted ...

220
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,261
Note well what you say.

221
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:20,931
I suffer no such insinuations
of a child ...

222
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,760
that not even her own face
can clean.

223
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:29,246
Scroll down and help your sister
with the laundry.

224
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,805
When you're done,
I show you something else.

225
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,535
My boys can handle this.

226
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,289
Right, boys.

227
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:44,883
A cheeseburger and a lemonade.

228
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,744
Hi Meg, how are you?

229
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:52,576
Want to buy me something?
I have not eaten in two days.

230
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,906
Can I still get one?

231
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,330
Why did not you eat?

232
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,305
I can not.

233
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,675
Why not?
- I can not.

234
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:14,119
I do not understand.
- Ruth says I am overweight.

235
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,087
That says it for you to tease.
- David No, she hates me.

236
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,785
Everybody hates me.

237
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:34,318
Why was she so angry last?

238
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:37,535
Maybe they just
irritable.

239
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,477
She was not accustomed to
girls in the house.

240
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,709
It is not just this once.

241
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:55,224
It happens all the time.

242
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,770
I can never do anything right.

243
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:01,074
When I lie in bed at night
I can think of nothing else.

244
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:11,483
Before we came here to
I painted.

245
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:14,193
Just in watercolor.

246
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,556
I do not think I
very good, but ...

247
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:21,458
My mother liked it.

248
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:25,194
I've tried, but I
here can not paint.

249
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:29,462
Because I know what Ruth would do.
I know what she will say.

250
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,997
She would look at me.

251
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,824
And say I'm a stupid weight
and my time trying to peel fresh.

252
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,189
That does not sound like the Ruth I know.

253
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,614
Come on, why do not you?

254
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,679
Why do not you paint watercolor
for Ruth?

255
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:48,379
She will love it.

256
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:51,225
I really can not.

257
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:52,845
Create one for me.

258
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:58,570
Would you really want?
- Very happy.

259
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:06,349
I make a painting.

260
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:14,128
And thanks for everything, David.
- Sure.

261
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,113
I do not want you hanging around outside.
I need your help in the house.

262
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:40,262
Better to continue immediately.
- Yes, Mrs. Chandler.

263
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,239
Aunt Ruth.

264
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,640
In hell, you even know?

265
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:59,105
Stupid bitch.

266
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,681
Dinner is ready.

267
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,329
Give the stuff here.
It will brains.

268
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:12,344
Hello there.
- Hello Mrs Moran. I'm Meg.

269
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,455
How nice to finally
meeting.

270
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,492
Want to come and eat?
- I can not, I ...

271
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,938
I did this to David.

272
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:34,956
Thanks, Meg.
- It is a bit stupid.

273
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,802
Throw it away but
if you do not like.

274
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,600
What have we here?

275
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:53,541
That is really nice.

276
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,440
She has something, right?

277
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:02,799
Mrs. Chandler is happy
to her house.

278
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,642
You must be David.
- Yes. Hi Susan.

279
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,437
Meg says you're nice.

280
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:29,006
What you got?

281
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:36,693
I have something for you.
- Turn off the TV, Ralphie.

282
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,212
What is it, David?
- A present.

283
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:42,997
Meg.

284
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:50,819
She has painted for you.

285
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,453
It is beautiful, Meg.

286
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,285
Do not kid me.

287
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,645
She made this for you, Davy.
- Surely not.

288
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:17,845
Just look.

289
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,994
It's a boy to a river.
Course is for you.

290
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:26,114
Take it. I will not.
- They made it real for you, Ruth.

291
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,129
She just wanted ...
- Do not, David.

292
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:30,171
Come learn something, guys.

293
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:33,126
Listen well.
This is important.

294
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,279
You just need love but are
for a woman.

295
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:39,779
Then she does all kinds
good things for you.

296
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,097
Look at David.

297
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,713
He was kind to Meg
and she gave him a painting.

298
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,395
That is what you got, huh David?

299
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,648
Is that all they gave you?

300
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,848
You're a bit young,
but these days you never know.

301
00:26:55,852 --> 00:27:00,553
Today, girls
so easy. That is their problem.

302
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,963
Promise them a trifle,
and you usually get what you want.

303
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:09,163
Believe me, I know
I am talking about.

304
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,167
Look at your father, Davy.

305
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,342
He fucked half
the women in this city.

306
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:16,802
Everyone knows that.
Even your mother knows that.

307
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,597
Do not be ashamed.

308
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:23,957
He is at least a hard worker,
that his family maintains decent.

309
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:29,447
Your father would have his own business
when we married.

310
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:33,411
We would be richer than
my parents were when I was little.

311
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:37,504
And they were quite rich,
believe me.

312
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,145
And look what I got.

313
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:44,834
And that beautiful Irish bastard
Noorderzon to the left.

314
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:49,171
Believe me Fri
Girls are stupid.

315
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,236
Girls are easy.

316
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,858
Bitches.

317
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,788
Through and through.

318
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,180
Take this painting on back, Meg.

319
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,613
I know you've made for Davy.

320
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:08,349
And try to make me anything else wise.

321
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:13,109
What I would like to know, Meggie ...

322
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,738
What do you get to this?

323
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:19,970
We all know that David
a nice guy, but ...

324
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:22,774
From him you expect nothing.

325
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:27,215
I only hope that this painting
the only thing you gave him.

326
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:33,558
You have all men want in the house.
And that's not your painting.

327
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:42,968
If you guys now what they want
Makes no more than a slut.

328
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:44,962
You know what a slut is?

329
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:49,179
Can you, Susan?
Of course not, you're too young.

330
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:52,448
I will tell you what a slut.

331
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:57,383
This is someone who's legs
spreads open for a man ...

332
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,508
so he could slip inside.

333
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:03,368
Stop giggling, Ralphie.

334
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:07,742
Anyone who is a slut
deserves a punishment.

335
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:11,496
There will everyone in this city
to accept them.

336
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:14,204
I am warning you, darling.

337
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:18,007
If I notice that you hang the slut ...

338
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:22,649
your ass is a lawn
Aunt Ruth and the lawnmower.

339
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,635
Who wants a beer?

340
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:39,861
As if I am yesterday.

341
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:43,396
I always painted for my mother.
I also wanted to try.

342
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:49,670
I do not care what you
your mother did. You're a slut.

343
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:54,289
Want to waste your time
a boy?

344
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,805
Hands off.
- You are a liar and a slut.

345
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:02,186
You can not forget your sister.

346
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,905
What an exemplary behavior.
- Yeah, I think the whole day to him.

347
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:12,691
So do you act so.
The whole day fantasizing about one boy.

348
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,926
Good night, girls.
It was blissful.

349
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,682
Hold on.

350
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:01,861
Come watch, David.
She creeps.

351
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,620
Leave me alone, please.
- Grab her.

352
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:08,110
Why did you do that, bitch?

353
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,232
You've seen what he did.
- He did nothing.

354
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,491
You have his face scratched.
- I'm going to tell Mama.

355
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:16,751
I want nothing with you
face.

356
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:20,636
Your sister is a fucking whore.

357
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:24,666
Can someone tell me
what happens here?

358
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,907
Meg has Woofer attacked.
- She scratched his face.

359
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,146
Someone should have challenged her.

360
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:34,290
We were tickling her
and when she scratched in Woofers face.

361
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:36,482
You too, David?

362
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:42,068
Did you also tickled Megan?
- No, I just came inside.

363
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:47,070
I do not blame you, sweetie.
I suggest you just one question.

364
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,396
Where is she now?
- I do not know. She ran away.

365
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:53,166
Susan, you saw what happened here?

366
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:58,422
And you tried her
to stop when they hit Ralphie?

367
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:03,384
I could not.
- You had to try, sweetheart.

368
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:06,121
Meg is finally your sister.

369
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:11,102
Do you know what it means ...

370
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:16,938
the accomplice to
of someone doing something?

371
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:21,533
This means that you may owe.

372
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:25,483
Even though you yourself might
nothing specifically done ...

373
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:30,213
yet you somewhere complicit.
Do you understand me?

374
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:34,228
I will try to explain.

375
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,519
You love your sister, right?

376
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,147
Because you love her,
it would also forgive you, no?

377
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:45,342
She wanted to hurt him.
She was just angry.

378
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:50,362
Of course.
But you forgive her, right?

379
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:55,077
So there you are totally wrong, sweetheart.

380
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,382
This Makes her accomplice.

381
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:03,266
What they did was wrong.
This is misconduct.

382
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,624
If you forgive her because of you
love her, you're wrong.

383
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:14,405
Go to on this side of the bed.

384
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:18,458
Pull your skirt up
and your underpants down.

385
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,184
Come on, do it.

386
00:33:21,537 --> 00:33:24,607
Let Aunt Ruth not force.

387
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:28,745
Disobedience.
It also comes with.

388
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:31,895
I give it five for your complicity.

389
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,045
Ten Meg.

390
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:40,095
And another five for disobedience.
That makes twenty.

391
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,995
Stay here, guys.

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,435
Girls just cry.

393
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:45,589
There is nothing to do.

394
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:50,350
This is for her own good.
Your presence there contributes to this.

395
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:58,621
Dare not to touch her ...

396
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:03,329
Not as fun as your little sister
be beaten.

397
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,976
Right, Megan.

398
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:07,893
You might teach people
your own age to address.

399
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:16,102
Hold on, vixen.
- I'm not ready, sweetie.

400
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:24,081
Please stop.

401
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,720
You have two more credits.

402
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,372
Give me that ring, Meg.

403
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,877
That was my mother.
- Your mother is dead.

404
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,972
You live in my house,
I determine the rules here.

405
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:47,262
Give me the damn ring.

406
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,481
I gotta go.

407
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:58,571
This is only a small domestic
disagreement. It remains among us.

408
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:00,466
You saw what you saw ...

409
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,277
but nobody goes
else to.

410
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:06,589
Understood?

411
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:24,260
Hey guys, what do you want?
- A red popsicles.

412
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:28,575
For me a brown cow.
- Thanks, guys.

413
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:36,813
What time does the fireworks?
- Around half past eight, I think.

414
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,645
Come sit with us.

415
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:06,334
Donnie, get a few beers.

416
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,626
You sent a policeman
to my mother.

417
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:28,077
Sit down, Willie.

418
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,418
Sit down, I say.

419
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,594
What I wonder is
what you expected, Megan.

420
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:44,120
What went through your head?

421
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:50,356
Did you really think he is you
road would bring?

422
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:51,962
You and Susan.

423
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,454
You are away?

424
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,405
I assure you
that it will not happen.

425
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:10,061
He takes you nowhere,
because he did not care.

426
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:13,852
What's left?

427
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,738
What else can you do?

428
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:21,670
Did you think I scared him
would be?

429
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:37,796
The question is.

430
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,946
What do we do now?

431
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:48,638
Nothing on this man or to the
Any man scares me.

432
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:52,593
If you did not know, I hope
that you have by now.

433
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:56,870
But I can not even five feet
the police to let go.

434
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,938
So the question is ...

435
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,963
What do we do?

436
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:10,566
Was there a place where you
can go, I would send you there.

437
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:17,272
I is not stupid slut needed
to damage my reputation.

438
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:21,410
And they pay me enough
to be stabbing you in much trouble.

439
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:26,107
I will have another good
about it.

440
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,903
Go to your room.

441
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:50,399
I mean everyone.

442
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,755
You too, Davy.

443
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,614
Sorry, but I must
think hard work.

444
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:06,389
Would you go for a beer?
- No, thanks.

445
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:11,587
Tell your papa but not who gave it to you.

446
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:14,705
Thanks, Ruth.
- Aunt Ruth.

447
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,949
Have you even thought about?
- What?

448
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:25,061
Meg to the game
to participate.

449
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:27,425
We now have our own game.

450
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,878
I think not, David.

451
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,339
I stayed there so often before sleep.

452
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:42,221
The last time no longer.

453
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:46,313
Is it because Megan and Susan?
- Yes.

454
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:51,633
I do not understand.
For me this is the same as before.

455
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,393
It is not the same,
and you know well what is at stake.

456
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,523
I do not know, ma.
- What is it about?

457
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:04,345
He wants to spend the night there again.
- Besides?

458
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:07,005
Let him sleep.

459
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:13,422
You clearly know the latest
developments not.

460
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,935
When the Chandlers live now
two young girls.

461
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:22,361
Do not be silly, Robert.
- You're silly.

462
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,136
Is there any coffee?

463
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,393
Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

464
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:42,213
Now we are complete.

465
00:41:42,218 --> 00:41:45,123
The game is something to tell.

466
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,933
What say?
- A secret.

467
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,707
Sounds good. But how do they
with the gag in her mouth?

468
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,722
They may still not
talk, Mom.

469
00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:56,932
You want something, Meggie?
- No, she's not ready.

470
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:58,395
What happens now?

471
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:02,228
Now we take a book.

472
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,351
Confession it.

473
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:17,858
Take a book down.

474
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:26,606
Let's see how long they stand it.
- It must have hurt after a while.

475
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,646
She is still too easy.

476
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,386
Should they not be allowed
to confess to?

477
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:36,355
No, not so fast.
Take away the other book, Willie.

478
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:46,483
We have to undress her.
- Yes, her dress.

479
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:48,820
Shut up.
- I do not think this is good ...

480
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:50,701
We got the admission.

481
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:54,237
Let her undressed.

482
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:57,124
That is the game, right?

483
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:59,796
Then we start it.
- I got it.

484
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:03,444
Want to save her clothes, ma?
But then I just underpants.

485
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,392
No, I do not care.

486
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:14,967
I want to hurt you.

487
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,435
But if you try something ...

488
00:43:18,922 --> 00:43:20,996
I will have to.

489
00:43:21,704 --> 00:43:23,708
Do not be stupid.

490
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:37,201
Please.

491
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,115
No stairs.

492
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:29,935
Ready to confess, Megan?

493
00:44:29,945 --> 00:44:31,781
Let me do the rest.

494
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:34,589
Then let her confess.

495
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:45,207
Now you can confess.

496
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:47,530
Get the ropes.

497
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:59,481
Do you untie my arms?
They really do hurt.

498
00:45:00,174 --> 00:45:03,432
You get no more.
- Come, confession.

499
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,724
Tell us how you play with yourself.

500
00:45:05,734 --> 00:45:07,967
You stick your finger in there might not?

501
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:11,990
Tell us what you do.
- In the sly.

502
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:17,577
Is David here?
- Yes, that is here.

503
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:25,783
Where is Susan?
- That there is.

504
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,583
The hell with Susan,
where is your confession?

505
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,779
I have nothing to confess!

506
00:45:36,424 --> 00:45:39,315
Let me go.

507
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:43,137
Touch not that girl.

508
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,217
I do not want one of you
touch her.

509
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:49,052
One girl even if it is not proper.

510
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:51,987
Keep your hands off her.
Understood?

511
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,806
First we have the gag
back into her mouth.

512
00:45:57,809 --> 00:45:59,419
That is totally disgusting.

513
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,526
So it is not dirty.

514
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:08,587
They may not all night
are called. Push him into it.

515
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:18,762
Maybe you have a slightly
thinking, girl.

516
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:20,990
About two things even.

517
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:22,122
First.

518
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:26,845
Your little sister before you can hang
instead of you.

519
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,130
And second.

520
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:33,185
I know what nasty things you did.
And I wanted them to hear from you sometimes.

521
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,739
Perhaps this confession
yet so no children's game.

522
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:40,684
Either I hear it from one ...

523
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:43,849
I hear either of the other.

524
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:46,024
Think about it.

525
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:09,065
I wonder how it feels.

526
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:14,113
As long standing position with hands
tied above her head.

527
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:19,024
It must hurt.

528
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:21,697
Terribly hurt.

529
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,384
Have you seen her?

530
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:28,076
How they looked.

531
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,247
Down there.
- I've never seen anything like it.

532
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,337
Let us go see what they make.

533
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:38,857
Then we have another good look.
- Are you crazy? Mama would hear.

534
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:41,857
We can silently.
- Are you kidding?

535
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,111
Even if farting
under the sheets, they hear it already

536
00:47:58,052 --> 00:47:59,464
Silence.

537
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:01,841
She'll want some water.

538
00:48:01,848 --> 00:48:04,838
You idiot. If we give her water
we must remove the prop.

539
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:07,645
So what?
She will not make noise.

540
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:11,075
You will make any noise he Meg?

541
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,200
Otherwise make your mom awake.

542
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:18,596
If they make noise, they find problems.
She is not stupid.

543
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:41,379
My arms and my shoulders
do so much.

544
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:43,951
Maybe we can ...
- A little.

545
00:48:44,473 --> 00:48:48,704
On one condition.
- All you ask.

546
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,968
You must promise that you will not fight
and you will tell it to anyone.

547
00:48:51,975 --> 00:48:53,205
Never.

548
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:56,064
What say?
- You know.

549
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,821
We will hurt you,
we only want to touch it.

550
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:04,658
None of you will touch me.

551
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:08,978
Wrong. Who will stop us?
- I.

552
00:49:08,985 --> 00:49:12,033
Really? How?

553
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,492
You will only get one chance to
touching me, you bastards ...

554
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,635
for I will start screaming.

555
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:26,462
That leaves the ropes where they are.

556
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,554
And you get back a lump in your mouth.

557
00:49:28,604 --> 00:49:30,533
And that's that.

558
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,628
Well.

559
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:34,564
Gag me.

560
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:38,607
And then make out of here.

561
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:41,041
We do that.

562
00:49:41,076 --> 00:49:42,536
Open your mouth.

563
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,236
Remember our deal.

564
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:46,092
You got your water.

565
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,974
But we have not been.
Understood?

566
00:49:53,698 --> 00:49:56,931
Come on guys, learn the ropes
looser. Ruth will not see.

567
00:49:57,038 --> 00:50:00,432
Look at her.
It takes long before the morning.

568
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:13,531
Goodbye.

569
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:28,081
Forward.

570
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:37,174
Eat your toast on, sweetie.

571
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:43,155
Come on sweetie, eat some of.
- Better not.

572
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,423
I will not squander food, Meg.

573
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,388
I made that toast for you.

574
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:50,816
What do you want me to do?
Discard it?

575
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:53,348
Put him there.
I eat it later on.

576
00:50:53,355 --> 00:50:55,283
This attracts insects.

577
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,518
Cockroaches and ants.

578
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:00,598
I do not want bugs in the house.

579
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:03,797
You must eat now.
While fresh.

580
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:08,232
I would eat it,
but I can hardly swallow.

581
00:51:08,237 --> 00:51:10,332
I will drink tea.
Is that good?

582
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:13,187
Nobody has said
it would be easy.

583
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:18,762
You're a woman, Meg.
And that's not easy.

584
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:21,501
Eat.

585
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:28,686
You have broken my head, damn.

586
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:34,786
Do you think tea is cheap?

587
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:37,471
I've not broken.

588
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:39,176
What is this?

589
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:42,711
Who will clean up the mess?

590
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,561
I do though.
I promise.

591
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,794
Susan, come here.

592
00:51:48,943 --> 00:51:54,008
You love Meg down, the
case they mean or stupid to do.

593
00:51:55,506 --> 00:51:57,592
Come stand here.

594
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:01,460
So we clean the floor.

595
00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:03,601
We start with the slut.

596
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,395
We will insert a new regulation.

597
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:07,930
Once you disobey ...

598
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:11,381
speaks to me, strengthens me energy,
anything, missy ...

599
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,834
will pay them.

600
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:15,557
We will try that.

601
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:17,917
Do you think honestly, Suzie?

602
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:21,740
Do you think you should pay
for what your dirty sister doing?

603
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,405
No.
- Of course not.

604
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:28,609
But nobody says
that life is fair.

605
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:34,202
Put the dress the girl up
and pull her panties down to Mama.

606
00:53:06,544 --> 00:53:07,782
Where you going?

607
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:09,092
I need help with my dad.

608
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:12,879
We will later play in the water tower.
Involvement

609
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:39,228
Have you ever seen a guy
a girl look whack?

610
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:44,165
I think so.
Drunks or children.

611
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,485
Have you ever wondered
or could do?

612
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,980
You mean if I got talking?

613
00:53:55,896 --> 00:53:57,433
This is a difficult question.

614
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,542
A woman is a man
sometimes rod hunting.

615
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:04,569
But you must always think
that the weaker sex.

616
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,782
And you're not tough.

617
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:13,879
But despite ...

618
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:15,495
I have seen women who
it deserved.

619
00:54:15,504 --> 00:54:17,804
If you work in a bar that you see sometimes.

620
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:20,979
A woman has too much to drink.
She is bold and boisterous.

621
00:54:20,982 --> 00:54:23,878
Sometimes they give a stab at the man
who is with her. What should they do?

622
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:25,341
Sit?

623
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:28,463
So he gives her a slap.

624
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:32,002
But you just said ...
- There are exceptions to the rule.

625
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,339
You should never hit a woman.

626
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:38,136
And I care but
you never see it.

627
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:40,463
But sometimes ...

628
00:54:41,914 --> 00:54:44,012
you are bound.

629
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,542
Because they have driven too far.

630
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:49,224
But for both parties.

631
00:54:50,738 --> 00:54:52,242
Good advice.

632
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,546
Keep your hands off and makes you
your own business. Man or woman.

633
00:54:56,854 --> 00:54:59,069
You will avoid problems.

634
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:37,916
Hi, Susan.

635
00:55:40,023 --> 00:55:42,060
Ruth is here somewhere?

636
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,456
She is top of the rest.

637
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:54,309
I can not stop them.

638
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:57,830
Do you?
- I know.

639
00:56:00,428 --> 00:56:02,910
I would do it I can.

640
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,610
Do not you think it enough?
- Not dicks.

641
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:25,730
Get up, piece of shit.

642
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:28,335
Your turn to tie her down.

643
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,551
Were you forget something, David?

644
00:58:39,076 --> 00:58:41,100
Sorry.

645
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:46,127
I have something to say.

646
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:26,870
Stop moving.

647
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,939
Good morning, David.

648
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,371
Take a beer if you want.
- Maybe later.

649
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:47,195
Goddamn, Donnie.

650
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,747
Now we close fires.

651
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:02,964
Shut up.

652
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:07,427
Shut up or I'll do it again.

653
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:15,829
You go look.
Careful.

654
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,794
Did you hear me?

655
01:00:19,654 --> 01:00:23,535
I said:
Shut up or I'll do it again.

656
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,607
Do they handle
when someone at the door?

657
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:31,632
Should you not control that, Ruth?

658
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:33,945
Suppose again
Mr. Jennings is.

659
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:36,328
Who?
- The police, Ruth.

660
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,521
I can monitor her for you.

661
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:47,844
Her guard.
- To ensure that they are not running away.

662
01:00:51,074 --> 01:00:54,708
But monitor her.
Good idea.

663
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:06,450
If I hear a noise, I died
you both. I promise.

664
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:10,600
Not simply punish, but murder.
Death.

665
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:16,074
Do you understand that, David?
Is that clear? Well.

666
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,400
Very good.

667
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,399
Here she comes.

668
01:01:37,415 --> 01:01:38,834
Good afternoon, Mrs. Chandler.

669
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:42,349
I was in the neighborhood and come to see
how the girls go.

670
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:45,813
That is kind.
They make it very well.

671
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,942
Come in, please.

672
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,073
The girls are going shopping.

673
01:01:58,078 --> 01:02:01,463
Want a cup of coffee?
- No thanks, Mrs. Chandler.

674
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:05,926
Or a glass of lemonade?
It is such a hot day.

675
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:11,851
No thanks.

676
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:15,691
I will help you out, Megan.
I have some money saved.

677
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,156
Everything is okay.

678
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:22,030
I make sure that nothing
Susan happens.

679
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,368
And that is all right
when you return.

680
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:31,129
Go to the police.

681
01:02:31,922 --> 01:02:34,090
And show them this.

682
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,409
Tonight.
I promise.

683
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:52,755
He is my shadow.

684
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:55,070
Ms. Chandler, I ...

685
01:02:55,077 --> 01:02:57,350
Everyone calls me Ruth.

686
01:02:57,847 --> 01:03:01,685
I got a call from
Ms Marina from the street.

687
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:03,935
Apparently, her eldest son, Tony ...

688
01:03:03,938 --> 01:03:07,000
We know Tony very well.
A very sweet boy.

689
01:03:07,004 --> 01:03:12,833
He told his mother that his boys
Meg saw whack away.

690
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:17,759
You know that children always exaggerate.
It would have been a familieruzietje.

691
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:20,487
He told her that she
used as a punching bag.

692
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:23,538
Something my boys would never do.

693
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,359
How did he know?
- What did he know?

694
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:35,535
Did you tell him?
- As told? What do you mean?

695
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,463
Do not kid me, David.

696
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:39,943
According to her ma told you that Jennings
at the door.

697
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,498
How did you know that he was?

698
01:03:41,503 --> 01:03:44,013
I assumed that.
- You had or guessed.

699
01:03:44,018 --> 01:03:46,613
I just wanted Ruth ...
- What did you do to her?

700
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:50,669
I wanted her here wegkrijgen.
She looked exactly a zombie.

701
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,222
She was indeed quite strange.

702
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:56,240
That is true.

703
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,917
What happens to Meg?
- What do you mean?

704
01:04:00,782 --> 01:04:04,474
We need something that burns
lubrication, for they become infected.

705
01:04:05,656 --> 01:04:07,257
To hell with her.

706
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,354
I'm not quite finished with her.

707
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:14,067
But then ...

708
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:15,904
I am perhaps.

709
01:04:17,642 --> 01:04:19,062
I do not know.

710
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:22,988
I just do not know.

711
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:16,422
Turn that TV softer, Ralphie.

712
01:05:52,752 --> 01:05:54,537
I will leave the back door.

713
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:59,295
They will think that I forgot.
Give me half an hour.

714
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:04,567
Here, take this.
- I can not do this, David.

715
01:06:05,604 --> 01:06:08,301
If something goes wrong.

716
01:06:08,305 --> 01:06:10,551
And they find it in me.

717
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,331
Then they will know you were here.

718
01:06:14,383 --> 01:06:17,638
And then we never get any chance.

719
01:06:20,071 --> 01:06:22,114
Hide it for me.

720
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:23,916
Among the large stone.

721
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,940
You have really gone, believe me.

722
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:37,522
I'm so sorry.

723
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,891
It is the last thing you did
that is important.

724
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:20,822
Come in and close the door.

725
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:58,025
Stay here.

726
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,972
There good for you, girl.

727
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:12,291
You will now have a disease,
but that's not bad.

728
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:14,620
Today they
there treatments.

729
01:09:16,043 --> 01:09:18,972
I want my mommy.
- Shut up, dammit.

730
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:25,073
Who wants another round?
Eddie? Davy?

731
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,098
I want it.

732
01:09:26,102 --> 01:09:30,482
I do not know. So right after your brother.
That seems incest.

733
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:33,182
Come on, ma.
- No, not really.

734
01:09:33,187 --> 01:09:36,151
It would be here hooker
do not care, but ...

735
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:38,460
it seems to me ...

736
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:44,023
much more appropriate as it would be Eddie
or Davy.

737
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:49,877
Perhaps you are wise guys.
I would not touch her in any case.

738
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:52,986
But I'm just not a man.

739
01:09:52,995 --> 01:09:56,281
I just want to cut her.
- Me too.

740
01:09:56,285 --> 01:09:57,591
Cutting?

741
01:09:57,597 --> 01:10:01,551
Why let her fuck you Donnie?
- Shut up, I am talking to Ralphie.

742
01:10:02,274 --> 01:10:03,786
What do you mean cut, baby?

743
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:07,357
Something in her letter, so everyone
knows that she is a whore.

744
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,088
We cut it, ma.

745
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:24,964
This show you do not do?

746
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,795
The boys have decided.

747
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:31,061
So we do it.

748
01:10:31,536 --> 01:10:35,284
You know what that slut
wanted to do last night?

749
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:37,410
She tried to get out of here.

750
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:40,577
Someone left the door open.

751
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:46,084
We think it was Donnie.
He was here last.

752
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:49,854
And he's always been kind to her.

753
01:10:52,284 --> 01:10:54,094
Why can not I?
- What then?

754
01:10:54,098 --> 01:10:55,373
Fuck her.

755
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,043
As I say, damn.
That's incest.

756
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:02,986
Would you mess your brothers in dirt?
You're disgusting.

757
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,980
Just like your father.
Say nothing to me.

758
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:07,855
This may not make you, Ruth.

759
01:11:07,933 --> 01:11:09,494
No?

760
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:11,643
This is not right.

761
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:15,627
Please tell me no
hear or what not, boy.

762
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:20,142
Never say that to me.

763
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,532
Here we go.

764
01:11:27,518 --> 01:11:29,627
We will have heat.

765
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:32,037
Otherwise she gets an infection.

766
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:40,043
I'm outta here.
- You're not going anywhere.

767
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:43,491
I want to see this.

768
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,991
Close your eyes, damn.

769
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:40,184
See?

770
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,374
That there forever, Meggie.

771
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:44,586
You will never have married.

772
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:48,419
You will no
exposing your clothes.

773
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:52,690
That is best for you.

774
01:12:52,961 --> 01:12:54,654
No man will want you.

775
01:12:54,656 --> 01:12:56,913
You will never have problems with children.

776
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:58,496
Price you happy.

777
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:02,473
You liked to be nice to see.

778
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,358
To be sexy.

779
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:08,487
This world is a woman
more ugly.

780
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,532
So many states they are no longer.
- I told you.

781
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,836
A woman knows such things.

782
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,775
She does not look out.

783
01:13:26,155 --> 01:13:27,902
Fuck me.

784
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:30,901
You would better her
hang again.

785
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:34,568
Hold on.

786
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:40,081
We have ensured
that no man will want her.

787
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:42,315
But the problem is.

788
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:53,484
That Meg perhaps even
a man wants.

789
01:13:53,854 --> 01:13:56,065
Then life becomes a torture.

790
01:13:56,071 --> 01:14:00,454
A woman is not over her
a body man.

791
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:04,402
She wants him only
at a particular place.

792
01:14:04,781 --> 01:14:07,245
You know what I'm talking about?

793
01:14:07,249 --> 01:14:09,625
That'll come, dear.

794
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:13,492
A woman wants a man
between her legs.

795
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:15,423
In a small place.

796
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:18,492
If you spot away ...

797
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,560
You know what happens then?

798
01:14:21,026 --> 01:14:24,219
Then you take away her desire.

799
01:14:24,223 --> 01:14:27,245
You take that away forever.
That succeeds.

800
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,589
In some countries they always do.

801
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:34,042
It is very common
as a girl a certain age.

802
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:38,656
In Africa, for example,
in New Guinea.

803
01:14:38,962 --> 01:14:42,151
They find it even
a civilized custom.

804
01:14:42,496 --> 01:14:46,788
So I wonder
why would we not do?

805
01:14:47,285 --> 01:14:51,574
We just take
that one little spot away.

806
01:14:51,978 --> 01:14:54,274
We burn it away.

807
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:58,326
Then our work will be perfect.

808
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:07,297
What do you think you going?

809
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:11,137
Wanted this to your whore of a mother
to tell?

810
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:13,827
If you wanted to send Jennings agent?

811
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:16,177
Now hear her.

812
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:20,891
I do not know what to do with you
to do, but I find something.

813
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:25,321
Be happy that you have no place
as it has.

814
01:15:25,327 --> 01:15:30,344
But you yourself have two boyfriends
where you can to make sure.

815
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,586
Tie him up, boys.

816
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:42,695
Where were we?

817
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:46,080
You hate me?
- Not at all.

818
01:17:48,603 --> 01:17:50,308
And even Meg.

819
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:53,478
It's all my fault.

820
01:17:53,947 --> 01:17:58,874
Without Meg yesterday i had to
run away and never return.

821
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,021
She has tried, Susan.

822
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:05,024
But they have caught her.

823
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:08,302
She grabbed her when she came up
to fetch me.

824
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:12,944
She could not leave.

825
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:14,827
I left the door open.

826
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:18,503
She would come and collect you later.

827
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:21,058
Why is not immediately fled?

828
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:24,742
Probably because ...

829
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:28,656
It happens that Ruth ...

830
01:18:29,594 --> 01:18:32,127
touching me.

831
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:36,063
At one time she did me bleed.

832
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:37,477
I told Meg.

833
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:42,507
That was very angry and told Ruth
she knew what she did with me.

834
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,374
And when Ruth began beating her.

835
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:47,270
She hit her very much.

836
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:50,252
She had to run away without me.

837
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:53,454
I've never liked it
pain was made.

838
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:59,262
Calm down, it will be fine.

839
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:06,343
No Meg, do not.

840
01:19:08,097 --> 01:19:10,698
I'm here, and Susan is there.

841
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,846
It hurts so much.

842
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,337
Do not move.

843
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:27,114
Sorry, Megan.

844
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:30,396
I am so sorry.

845
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:33,007
It is good, Susan.

846
01:19:36,202 --> 01:19:39,287
We have tried.

847
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,470
Is it night?

848
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:45,589
Therefore, I think ...

849
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:48,406
my parents are worried
if I did not come home.

850
01:19:48,441 --> 01:19:53,094
I can not, David.
- Rest.

851
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:58,914
I have to find something that I
can hurt them.

852
01:19:58,921 --> 01:20:01,037
So we miscarry.

853
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:03,144
There is nothing.

854
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,168
You know how many times
I've tried?

855
01:20:06,203 --> 01:20:07,928
There is something.

856
01:20:10,695 --> 01:20:12,266
Maybe.

857
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:16,964
But there must have something else
done.

858
01:21:34,772 --> 01:21:36,894
Put the knife away.

859
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,922
Throw it away, I say.

860
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,725
Take him away.

861
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:02,988
What happened?

862
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,411
It was Ruth, Mr. Jennings.

863
01:22:05,825 --> 01:22:07,658
It was Ruth.

864
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:10,437
She has done Meg.

865
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:12,274
Because that gave her problems.

866
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,128
Stay here with her.

867
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:46,941
Not talking.

868
01:22:48,203 --> 01:22:50,476
Would you do me a favor?

869
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:52,727
Of course.

870
01:22:55,966 --> 01:22:59,319
Want the ring of my mother
return?

871
01:23:34,967 --> 01:23:36,818
Thank you.

872
01:23:41,927 --> 01:23:45,502
I thought it was a dream.

873
01:23:49,444 --> 01:23:53,237
That you tried to help me.

874
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:58,153
A dream.

875
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:04,427
But it was no dream.

876
01:24:05,443 --> 01:24:09,678
You have not abandoned me.

877
01:24:14,545 --> 01:24:17,543
Do you mind?

878
01:24:25,778 --> 01:24:28,480
Now she can ...

879
01:24:30,478 --> 01:24:34,013
I do not hurt anymore.

880
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:44,789
You will now take care of me, right?

881
01:24:49,748 --> 01:24:52,580
And Susan too?

882
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:03,559
I do not think I will save.

883
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:08,679
I love you.

884
01:26:05,806 --> 01:26:08,137
The past always catches up to you.

885
01:26:08,139 --> 01:26:10,346
Whether you like it or not.

886
01:26:13,011 --> 01:26:17,481
This can be a gift,
or a curse. If you allow that.

887
01:26:39,702 --> 01:26:42,907
I will never be the gift
Meg Loughlin forgotten.

888
01:26:44,047 --> 01:26:47,590
Although I am haunted by
the agony that I have failed ...

889
01:26:47,593 --> 01:26:49,780
somebody to save.

890
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:53,759
But as she taught me ...

891
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:58,195
What you did last,
is important.

892
01:26:59,305 --> 01:27:59,901
