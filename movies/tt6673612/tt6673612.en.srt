00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:56,632
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor,</i>

3
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:00,436
<i>known for his
extraordinary ability.</i>

4
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:03,472
<i>He could talk to animals.</i>

5
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:07,845
<i>Dr. Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide.</i>

6
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,680
<i>Even the queen of England called on him.</i>

7
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,482
<i>So grateful for his help,</i>

8
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,719
<i>she gifted him
a wondrous sanctuary,</i>

9
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,656
<i>whose doors were open
to all creatures.</i>

10
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:21,725
<i>His days belonged
to the animals,</i>

11
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:26,029
<i>but his heart belonged
to one woman:</i>

12
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,967
<i>Lily, the fearless explorer.</i>

13
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,504
<i>They traveled the globe
going on great adventures,</i>

14
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,477
<i>defending creatures who could
not defend themselves.</i>

15
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:47,551
<i>They made
an extraordinary team.</i>

16
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,589
<i>Soon, that team
became a family.</i>

17
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:55,059
<i>With Lily by his side,</i>

18
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:58,629
<i>Dolittle never felt more alive,</i>

19
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,702
<i>until one day,
she left on an adventure.</i>

20
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,546
<i>Lily died at sea.</i>

21
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:20,818
<i>Heartbroken, he locked
the gates of the manor</i>

22
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,955
<i>and completely retreated
from the world.</i>

23
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:28,493
<i>As for me and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,</i>

24
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:32,899
<i>we were left to wonder...
could anyone save his?</i>

25
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:39,972
<i>Until one morning,
a most unlikely creature</i>

26
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:42,707
<i>found its way
into Dolittle's life.</i>

27
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,576
<i>A very special boy.</i>

28
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,612
<i>In a time where people
thought of animals</i>

29
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,950
<i>only as possessions,
food or sport,</i>

30
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,819
<i>this boy felt
quite differently.</i>

31
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:05,130
This way,
me scattered squirrel.

32
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,300
Right.

33
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,867
Junior flushes 'em.

34
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,602
You shoot 'em. Yeah?

35
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,804
Right. Good plan, Dad.

36
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,105
Get ready.

37
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:15,574
- Shoulder your gun.
- Do I have to, Uncle?

38
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,009
Come on, boy.

39
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:18,711
Duck!

40
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,579
Duck! Duck, duck!

41
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,881
- Duck! Duck!
- There, there they go.

42
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,683
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
You got him. You got him.

43
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:25,684
You got him.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

44
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,954
- Oh, oh, no, I can't.
- Shoot, shoot, shoot!

45
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:33,827
You can't keep
missing on purpose.

46
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,028
Oh, look.

47
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,963
He hit something this time.

48
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,171
Oh, no.

49
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,040
We have to help him.

50
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,908
Aye.

51
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,610
We never leave
an animal suffering.

52
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,911
Not on our error.

53
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,015
Here you go.

54
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:03,058
He's a very odd boy.

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,804
Follow Poly.

56
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,388
"Home of Dr. John
and Lily Dolittle.

57
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,990
We treat all animals."

58
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,168
Ah-ah.

59
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,305
Follow Poly.

60
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,709
Secret entrance.

61
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:39,788
P-Poly? Where'd you go?

62
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,006
Good... good... good dog.

63
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,143
Big, hairy...

64
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,233
It's not good.

65
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:05,137
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here.

66
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,605
Just ignore them.

67
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,374
There's no getting past
a Kalahari snare, Doc.

68
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,907
It's an ingenious design.

69
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,909
I think you just
caught yourself a boy.

70
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:13,279
Let me see.
Wait, I don't want to see.

71
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,913
Just make it go away.

72
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:17,049
Deep breaths, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back.

73
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,317
Don't be afraid, John.

74
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,918
It's just a boy.

75
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,453
This is an opportunity.

76
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:24,456
Oh, this is a nightmare!

77
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,928
- Oh, come on.
- Pardon me.

78
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,133
Whatever are you
doing up there?

79
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,067
I've come from
Buckingham Palace

80
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,869
on urgent business.

81
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:40,205
Can you tell me if this is
the home of John Dolittle?

82
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,309
Who are you?

83
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,209
You may call me Lady Rose.

84
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,212
And you are?

85
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,047
Stubbins.

86
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,284
Could you help me down?

87
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:53,320
This goes against
Dolittle's rules.

88
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:55,954
Why are humans
against the rules again?

89
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,424
If you let humans too close,
you'll get hurt

90
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,492
more than you would if
you didn't let them in at all.

91
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:00,960
Isn't that right, Doc?

92
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,128
That's enough, everybody.

93
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,363
Back to our routine.

94
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:05,098
- We have a very full day.
- John!

95
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,033
Pull yourself together.

96
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,235
You can't ignore people
just because they're...

97
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,670
people.

98
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,673
What if they need help?

99
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:16,376
Possum. Play dead.

100
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,978
This is ridiculous.

101
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,313
Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?

102
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:22,148
You're the only one with arms.

103
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,384
I think chess was
enough pressure for one day.

104
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:25,486
Chee-Chee, boy,

105
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,187
this is what we trained for.

106
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,490
Be brave and get rid of 'em.

107
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,392
And don't forget your mantra.

108
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,528
I am not a prisoner of fear?

109
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,264
You are not a prisoner of fear.

110
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,435
Have you been here before?

111
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:43,371
The queen's told me
all about it.

112
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,706
It's a most unusual place.

113
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,276
I'm prepared for anything.

114
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,153
Wonderful.

115
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,088
A gorilla answering the door.

116
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,991
Just as the queen said.

117
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:12,233
Oh, wait a minute.

118
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:14,438
I have an injured squirrel.

119
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,947
I should never have let you go.

120
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,099
Hello?

121
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,622
Oh, look at you.

122
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,460
Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?

123
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,361
Move, please.

124
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:13,629
This is my hiding spot.

125
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,369
Not here.

126
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,106
Are you all right down there?

127
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,541
Yeah. Fine.

128
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,410
- Go on.
- Dr. Dolittle?

129
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:30,046
- Yeah, right.
- You have been summoned

130
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:33,115
to Buckingham Palace
by the queen herself.

131
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,450
Hoo-ha.

132
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,052
Go on.

133
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,522
You should know,
she's fallen gravely ill.

134
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,126
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

135
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,395
Do you understand what
I'm saying?

136
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,465
Go... on.

137
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,567
Go on and be gone!

138
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,570
I don't care about anyone,
anything, anywhere anymore.

139
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,208
The birds will show you out.

140
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,143
Right, everything's tidy.

141
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,247
Lunch will be served in a minute now.

142
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:10,687
Mmm!

143
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,589
Smells lovely, Doc.

144
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,157
Thanks very much.

145
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,462
Hey, Doc, save some
for us this time.

146
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:22,699
Sorry, Doc.
Guess I'm scared of kids, too.

147
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,269
Don't worry about that.
Come on, let's eat.

148
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,705
I'm going to be offering today
a brothy soup.

149
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:30,374
You'll never believe
what we caught in the net.

150
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,342
The queen has asked for you
by name, sir.

151
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:33,678
Are you hard of hearing?

152
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,580
I told you,
I'm closed for business.

153
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:42,252
What business?

154
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,187
Treating humans.

155
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:48,893
Intruder alert.

156
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,498
Don't worry. I'm fine.

157
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,366
Well, I'm not.

158
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:57,168
My house is descending
into chaos.

159
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,603
I-Is he yours?

160
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,339
I don't own anybody.

161
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,741
Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with.

162
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,212
He's always cold.

163
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:10,350
I have an injured squirrel.

164
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:13,318
I don't know what to do.

165
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,088
How was he injured?

166
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:17,623
I...

167
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,357
I-I shot him.

168
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,192
What? I can't hear you.

169
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,361
I shot him,
but it was an accident.

170
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:26,230
Of course,
an accidental firing upon.

171
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,534
Humans never change.

172
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:31,403
He's very hurt.

173
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,708
Please help him.

174
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:44,516
Take that.

175
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,387
And this.

176
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,325
I...

177
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,795
I... I...

178
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:58,499
I'm too beautiful to die.

179
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,506
Oh.

180
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,684
Yes?

181
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,786
He's with us.

182
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:23,823
Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps
and disinfect the surgery.

183
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,492
You will not tend to a squirrel

184
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,761
while the queen of England's
life hangs in the balance.

185
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,363
Oh, you don't know me
very well, do you?

186
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,631
Don't drop him.

187
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,000
We got a code red.

188
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,503
Code red, code red, everybody.

189
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,005
The doctor is back!

190
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,008
Hang on, little buddy.

191
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,010
Whew!
I haven't done this in a while.

192
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,280
Let's get everything
the way Doc likes it.

193
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,583
Don't worry. We got you, pal.

194
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,494
Righto. Let's save
this squirrel, shall we?

195
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:01,361
Okay.

196
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,631
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

197
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,466
If I die, I swear
I will haunt your house.

198
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:06,667
Sterilize the scalpels.

199
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:08,269
Do not lick any instruments.

200
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,637
Patient's condition
has stabilized.

201
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:14,775
They're understanding him,
and he's understanding them,

202
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,744
in their own languages.

203
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,618
Going through the left
ventricle... it's brilliant.

204
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,054
Wow.

205
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:27,621
Dab-Dab, forceps, please.

206
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:28,789
Here you go.

207
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,491
That's a piece of celery.

208
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:31,625
Forceps, Dab-Dab.

209
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:33,494
Oh, sorry. Here you go.

210
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:34,763
Still celery.

211
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:35,797
Forceps?

212
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,631
- Carrot, that is.
- Forceps?

213
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,366
That's a different piece
of celery.

214
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,367
Got it. Forceps.

215
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,636
No, still celery.

216
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:43,872
Never mind. I'll get it myself.

217
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:46,777
I want to know how to talk
to the animals.

218
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,545
Chee-Chee, brow.

219
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,748
My brow as well,
when you've got a second.

220
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,516
Right. Sorry.

221
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:58,086
I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice.

222
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:01,358
Her Majesty has designated
this land a nature preserve.

223
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:03,625
If she dies,

224
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,495
the deed will be owned
by the Treasury,

225
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,665
and this place goes away.

226
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,566
- Shut down?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,870
There you are.

228
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,570
Whoo, still got it, Doc.

229
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,339
Oh, wow.

230
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,875
Ah.

231
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,408
There, Cheech.

232
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,911
That's the spot.

233
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,412
Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we?

234
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,916
He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off.

235
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,457
Revenge.

236
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,391
Okay, okay.

237
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,394
Enough with the pampering.

238
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,963
You need to go
and help the queen.

239
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:44,534
There are things
I no longer do:

240
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,836
work with humans
or leave the house.

241
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,838
- Or bathe.
- Oh, exercise.

242
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,576
Express emotional
vulnerability.

243
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:54,977
Wake up, John.

244
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,413
If the queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed,

245
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,582
and we'd lose this house.

246
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,485
You're talking out of
your tail feathers, Poly.

247
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,453
The deed was for life.

248
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:07,623
The last time I checked,
I was very much alive.

249
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,661
The queen's life, John,
not yours.

250
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,995
Look at that.

251
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,597
It just rolls off my back.

252
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,601
I knew I shouldn't have let
monkeys proofread the contract.

253
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,537
Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!

254
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,942
It gets worse. We'll be
thrown out of these gates

255
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,010
right in the middle
of hunting season!

256
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,512
- What?
- No, no, no.

257
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,780
Breathe, Chee-Chee.

258
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,648
We get kicked out
if the queen dies?

259
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,684
- We're gonna be hunted!
- Everybody, calm down.

260
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,621
- Look at the state of him now.
- Fear not.

261
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,490
I have an in at, uh,
Regent's Park Zoo.

262
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,893
Everyone, pack your bags!

263
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,529
Ah-ah.

264
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,899
You help the queen,
or we are leaving.

265
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,636
- You're bluffing.
- Don't make me count.

266
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,504
Don't make me count.

267
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,773
One.

268
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,841
Three!

269
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,042
Two.

270
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,911
All right!

271
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,511
I'll do it.

272
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,513
Marvelous.

273
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,449
Right, let's get you
ready to go, honey.

274
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,218
- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that.

275
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,786
- Just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him.

276
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,787
Apologies, Doc.

277
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,222
Hold still, now.

278
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,025
Take your paws off me!

279
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,694
- This isn't gonna hurt a bit.
- Let's clean him up.

280
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,730
How dare you.

281
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,698
- Whoa.
- Oh, hey, guys.

282
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,634
Arthur? How long have you
been living in there?

283
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,602
I don't know.
What year is it?

284
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,971
Dab-Dab's got the razor.

285
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,740
That's still celery.

286
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,411
Nighty-night, Doc.

287
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,552
Dolittle used to
travel all around the world.

288
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,821
Look.

289
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,824
Rummaging through
my private projects, is it?

290
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,927
How is he?

291
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,728
Well, first things first,

292
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,897
the squirrel's name is Kevin.

293
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,666
Expect a full recovery.

294
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:56,602
And after some violent
grooming, it's been decided.

295
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:59,707
We will accompany you
to Buckingham Palace after all.

296
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,542
Hmm.
You are going back

297
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,978
to whatever burrow
you emerged from.

298
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,783
Try not to shoot anything
on your way home.

299
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,995
Maybe I-I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds.

300
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,629
We'll look after you, Cheech.

301
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:26,132
But we all go together,
just like the old days.

302
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,934
Oh, don't forget Doc's forceps.

303
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,635
That's a leek, Dab-Dab.

304
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:31,037
Sure it is.

305
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,604
Styx?

306
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,773
No.

307
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,842
Where are you? Oh.

308
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:37,844
So, uh, would you care
to come along?

309
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,016
I know.
I had other plans as well.

310
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,021
Hurry up. Hurry up.

311
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:48,890
Shh!

312
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,782
Prepare my ride.

313
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,584
Today's gonna be a good day.

314
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm gonna do nothing...
just prance around,

315
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:20,921
think my own thoughts and...

316
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:23,057
- Oh, he's walking this way. Not a great sign.
- Oh, uh...

317
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,692
He's got no beard.
He looks motivated.

318
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:25,926
Uh, no. Plimpton, don't be alarmed.

319
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,162
People only say that when
they're about to be alarming.

320
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,797
- Look, I know it's been a while.
- Sorry about this.

321
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,067
- And sorry about that.
- All right.

322
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:34,635
I'm unavailable.

323
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,803
Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?

324
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,772
We're going to save
the queen, bro!

325
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:39,707
I am not your bro.

326
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,609
You should be
an Eskimo's rug by now.

327
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,843
- Ow. Claws.
- Ow! Beak!

328
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:43,978
- Claws.
- Beak!

329
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,713
Now, now, gentlemen.

330
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:48,682
Oh, you've gained weight.

331
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,218
Why are you riding me?

332
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,620
There's, like, four horses
in front of us.

333
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,021
Cheer up, angry bird.

334
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,124
Kick back and enjoy the ride.

335
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:58,160
I am the ride.

336
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:03,231
Buckingham Palace.

337
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,903
We've hit the big time!

338
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:11,175
Full speed no longer required!

339
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:18,246
Whoa.

340
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,248
Welcome home, milady.

341
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,253
Guards! Guards!

342
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,828
Your ladyship, Rose.

343
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,063
They are the queen's
own guests.

344
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:37,032
Treat them accordingly.

345
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,867
You better
give us a wide berth.

346
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:39,968
Make way, boys.

347
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,838
Plimpton, don't. Stop.

348
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,773
- Don't stop? Odd decision, but...
- Stop!

349
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,443
Whoa!

350
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,048
Aah! Can't see!

351
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,052
Oh, my God.

352
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,887
Oh, uh...

353
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,856
Okay.

354
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:01,893
I blame the hat.

355
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:13,838
Dr. Müdfly.

356
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,072
Lord Badgley.

357
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,173
My lord.

358
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:19,909
I come from the House of Lords.

359
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:22,814
There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health.

360
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,717
I shall continue to leech

361
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:31,321
to circulate the vapors
in the bloodstream.

362
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:34,226
She'll be lucky
to last the week.

363
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:40,330
This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here.

364
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,000
You got a dying queen?
Not for long.

365
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,835
Dr. Dolittle is in the...

366
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,072
Oh, uh, wait. Wait for me!

367
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:52,109
A stowaway, my lady,
who claims to be Dr....

368
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:53,844
Dr. Dolittle's apprentice.

369
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:55,214
It's quite all right, Gareth.

370
00:22:57,883 --> 00:22:59,183
Well, if he was my apprentice,

371
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:02,753
he should fetch my bags
and keep his gob shut.

372
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:08,959
- A bird.
- A duck.

373
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:11,094
Animals in the queen's chamber?

374
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,164
I demand their
immediate remov...

375
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,898
Ah, Lady Rose.

376
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,800
My apologies.
Please forgive me.

377
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:18,902
I didn't realize
that you were part of...

378
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,238
John Dolittle?

379
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,873
- Is that Blaine?
- Blair.

380
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,142
Poopfling?

381
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,109
- No.
- It was Mudflap?

382
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,946
- No, it's Müdfly.
- It was... Müdfly.

383
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,780
- With an umlaut.
- Yes.

384
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:30,982
- From the German.
- Of course.

385
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:32,850
- From the Germans.
- Why is he here?

386
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:35,222
Her Majesty has personally
requested Dr. Dolittle.

387
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,133
Well, then, let's get to work.

388
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:51,905
All right, Jip,
give her a good sniff.

389
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,945
- That dog is licking the queen.
- Don't worry, my love.

390
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:02,147
This is outrageous.

391
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,290
Oh, bark.

392
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,159
- You all right, fellow?
- Something smelled wrong.

393
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,829
And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts.

394
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,030
Oh, you do love butt.

395
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,932
I detected a whiff
of something else.

396
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,233
Floral, with earthy...

397
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:25,871
I'm perplexed, Doc.

398
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,840
I've never smelt anything
like it before.

399
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,844
Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I
are out of our depths.

400
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,846
- May we consult?
- Well, of course.

401
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,283
I'd be more than happy
to help illuminate...

402
00:24:56,937 --> 00:25:00,974
John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago.

403
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:04,880
Some thought he had
a gift for observation.

404
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:13,286
One minute.

405
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:21,129
Oh, sorry about that, Mini.

406
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,066
Stay here.

407
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,001
Dab-Dab, clear out the humans.

408
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:30,504
Boyo, fetch the "Botanical
Index" and the tea tin.

409
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:31,605
Everyone out.

410
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:34,140
Do you understand the words
coming out of my bill?

411
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,979
What do you smell, Jip?

412
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,315
Elderberries?

413
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:43,451
Hemlock?

414
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:46,954
Negative.

415
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:48,257
Negative.

416
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:52,360
Aye, aye.

417
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:02,336
What have you found, Dolittle?

418
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,338
Well, quite possibly,
the answer to everything.

419
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,006
Exposure to toxic...

420
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,408
God, he was like this
at school.

421
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,009
"Lean in, lean in.

422
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,978
I'm saying something
interesting."

423
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,447
I am interested.

424
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,716
The queen's symptoms
are due to the effect

425
00:26:14,718 --> 00:26:16,551
of a rare Sumatran plant

426
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:19,354
known as the nightshade flower.

427
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:24,024
A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month.

428
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,428
If she has not received
the antidote by then,

429
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,165
she will perish.

430
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:31,299
Is that a Turner?

431
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,535
Must be.
What a fine painting.

432
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,438
I say, Dolittle,
what is your plan?

433
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,039
The plan?

434
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,742
Uh, I suppose we do need one.

435
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:42,244
Well, the queen's only hope

436
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:44,045
is a cure that's
never been tested,

437
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,748
from a tree
that's never been seen,

438
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,049
on an island
that's never been found.

439
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,518
Sounds ridiculous
saying it out loud.

440
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,088
But regardless of that...

441
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:54,423
...we have no choice
but to embark

442
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:56,258
on this perilous journey

443
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,094
to obtain the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

444
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:00,530
What?

445
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,499
Eden Tree. Oh, my. Fantastic.

446
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:07,403
The Dolittles with
their Eden Tree Island.

447
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:10,038
- Isn't it enough that your wife...
- Shut up, Blair!

448
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,340
Sorry, I-I meant to say:

449
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:14,042
"Lovely to see you
again, Blair."

450
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,579
We're off now. Ta-ra.

451
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:19,782
Oh, its fruit is said to cure
every malady known to man,

452
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,350
grant eternal life,

453
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:23,319
even restore
the hair on your head.

454
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:25,421
You must let nothing
pass her lips

455
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:27,790
that hasn't been made
and served by you.

456
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,125
Clear?

457
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:31,260
Yes, I'll see to it.

458
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,796
That's us to the carriage.

459
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,198
Jip, you need to stay behind
and guard the queen.

460
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,633
- Very important.
- Right, guard dog mode.

461
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,505
Stand back, everyone,
while I secure the perimeter.

462
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,510
Excuse me.

463
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:51,415
I do so admire
how you don't give up.

464
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,550
The queen is counting
on both of you.

465
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:55,354
Good luck.

466
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,056
Right. Chop-chop.

467
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:02,058
We got a long voyage
in front of us,

468
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,394
and the boat isn't
gonna sail itself.

469
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,597
Deep breath, Yoshi.

470
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,600
We haven't got all day.

471
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,301
Seems like she's full up.

472
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:13,570
Maybe we could
squeeze in one more.

473
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,272
Plenty of room.

474
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:17,541
- Oh, no.
- Uh, Plimpton.

475
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:20,177
I mean, one more stop,
good fellow.

476
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:22,579
I can't hear you,
because I am not here.

477
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,549
Well, I believe it's time
to go our separate ways.

478
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,384
Uh, I'm going with you.

479
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,686
Certainly not.

480
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:30,153
It's far too treacherous.

481
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,288
I'm your apprentice.

482
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,489
You? No, no, no.

483
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,124
Oh, you have an apprentice?

484
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,560
You don't need an apprentice
and an ostrich.

485
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:37,094
I'll go home.

486
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,262
I didn't want
to be embarrassed,

487
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:39,464
so I pretended you belonged.

488
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:41,432
I was helpful in there,
wasn't I?

489
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,434
- Hmm...
- The animals like me.

490
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:46,103
I don't take up much space.

491
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:48,439
I think I belong here.

492
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:51,175
Don't make me go home.

493
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:52,646
Please.

494
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,723
What is that around your neck?

495
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,258
Come on.

496
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,160
<i>I'm worried about the boy,
Bethan.</i>

497
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:11,129
Give him time. Time is all.

498
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,597
We're hunters, Bethan.

499
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,500
Hunters.
It has a certain...

500
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:17,201
We hunt things.

501
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:18,469
He frees things.

502
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,204
Like rabbits and mice.

503
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:22,340
He carries spiders outside.

504
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:24,679
Nobody likes spiders...
not even spiders.

505
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,614
I don't know how your sister
put up with him.

506
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:53,172
Ugh. Ugh.

507
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,375
Poly?
What are you doing here?

508
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,611
Making sure
you don't miss the boat.

509
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:03,282
A-Am I talking to an animal,
just like Dolittle?

510
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:05,517
Oh, no.
I'm speaking human.

511
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,453
Better than any parrot
ever has, actually.

512
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,390
Now, let's pack some clothes.
Come on.

513
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,264
But Dolittle said
I belong here.

514
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,601
Little help, Tutu?

515
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,537
Well, I never heard him say
anything of the sort.

516
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,408
There's something special
about you, Stubbins.

517
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,278
Something I've only seen
in two other humans.

518
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,681
You belong with us, kid.

519
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:37,717
And you let me worry
about Dolittle. That's my job.

520
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:42,424
So, are you ready for
the adventure of a lifetime?

521
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:48,561
I'm in.

522
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,330
Of course you are.

523
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:51,431
Poly, let's move.

524
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,601
We got a boat to catch,
and we're burning daylight.

525
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,301
Fret not, <i>ma chérie.</i>

526
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:57,303
We have the perfect plan.

527
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,572
New plan!

528
00:30:58,574 --> 00:30:59,840
New plan!

529
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:02,443
Come on!
Don't let them get away!

530
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,379
Why are they chasing us?

531
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,681
We're not criminals.

532
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:08,315
Speak for yourself.

533
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:09,850
We're wanted in three forests.

534
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:12,853
And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased.

535
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:15,489
Whoa!

536
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,391
That tickles!

537
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:18,626
Which way, Tutu?

538
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,295
- Down!
- Whoa!

539
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,264
Clear the way!

540
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:24,598
Hey! This way!

541
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,535
Get off the road, <i>ma chérie.</i>

542
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:30,337
See you later, suckers.

543
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:38,279
Whew. We've done it.

544
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:39,781
We've done it. We...

545
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:41,717
Missed it.

546
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,285
Okay, boss,
what's our next move?

547
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,488
We cut our losses,
change our identities,

548
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,789
ditch the kid in the river.

549
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

550
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,627
Wh-Wh-What about that bridge?

551
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:52,794
Yes, the bridge.

552
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,696
Uh, that was
my next suggestion.

553
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:55,766
Let's go!

554
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:58,900
Come on, Doc.

555
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,602
At least get out
of the hammock.

556
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:03,338
Your seasickness will wear off.

557
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,373
Try some of this ginger root.

558
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,375
You'll get your sea legs back.
You look terrible.

559
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:08,677
Ah, button it.

560
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,645
Who put me in this hammock?

561
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:13,782
I am the captain
of this ship, right?

562
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:16,384
Raise the blasted sails, will you?

563
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:19,554
Uh, that's a big bite.

564
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:22,792
Everyone, look.

565
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:24,526
Is that the boy?

566
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,095
He's coming to finish the job!

567
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:27,764
He won't rest till I'm dead!

568
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,397
He's obsessed!

569
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,801
- John, slow the boat down.
- No.

570
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:34,504
- I want to go faster. I want...
- Sorry, kid. Doc says no.

571
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,938
We're going to miss
all the good current!

572
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,808
- I hope you make it.
- Me, too, Dabs.

573
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
- All right, Bets, moment of truth.
- Okay.

574
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:47,817
Oh, big hole, 12 o'clock!

575
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,452
Maybe this is a bad idea.

576
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,123
- Let's go, Stubbins, let's go!
- Come on, kid.

577
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,390
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!

578
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,826
I've run out of track!

579
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,594
But not courage!

580
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,830
- Fly and be free!
- Whoa!

581
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:09,474
<i>Vive la résistance!</i>

582
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,412
- Whoa!
- Is that thing up to code?

583
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,648
Whoa. Whoa.

584
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:27,858
No!

585
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,959
No.

586
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:32,796
Jump, murderer.
You got this.

587
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,538
Oh, I can't look.

588
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:47,744
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

589
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,851
Do it again! Do it again!

590
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:55,552
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Yes!

591
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:57,454
- Crushed it, kid.
- Do it again! Do it again!

592
00:33:57,456 --> 00:33:58,689
You made it.

593
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:01,759
Why y'all cheering
for the kid who shot me?

594
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,828
Ah, he's all right.

595
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,495
Darling.

596
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:07,497
- Can I have a word, please? Huh.
- Glad you came around

597
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,734
and saw things my...

598
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:12,036
What was she thinking?

599
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:14,439
The boy nearly killed himself.

600
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:16,641
Oi! This is my ship, right?

601
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:18,509
And I'm its sovereign.

602
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:19,711
And there are consequences...

603
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:20,745
To ignoring me.

604
00:34:20,747 --> 00:34:22,513
- Is that what you were going to say?
- No, no.

605
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:23,915
Don't mince my words.

606
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,917
And stop messing
with my routine.

607
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,519
But look at the state of you.
You're sick as a dog.

608
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:30,521
Uh, but actually,
I have my medicine.

609
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:33,524
See? This licorice root
is working a treat.

610
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:35,860
Sit down, John.

611
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:39,865
Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew.

612
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:42,500
I'm sparing you embarrassment.

613
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:43,769
You need a trim.

614
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,603
All right, all right, be quick.

615
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,940
It's important to maintain
my status, yeah?

616
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:50,809
This ship is dangerous...
no place for a... Ow.

617
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:51,810
- Ow!
- What? - Huh?

618
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:52,845
Hurts, man!

619
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:54,546
Private conversation.

620
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:55,814
- Oh, okay. - Okay.
- Sorry.

621
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,886
I know this particular voyage
is hard for you, John.

622
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,821
It is for me, too.

623
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:05,557
I brought you Lily
just when you needed her,

624
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,261
and now you need
one of your own kind again.

625
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:12,265
Someone without feathers
or fur.

626
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,700
Fine, the boy can stay,
but it'll be on my terms.

627
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,102
And I'll keep him quite busy.

628
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:18,572
You'll do it
with a smile on your face.

629
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:20,973
Crew!

630
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:23,979
Seems you got a new shipmate.

631
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:29,983
As I just told Poly,

632
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,551
we are a bit shorthanded
after all, so...

633
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:33,787
You won't regret it.

634
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:34,955
Welcome aboard.

635
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,823
I hear you could be
a big help...

636
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,590
...by cleaning this up.

637
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,026
That, too,
if you wouldn't mind.

638
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:41,661
Oops. Those as well.

639
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:43,663
And that.

640
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:44,998
I got these.

641
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,469
Careful with that
medical equipment.

642
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:53,008
Because a parrot's in charge
of my ship! Brilliant!

643
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:57,612
He's absolutely thrilled
to have you.

644
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:13,060
Hmm.

645
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:14,962
Hello there, little squid.

646
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,564
You don't understand me,
do you?

647
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,033
That would be preposterous.

648
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:22,036
- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!

649
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:25,973
I'm dispatching a frigate,
the <i>Britannia,</i>

650
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,676
to follow Dolittle.

651
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:32,582
But you must not support him
in his foolishness, my lord.

652
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,120
England has enemies everywhere

653
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:43,057
waiting for the slightest
sign of weakness.

654
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:46,594
Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?

655
00:36:46,596 --> 00:36:48,596
That is lunacy.

656
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:49,964
So, while I remain here

657
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:52,933
ensuring no one prevents me
from taking the throne,

658
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:55,870
you will be on the <i>Britannia</i>

659
00:36:55,872 --> 00:37:00,077
making certain
Dolittle never returns.

660
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,090
Great. Round two, yeah?

661
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:17,225
You got me on the ropes,
you have, Cheech.

662
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:19,027
Come on. One, two.

663
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,695
Jab, jab, cross.

664
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:22,831
The best form of defense
is attack.

665
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,751
I really don't want
to fight you.

666
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:44,253
We're not fighting, are we?

667
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:45,789
It's a therapeutic session.

668
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,034
I-I think I'm getting this.

669
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,838
I'm actually starting
to understand.

670
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>Stop worrying, John.</i>

671
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:39,042
<i>Every step is planned out
in my journal.</i>

672
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:42,747
<i>I'll be back
before you even miss me.</i>

673
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:54,160
Are you all right?

674
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:59,497
I think I'm beginning
to understand

675
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:01,965
a little bit of what
the animals are saying.

676
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,736
Seems you are, boyo.

677
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,878
What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?

678
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,813
Well, what kind of bird...

679
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,782
Wait, are you even a bird?

680
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,351
- Of course I am.
- Well, can you fly?

681
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:21,818
- No.
- Can you swim?

682
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,819
No.

683
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:23,955
Well, what can you do?

684
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:25,523
- I can run.
- I can run.

685
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,225
What bird stuff can you do?

686
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:29,294
Well, what bear stuff
can you do?

687
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:33,200
You win this round.

688
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:46,945
Ro...

689
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:49,280
Pickles?

690
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:53,117
Oh, you were saying "warship."

691
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,221
Weird time to be asking
for pickles.

692
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:58,122
I mean, who could eat
when we're under attack?

693
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:00,858
Enemy, starboard aft.

694
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,861
Elliott, you and Elsie
ready the machine.

695
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:07,066
We're gonna need speed.
Send out the call.

696
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:14,139
Which way are the lifeboats?

697
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:15,274
This whole thing is
a death boat.

698
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:16,875
Mini, mind the lookout.

699
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:19,878
Stubbins, boy, I need you
now more than ever...

700
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,981
- to stand still.
- I surrender!

701
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,349
We surrender!

702
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,217
Oh...

703
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,820
hello, Blair,
you chinless wonder.

704
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:32,291
He said something
about my chin, didn't he?

705
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,293
It's a magnificent chin, sir.

706
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:35,894
We're in their sights.

707
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:37,430
Cannons are taking aim.

708
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:40,165
Let's turn this ship!

709
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:44,169
I'm on my way.

710
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:48,009
It is time for me to slip into
something less comfortable.

711
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:58,084
Hello...!

712
00:40:58,086 --> 00:41:00,188
I bought a front-row seat
to crazy town.

713
00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:04,958
Once Humphrey's been secured,

714
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,926
you pull me out
on Yoshi's signal.

715
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:09,296
Me? No, I-I can't handle
that type of pressure, Doc.

716
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:12,132
I'm a "cheer quietly from
the sidelines" kind of gorilla.

717
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,900
Don't worry, Cheech.

718
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,269
You'll rise
to the occasion, huh?

719
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:19,139
You're stronger than you know.

720
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:22,942
Now, remember, courage
is not the absence of fear.

721
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,413
Wait. You got cut off.

722
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:27,113
I-I can't hear you.

723
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,882
I need the second part!

724
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:31,053
No time, Cheech. Let's go.

725
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:43,664
Oh, look, look.

726
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,466
They're already
abandoning ship.

727
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,370
Boom!

728
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,475
Oh, this is gonna be cold.

729
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,412
But I'm coming in hot!

730
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,052
Humphrey here.

731
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:07,056
Let's hook it up.

732
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:16,698
Where we headed?

733
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,032
South.

734
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,941
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.

735
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:30,712
Full steam ahead!

736
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,383
Go, Humphrey, go!

737
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,384
Are they pulling away?

738
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Do it, whale, do it!

739
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,389
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's working!

740
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,090
- How is this possible?
- Well, sir, it appears

741
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,259
Dolittle and a polar bear
have harnessed a whale...

742
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,528
It was a rhetorical question.

743
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,464
Just fire!

744
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,337
I dropped the rope!

745
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,116
I failed.
I knew I couldn't do it.

746
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,995
- Yoshi!
- Hang on.

747
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,499
I'm coming, kid!

748
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,334
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- You're doing great.

749
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,136
Oh, this is gonna
murder my back.

750
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,241
Quit complaining,
you oversized flamingo.

751
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,316
Oh, no, no, no.

752
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,519
Oh, no.

753
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,223
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

754
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:04,109
- Oh!
- Yes!

755
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:13,217
I let you down, Doc.

756
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,118
Look at me.

757
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,087
I'm fine. We're all fine.

758
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,323
- I froze.
- No, no, no, Cheech.

759
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,291
It's okay to be scared.

760
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:23,095
Mm-mm.

761
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,531
You saved me, did you?

762
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:28,833
Fair play.

763
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,369
Thanks very much.

764
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:33,403
Well done, everybody.

765
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:37,140
Feel like you belong now, kid?

766
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,076
I guess I do.

767
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:40,545
- We lost 'em.
- I guess I do.

768
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,279
Great work, gang.

769
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,516
Eat our dust, Mudfly.

770
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,293
- They've gotten away, sir.
- Oh, really?

771
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:57,161
I thought they disappeared
into thin air.

772
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:59,097
I'm afraid not, sir.
They've escaped.

773
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,298
Read the room, Lieutenant!

774
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,168
I can see they've escaped.

775
00:45:03,236 --> 00:45:05,639
But not for long.

776
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:08,540
It's a miracle.

777
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,175
That must mean
I am the chosen one.

778
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:12,577
I'm gonna change the wor...

779
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,480
Whale power.

780
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:17,683
Dolittle had to write
a paper about it,

781
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,385
which, of course,
nobody took seriously.

782
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,421
This one even theorizes
the existence of dragons.

783
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:26,257
Just preposterous.

784
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:28,727
Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle is...

785
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,596
What obsession?
I'm not obsessed with Dolittle.

786
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:32,364
You're obsessed with Dolittle.

787
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,669
You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol...

788
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,737
I'm loath to admit it,

789
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,474
but he's more valuable alive
for now.

790
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,510
But luckily,

791
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,214
I think I know
where he's going.

792
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:52,418
Kevin's log, day seven.

793
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,719
I'm now totally isolated.

794
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:55,521
The enemy has
ingratiated himself

795
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:57,523
with the captain and crew.

796
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,726
No sign of promised
tropical island

797
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:01,695
or the magic fruit.

798
00:46:01,697 --> 00:46:03,632
But I will endure.

799
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:20,480
Take the wheel, Stubbins.

800
00:46:20,482 --> 00:46:21,781
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

801
00:46:21,783 --> 00:46:23,650
I have to calculate
our route coordinates.

802
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:25,518
The bees are buzzing about you.

803
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,953
Seems you are getting

804
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:29,956
a rudimentary grasp
of their language.

805
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:33,593
35 degrees portside.

806
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:37,731
Well, I-I have noticed when
they fly in a zigzag pattern,

807
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,299
they sort of go...

808
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,304
Which means: "Back off, kid."

809
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:46,741
But when Dab-Dab goes, uh...

810
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:51,712
That means: "Look at this."

811
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:53,614
Mm. "Look at me."

812
00:46:53,616 --> 00:46:55,382
- Oh, close.
- Not bad, though.

813
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:57,654
Oh, uh...
No, when Chee-Chee says...

814
00:46:58,721 --> 00:47:00,755
When Chee-Chee says...

815
00:47:03,693 --> 00:47:08,228
That means:
"Where's my... blanket?"

816
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,499
Very good.

817
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,003
Is that the map
of Eden Tree Island?

818
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:19,540
The Eden Tree cannot
be found on any map.

819
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:21,542
And to call it an island
is to suggest

820
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:25,513
that it is of our world,
and it is anything but.

821
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:28,349
That is why we must first go
to Monteverde,

822
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:29,617
birthplace of the only person

823
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:31,585
to ever chart a course
to the tree.

824
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:32,821
Her name was Lily.

825
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:35,489
She wrote the route
in a journal,

826
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:37,726
but on her voyage,
she was shipwrecked.

827
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:41,732
The world lost the greatest
explorer I've ever known.

828
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,734
The journal
from that expedition

829
00:47:45,736 --> 00:47:47,671
was all that survived.

830
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:53,842
Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?

831
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:58,647
So, anyway,
you get the picture.

832
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:00,615
To have any chance
of finding the tree,

833
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,552
we have to go to Monteverde and
steal that flippin' journal.

834
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:05,454
Steal the journal?

835
00:48:05,456 --> 00:48:06,621
Did I say that?

836
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:08,490
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

837
00:48:12,763 --> 00:48:15,363
Don't worry.
I know an omen when I see one,

838
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,666
and that was not an omen.

839
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:21,871
Stealing the journal
is not a big deal.

840
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,908
In fact,

841
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,411
Monteverde itself
is not a big deal.

842
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:35,084
<i>The stop at Monteverde
was a very big deal.</i>

843
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:38,421
<i>After all, this island
of bandits and thieves</i>

844
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:41,557
<i>was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home.</i>

845
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,826
<i>Until the doctor</i>

846
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:48,831
<i>made an enemy of the island's
notorious ruler, King Rassouli.</i>

847
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,801
<i>And just our luck...
his most prized possession</i>

848
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,604
<i>was the very journal
we needed to steal.</i>

849
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:58,908
<i>So Dolittle needed a disguise.</i>

850
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:07,818
<i>While I was left watching
over the rest of the crew,</i>

851
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,556
<i>Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace.</i>

852
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,694
I'm about to die!

853
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,666
<i>Once inside, their path ended</i>

854
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,402
<i>at a heavily bolted door,
naturally.</i>

855
00:49:25,404 --> 00:49:27,471
<i>But Dolittle still had</i>

856
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:30,507
<i>questionable contacts
on the island.</i>

857
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,575
Hut, hut, hut,

858
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,644
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

859
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:35,612
The opening bid will suffice.

860
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:37,447
You have my attention.

861
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:38,749
Don Carpenterino,

862
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:40,918
I'm here on behalf
of these humans.

863
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,719
They will pay you handsomely

864
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:44,989
for your family's
lock-picking skills.

865
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:46,857
You come to me for this,

866
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,426
on the day of
my daughter's wedding?

867
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,428
Wait a minute.
Which daughter?

868
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,430
It's not... Sh-Sheila?

869
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:56,533
My Sheila?
She's getting married?

870
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,469
- To a scorpion named Dylan.
- Sorry, Boy Scout.

871
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,505
I guess Sheila's
into bad boys now.

872
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,777
We were gonna spend the rest
of our life spans together.

873
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:07,444
Move on, James.

874
00:50:07,446 --> 00:50:09,747
What's your human's best offer?

875
00:50:09,749 --> 00:50:11,482
Two more now...

876
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:13,418
and two later. Huh?

877
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,653
Okay.
You have yourself a deal.

878
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,889
See you around, Boy Scout.

879
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,791
Guys, I'm no Boy Scout.

880
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:23,561
Also, what's a scorpion got
that I don't got?

881
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:25,864
- Besides a massive stinger.
- Get over her, James.

882
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:27,732
You dated for two weeks.

883
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,843
These bars are new.

884
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:39,544
Totally messing up my plan.

885
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:40,812
I can fit through them.

886
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:42,647
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous, man.

887
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:45,650
Can't go in there on your own.

888
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:47,686
Let me take him in, Doc.

889
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:49,989
I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal.

890
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,725
Are you sure your head's
in the right place, James?

891
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:54,593
Oh, yeah.
I'll get the kid in

892
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:56,228
and then fly headfirst
into a brick.

893
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,497
Just kidding. I'm fine.

894
00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:00,532
Aye. All right.

895
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:01,901
James will look after you.
It's fine.

896
00:51:01,903 --> 00:51:03,702
Listen closely.

897
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:05,604
Get the journal
and get out of there.

898
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:06,872
<i>Go through the room quietly.</i>

899
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:08,507
<i>Look for the tiger's eye.</i>

900
00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:09,808
<i>Go down the hidden staircase.</i>

901
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,978
<i>And most importantly,
keep your disguise on.</i>

902
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,748
There's just one
little thing you should know.

903
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,983
Rassouli loves his cats.

904
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:23,957
But that's no problem for us,

905
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:26,792
'cause we can just fly
right over... Wait.

906
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:28,761
Uh, I see the mistake
I made here.

907
00:51:28,763 --> 00:51:30,562
You can't fly.

908
00:51:38,073 --> 00:51:40,073
Hey. Oh. Watch out.
Kitty cat on your six.

909
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:42,909
Oh, God.

910
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:44,010
Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!

911
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:45,712
Hey!

912
00:51:45,714 --> 00:51:47,547
Slick move, kid.

913
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,284
We make a pretty good team.

914
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:53,987
A real couple of bad boys.

915
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,524
Okay, partner,
you know where to go.

916
00:52:19,148 --> 00:52:21,082
I'll keep watch on these lions.

917
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:23,317
That's what a bad boy
dragonfly does.

918
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:26,687
Would Dylan get
this close to a lion?

919
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:28,756
Would he get this close?

920
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,324
How about this close?

921
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:32,893
Oh, sh...

922
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,699
This is bad.
This is... very bad.

923
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,637
"Lily...

924
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:44,107
Dolittle."

925
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:53,814
We got the journal! Open up!

926
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:54,982
Just kidding. He blew it.

927
00:52:54,984 --> 00:52:56,018
- Bye!
- Oh, dear.

928
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,785
Stubbins.

929
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:03,091
Former resident here.

930
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:04,926
- Don't move.
- Huh?

931
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,194
Don't touch.

932
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:14,803
All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,

933
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:18,740
and instead, I got
the ringleader of a circus.

934
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:22,044
I never understood
what Lily saw in you.

935
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:24,813
A common complaint
the world over

936
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,082
for fathers
of beloved daughters,

937
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:30,819
but in this instance,
I think we can all agree

938
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:34,056
it is particularly accurate.

939
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:39,628
Come here.

940
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,099
Come here. Come here.

941
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:45,234
Um, so,
you didn't mean any of that.

942
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:48,171
It was her journal.

943
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:52,208
The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage.

944
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,646
It belongs here.

945
00:53:57,782 --> 00:54:02,218
All you had to do was
never show your face again

946
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,120
and even at that...

947
00:54:04,122 --> 00:54:06,222
you failed.

948
00:54:06,224 --> 00:54:10,728
Now you'll pay
for taking Lily away from me.

949
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:16,732
You knew what would happen
if you returned.

950
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,435
Yes.

951
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:23,739
Barry! Barry!

952
00:54:23,741 --> 00:54:27,177
Barry! Barry! Barry!

953
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:31,215
Barry! Barry!
Barry! Barry!

954
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:32,982
You should go.

955
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:35,252
Come on, Barry!

956
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:37,955
It's my past that's caught up
with me, not yours.

957
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:40,057
- Yeah?
- But you're my friend.

958
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:41,961
Go. Don't look back.

959
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:52,769
You're better off
without him, kid.

960
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:55,906
Um... I'm in compliance.

961
00:54:55,908 --> 00:54:57,908
Yes!

962
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,309
Finally, some action down here.

963
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:02,045
Boy, was it getting boring.
You know, Doc,

964
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:04,848
I hate to tell you, but you're
going down, my friend.

965
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,817
You'd do well to keep
your buckteeth together.

966
00:55:06,819 --> 00:55:07,985
What is that smell?

967
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:10,255
Hey, fellas,
I think Dr. Dolittle

968
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:12,789
did a little doo-doo.

969
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,758
Did Dr. Dolittle do
a little doo-doo?

970
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,495
Perhaps when I'm out of here,
I'll teach you some manners

971
00:55:17,497 --> 00:55:20,064
and accept your lucky foot
as payment.

972
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,865
Oh, this lucky foot?

973
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:24,169
Don't worry about it, Doc,
'cause both of my lucky feet

974
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:26,070
are gonna be tap-dancing
on your grave

975
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,804
when my guy's done with you.

976
00:55:27,806 --> 00:55:30,308
Taking bets over here.

977
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,044
In the right corner,
wearing golden stripes,

978
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:36,814
with a sparkling record
of 872 kills,

979
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:41,753
Barry "The Butcher" Bernstein!

980
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,128
Dr. Dolittle, remember me,

981
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,130
your old patient?

982
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:54,333
It's Barry.

983
00:55:54,335 --> 00:55:55,967
Barry.

984
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,536
How could I forget you?

985
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:00,004
Oh, but you did, Doc.

986
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:02,807
We were just starting
to make progress,

987
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:06,111
and then you run off
with Rassouli's daughter

988
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,845
and abandon me.

989
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:10,049
Well, uh, I'm back now.

990
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,251
Uh, perhaps we should just
pick up where we left off...

991
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,055
Enjoy the feast.

992
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:22,127
What will happen to Dolittle?

993
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,863
Oh. Well, he's a dead man.

994
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:26,565
Yeah.

995
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,902
He'll think he can talk
his way out of it, but, uh,

996
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:33,205
Barry has gone completely nuts.

997
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:37,943
But you...
you are one of us now.

998
00:56:37,945 --> 00:56:40,848
To Dolittle's death!

999
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:47,989
- Psst.
- Hey, it's you.

1000
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:50,290
You made it.

1001
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,957
I need you to get a message

1002
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:53,126
to my friends on our boat.

1003
00:56:53,128 --> 00:56:54,927
A message? Sure.

1004
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:57,297
When have I ever let you down?

1005
00:56:57,299 --> 00:56:59,933
All I hear day after day is:

1006
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:03,303
"Oh, Barry,
you're such a disappointment.

1007
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:05,238
"Why can't you be
more like your brother?

1008
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,907
He eats poachers
for a living, you know."

1009
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:11,111
"Yes, Mother, I know!

1010
00:57:11,113 --> 00:57:13,782
The whole jungle knows."

1011
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:15,949
Oh, my head.

1012
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:17,984
Your migraines are brought on

1013
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,986
by severe maternal issues

1014
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:21,388
and compounded
by sibling rivalry.

1015
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,924
Please make it stop.

1016
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:25,992
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:28,028
- Lie down.
- Oh, my head.

1018
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,998
We could resume your treatment.

1019
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,134
Oh, the stress is unbearable.

1020
00:57:34,136 --> 00:57:37,204
I... I just want
to be a good boy.

1021
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,073
I just want
to make Mummy proud.

1022
00:57:40,075 --> 00:57:41,342
There we are.

1023
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:45,012
No one I eat
will ever be good enough.

1024
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:47,914
There's the release.
Release it.

1025
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:51,052
I will never be good enough.

1026
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,954
Unless I eat you.

1027
00:57:56,926 --> 00:57:58,092
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1028
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:01,095
Because every mother
wants their son

1029
00:58:01,097 --> 00:58:03,665
to grow up and eat a doctor.

1030
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,232
You're a sick kitty.

1031
00:58:10,173 --> 00:58:12,106
Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick.

1032
00:58:12,108 --> 00:58:15,111
I've got another
one of these in an hour.

1033
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,245
Give up, Dolittle.

1034
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:19,514
You can't outsmart...

1035
00:58:19,516 --> 00:58:21,015
Oh, what was that?

1036
00:58:21,017 --> 00:58:22,183
Oh, wait.

1037
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:23,385
Now it's over there, huh?

1038
00:58:23,387 --> 00:58:25,119
And now it's over here.

1039
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:27,054
Now it's back over there.
Got it.

1040
00:58:27,056 --> 00:58:28,490
And now it's over here.

1041
00:58:28,492 --> 00:58:30,392
Oh, I lost it.
I've got to get it.

1042
00:58:30,394 --> 00:58:32,127
A cat is still a cat.

1043
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:34,131
- I got it.
- Easily distracted.

1044
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,065
New game, Doc.

1045
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:39,368
Get back down here.

1046
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,169
Come on down, Doc.

1047
00:58:42,506 --> 00:58:45,006
Okay, James,
you can't let this kid down.

1048
00:58:45,008 --> 00:58:46,441
You got to deliver
this message.

1049
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,711
Oh, no. It's James.

1050
00:58:48,713 --> 00:58:53,115
From now on, no more focusing
on relationships and...

1051
00:58:53,117 --> 00:58:55,083
Whoa. Poly?

1052
00:58:55,085 --> 00:58:56,552
- Is that you?
- James?

1053
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:59,555
- Ooh, your feathers really filled out nice.
- James, James!

1054
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:02,057
- What happened, James?
- Oh, right. Message.

1055
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:03,325
My bad.

1056
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:05,060
The kid's been captured
by Rassouli,

1057
00:59:05,062 --> 00:59:07,195
and Barry's about to have
Dolittle for lunch.

1058
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:09,197
Looks like we're going ashore
after all.

1059
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,501
Be a darling and grab
my dynamite, will you?

1060
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:17,540
We need to split up if
we're going to pull this off.

1061
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,409
Chee-Chee,
you're coming with me.

1062
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:21,411
Where are we going?
No, no, no, don't tell me.

1063
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:23,112
Just tell me when we get there.

1064
00:59:23,114 --> 00:59:26,115
<i>Yoshi, create a distraction.</i>

1065
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:27,952
Hope this is enough.

1066
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,026
We are being attacked!

1067
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:43,166
Come on down, Doc.

1068
00:59:43,168 --> 00:59:44,434
Therapy's the answer.

1069
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:46,770
Oh, no.
Worse than I expected.

1070
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:54,143
- I got you, Doc.
- Back off, Barry!

1071
00:59:54,145 --> 00:59:56,346
Poly, don't!

1072
00:59:56,348 --> 00:59:58,181
An appetizer.

1073
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:01,785
I got you, Poly.

1074
01:00:05,191 --> 01:00:07,157
Any final diagnosis, Doc?

1075
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:09,193
Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?

1076
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:12,095
Oh, I'm about to.

1077
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:14,467
I am not a prisoner of fear!

1078
01:00:18,237 --> 01:00:20,204
I'm not a prisoner of fear?

1079
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:21,505
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1080
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:23,340
It's okay to be scared.

1081
01:00:23,342 --> 01:00:25,142
- Ow, ow.
- Oh, oh!

1082
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:30,247
It's okay to be scared.

1083
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:32,182
- You should be scared.
- It's okay to be scared!

1084
01:00:34,186 --> 01:00:36,488
- Give him a good hiding.
- Okay, we're doing this.

1085
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,322
We are doing this.

1086
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:40,257
We're not doing this.

1087
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:46,397
Hit him in the low area.

1088
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:49,099
Down there.

1089
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,170
Ah.

1090
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,540
Ooh, that's got to hurt.

1091
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,141
Ow! My Barry berries.

1092
01:00:57,143 --> 01:00:58,142
That will work.

1093
01:01:00,113 --> 01:01:01,346
Cheap shot, ape.

1094
01:01:04,284 --> 01:01:06,351
Wait. I...

1095
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:10,121
I haven't finished
my treatment.

1096
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:14,359
♪ Go to sleep, baby tiger ♪

1097
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:17,328
♪ Time to put
those claws away. ♪

1098
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,166
Anyway...

1099
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:23,636
You need this more than I do.

1100
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,672
Tell me I'm enough, Mummy.

1101
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:29,475
I had 50 grand riding on that.

1102
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,143
Well, I won't pay that.

1103
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:35,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

1104
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,120
Thanks for sticking
with me, Doc.

1105
01:02:02,209 --> 01:02:03,275
I have it.

1106
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:05,681
- I have the j...
- Stop! - Halt!

1107
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,118
And now I'll have it.

1108
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:14,588
Hmm.

1109
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:20,225
She had such a sure hand.

1110
01:02:20,227 --> 01:02:23,463
Exactly what
the doctor ordered.

1111
01:02:27,636 --> 01:02:29,502
What did they offer you,
Mudfly,

1112
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,239
to murder the queen of England?

1113
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:34,441
Quite a few things, actually.

1114
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:35,709
Knighthood.

1115
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:37,444
Windward House.

1116
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:39,212
Chair of the Royal College.

1117
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,514
In no particular order.

1118
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:44,551
Oh, and the icing
on the madeleine

1119
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:47,520
will be the scientific
accolades that accrue

1120
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:50,691
from the proper study
of the Eden Tree.

1121
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,460
All thanks to Lily Dolittle.

1122
01:02:53,462 --> 01:02:56,262
Actually, no,
that's still madeleine.

1123
01:02:56,264 --> 01:03:01,303
The icing is knowing
that you know I won.

1124
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:08,976
Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat.

1125
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:10,279
What hole?

1126
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:21,691
Abandon ship!
Everyone, overboard!

1127
01:03:26,295 --> 01:03:28,462
Oh, not good.

1128
01:03:33,569 --> 01:03:35,236
Don't look back.

1129
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:38,572
Help!

1130
01:03:38,574 --> 01:03:40,443
I'm on it, Doc.

1131
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,812
I can't fly.

1132
01:03:43,814 --> 01:03:46,215
And I can't swim.

1133
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,319
Got you, buddy.

1134
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:53,789
Plimpton,
I'm not losing you, bro.

1135
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,590
Step away from the light.

1136
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:56,825
There is no light.

1137
01:03:56,827 --> 01:03:58,026
I'm alive.

1138
01:03:58,028 --> 01:03:59,594
I'm alive.

1139
01:03:59,596 --> 01:04:03,665
I'm alive,
thanks to you, Yoshi.

1140
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:29,359
You've always been so kind.

1141
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:35,430
It's difficult to say goodbye.

1142
01:04:35,432 --> 01:04:38,468
Please don't say that.

1143
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,572
It's all right.

1144
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:46,342
You've done your best.

1145
01:04:46,344 --> 01:04:48,513
Your queen is proud.

1146
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:55,520
Where are you, Dolittle?

1147
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,822
Hey, big bird, you doing okay?

1148
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:01,557
No.

1149
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,626
Nothing about me is okay.

1150
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:05,829
My father was right about me.

1151
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:07,931
I should have been an omelet.

1152
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:10,100
I know how you feel.

1153
01:05:10,102 --> 01:05:13,603
My dad said he was going out
for a pack of seals one night

1154
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:16,106
and never came back.

1155
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:19,475
I guess we got something
in common after all, Plimpton.

1156
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:21,645
What is this feeling?

1157
01:05:21,647 --> 01:05:25,582
I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.

1158
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:27,818
That's friendship, bro.

1159
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,353
Huh.

1160
01:05:29,355 --> 01:05:31,855
Not bad... bro.

1161
01:05:35,528 --> 01:05:37,828
I'm not crying. You're crying.

1162
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:53,777
Right.
Gather round, shall we?

1163
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:56,446
Huh? Let's have a look
where we are now.

1164
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:58,317
That's the spirit, John.

1165
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,758
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1166
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,727
I'm already getting duck bumps.

1167
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:13,498
- We are finished.
- What?

1168
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,599
Is this a pep talk?

1169
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:15,867
'Cause it's a weird one.

1170
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:19,470
I can sniff defeat
like a truffle pig.

1171
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:21,472
This can't be the end.

1172
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:22,941
- Yeah.
- We...

1173
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:24,943
- I smell it.
- We can still save the queen.

1174
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:26,778
- Nope.
- We can still save your house.

1175
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,482
I believe in you.

1176
01:06:31,484 --> 01:06:32,750
We can keep going.

1177
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:34,485
Oh, you got a point there.

1178
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:35,720
Except the journal's gone,

1179
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:37,789
we have no way to find
the Eden Tree,

1180
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:39,024
and our boat is sunk.

1181
01:06:39,026 --> 01:06:40,895
He makes a strong argument.

1182
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:45,663
On the plus side,
you are all cured.

1183
01:06:45,665 --> 01:06:47,565
Chee-Chee, you are brave now.

1184
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:49,869
Plimpton and Yoshi
are getting along.

1185
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:51,770
Ow! Remember, back! Back!

1186
01:06:51,772 --> 01:06:52,972
Sort of.

1187
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:54,773
And, Stubbins,
you've made friends,

1188
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:56,642
and you can even talk to 'em.

1189
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:58,443
You don't need me.

1190
01:06:58,445 --> 01:07:00,813
I'll stay here
and offer medical services

1191
01:07:00,815 --> 01:07:03,649
to this island
of random bandits and outlaws.

1192
01:07:03,651 --> 01:07:04,917
The doctor's here!

1193
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:06,619
Seeking new patients.

1194
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:08,520
- Cash only.
- Ladies, gentlemen,

1195
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:10,223
who'd like to dance?

1196
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:12,691
I got a bad case
of dancing fever.

1197
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:14,793
So, watch out, it's infectious.

1198
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:16,462
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!

1199
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:17,963
- Come on, Doc.
- Can't help him.

1200
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:19,932
That explorer
you told me about...

1201
01:07:19,934 --> 01:07:21,800
she would have never given up.

1202
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,769
She was your wife, wasn't she?

1203
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:25,571
You want to know
the ironic bit?

1204
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:29,475
I don't know
what "ironic" means.

1205
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:32,779
Irony is when you find a woman

1206
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:34,080
and she makes your life
more wonderful

1207
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:35,882
than it had any right to be,

1208
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:39,518
and then, poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault.

1209
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,558
This journey was my chance
to finish what she started.

1210
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:48,962
Lily insisted I care
for the animals at home,

1211
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,498
so I stayed behind.

1212
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,066
Rassouli's right.

1213
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:54,801
I should have been with her.

1214
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:57,704
Now all I have left of her
is the ghost I see

1215
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,572
when I hold our rings.

1216
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:01,743
So, you see her, too?

1217
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:08,982
Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal...

1218
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,853
...but your polar bear
blew up my village.

1219
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:14,956
No.

1220
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:16,991
We don't know that.

1221
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:21,561
And your gorilla
beat up my tiger.

1222
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,066
No good.

1223
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,570
- Let's go.
- No, no. Stay.

1224
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:30,773
No, no, no, no, no.

1225
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,777
Mm. Yeah.

1226
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:42,616
Irony...

1227
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,053
is me wanting to kill you

1228
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,092
with every fiber of my being...

1229
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:56,666
...but loving my daughter more.

1230
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,845
I miss her, too.

1231
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:13,782
She would have wanted you to...

1232
01:09:13,784 --> 01:09:15,619
to keep going.

1233
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,796
So!

1234
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:30,366
Get going...

1235
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:32,734
before I stop feeling
sentimental.

1236
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:38,809
She's saying
we don't have a ship.

1237
01:09:40,044 --> 01:09:42,111
Well, uh...

1238
01:09:42,113 --> 01:09:44,882
I have the perfect vessel
for you.

1239
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,152
Bit of a fixer-upper.

1240
01:09:49,154 --> 01:09:51,220
It's got good bones.

1241
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:52,288
At least it floats.

1242
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:55,958
We'll just have to make
the best of it, won't we?

1243
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,027
Ooh! Company.

1244
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:00,029
Uh, who's that?

1245
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:01,397
Hi.

1246
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:02,732
I'm Jeff.

1247
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:04,903
Crikey.

1248
01:10:07,038 --> 01:10:09,839
<i>If Lily's research was correct,</i>

1249
01:10:09,841 --> 01:10:13,943
<i>then Mudfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree Island.</i>

1250
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:16,979
<i>All we needed to do
was track Mudfly.</i>

1251
01:10:16,981 --> 01:10:18,815
But how do we do that?

1252
01:10:18,817 --> 01:10:21,017
Whales, boyo.

1253
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:22,987
Whales.

1254
01:10:39,138 --> 01:10:41,171
I can't believe
you're flipping him off.

1255
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:43,741
I know.
That man has no chin.

1256
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:54,753
Ah.

1257
01:11:12,004 --> 01:11:14,874
We found him. Follow us.

1258
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,253
Eden Tree Island.

1259
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:45,303
- Yeah!
- Oh, wow.

1260
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:49,007
- Wow.
- Extraordinary.

1261
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:04,956
This must be it.

1262
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:10,262
The map points us directly into
the center of this mountain.

1263
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:12,131
Don't look down.

1264
01:12:12,133 --> 01:12:14,200
Let's keep our beaks up,
shall we?

1265
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:15,767
Trying to stay positive.

1266
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:17,203
What the heck
are we doing up here?

1267
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:20,072
Going in the back way,
my feathered buddy.

1268
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:21,840
What are you complaining about?

1269
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,976
This is the widest branch
I've ever scurried on.

1270
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:25,277
Don't look down.

1271
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:27,079
Look at me.

1272
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:29,081
Whoa.

1273
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,719
A big cave.

1274
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:38,023
Stay close. Keep quiet.

1275
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,825
Kevin's log, day 12.

1276
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:41,260
Some force
beyond my comprehension

1277
01:12:41,262 --> 01:12:44,129
still compels me to follow
this crew of lunatics,

1278
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,865
the squirrel killer
and their deranged leader.

1279
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,369
Perhaps it's the magic tree
that draws me.

1280
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,271
- Rifle troop! Fall in!
- Hide. They're close.

1281
01:12:51,273 --> 01:12:54,041
Turn it down now. Stay down.

1282
01:13:04,386 --> 01:13:06,855
Fox fire fungus.

1283
01:13:07,923 --> 01:13:09,825
We must be near it now.

1284
01:13:12,294 --> 01:13:14,294
Look, Doc.

1285
01:13:14,296 --> 01:13:16,363
It's lighting a path
all the way...

1286
01:13:16,365 --> 01:13:18,898
to the man who wants us dead.

1287
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,900
Stay right there.

1288
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,836
Oh.

1289
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:25,071
Go on, then, soldier boy.
Spoil yourself.

1290
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:32,178
Hello, Blair.

1291
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:35,249
Get over there!

1292
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,152
Looking for a tree, is it?

1293
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:41,188
Trees don't often grow
in caves.

1294
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,956
Didn't you pay attention
in botany class?

1295
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:46,062
No, but pay attention
to this, Dolittle.

1296
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,930
I beat you.

1297
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:53,067
You filthy animal...

1298
01:13:53,069 --> 01:13:54,468
Move it. Come on, beasts.

1299
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,973
...hoarder!

1300
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,175
So...

1301
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:02,910
where is it?

1302
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:04,245
Where's what?

1303
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:07,081
The Eden Tree.

1304
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,351
Truth is, I haven't got a clue.

1305
01:14:10,353 --> 01:14:11,886
Don't be ridiculous.

1306
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:13,287
You're John Dolittle.

1307
01:14:13,289 --> 01:14:15,890
You get everything you want.

1308
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:17,361
Not today, I don't.

1309
01:14:19,062 --> 01:14:22,196
You really don't have
any idea, do you?

1310
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:25,367
How does ignorance feel?

1311
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:27,369
Oh.

1312
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:29,970
Well, very freeing, actually.

1313
01:14:29,972 --> 01:14:33,108
One must hug uncertainty,
don't you think?

1314
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,377
That's how Lily lived her life.

1315
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,214
Embrace the unknown, and...

1316
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:42,117
the answers will be revealed.

1317
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,221
You sad, misguided nut,
Dolittle.

1318
01:14:46,223 --> 01:14:47,858
Give that to me.
Give me that.

1319
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:54,096
I will find this damn tree
on my own,

1320
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:58,133
and by God,
history will remember me.

1321
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:12,281
Yeah. Something interesting
going on now.

1322
01:15:17,522 --> 01:15:21,023
My God, that feels
a lot larger than all of us.

1323
01:15:23,194 --> 01:15:25,161
Let's go!

1324
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:27,296
- What is that?
- Something's moving!

1325
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:29,968
Look out!

1326
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:37,173
Retreat!

1327
01:15:37,175 --> 01:15:38,742
Down over here!

1328
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:41,177
The lot of you! Come on!

1329
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:43,281
Yoshi, stay down.

1330
01:15:44,382 --> 01:15:45,982
He saved me.

1331
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:48,050
I have a second chance

1332
01:15:48,052 --> 01:15:52,356
to live a life of-of kindness
and-and-and generosity and...

1333
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:59,095
Take him, not me!

1334
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:01,231
I'm a good person now.

1335
01:16:25,324 --> 01:16:27,324
Tell you what we're gonna do...
we're gonna make a run

1336
01:16:27,326 --> 01:16:28,392
for that ditch
while she's distracted...

1337
01:16:30,362 --> 01:16:32,062
- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me!

1338
01:16:32,064 --> 01:16:33,096
Cheech.

1339
01:16:33,098 --> 01:16:34,599
Help me! Plimpton!

1340
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:36,300
I'll save you, bro.

1341
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:38,168
Right. Think fast. Uh...

1342
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:41,106
Get this off of me!

1343
01:16:42,642 --> 01:16:44,411
This will likely
upset her a bit.

1344
01:16:46,379 --> 01:16:48,045
No! Doc!

1345
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:49,581
- No! - No!
- John!

1346
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,219
Dolittle!

1347
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:06,397
Dolittle!

1348
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:07,665
Help!

1349
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:21,379
Is he speaking dragon?

1350
01:17:23,383 --> 01:17:28,387
You may be able
to speak my language,

1351
01:17:28,389 --> 01:17:32,691
but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit.

1352
01:17:32,693 --> 01:17:35,361
I know protecting the tree's
your duty,

1353
01:17:35,363 --> 01:17:38,264
but you won't be able
to continue much longer...

1354
01:17:38,266 --> 01:17:39,698
considering
the damage you've taken

1355
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,400
and the pain you're in.

1356
01:17:41,402 --> 01:17:46,539
Oh, you know
nothing of my pain.

1357
01:17:51,245 --> 01:17:53,345
But I do.

1358
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:55,481
I've felt it as well.

1359
01:17:55,483 --> 01:17:58,384
The kind that doesn't come
from a bullet or a blade,

1360
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,121
but cuts much deeper.

1361
01:18:01,455 --> 01:18:04,323
And now in every moment
and every movement,

1362
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:06,325
you feel that pain again.

1363
01:18:06,327 --> 01:18:08,394
Yeah?

1364
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:14,133
It's hard to carry on...

1365
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,208
...when you've lost
the one you love.

1366
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:38,360
Just leave!

1367
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:47,233
Uh, what just happened?

1368
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:48,703
Oh, broken hearts.

1369
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:50,370
What the heck
are you doing here?

1370
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:51,571
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

1371
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:53,306
We're both dragons.

1372
01:18:53,308 --> 01:18:56,544
Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon,

1373
01:18:56,546 --> 01:18:58,244
if you wouldn't mind
telling me where...

1374
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:00,481
Ow, ow, ow!
She's really mad.

1375
01:19:00,483 --> 01:19:02,783
I'll wait for
whoever survives outside.

1376
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:05,786
John, let's just get
out of here while we still can.

1377
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:07,488
No.

1378
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,323
I think we're here to help her.

1379
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,461
Yeah.

1380
01:19:13,463 --> 01:19:15,630
- We haven't got much time.
- Hmm?

1381
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:18,766
I-I imagine
it's a bit tender here.

1382
01:19:20,637 --> 01:19:22,269
Oh...

1383
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:24,672
I'm unarmed.

1384
01:19:24,674 --> 01:19:27,274
I pose no threat to you.

1385
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,276
The emotional stress
over the years

1386
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:30,544
has done damage
to your stomach.

1387
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:32,546
Get away from me.

1388
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:35,383
You have a severe
impaction of the colon,

1389
01:19:35,385 --> 01:19:38,319
and if I don't manually
fragment it, it'll go septic.

1390
01:19:38,321 --> 01:19:41,322
You won't be able to protect
anything anymore.

1391
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:44,693
Ooh, that sounds like
some tummy ache.

1392
01:19:44,695 --> 01:19:46,528
Tell you what,
give us five minutes.

1393
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,797
If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all.

1394
01:19:48,799 --> 01:19:50,732
Stop talking.

1395
01:19:50,734 --> 01:19:53,669
Just get on with it.

1396
01:19:53,671 --> 01:19:56,471
We have to get you
on your side.

1397
01:19:56,473 --> 01:19:58,707
We need to perform
an emergency extraction.

1398
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:00,742
Extraction?
Uh, what are we pulling out?

1399
01:20:00,744 --> 01:20:03,445
- Go get 'em, gang.
- Got your back, Doc.

1400
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:05,580
It's showtime.

1401
01:20:05,582 --> 01:20:07,649
Three, two, one.

1402
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:09,551
Turn.

1403
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:12,854
Chee-Chee,
chuck me the forceps.

1404
01:20:12,856 --> 01:20:15,557
Knew it would come in handy.
Told you!

1405
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:16,859
Everybody knows what to do.

1406
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:18,660
Just breathe. Works for me.

1407
01:20:18,662 --> 01:20:21,296
It's okay. Just hold on
to my wing, sweetie.

1408
01:20:21,298 --> 01:20:22,464
Dab-Dab's here.

1409
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:23,498
Oi.

1410
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,566
You are my apprentice.

1411
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:26,303
You keep her calm.

1412
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:31,541
Did you know the leek is
the national emblem of Wales?

1413
01:20:31,543 --> 01:20:33,341
And very useful it is, too.

1414
01:20:33,343 --> 01:20:35,343
You might feel
a bit of pressure.

1415
01:20:35,345 --> 01:20:37,347
I got her.

1416
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:40,450
Oh, good heavens!

1417
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:41,617
Oh, no, you didn't.

1418
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,486
Oh, my gosh!

1419
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:45,388
Just clearing the way.

1420
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:47,557
Is that armor?

1421
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:50,228
You got the whole
Spanish army in here.

1422
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:52,895
Give us a deep breath.

1423
01:20:52,897 --> 01:20:54,430
Hold it.

1424
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,498
Word of warning.

1425
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,599
What's up, Doc?

1426
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,367
When removing the blockage...

1427
01:20:58,369 --> 01:20:59,736
Yoshi, now.

1428
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:02,805
...there may be an initial
release of wind.

1429
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:11,915
Ach-ah-vee!

1430
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:13,483
Respect.

1431
01:21:13,485 --> 01:21:15,418
It's all right.
Nobody heard that.

1432
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,588
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1433
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:18,922
We all do it.

1434
01:21:18,924 --> 01:21:21,091
We're all animals.

1435
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:23,093
I can taste it!

1436
01:21:23,095 --> 01:21:24,695
- Okay, I'm back.
- Right.

1437
01:21:24,697 --> 01:21:26,897
What did I miss? Oh, my gosh!

1438
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,699
This is the big one.

1439
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:30,400
We're in the homestretch now.

1440
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:31,535
Cheech, get behind me.

1441
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:32,870
I'm with you, Doc.
On your call.

1442
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:34,605
Heave!

1443
01:21:36,776 --> 01:21:38,675
Oh, it's breaching.

1444
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:41,411
Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red.

1445
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:43,814
One last push, madam,
if you please.

1446
01:21:56,595 --> 01:21:58,129
Thank you.

1447
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,765
We did it.

1448
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:02,432
Teamwork makes the dream work.

1449
01:22:03,804 --> 01:22:06,671
That was a lot,
but we did good.

1450
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:11,943
To put it simply,

1451
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:15,547
more leafy greens
and less armor in your diet.

1452
01:22:16,983 --> 01:22:21,920
I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you.

1453
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:26,591
What unites
such a group of creatures?

1454
01:22:26,593 --> 01:22:30,728
Well, we may not look it,
right, but somehow...

1455
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:33,598
- Who's a good boy? Good boy.
- ...we just belong together.

1456
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,903
Now let me help you.

1457
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:56,454
Lily would have loved it, John.

1458
01:22:56,456 --> 01:22:58,724
We would never have found it
without her.

1459
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:03,364
Wow. I just got the chills,
and I'm not even cold.

1460
01:23:27,655 --> 01:23:30,591
Thank you for showing me
the way, my love.

1461
01:23:36,965 --> 01:23:38,765
We know, O Lord, that there is

1462
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:41,533
no word impossible to thee;

1463
01:23:41,535 --> 01:23:45,705
and that, if thou wilst,
thou canst yet raise her up

1464
01:23:45,707 --> 01:23:48,942
and restore her to a longer
continuance amongst us.

1465
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:51,778
O Father of mercies
and Lord of all comfort...

1466
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:54,681
I'm sorry we couldn't save you,
Your Majesty.

1467
01:23:54,683 --> 01:23:57,019
...her disillusion
draweth near.

1468
01:23:59,054 --> 01:24:01,621
It is with great sadness...

1469
01:24:01,623 --> 01:24:02,989
Wait a minute.
I smell something.

1470
01:24:02,991 --> 01:24:04,624
It smells like...

1471
01:24:07,796 --> 01:24:08,662
Hope.

1472
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:10,597
...that I have to announce...

1473
01:24:12,035 --> 01:24:13,867
...that the queen is no more.

1474
01:24:13,869 --> 01:24:15,970
Somebody call a doctor?

1475
01:24:15,972 --> 01:24:17,972
My mates!
A very dramatic entrance, boys.

1476
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:19,706
Well played.

1477
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,742
- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!

1478
01:24:21,744 --> 01:24:23,711
Clear a path.
There isn't a moment to waste.

1479
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:30,818
I have procured that which
is said to not exist.

1480
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,690
Behold, the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

1481
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:38,025
I said clear a path.

1482
01:24:38,027 --> 01:24:39,627
Seize them!

1483
01:24:40,897 --> 01:24:42,964
Sorry but... sorry.

1484
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,871
I got him!

1485
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,740
- Go.
- Seize them!

1486
01:24:53,977 --> 01:24:55,712
You were born for this moment.

1487
01:24:56,746 --> 01:24:57,812
I born.

1488
01:24:59,649 --> 01:25:01,116
Mini, take flight.

1489
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:02,918
Get him!

1490
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:03,952
Freeze!

1491
01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:06,021
Go, go, go!

1492
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,659
No.

1493
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:12,796
No, no, no, no!

1494
01:25:55,006 --> 01:25:57,639
Kevin's log, day unknown.

1495
01:25:57,641 --> 01:25:59,108
The killing has ended.

1496
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,943
Let there be life.

1497
01:26:00,945 --> 01:26:02,814
Lady Rose.

1498
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:08,951
Is there a giraffe
in my bedchamber?

1499
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:10,686
Yes. Oh, yes.

1500
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,689
And a polar bear
and a gorilla and a parrot

1501
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:15,625
and a duck, an ostrich.

1502
01:26:18,196 --> 01:26:22,698
Our humble thanks be to God.

1503
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,768
And well done, Dr. Dolittle.

1504
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,704
Not quite done, are we?

1505
01:26:28,706 --> 01:26:31,208
Interesting.
Carry on, Styx. I'm all ears.

1506
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:33,177
What's that?

1507
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:35,678
Uh, Styx here agreed
to stay behind,

1508
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,147
keep his 12 eyes on things.

1509
01:26:37,149 --> 01:26:39,149
He's just catching me up.

1510
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:40,783
Like all leaf insects,

1511
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:42,986
he speaks in
eight-syllable phrases,

1512
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:45,655
and he states...

1513
01:26:45,657 --> 01:26:48,125
"Lord Badgley
did poison the queen."

1514
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:49,960
What? He did?

1515
01:26:49,962 --> 01:26:53,063
Really,
Dolittle, this is too much.

1516
01:26:53,065 --> 01:26:54,098
You're certain?

1517
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,266
Well, this would be the time.

1518
01:26:56,268 --> 01:27:00,170
No. I'm sorry.
Styx is quite adamant.

1519
01:27:00,172 --> 01:27:04,241
"In his right pocket,
the vial."

1520
01:27:04,243 --> 01:27:05,943
Ugh, that's only seven.

1521
01:27:05,945 --> 01:27:07,911
Oh, "in his right pocket,

1522
01:27:07,913 --> 01:27:09,880
the vial of
deathly nightshade."

1523
01:27:09,882 --> 01:27:12,015
Let's have a look, shall we?

1524
01:27:12,017 --> 01:27:13,750
You can't possibly believe

1525
01:27:13,752 --> 01:27:16,987
that he's talking to an insect.

1526
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:18,755
Well, I've...

1527
01:27:18,757 --> 01:27:21,159
I've spoken to ladybugs.

1528
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:23,962
Making a wish
before they fly away.

1529
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:25,762
Let's have a look.

1530
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:30,767
Ooh.

1531
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:36,908
No one messes with my family.

1532
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,277
Take one more step, and I'll
rip you a brand-new a...

1533
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:41,047
Come on.

1534
01:27:42,315 --> 01:27:43,948
Get...

1535
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,218
Hah.

1536
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,786
To the Tower with him.

1537
01:27:48,788 --> 01:27:51,990
Oh, someone's been a bad boy.

1538
01:27:51,992 --> 01:27:53,791
Come on.

1539
01:27:53,793 --> 01:27:56,027
And I don't know why
you're all standing there.

1540
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:58,163
Nobody's died.
Leave me in peace.

1541
01:27:58,165 --> 01:27:59,964
You, too.

1542
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:01,233
Your Majesty.

1543
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:04,738
Not you, Dr. Dolittle.

1544
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:07,807
A moment, if you would, please.

1545
01:28:10,044 --> 01:28:12,978
Lady Rose, who is this person,
and why is he staring at me?

1546
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,714
He's Stubbins.

1547
01:28:15,983 --> 01:28:18,783
I-I want to be
an animal doctor.

1548
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:20,753
He saved your life.

1549
01:28:32,233 --> 01:28:33,933
Thank you.

1550
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:35,803
It's good to have you back,
Doctor.

1551
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:41,474
Poly.

1552
01:28:41,476 --> 01:28:44,043
Anything
you'd like to say to me?

1553
01:28:44,045 --> 01:28:45,345
Aye, you were right.

1554
01:28:45,347 --> 01:28:47,880
I suppose it is nice
to get out of the house

1555
01:28:47,882 --> 01:28:49,148
every once in a while.

1556
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,783
Stubbins, Mini.

1557
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:53,852
Enough. We have far less
important places to be.

1558
01:29:02,863 --> 01:29:05,999
<i>Our story ends
the way it began.</i>

1559
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:08,868
I have a letter
for Dr. Dolittle!

1560
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:10,036
Somebody get me down!

1561
01:29:10,038 --> 01:29:11,304
<i>Mostly.</i>

1562
01:29:11,306 --> 01:29:14,274
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor...</i>

1563
01:29:17,012 --> 01:29:20,280
<i>...who found he was
at his best when sharing</i>

1564
01:29:20,282 --> 01:29:22,849
<i>his extraordinary ability...</i>

1565
01:29:22,851 --> 01:29:25,185
- <i>...with others.</i>
- Excellent.

1566
01:29:25,187 --> 01:29:28,356
<i>Soon, Dr. Dolittle
reopened his gates,</i>

1567
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:31,359
<i>as Lily would have wanted.</i>

1568
01:29:31,361 --> 01:29:33,994
Three more in the queue, gang.

1569
01:29:33,996 --> 01:29:36,162
Copy that.

1570
01:29:36,164 --> 01:29:39,400
<i>Dolittle discovered his
place in the world once again.</i>

1571
01:29:46,908 --> 01:29:50,177
<i>After all,
it's only by helping others</i>

1572
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:53,249
<i>that we can truly
help ourselves.</i>
