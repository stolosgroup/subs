2
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,667
- So, Philippe?
- Yeah, the mechanics did a great job.

3
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,042
- It's a real beauty.
- She's a what?

4
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:32,876
A real beauty!

5
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,959
Well, your beauty
still smells of car grease.

6
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,876
That's part of her charm, man.

7
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:56,709
I don't want to spoil the party, but…

8
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:58,376
What?

9
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,292
How far do you think
this seaplane can glide?

10
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:03,417
There's only one way to know, right?

11
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,751
Just kidding, relax.

12
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,501
We're going home.

13
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,001
OK. Ready to land.

14
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,792
Shit! Holy shit!

15
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:44,751
Holy shit!

16
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:34,292
"Don't Knock It"
by The Delta Rhythm Boys

17
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,084
We're late.

18
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,001
Julie! We're late.

19
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:08,792
Not only do we have the bathyscaphe

20
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,584
but we will also have
two midget submarines on board

21
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:15,792
to reach depths never,
never seen by man yet.

22
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:20,209
Now, our divers will be equipped
with streamlined scubas,

23
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:23,834
fitted out with
an integrated lighting system

24
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,917
and a marine telephony system

25
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,376
to communicate underwater.

26
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:30,126
- Please have a look.
- James Bond style.

27
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:33,292
We already broadcast
dozens of animal documentaries…

28
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,251
No, no, no. You did not understand.

29
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:38,709
We must not have explained it properly.

30
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,709
I am not making animal documentaries.

31
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:46,417
I am going to tell the story of men
who are going to explore a new world.

32
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,376
Captain Cousteau in the lead

33
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:51,334
and around him,
a gallery of other personalities.

34
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:53,834
His loyal right-hand man, Bébert,

35
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:58,209
and discreet wife, Simone,
who the entire crew adores.

36
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:02,209
And the son, with the movie star looks,
Philippe.

37
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,459
The spectators will travel with us

38
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,334
to all the oceans
on the face of the earth.

39
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,417
They will discover,
they will explore.

40
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:12,167
They will share our emotions.

41
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,584
They will be afraid when we take risks.

42
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,292
They will tremble,
they will laugh, they will cry.

43
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,292
It is not stories about fish
that interest people,

44
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:24,542
it is stories about people and that
is what I intend to show your viewers.

45
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:27,334
And how many films
will this contract cover?

46
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,667
- Twelve.
- Six!

47
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:31,292
Twelve.

48
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,001
Thank you.

49
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:27,667
- To Calypso.
- Calypso!

50
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:35,417
Stay here.

51
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,042
Come with me.

52
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:22,959
Doctor Clark.

53
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:26,417
The Head of the Zoology Department
of the University of Maryland.

54
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,542
- My son Philippe.
- Hi.

55
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:29,459
Nice to meet you. This way please.

56
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:33,834
She's the world's most renowned
shark specialist in the world.

57
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,876
Impressive.
You don't have any luggage?

58
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:39,917
- I was told to travel light.
- OK, great. It's a quick 1-hour flight.

59
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:15,001
If I had negotiated even 0.1% of all
the oil wells I discovered with him…

60
00:55:16,084 --> 00:55:18,417
You wouldn't have to make TV films.

61
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:54,667
You stay at the controls.
It's an order. All right?

62
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:11,751
Yes?

63
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:02,334
Loubi…

64
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:38,626
- Welcome. Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

65
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,709
Captain Cousteau.

66
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,959
Do you really believe
that man will colonise the seas?

67
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:47,084
Oh, absolutely.
I believe that in the near future…

68
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:51,251
a homo-aquaticus capable
of living underwater will exist.

69
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:54,792
A shunt connected
to a chemical cartridge

70
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:56,876
would ensure
the oxygenation of the blood

71
00:58:57,126 --> 00:58:58,834
and thanks to artificial gills,

72
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:01,751
man would be able to rediscover
its original world.

73
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,126
The aquatic world.

74
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:07,376
I believe that, with the help of science,
man knows no limits.

75
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:08,542
I believe so.

76
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:43,167
Philippe!

77
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:39,126
Nice.

78
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:43,001
Chin down a little bit.

79
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:44,834
That's nice.

80
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:50,334
Excuse me.

81
01:03:52,084 --> 01:03:54,584
Just check the cable there
on the floor.

82
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:55,959
How are you?

83
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:01,001
OK, 5 minutes to work.

84
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:17,042
I totally agree with you
but you'll have to talk to my colleague.

85
01:06:17,084 --> 01:06:19,542
I'm very pleased indeed.
Yes.

86
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,376
Hold on.

87
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:28,042
All right, talk to her. Talk to her.

88
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:32,917
Yes, I have no time now.
I'm sorry I have no time.

89
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:06,959
You know, this is exactly where
I went diving for the very first time.

90
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:08,751
I would have liked to have seen that.

91
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,292
Let me check.

92
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:14,126
Good. Ready?

93
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,459
I'm not sure this underwater grotto
is a good idea.

94
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,376
Can you please trust me?

95
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,667
This is gonna be unbelievable.
It's fantastic.

96
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:23,751
It's like swimming in an aquarium.

97
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:26,251
You'll love it.

98
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:28,751
Let's go.

99
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:43,959
Allô!

100
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:55,542
- Mr. Cousteau?
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

101
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:38,792
Mr. Cousteau?

102
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,001
I'm coming, I'm coming.

103
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:56,667
I hear Philippe
has formed his own crew.

104
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:01,042
Yes, I think he wants
to work on slightly different topics.

105
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,751
- Ecology.
- Yes.

106
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:04,209
…Captain Planet.

107
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:08,542
I ask you to give a warm welcome
to Mr. Jacques Cousteau.

108
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,834
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

109
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:42,667
Baby.

110
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:46,084
Look.

111
01:12:50,501 --> 01:12:51,751
This is home.

112
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,417
Some species of whales

113
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:38,209
have already completely disappeared
from the Atlantic

114
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:40,167
due to intensive hunting.

115
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,459
Here, the Great Whale
is affected by pollution.

116
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:46,751
- And are we talking about oil slicks?
- Oil slicks,

117
01:13:47,084 --> 01:13:50,542
heavy metals, garbage,
you name it, it's out there.

118
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:15,042
It's love.

119
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:48,751
Ah.

120
01:20:09,376 --> 01:20:10,417
Jacques?

121
01:22:54,376 --> 01:22:56,834
No, they never mentioned an advance.

122
01:22:57,834 --> 01:22:59,251
Let me refresh your memory.

123
01:22:59,334 --> 01:23:02,917
You still owe them two films,
which they've paid for in full.

124
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:05,917
You're not gonna squeeze
another dollar out of them, JYC.

125
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:10,542
<i>You'll feel sad to leave this entrancing,
magic place,</i>

126
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:14,167
<i>but the Calypso,
indifferent to our cause, nostalgia,</i>

127
01:23:14,251 --> 01:23:17,751
<i>is already setting her course
towards new adventures.</i>

128
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:22,459
- So, how did you like it?
- Very much.

129
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:25,417
Actually, so much
we'd like to see a little more.

130
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:28,667
JYC, we're worried about
the two remaining films

131
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:31,251
you're supposed to deliver
before the end of the year.

132
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:34,834
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to deliver four in one go.

133
01:23:34,959 --> 01:23:38,792
Let me explain to you.
This will be my greatest expedition yet.

134
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:44,417
I am going to explore the last
untouched open space in the world.

135
01:23:44,792 --> 01:23:46,167
Antarctica.

136
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:48,792
Frozen Spaces. The white continent.

137
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,751
Icebergs, whales, penguins…

138
01:23:52,084 --> 01:23:55,501
Places where man
has never dived before.

139
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:59,876
I already have the title.
'Voyage to the End of the World.'

140
01:24:00,126 --> 01:24:04,126
An expedition like this, we'd have to get
all-new diving equipment.

141
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,792
And above all,
a special boat, an icebreaker.

142
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:07,917
David…

143
01:24:08,584 --> 01:24:12,084
- Have you an idea of the costs?
- I want five million dollars.

144
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:14,292
Oh no. No way, no way.

145
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:16,376
- How much are you prepared to…
- JYC…

146
01:24:17,459 --> 01:24:19,126
- One million.
- Max.

147
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:23,001
It's a deal.

148
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,167
That's not even gonna rent you
an icebreaker.

149
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:27,917
An icebreaker?
Who needs an icebreaker?

150
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:29,834
I am taking Calypso.

151
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:32,667
- The Calypso? In the Antarctic Ocean?
- Absolutely.

152
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:37,001
- Fabulous! I love that idea.
- She's a very good boat. She'll make it.

153
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,084
I love that idea.

154
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,417
Oh, that's great.

155
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,167
So right over here…

156
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:37,042
Two coffees, please.

157
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,417
Excuse us for bothering you, Captain,

158
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:49,209
- but may I ask you for your autograph?
- Yes, of course.

159
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:52,751
- I admire you so much.
- I still remember those two sea-lions.

160
01:25:52,876 --> 01:25:55,334
- What were their names again?
- Pepito and Christobelle.

161
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:58,292
- Christobelle!
- That's right. They were so adorable.

162
01:25:58,376 --> 01:26:01,209
- We won't bother you any longer.
- And once again, bravo.

163
01:26:01,501 --> 01:26:04,334
Thank you very much.
Have a good day. Thank you.

164
01:29:23,209 --> 01:29:25,792
- OK. And this one?
- Yes, let me check.

165
01:29:26,626 --> 01:29:29,584
- And this one?
- OK, yeah. This one at the top.

166
01:31:23,126 --> 01:31:24,209
"My love,

167
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:26,667
I don't know
when you'll read this letter,

168
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:29,292
but after several days at sea

169
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:33,292
writing to you makes me feel
like you're not so far away.

170
01:31:33,667 --> 01:31:36,751
The ocean here seems more immense
than anywhere else.

171
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:40,292
Soon we'll be in sight
of the first islands.

172
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,459
I cannot wait to discover
this unknown world."

173
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:51,792
We're going to try to circle around
to the west. Over.

174
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:53,917
<i>The depression is growing too rapidly.</i>

175
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:56,834
<i>The only solution is to turn back
and head for shelter.</i>

176
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:59,167
<i>Otherwise, you'll encounter hell. Over.</i>

177
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:01,042
Roger that.

178
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:04,792
<i>It's time for you to turn back
and seek shelter. Over.</i>

179
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,542
I'll get back to you.
Over and out.

180
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:25,334
Merry Christmas to you, baby!

181
01:42:23,876 --> 01:42:24,917
Fools!

182
01:42:25,251 --> 01:42:26,876
No one is gonna buy documentaries

183
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:28,334
about ecology. No one.

184
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:31,834
Yes, because TV channels don't want
any trouble with industrialists.

185
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:33,917
- That's why.
- Where the hell is the car?

186
01:42:34,042 --> 01:42:35,376
They are the ones who pollute,

187
01:42:35,459 --> 01:42:37,417
but they buy advertising time
every year.

188
01:42:37,501 --> 01:42:41,501
- Cut out the left-wing diatribe for me.
- Hey, we don't need these guys.

189
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:47,584
The world's oceans are in danger.

190
01:42:48,042 --> 01:42:51,626
I am here today to announce
the creation of the Cousteau Society.

191
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:56,334
A non-lucrative organization
whose mission is to protect nature.

192
01:42:56,792 --> 01:43:00,709
If industrialists pollute,
it is not out of cynicism.

193
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:02,417
They do not want
to actively destroy the planet

194
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,334
and they will be willing to accept

195
01:43:04,417 --> 01:43:06,167
and follow the regulations
of the politicians,

196
01:43:06,251 --> 01:43:07,667
but the politicians don't do anything

197
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:09,417
because they are thinking
of their elections.

198
01:43:09,626 --> 01:43:12,959
And the funds collected by
the Cousteau Society will be used

199
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:15,834
to produce our future documentaries

200
01:43:16,084 --> 01:43:20,876
and to raise public awareness
for the need to save nature.

201
01:43:21,084 --> 01:43:24,167
I believe it will take a widespread
people's movement

202
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,417
to push the governments
to take the necessary measures

203
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:28,209
to protect the planet.

204
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:30,792
Now, my son Philippe…

205
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:33,042
and myself
will give conferences.

206
01:43:33,251 --> 01:43:35,667
We will go and meet the people.

207
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:39,417
And you believe that the people
will rise to the occasion?

208
01:43:39,626 --> 01:43:41,376
You see, people think the sea

209
01:43:41,459 --> 01:43:44,542
is so immense that man
will never be able to destroy it

210
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:46,667
and that is a fundamental error.

211
01:43:47,292 --> 01:43:50,709
One day, we will no longer
be able to swim in the sea.

212
01:43:50,834 --> 01:43:55,126
Because only the simplest forms of life,
such as bacteria and viruses

213
01:43:55,292 --> 01:43:57,417
will be able to survive the pollution.

214
01:43:57,959 --> 01:43:59,584
The longer we wait,

215
01:43:59,709 --> 01:44:02,876
the poorer the world we want to save
will be.

216
01:44:20,584 --> 01:44:21,626
Yeah.

217
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:24,626
We have the power to act

218
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:26,792
as citizens of this world,

219
01:44:27,209 --> 01:44:30,334
for the sake of our children
and our grandchildren.

220
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:32,376
We can change things.

221
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:42,501
This is our planet,
and it's the only one we have.

222
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:45,334
Man has probably done more damage
to planet Earth

223
01:44:45,459 --> 01:44:47,542
during the course of the 20th century

224
01:44:47,667 --> 01:44:50,167
than in all of human history before that.

225
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:26,751
We live in an interminable succession

226
01:45:26,834 --> 01:45:28,126
of absurdities

227
01:45:28,376 --> 01:45:32,209
imposed by the blind logic
of short-term thinking.

228
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:37,042
The demographic explosion.
The divorce of south and north.

229
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:40,209
The climatic changes of all sorts.

230
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:44,084
The elimination of thousands of species
all over the world.

231
01:45:44,376 --> 01:45:47,251
The dictatorship of materialism.

232
01:45:48,209 --> 01:45:52,084
The only cure is the recourse
to utopia!

233
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:09,209
Yes, of course I wanna talk to her.
Put her on the phone.

234
01:47:23,167 --> 01:47:24,209
Daddy?

235
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:33,042
Daddy?

236
01:47:43,251 --> 01:47:44,501
Hello, yes?

237
01:47:45,305 --> 01:48:45,715
