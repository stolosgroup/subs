What's it to be, Eddie?

- How are you?
- It's my lucky day today.

14
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,586
Shove over, then.

You won't believe this, Vi.

can't use the post

belts for so long now,

foot in the Avenue Montaigne,

00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,957
I won, Vi.

168
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,026
I've won.

169
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:11,145
You want to make nice to her.

170
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,147
She's only gone
and won the pools.

171
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,721
Ada, what you going to do?

172
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,089
I'm going to buy a dress.

173
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,359
Something pretty for
the Legion Dance.

174
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,694
Yeah.

175
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:30,532
A Christian Dior
dress from Paris.

176
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,601
500 quid.

177
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,340
How much you win?

178
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,685
Any more tickets, please?

179
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,486
Where to, ma'am?

180
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,990
Single, Miss Violet?

181
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,695
Mm-hmm. No cleaning up
after no man for me.

182
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,399
- Ah.
- Morning, Mr. Newcombe.

183
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,067
Mrs. Harris, I, uh...

184
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,136
I don't believe you've
met my niece, Samantha.

185
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,438
Oh, no, I haven't
had the pleasure.

186
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,474
Um, Mr. Newcombe.

187
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:16,778
If you know of anyone who
could use me services... um...

188
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:19,146
one of your nieces, perhaps?

189
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,684
Samantha, Mrs. H is
the soul of discretion.

190
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,787
One would never know she'd been
but for the polish on my knobs.

191
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,021
Oh, Giles.

192
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,410
Thank you.

193
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,075
Oh.

194
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,190
Sorry about the audition, love.

195
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,893
Oh, I don't know why I bother.

196
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,494
"Too young." "Too old."

197
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,831
"Too tall." "Too fat."

198
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,600
You're just right, ducks.

199
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,201
I'm twenty... three.

200
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,838
Couple more years, and
it's all over for me.

201
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,472
Oh, you've plenty of time.

202
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,475
You can't imagine what
it's like, Mrs. Harris,

203
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:31,512
always having to worry
about your looks.

204
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,519
Hey, Cinderella, why'd
you bring them rags?

205
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,154
I will go to the ball...

206
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,657
when I get me dress.

207
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,492
Oh, here comes trouble
with a capital "A."

208
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,493
Hello, Archie.

209
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,495
Ada, the very girl I was after.

210
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,440
- What can I do for you, ducks?
- Now, don't get me excited.

211
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,866
You know I've got
a dodgy ticker.

212
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,300
Oh, get away with you.

213
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,737
She got bigger plans than you.

214
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,170
I can see that.

215
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,239
So, would you mind
doing me a favor

216
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,551
and look after
Spring and Summer?

217
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,442
Because Cynthia there's

218
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,245
not exactly a dog's best friend.

219
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,449
Go on.

220
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,186
Thank you.

221
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,792
You are an absolute star.

222
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,560
And you're all right.

223
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:22,897
C? All right, here we go.

224
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,565
Shake that tail, baby.

225
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,702
That's what we are, Vi.

226
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:28,970
The invisible women.

227
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,538
Speak for yourself.

228
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,975
They see me coming. ♪ Mm! ♪

229
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,685
Oh!

230
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,787
Beg your pardon, milady.

231
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,527
Milady, um, my account.

232
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,829
I was wondering if
you might settle up.

233
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,898
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Harris.

234
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,866
I'm afraid I forgot
to pop to the bank.

235
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,367
This wedding is a nightmare.

236
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,770
Everybody has said yes.

237
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,639
Oh, um...

238
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:07,240
you wouldn't mind waiting
until next week, would you?

239
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,609
Well, uh, the thing is,

240
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,611
it's become a bit pressing
because I need to...

241
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:14,649
Oh, is that the time?

242
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,551
Actually, Mrs. Harris,

243
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,520
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to reduce your hours.

244
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:22,322
Reduce? N-No, please.
Milady, please...

245
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,692
Well, we all have to economize
these days, don't we?

246
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,827
Sorry.

247
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,645
I know you're there, woman,
in the dark and cold.

248
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,850
I'm all right, Vi.

249
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,588
Archie has got us
free into White City.

250
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,389
Oh, no, I've got
all this mending.

251
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,859
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
- N-No. No, no, Vi.

252
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,326
Vi... Oh.

253
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,062
Have us a bit of fun.

254
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,688
Oh, good Lord. Look.

255
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,056
It's a sign.

256
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,825
You got a good tip?

257
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,358
Yeah!

258
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,094
Yeah, I have!

259
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,097
- Um... excu... excuse...
- Hey.

260
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,834
- Excuse me.
- Ada, you fancy a flutter?

261
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,335
- Yeah.
- What'll it be?

262
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,874
100 quid on number six.

263
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,644
To win.

264
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,846
A ton?

265
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,114
For the love of Mike,
Ada, no, put it away.

266
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,550
No. Number six.

267
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,886
- Haute Couture, please.
- The dog's a bag of bones.

268
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,988
It couldn't win with
a rocket up its arse.

269
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,455
You tell her, Archie.

270
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,991
She's lost her marbles.

271
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,759
No, it's Haute Couture.

272
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,628
It's a sign. How could
it be anything else?

273
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,864
Ada, girl, I've been doing
this a long time, all right?

274
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:44,165
Signs don't win races.

275
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,868
Not till tonight, they didn't.

276
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,138
My money's good.

277
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,774
Count it, please.

278
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,679
Yeah.

279
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,022
Here.

280
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,423
Here we go. That's good.

281
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,793
Oh, we got a good spot. Right.

282
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,536
Oh. Wish me luck.

283
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,506
- Oh, Ada.
- Come on, Haute Couture.

284
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,185
Oh, look, she's in the lead!

285
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,654
Come on!

286
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,790
It's in front.

287
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,926
Come on!

288
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,716
It's Clever Count,

289
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,085
Blue Streak, and Stormy Bay.

290
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,955
And would you look at that...
Haute Couture has just

291
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,123
woken up and remembered
what she's here for.

292
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,073
Well...

293
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,108
Hats off to you, girl.

294
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,010
You went for it.

295
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,980
I'll go find a St
John's Ambulance.

296
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,915
They might have a tot of brandy.

297
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,584
For me.

298
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:46,454
You were right,
Vi... All that money.

299
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,824
My Eddie'd be ashamed of me.

300
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:53,027
I'll be right back, huh?

301
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:00,935
Nothing wrong with
dreaming, Ada, hmm?

302
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,803
When I came to London,

303
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:05,506
the streets were
paved with my dreams.

304
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:13,247
That's what you are.

305
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,583
You're a dreamer.

306
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,785
Plain as the nose on your face.

307
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:55,623
Give over, Vi. I'm all right.

308
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,258
Mrs. Harris?

309
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,360
Mrs. Edward Harris?

310
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,629
It's about your husband.

311
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,633
Sit down, please.

312
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,170
Sergeant Harris wasn't
declared missing in action

313
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,838
until April the 19th.

314
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,074
Uh, yeah, that's when
I got the telegram.

315
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,209
It's a day after his birthday.

316
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,344
Ah, yes.

317
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:20,681
Well, um, as we now know,

318
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:25,386
Flight Polo Lima 326 crashed
on March the 2nd, 1944,

319
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,788
meaning that Sergeant
Harris was paid

320
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:30,991
for almost seven
weeks after his death.

321
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,329
At, um, six shillings a day.

322
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,099
Is that what you
come to tell me?

323
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,601
After all this time.

324
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,937
That my Eddie owes you back pay?

325
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,972
When he never owed
a penny in his life.

326
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:47,408
When he give up his life
for king and country.

327
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,976
You got a nerve.

328
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,978
Coming into my home,
drinking my tea,

329
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,146
blackening his name.

330
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,381
- Um...
- How much do you want?

331
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,050
How much? And then
you can leave.

332
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,828
I-I think you've got the
wrong end of the stick.

333
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,120
Oh, have I? Well,
I'll tell you

334
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,921
where you can shove
your stick in a minute,

335
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,899
- if you don't watch out.
- Oh, golly, no. Um, I, uh...

336
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,692
I'm here to give you
money, Mrs. Harris,

337
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,194
- not-not to take it from you.
- I've had enough of...

338
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,929
What'd you say?

339
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:10,998
Y-Yes. Righto.

340
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,967
Uh, you should
have been receiving

341
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,237
a-a war widow's
pension since 1944.

342
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,107
It comes to quite a tidy sum,
uh, with that small deduction.

343
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,144
So long as you
haven't remarried.

344
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,879
Oh, give over.

345
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:26,747
He might have come
back any minute,

346
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,249
I'd have looked a right Charlie.

347
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:31,018
Uh...

348
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,686
well...

349
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,658
I suppose you'd better sit down.

350
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,261
Have that cup of tea after all.

351
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,296
Um, no milk.

352
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,432
She's never done a thing
wrong her whole life, sir.

353
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,801
She went a bit crazy on
account of some dress,

354
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,037
but she's fine now.

355
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,206
Nothing to worry about.

356
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,180
- Oh, hello.
- Mrs. Harris?

357
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,315
You come to tell me I
got the crown jewels?

358
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,850
She's still not
right in the head.

359
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,319
Almost. That diamond
clip you handed in...

360
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,354
The owner wants to
give you a reward

361
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,356
for being an honest citizen.

362
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,726
Oh! She is, sir,
honest to a fault.

363
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,328
Come in and have a cup of tea.

364
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,930
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

365
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,474
Oh, come on, Vi. We
can have a knees-up.

366
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,999
Oi, wait for me.

367
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,402
And, uh, you might want
to break out the bubbly.

368
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,103
You having another
lucky day, Archie?

369
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,239
As a matter of fact,
I am, and so are you.

370
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,974
News travels fast.

371
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,476
So, that bet you put on
that two-legged dog...

372
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,478
Oh, y-yeah, don't...
don't worry about that.

373
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,980
I've come to me senses.

374
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,782
No, the boss was there,

375
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:36,083
so I had to take the money,

376
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,018
but I managed to
hold back a tenner.

377
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,987
You shouldn't have
done that, Archie.

378
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,488
You could have got into trouble.

379
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,290
All tickety-boo, Mrs. Harris?

380
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,528
Oh, sorry, I didn't
realize you had company.

381
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:48,963
Hello. What's going on here?

382
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,364
- Oh.
- For the love of Mike.

383
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,933
- Uh, I'll see you later.
- Uh, no, Archie, Archie.

384
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,502
Uh, can you just
give me a moment?

385
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,370
It-it's personal.

386
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,739
- That the kettle calling?
- Ah, righto.

387
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,343
What's going on? Something up?

388
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,811
It's a long story.

389
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:04,912
What were you saying?

390
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,480
So, I took your money

391
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,983
and put it on a sure
thing in the last race.

392
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,151
And, um...

393
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,755
your stake back
and a wee bit more.

394
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,125
Oh, n-no, Archie, I couldn't.

395
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,928
- I...
- It's your money. Take it.

396
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,396
I can't keep it, woman.

397
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,032
PC Plod in there would
have my license. Come on.

398
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,038
Just promise me a
dance at the Legion.

399
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,410
Thanks, Archie.

400
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,145
Much obliged.

401
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,385
Blimey.

402
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,838
Are we flying?

403
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,341
We're terribly sorry,

404
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,576
ladies and gentlemen.

405
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,612
There seems to be a
fault with one engine.

406
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:12,112
There will be a slight delay

407
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:14,315
while we try and
fix the problem.

408
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,150
Delay?

409
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,018
How long?

410
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,822
I've got to be there
and back in a day.

411
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,371
Oh, God.

412
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,378
Paris.

413
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,406
Righto, Paris, here I come.

414
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:19,079
It's a fair old walk.

415
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,144
Oh. Um...

416
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,513
<i>bonjour.</i>

417
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,036
English?

418
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,582
Beg your pardon?

419
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,206
An Englishwoman.

420
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,320
Hey.

421
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,124
Thank you. Yeah.

422
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,297
Um, I'm here to buy a dress.

423
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,432
From Dior.

424
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,033
Dior?

425
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,402
<i>Ah, oui.</i> Me also.

426
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,576
Is it far... Dior?

427
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,243
Oh...

428
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,045
20 minutes.

429
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,981
Uh, but after you
take wine, two hours.

430
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,187
I walk you there.

431
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,024
Tomorrow morning, eh?

432
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,292
Are you hungry?

433
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,428
Oh, no, no, thanks.

434
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,430
I couldn't, no.

435
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,304
All right, go on, then.

436
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,645
Oh, blimey.

437
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,764
Why is all this
rubbish on the streets?

438
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,600
The big boss cheats...

439
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,958
- The worker, yes?
- Yeah, yeah.

440
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,169
Well, no. It's over.

441
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,962
The worker say, "No more."

442
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,756
They've had enough.

443
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,443
The binmen are on strike?

444
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,278
Ah, yes.

445
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,548
Now all Paris, uh, smells, uh...

446
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,250
uh, like me.

447
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,018
Here we are, we've arrived.

448
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,062
The great House of Dior.

449
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,290
Oh, God.

450
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,066
Good luck, English lady.

451
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:49,062
You are a noble woman.

452
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,767
And remember, in France,
the worker is king.

453
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,446
Hold them back as best you can.
She won't be long, I'm sure.

454
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,175
Excuse me, Madame.

455
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,154
Oh, miss!

456
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,624
You all right,
love? Clumsy girl!

457
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,258
André, what is going on?
I could have been hurt!

458
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,728
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No. Sorry.

459
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:21,796
Thank you.

460
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,831
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

461
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,567
Oh.

462
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,100
Miss?

463
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,469
Miss!

464
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,240
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me!

465
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,381
No, miss.

466
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,083
Ooh-ooh! Miss!

467
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:44,686
Miss?

468
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,688
Here you go.

469
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:48,188
Once again, you save me, madame.

470
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,891
- Oh.
- I'm sorry. I'm very late.

471
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,593
- Oh.
- Thank you.

472
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:53,861
It's all right. As long
as you're in one piece.

473
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,097
Ooh.

474
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,349
Careful, careful, careful!

475
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:10,344
Ooh, uh...

476
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,232
Oh. Excuse me, dear.

477
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,302
Where would I find the frocks?

478
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,404
I fear you have the
wrong address, madame.

479
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,272
I will call someone
to show you the way.

480
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,541
No. No, no.

481
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,376
Sorry. I'm-I'm...
I'm after a frock.

482
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,244
One of them 500-pound ones.

483
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,880
Please, if you could
wait over here,

484
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,215
somebody will
attend you directly.

485
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,356
Ah, the Countess.

486
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,483
Good day, Baroness
von Tiesenhausen.

487
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,987
Hello, Madame.

488
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,075
Hello, Madame.

489
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,773
Now, hang on. Excuse
me. Here you are.

490
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:06,199
Madame, I-I was here first,
before any of this lot.

491
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,435
Ain't you heard of queuing?

492
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,378
Madame Avallon! Such
elegance, as always.

493
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,874
Mathilde, how you've changed.

494
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,409
Excuse me. Look, I'm sorry.

495
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,220
- Please.
- I'm-I'm... I'm not one to make a fuss,

496
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:18,445
but where I come from,

497
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:20,848
shopgirls are pleased
to be of service.

498
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,216
Shopgirls?

499
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,434
How has this unfortunate
creature been allowed in?

500
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,699
This lady wishes to buy a dress.
The woman is clearly deranged.

501
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:31,147
Direct her to a suitable shop.

502
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,391
A department store.

503
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:33,427
Go.

504
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,395
Uh, please let me
escort you out.

505
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,565
No, no, no, no, no,
hang on a minute.

506
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:39,266
I've come miles.

507
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,234
Saved every penny
scrubbing floors

508
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,980
and I don't know what
so I can buy this frock.

509
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,506
A Christian Dior gown
is not for pennies.

510
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,289
Have her removed at once.

511
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:49,342
Right.

512
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:53,748
If you think I ain't
got the money...

513
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:54,816
there.

514
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,449
<i>Oh là l.</i> It's real
money, Madame Colbert.

515
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,093
If only everyone
could do the same...

516
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,455
Are you Mr. Dior?

517
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,725
Oh, oh, no, I'm
Mr. Fauvel, accounts.

518
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,492
Let me help you with the...

519
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,143
Today, Monsieur Dior will reveal
his 10th Anniversary Collection.

520
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,479
Nothing must detract
for this occasion.

521
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:13,768
Excuse me, <i>chère madame,</i>
but it would be my honor

522
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:17,471
to have you view the
collection as my guest.

523
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,474
There you are.

524
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,611
<i>Merci.</i>

525
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:24,946
Shall we?

526
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:27,380
Oh.

527
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,008
Girls, you will never
believe what's just happened.

528
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,528
There's a cleaning lady from
London who's going to buy a dress.

529
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,846
- A cleaning lady?
- Yes, a Dior gown!

530
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,682
She arrived with all her money.

531
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,934
And Madame Colbert didn't
know where to put herself.

532
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:53,188
Natasha, you must come and
see her. She's so wonderful!

533
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,524
Look! Look!

534
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,651
Ladies.

535
00:37:57,779 --> 00:37:59,446
It's here.

536
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,363
Thank you.

537
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,700
She saved up all her
pennies to come and see us!

538
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,122
There she is, just next to
the Marquis de Chassagne.

539
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:13,374
You see?

540
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,167
What's going on?

541
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,879
Back to work!

542
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,755
Quick!

543
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:27,074
When you see the dress you want,

544
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,943
you can write the
number down here.

545
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,444
Oh.

546
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:41,856
Oh, I was just admiring
your buttonhole.

547
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,957
Oh.

548
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,959
- It's Louise Odier.
- Ah?

549
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,694
Yes, it's lovely. Proper scent.

550
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,629
Are you a connoisseur of roses?

551
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:50,765
My husband Eddie worked
at Covent Garden,

552
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,365
the flower market.

553
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:55,002
He was always bringing home
odds and ends, you know.

554
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:57,505
Roses are me favorite.

555
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,009
You after a dress for your wife?

556
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:04,377
Ooh. Lucky woman.

557
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:05,880
My wife is dead.

558
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,983
Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir.

559
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,751
My clumsy clogs.

560
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,654
My Eddie and all.

561
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,122
Oh, um...

562
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,727
But yes, uh, my wife and I
would come here together.

563
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:22,530
I like to see beautiful clothes.

564
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,732
And beautiful women, of course.

565
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,705
This can't be true.

566
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,956
Her again!

567
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,794
This won't do.

568
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,587
I'm sorry, Madame Avallon.

569
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,148
We will find you a
more suitable seat.

570
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,633
No! These are our usual seats.

571
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,136
We will endure this indignity
but it won't end here.

572
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,207
Oh, here we go.

573
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,580
Number one,

574
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,082
the Bar Suit.

575
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:23,824
Ooh.

576
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,928
Number two,

577
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,151
Number three,

578
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,849
Oh, that's lovely.

579
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:54,622
Oh. Number four, Cocotte.

580
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,891
Number 42, Cabaret.

581
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:19,853
Dinner dress in
champagne satin chiffon.

582
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,922
Oh, will you look.

583
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:56,264
Cocktail dress in black
satin with white polka dots.

584
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,788
Oh, that's lovely.

585
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,207
<i>Vénus.</i>

586
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:22,576
- What number's that?
- 73.

587
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,579
<i>- Vénus.</i> Yes.
- 73. <i>Vénus.</i>

588
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,308
- What number's that?
- 89.

589
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:28,943
Temptation.

590
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:32,012
Oh, yeah.

591
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,076
Bravo!

592
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:38,312
Who's that bloke?

593
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,248
Well, that's the master
himself, Monsieur Dior.

594
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:42,783
Go on.

595
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:49,089
He looks like my milkman.

596
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,497
Well, good luck, madame.

597
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:58,332
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

598
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,968
Oh, well...

599
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:03,938
Here.

600
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,244
You do not wish to keep it?

601
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,114
Yeah, it's-it's
lovely. Thank you.

602
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,884
<i>Enchanté.</i>

603
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,024
Don't mind me.

604
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,362
- Yes, madame?
- Oh.

605
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,130
Have you made your selection?

606
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:32,366
Yes. Um...

607
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:35,402
Number 89, please. Temptation.

608
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:36,971
Of course.

609
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:38,839
- Your name, please.
- Harris.

610
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:40,874
Mrs. Ada Harris. Sales girl?

611
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,741
You know our arrangements.

612
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,879
My apologies, madame.

613
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,881
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

614
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,457
Yes, Madame Avallon,
how can I help you?

615
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,583
I've made my choice.

616
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:55,128
- Very good, Madame Avallon.
- Temptation, number 89.

617
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:59,793
- Ah.
- Oh. Ta-da.

618
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,032
Madame Harris, I regret...

619
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,835
Well, there is a
difficulty with Temptation.

620
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,870
It seems Madame
Avallon demands it.

621
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,172
How's that work, then? You
only got the one dress?

622
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,875
I'm sorry. Madame
insists on exclusivity.

623
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,978
Madame Avallon is one of
our most devoted clients.

624
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,247
And her husband is known
as "The King of Rubbish."

625
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:23,484
But we would be so sorry if
you were to leave Maison Dior

626
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:25,019
without a purchase.

627
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:27,154
And you also wrote
number 73 on your card.

628
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:28,289
- Oh.
<i>- Vénus.</i>

629
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,958
Yeah, I never thought nothing
could be more beautiful.

630
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,527
Not till I saw Temptation.

631
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,428
An excellent choice, madame.

632
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,297
Yeah. How much is it?

633
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,601
<i>Vénus</i> is 600,000 francs.

634
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:42,036
430 pounds.

635
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,272
Wrap it up. I got
a plane to catch.

636
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,041
I'm a day late as it is.

637
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,909
Oh, you cannot have this gown.

638
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,546
Oh, don't tell me someone
wants that exclusive and all.

639
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,981
<i>Mais Madame Harris,</i>
every dress is made

640
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,983
and fitted individually
for the client.

641
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:58,352
Yes, this is haute couture.

642
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:01,556
We will, of course, reproduce
<i>Vénus</i> exactly as you saw it,

643
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,090
but the thing is...

644
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,325
Make me one?

645
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:05,560
How long's that gonna take?

646
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:07,194
Well, at least two weeks.

647
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:09,129
Ooh. At least.

648
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,031
Several fittings are necessary.

649
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,600
What, leave my people
for a fortnight?

650
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,944
They'd find someone else, and
then I'd be out on the streets.

651
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,437
<i>Vite, vite,</i> to
the airport, then.

652
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,939
I would not forgive myself
if you missed your flight.

653
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,108
- What, without my dress?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

654
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,045
Perhaps there is a
friend you can call?

655
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,582
Someone who can assist
you with your cleaning.

656
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,083
Well, uh, there's Vi,

657
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:30,528
but I've tried her
patience enough as it is.

658
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:31,985
Anyway, she's not on the phone.

659
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,887
Uh, we might send
her a telegram.

660
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,688
Yes. Yes, exactly.

661
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:39,059
Uh, Mrs. Harris,

662
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:40,437
uh, it might be
possible to encourage

663
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:43,197
the cutter and seamstress
to work a little faster.

664
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,400
And Madame Vi could fill you
in for one week, perhaps?

665
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:49,470
Well...

666
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:51,506
you're kind, but I can't.

667
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,108
Anyway, I got nowhere to stay.

668
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,877
I'll have to give it a miss.

669
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,115
My sister is away.

670
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:04,318
If you... would accept, um,

671
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,888
you could stay at my place,
uh, in my sister's room.

672
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:12,059
You're a proper
angel, aren't you?

673
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,294
It'll be my pleasure.

674
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,639
Um, we can have your
measurements taken at once.

675
00:48:15,663 --> 00:48:17,164
<i>N'est-ce pas, Madame Colbert?</i>

676
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,386
The atelier has nothing to do.

677
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,832
But to devote itself
to this one order?

678
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,733
A cash sale, Madame.
Given our circumstances...

679
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,653
Very well, Monsieur Fauvel. It
seems you are in charge now.

680
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,441
Come, Madame Harris. Come.

681
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,942
- Oh.
- We must be quick.

682
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,244
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

683
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,161
Off you go. Don't
just stand there.

684
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,951
Oh.

685
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:39,554
- Bravo, madame.
- Bravo.

686
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,429
- Please, madame.
- Oh.

687
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,164
You don't get all this hoo-ha

688
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:51,965
when you buy a frock
down Woolworths.

689
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,333
Well, I can tell you such things

690
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,603
do not happen every
day here, either.

691
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:57,938
Ah, the lady who must
have her dress...

692
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,019
Quick, quick, quick.

693
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:02,276
Your coat, please.

694
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,011
Oh.

695
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:08,949
<i>- Et le cardigan.</i>
- Yeah, me cardy.

696
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,486
Thank you very much.

697
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,089
Oh.

698
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,039
Thirteen.

699
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,962
Eighty-two.

700
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,550
Sixty-two.

701
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,473
Madame has the
proportions of a model.

702
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:35,543
Model railway, more like.

703
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,680
One of the curvy bits.

704
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:42,717
Oh, thank you.

705
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,752
Thank you very much.

706
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:52,092
Madame?

707
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,628
Oh.

708
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:54,762
May I give you a lift?

709
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:58,365
Oh, well, if it's no bother.

710
00:49:58,398 --> 00:49:59,066
No.

711
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,402
Uh, I'm going to Mr. Fauvel's.

712
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,507
The 18th, yes. That's easy.

713
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,208
- Oh, forgive the mess.
- Oh.

714
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:11,546
Is he a friend of
yours, Mr. Fauvel?

715
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,413
No. No, I-I know Mr. Fauvel

716
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:15,382
only as the hand
that signs my check.

717
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,017
Oh.

718
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,219
Oh.

719
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:22,155
<i>L'être et le néant.</i>

720
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,424
It's, uh, "Being
and Not Being."

721
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,530
I like to curl up with
a juicy mystery meself.

722
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,610
Oh, look, there's
the Eiffel Tower.

723
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,453
Oh, that's lovely.

724
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:03,565
Oh.

725
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,499
That's the opera.

726
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,582
May I help you
with your luggage?

727
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:23,283
Nothing in it yet.

728
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:26,186
Oh. That's something, innit?

729
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,231
Ooh.

730
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:45,172
I don't think his sister
knows where the mop is.

731
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:49,343
There must be a dustpan
and brush somewhere.

732
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,483
Uh...

733
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:57,685
Oh.

734
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,791
Oh, you don't have
to do that, love.

735
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:06,226
You must have
better things to do.

736
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,195
No, not really.

737
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,664
After the <i>défilé,</i> there's always

738
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,700
a certain feeling of emptiness.

739
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:13,901
Oh.

740
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,670
All right, ducks.

741
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,439
Oh. Aha.

742
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:22,275
Now we're in business.

743
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:30,317
Oh.

744
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,351
What's happened?

745
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,589
- Mrs. Harris?
- Hello, love.

746
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,759
Mademoiselle.

747
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,259
She's a good worker.

748
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,795
I can always find
you a job, my girl,

749
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,068
if the modeling don't work out.

750
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,232
I am embarrassed beyond words
that you have seen the state of...

751
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,301
No, no.

752
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,709
I haven't had time to...

753
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,211
No, please, it was nothing.

754
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:54,713
Oh! Oh! Allow me...

755
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,924
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

756
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,759
No, it's me, I shouldn't have...

757
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,827
M-Mrs. Harris has
cooked the dinner.

758
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,554
You look like you could do
with a good square meal,

759
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,388
the pair of you.

760
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,424
Well, Mademoiselle Natasha
has other engagements.

761
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:13,293
I'm sure the face of Dior is
always at a party or premiere.

762
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,663
There's a <i>soirée</i> later.

763
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,199
Come on. Grub's up.

764
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,339
Here we are.

765
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,341
Don't let it get cold.

766
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:35,248
<i>- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.</i>

767
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,452
My Eddie's favorite.

768
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,822
Be even better if we
had a bit of gravy.

769
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,591
Um, and what's the dish named?

770
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:46,359
Toad-in-the-hole.

771
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,225
Frog in the...?

772
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,227
In the ditch.

773
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,736
What a lot of books, Mr. Fauvel.

774
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:56,336
Oh.

775
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,740
Natasha's got a corker,
a murder-mystery.

776
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:00,273
Don't you, ducks?

777
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,073
Being and Nothingness.

778
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:03,782
You are reading Sartre?

779
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:04,846
We should speak English.

780
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:05,880
Oh, yeah. Of course.

781
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,414
Um, I-I'm interested to learn

782
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:09,349
that Mademoiselle
Natasha is reading a book

783
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:11,552
- by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
- Oh.

784
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,788
The author asks us to consider
the case of the waiter.

785
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,389
Is the waiter the waiter,
or is it just an expression

786
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,658
of what the waiter is?

787
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:20,327
Um, similarly, am
I the accountant,

788
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,763
or is that an
outward impression?

789
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:24,665
Um, is Mademoiselle Natasha
only the most beautiful,

790
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,834
the most exquisitely divine
Parisian model, or...

791
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:29,737
Or is there another
person behind the facade?

792
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:31,739
Yes.

793
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,443
Is Mrs. Harris the cleaner,

794
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:37,888
or is there more to
define her existence?

795
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,412
<i>Exactement.</i>

796
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,916
I'm a cleaner from
Battersea. No mystery there.

797
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,518
Uh, no, you're a
cleaner who dreams

798
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,385
of the most beautiful
gown in the world.

799
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:47,454
Oh, dreams, eh?

800
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:50,591
God knows what Vi is gonna say

801
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,794
when she gets that
blooming telegram.

802
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,607
Mrs. Harris?

803
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:09,577
Uh, please help yourself
to my sister's clothes.

804
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,413
Oh, thanks, love.
Um, I'm all right.

805
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:16,316
Uh, she would insist.

806
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,120
Good night.

807
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,721
Night, love.

808
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,590
Sweet dreams.

809
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,175
Ooh!

810
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,376
Stand straight, madame.

811
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:19,046
- Oh!
<i>- Non, mais...</i>

812
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,982
Keep still. Why do you move?

813
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:22,583
Sorry. Sorry.

814
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,630
I need to speak to you about
some of the alterations

815
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:27,965
Princess Margaret? Requested
by Princess Margaret.

816
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,489
Oh, I like her.

817
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,934
You can see a little bit
of mischief in her eye.

818
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,795
Our distinguished clients
demand our utmost discretion.

819
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,062
Let's go, Monsieur Carré.

820
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,867
That's all for today.

821
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,871
Little bit of that one
goes a long way, don't it?

822
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,506
What's eating her?

823
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,909
Well, the more grand the
client, the more difficult.

824
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:50,711
Their wishes must be
accommodated always,

825
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:53,514
even if it means
starting afresh.

826
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,616
- And they do not pay until delivery.
- Oh!

827
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,684
If then.

828
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:59,186
There are so many
salaries to find.

829
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,056
The fabric, braid,
embroidery, buttons

830
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,558
all must be the very best.

831
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,193
The pressure is on everyone:

832
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,596
on Mr. Fauvel and the accounts,

833
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:11,532
on Madame Colbert
and the seamstresses,

834
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:15,670
even on Monsieur Dior
himself, always such pressure.

835
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:17,972
Well, no wonder
Mr. Fauvel was so pleased

836
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:19,674
to see my little handbag.

837
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:22,877
Well, in truth, Madame
Harris, all of us fear

838
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,813
the House of Dior cannot
keep going this way.

839
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:43,597
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

840
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,610
You all right, love?

841
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,214
Wakey, wakey.

842
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,183
They're calling for you.

843
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,884
Oh.

844
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,987
Um, I'm sorry.

845
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,588
- I'm just tired.
- Mm-hmm.

846
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,657
You could do with
a little holiday.

847
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,625
It's doing me the
power of good already.

848
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,028
Yes, that would be nice.

849
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:16,931
By myself at the seaside,

850
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:18,733
where nobody... Where are you?

851
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:19,734
I'm sorry.

852
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,769
- I must go. Thank you.
- Oh.

853
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,251
Sorry.

854
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,596
No, it doesn't work.

855
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:40,921
Thank you.

856
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,959
How was your fitting, madame?

857
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,193
Oh.

858
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:48,629
Well, if it isn't my
old pal, Mr. Rosebud.

859
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:51,665
I regret we were not
properly introduced.

860
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,901
Marquis Hypolite de Chassagne.

861
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:55,169
Ooh.

862
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,538
Ada Harris, widow of Battersea.

863
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,673
Who's this fine fella?

864
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:01,242
- This is Nesquik.
- Oh.

865
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:04,645
So, I trust Monsieur Dior
fulfills your heart's desire?

866
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,747
Oh, they're being ever so kind.

867
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,584
Louise Odier. I'd
forgotten the name.

868
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:13,554
Oh, I must show you something.

869
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,724
Please, I won't detain you long.

870
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,168
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your time in Paris?

871
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,941
My wife adored the
Marché aux Fleurs.

872
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:35,209
Mm.

873
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,079
We came here almost
until the end.

874
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,247
It's been seven years now.

875
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:42,750
We mend, but we don't forget.

876
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,657
When you display your
Dior dress to the world,

877
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,859
- it will be perfection.
- Oh.

878
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,163
My pal Vi thinks I'm barmy.

879
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,034
"What do you want
that dress for?

880
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,236
When are you gonna wear it?"

881
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,105
Oh, I do not
question your desire

882
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:05,773
for a gown of such quality,

883
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,675
even if it is for
your eyes alone.

884
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,111
No, no, on the
contrary, I understand.

885
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:11,979
You see, a rose like this one

886
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:14,248
or a beautiful
gown such as yours,

887
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:16,383
they... they recall the days

888
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,886
when we were in the full
flower of our youth.

889
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,189
Oi, don't write me off just yet.

890
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:27,261
- Oh, a thousand apologies.
- Oh, no.

891
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,630
Please, allow me to make amends.

892
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:34,101
Have you any
arrangements for tonight?

893
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:44,378
<i>Voilà.</i>

894
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,013
Oh, thank you.

895
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,293
Some champagne?

896
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,427
Uh, oh, yes, please.

897
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:01,962
Just a drop.

898
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:04,331
Thank you.

899
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:06,233
Now, you-you must
try the caviar.

900
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,768
Oh. Right.

901
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,904
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

902
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,178
- Nice, huh?
- Mm.

903
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:18,479
Uh, oh, hello!

904
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,317
I don't think that getup's
gonna fool anyone. Do you?

905
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,959
Lovely girls.

906
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,494
Hmm. Soon, you'll
see how lovely.

907
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:43,237
Ooh! Oh. Steady on.

908
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,813
Blimey, they earn
their keep, them girls.

909
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,148
Well, least when I'm cleaning,

910
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:57,218
I don't have to smile
and strip as well.

911
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,089
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Mrs. Harris.

912
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,490
Natasha. Hello, love.

913
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:04,959
Hello.

914
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:06,894
<i>Bonsoir, mademoiselle.</i>

915
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:08,829
- Would you like to join us?
- Uh, yes, please.

916
01:02:08,862 --> 01:02:10,231
Who are you here with, then?

917
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:11,966
Investors.

918
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:13,968
I escape but only for a moment.

919
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:17,171
They don't half keep you at it,
all day and all night as well.

920
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,974
For Maison Dior, this
is my obligation.

921
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,376
Ah, well, Dior is
not just about gowns.

922
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,945
It's also about
elegance and decadence

923
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:27,848
and the <i>savoir-vivre</i>
of Paris, and...

924
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:31,151
and you, Mademoiselle
Natasha, you are the jewel

925
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:34,054
of this Dior crown.

926
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,457
Well, I would prefer to
be at home with a book.

927
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,125
It's funny you should say that.

928
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:40,261
I've left Mr. Fauvel
at home reading a book.

929
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,229
It was called...

930
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:45,266
"Nosy"? Something like that.

931
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,935
<i>- La nausée?</i>
- Don't know.

932
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:50,804
Why does he tolerate
the fashion house

933
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:53,907
compared to his world of
Sartre and the intellect?

934
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:57,011
Well, I-I think he
has his reasons.

935
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:06,220
Do you enjoy the show?

936
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,889
Yeah, the one... the
one at the end, she...

937
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:11,892
she's a dead ringer
for my Aunt Tilda.

938
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,460
From behind.

939
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,033
Well, this was lovely,
but I should go.

940
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,434
Thank you.

941
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,269
Oh, just-just a minute, love.

942
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:23,571
Your fringe.

943
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:25,372
There's a little gap.

944
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:27,174
That's it.

945
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,544
You have made a conquest.

946
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:31,312
Oh, get away with you.

947
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,448
You dare to follow your
dreams, Mrs. Harris.

948
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,216
- Bravo.
- Oh.

949
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:38,952
Bye, love.

950
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,556
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, Natasha.</i>

951
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,594
- Some more champagne?
- Oh, just a drop.

952
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:49,430
I've got me fitting at 9:30.

953
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,667
Oh, God!

954
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:04,071
Oh, Gordon Bennett!

955
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,306
Oh, oh!

956
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,308
Oh! Oh!

957
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,146
Careful!

958
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,450
Oh, oh, oh!

959
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,285
Oh!

960
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,333
Stupid cretin!

961
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,584
Idiot! Clear off!

962
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,202
Out! Out! Avallon out!

963
01:05:32,203 --> 01:05:33,467
I can't believe this.

964
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,515
Avallon, you dirty stinker!

965
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,641
Chuck him in the bin!

966
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,342
Sorry!

967
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:48,248
Sorry. Sorry.

968
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:51,586
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

969
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,420
This is not
possible, not at all.

970
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:56,056
No, no, no, please, I-I'm...
I'm never late. I...

971
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:58,258
R-Really, I'm not.
I'm never late. Sorry.

972
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,595
You demand of us,
<i>"Vite, vite, vite,"</i>

973
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,597
but you have no respect.

974
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,466
No, this cannot be done.

975
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,434
Not at all.

976
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:09,336
Now I depart.

977
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,205
This is finished.

978
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,474
No, no, no, no. Please,
please, p-please, Mr. Carré.

979
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:15,008
Madame Colbert, please.

980
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,377
Monsieur Carré
refuses to proceed.

981
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,079
What can I do?

982
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:21,616
No. No, of course, I...

983
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:23,217
No, I understand.

984
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,352
Yeah, of course I do. I do.

985
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:29,289
Dior, it's-it's not just a gown.

986
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:31,225
It's, um...

987
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:34,729
It's all the elegance and-and
the savvy and all that.

988
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,463
I-I know that.

989
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:39,567
I will see what can be done
to return your deposit.

990
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,369
No, I don't...

991
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,251
So, Monsieur Carré...

992
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:49,276
I-I...

993
01:06:50,712 --> 01:06:53,548
I don't want... I
don't want me deposit.

994
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:58,418
Right Champagne
Charlie, aren't I?

995
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:01,154
Serves me right,
living the high life.

996
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,626
I do respect you, all of you.

997
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:08,028
Never mind, eh?

998
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:10,798
Thanks, love.

999
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:12,600
You've been ever so kind.

1000
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:15,402
Madame Harris, would you
care to see the <i>atelier</i>

1001
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:17,605
before you leave?

1002
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,439
Ooh.

1003
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:23,210
<i>- Bonjour, mesdames.
- Bonjour.</i>

1004
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,580
So, this room is for cutting.

1005
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:32,352
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
- Morning.

1006
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:50,572
<i>Structure du couture.</i>

1007
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:07,622
Unstructured couture.

1008
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,508
<i>Passementerie.</i>

1009
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:33,447
<i>Plumassier.</i>

1010
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:42,356
<i>Broderie.</i>

1011
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,525
Mrs Harris?

1012
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,068
Are you all right?

1013
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,560
It's not sewing.

1014
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:21,929
It's making moonlight.

1015
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,733
Have I gone to heaven?

1016
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,166
Mrs Harris asked if
she's gone to heaven.

1017
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,170
Ladies!

1018
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,423
Quick, quick. Back to work!

1019
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,018
Do you think this fabric
could work well for Aphrodite?

1020
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,937
Yes, I love the color.

1021
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,064
- May I show Monsieur Carré?
- Certainly.

1022
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,946
Monsieur Carré, this fabric
is even more luxurious.

1023
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,865
Perhaps we could use it for...?

1024
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,253
We have found some common
ground, the little sparrow and I.

1025
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,091
She's a capable seamstress.

1026
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,139
What could go
wrong with buttons?

1027
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,876
I have stood at
Monsieur Dior's shoulder

1028
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,578
day and night for ten years,

1029
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:46,446
since <i>le maître</i> unveiled
his first collection.

1030
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:50,484
The most fashionable
women in the world

1031
01:10:50,518 --> 01:10:52,486
come to the Avenue Montaigne.

1032
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,555
Royalty and courtesans,

1033
01:10:54,589 --> 01:10:57,024
thin, fat, young, old, ugly,

1034
01:10:57,058 --> 01:11:00,494
or with a certain
<i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

1035
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:01,629
Hmm.

1036
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:04,732
But then there is
you, Mrs. Harris.

1037
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:07,535
All my time as directress,

1038
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:10,071
I have never encountered
anyone like you.

1039
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:11,606
Oh.

1040
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,808
In my walk of life,
you meet all sorts.

1041
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:18,045
As a good boss, I must
keep my workers happy,

1042
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,815
and their wish is to
complete your dress.

1043
01:11:20,848 --> 01:11:22,984
Oh. Much obliged.

1044
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:27,054
So you will do me the courtesy
of answering my questions, no?

1045
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:28,790
Yeah.

1046
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,759
Oh. Bottoms up. Cheers!

1047
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:39,667
Why do you come
here, Mrs. Harris?

1048
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,672
<i>Évidemment,</i> the rich and titled
must be seen, admired, copied.

1049
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:48,910
But this Dior dress
that you desire so much,

1050
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:50,545
where will you wear it?

1051
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:54,615
At the Vienna Opera Ball
or Queen Charlotte's?

1052
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:56,349
Will you wear it
to polish floors,

1053
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,886
or will you keep it shut
in your little wardrobe?

1054
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:03,591
A Dior dress is designed
to astonish and delight.

1055
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,793
How will you do
that, Mrs. Harris?

1056
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:07,595
You...

1057
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:11,464
Forgive me for saying this,
but you are nobody, invisible.

1058
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:14,602
How will you give this
dress the life it deserves?

1059
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,773
It's my dream.

1060
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,909
And my money's as good
as anybody else's.

1061
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:23,811
<i>Bien sûr. Hmm.</i>

1062
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:27,447
You may buy your dream, but
what will you do with it?

1063
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:31,786
<i>Oui, entrez.</i>

1064
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:36,023
Mrs. Harris, these are for you.

1065
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:37,424
Ooh.

1066
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:39,727
From Monsieur le Marquis.

1067
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,762
Oh.

1068
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:44,599
He wishes that you
visit for tea tomorrow.

1069
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:46,466
Le Marquis de Chassagne?

1070
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,970
But... he receives nobody.

1071
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:52,372
But I am nobody, aren't I?

1072
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:04,652
I never thought a place like
Dior would have problems.

1073
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,154
I saw that dress,

1074
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:09,891
and I thought of
dreams and fairy tales.

1075
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,760
Yes, we are like a fairy tale.

1076
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,563
Lovely but not real.

1077
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,565
Is there a place for that today?

1078
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,767
Oh, we need our dreams.

1079
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,536
Now more than ever.

1080
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,948
If you can have this,
why do you need Dior?

1081
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,618
Haute couture is a vanity
for us and our clients.

1082
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:41,188
In truth, I don't think the
House of Dior can survive.

1083
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:43,591
No, love, that
would be a tragedy.

1084
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,593
You can't allow that to happen.

1085
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:47,494
Well, I have an idea,

1086
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:50,598
but it requires a
new way of thinking.

1087
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:52,199
What? Bossy Boots in the way?

1088
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:55,503
Madame Colbert, she
guards the temple.

1089
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,939
She let a cleaning
lady buy a Dior gown.

1090
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,073
Money talks.

1091
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,741
Yes, and you know what it says,

1092
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,843
so you have to do
something about it.

1093
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:05,680
I know you can.
You're ever so clever.

1094
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,149
You're the only
one who believes.

1095
01:14:12,987 --> 01:14:16,090
What's going on here?

1096
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,959
It looks like a premiere.

1097
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:19,093
Ooh!

1098
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,862
Oh, exciting.

1099
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,966
Oh, that's Jean
Fabre, the movie star.

1100
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,204
Mm, and don't he know it?

1101
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,751
Oh, it's Natasha! Oh!

1102
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:53,027
- Natasha! Ooh-ooh!
- What are you doing? No, no.

1103
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,262
- Natasha!
- No.

1104
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,098
Hello.

1105
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,265
Good evening, Mrs. Harris.

1106
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,967
You look lovely.

1107
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,736
Thank you.

1108
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,771
<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur Fauvel.</i>

1109
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:08,009
<i>Bonsoir.</i> Um, we didn't
know you were, uh...

1110
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,777
We were just passing.

1111
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:13,247
So, what are you two
doing this evening?

1112
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,182
- Oh, well... Oh.
- Natasha.

1113
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:17,318
I'm sorry. I-I must go.

1114
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,686
It was great to see you.

1115
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,788
Oh, yeah. Ta-ta, love.

1116
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,935
I think it's just for show.

1117
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,772
I'm not sure that he's
the marrying kind.

1118
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:39,840
Mrs. Harris, I-I beg of you,

1119
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:41,609
you-you need to stop
this coupling thing

1120
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:43,677
- before I die of humiliation.
- Oh...

1121
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,246
Please. Enough!

1122
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,148
All right. I'm not deaf.

1123
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,084
Of course I'm in
love with Natasha.

1124
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:51,685
I mean, who isn't?

1125
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,589
I'm sorry, but life is not
all moonlight and movies.

1126
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:57,224
Why can't it be?

1127
01:15:57,258 --> 01:16:00,194
I've spent too long on my
own, wishing my life away.

1128
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,163
You don't want to
do the same thing.

1129
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:06,067
Mrs. Harris, I think
your dreams of romance

1130
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,768
fit Paris very well.

1131
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:10,738
Forgive me, but
perhaps it is you

1132
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:12,573
who wishes to be in love.

1133
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:15,843
You who must attend
to your own heart.

1134
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,086
Come on, Eddie, say
something, love.

1135
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:30,991
Try and make some sense
of this, 'cause I can't.

1136
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:38,599
This is all your doing.

1137
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,637
Coming up with the readies
to get your girl to Paris.

1138
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,876
Paris.

1139
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,949
To meet someone?

1140
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,688
Ah.

1141
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:04,391
Shall we?

1142
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:21,175
The girls at Dior say my
dress is almost finished.

1143
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,644
Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

1144
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:27,148
And then I'll be...
I'll be back off home.

1145
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,453
Yeah, it's lovely.

1146
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,689
Really, really lovely.

1147
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,159
That rubbish lady's
welcome to hers.

1148
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:41,095
And here's the irony.

1149
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:44,965
Monsieur Dior makes exquisite
poems for beautiful women

1150
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:47,201
in celebration of their
freshness and perfection

1151
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:50,037
only to see them carried
away by old frumps.

1152
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,073
Like that dreadful
Madame Avallon.

1153
01:17:53,107 --> 01:17:55,176
Oh, yeah.

1154
01:17:55,209 --> 01:17:57,411
Whereas, of course, there
are those who retain

1155
01:17:57,444 --> 01:18:00,281
a certain <i>je ne sais quoi,</i>

1156
01:18:00,314 --> 01:18:03,217
an indefinable allure.

1157
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,985
Ah.

1158
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:08,756
Allow me to present to
you a pot of English tea.

1159
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:10,324
Oh, just the job.

1160
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,393
Hmm. <i>Merci, Maria.</i>

1161
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,795
And now we let the pot brew.

1162
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,964
- Is that the correct form, yes?
- That's the ticket.

1163
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,066
I'll have to knit
you a tea cozy.

1164
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:22,736
Yes, for reasons that
were never clear to me,

1165
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,338
I was sent as a boy of six

1166
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:25,973
to a boarding school in Windsor,

1167
01:18:26,006 --> 01:18:27,942
and that's where I
acquired a taste for tea

1168
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:30,110
and of all things English.

1169
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:32,514
While we wait,

1170
01:18:32,547 --> 01:18:34,815
there's something I
would like you to see.

1171
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:36,917
Come with me.

1172
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:43,891
There.

1173
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,859
Oh. Oh.

1174
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,095
Six years old, you poor mite.

1175
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:51,098
Well, home was not much better.

1176
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,499
But yes, I suffered.

1177
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:54,902
I was a weak little boy,
perpetually bullied.

1178
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,071
Oh.

1179
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:02,042
You know, as soon as I saw you,

1180
01:19:02,076 --> 01:19:05,547
I felt this connection
in my heart.

1181
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,047
I don't know, perhaps...

1182
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:09,850
your smile, your
kindness, your...

1183
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:11,819
your English humor.

1184
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:13,387
I knew you reminded
me of someone,

1185
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:17,157
someone very dear
to me, but who?

1186
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:19,960
And only yesterday, as
I searched my memories,

1187
01:19:19,994 --> 01:19:24,532
did I realize there was a
person who took care of me.

1188
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:27,201
Her life was one of
tireless drudgery,

1189
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:31,506
and yet she found the time to
comfort me and dry my tears.

1190
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:33,974
Her name was Mrs. Maddox,

1191
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:36,143
but we used to
call her Mrs. Mops.

1192
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:37,911
There.

1193
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,286
I-I remind you of Mrs. Mops?

1194
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,354
- Ah, yes.
- The cleaner?

1195
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:51,025
Mrs. Mops dried my tears
and made me smile again,

1196
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:54,361
as you have, Mrs. Harris,
these past few days.

1197
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:59,233
I do wish my Delphine
could have known you.

1198
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:03,571
You see, you give
comfort to those in need

1199
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:06,006
without asking
anything in return.

1200
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,842
Is that right?

1201
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,046
Is that how you see me?

1202
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,281
You see why there is a
connection between us?

1203
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:20,454
Now, let's have a nice cup
of English tea, shall we?

1204
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:24,291
Uh, no, thank you.

1205
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:27,194
I'd best be getting along.

1206
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:29,330
They're expecting
me at the salon.

1207
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,406
Avallon, dirty boss!

1208
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,283
Avallon, in the bin!

1209
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,909
We will make you rot, Avallon!

1210
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,474
Marguerite?

1211
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,944
What's the matter?

1212
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,052
In you go.

1213
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,691
What's this about you
letting all these girls go?

1214
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,024
Ooh. You all right, love?

1215
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:32,292
It would not be necessary

1216
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:34,461
if they worked for
free, as you do.

1217
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:37,264
They need their jobs.
They've got families to feed.

1218
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:38,365
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1219
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:41,603
Yes, it is very sad, but
this is not of your concern.

1220
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,404
Well, we'll see about that.

1221
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:45,072
Please, madame, you have reached

1222
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:47,307
into every corner of
this establishment.

1223
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:50,545
Now, I insist that you
respect our privacy.

1224
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:52,012
Hmm.

1225
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:53,648
Where are you
going, Mrs. Harris?

1226
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:55,449
To see the boss.

1227
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:57,351
- You cannot. No.
- Come on, girls.

1228
01:21:57,384 --> 01:21:59,486
- Please. No.
- Follow me. <i>Vite, vite.</i>

1229
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:04,559
Here we go, girls. Come on.

1230
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:05,959
Down tools.

1231
01:22:05,993 --> 01:22:07,995
Come on, get behind me. Join us.

1232
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,564
Yeah, got a really
important job today.

1233
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,307
- Ooh, you look lovely, but come on.
- Mrs. Harris!

1234
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,967
- Come and do this for me.
- Mrs. Harris!

1235
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,670
You must stop this at once.

1236
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,505
You have no idea
what you are doing.

1237
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:18,972
Oh, yes, I do.

1238
01:22:19,006 --> 01:22:20,374
It's called a strike.

1239
01:22:22,577 --> 01:22:24,144
Right, ladies,
come on. Please!

1240
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:26,113
Follow me. No time
for that, dear.

1241
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:28,382
Oi! No need to push
and shove. Come on.

1242
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,612
Stay here!

1243
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,364
Marguerite, what's got into you?

1244
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,530
You stay here!

1245
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,957
On your feet, André.
There's work to be done.

1246
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,040
This is all your fault,
Monsieur Fauvel. Do something.

1247
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,833
Do you think I can
stop this woman?

1248
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:43,917
Arrest her!

1249
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,212
I'm a communist,
Madame. I'm on her side.

1250
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:47,754
Let me pass!

1251
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,605
Mrs. Harris, I beg of
you, do not do this.

1252
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:53,173
This is your chance,
André, and how many chances

1253
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:55,108
- do you get in your lifetime?
- No, look...

1254
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,445
Monsieur Dior, ten minutes
of your time, please.

1255
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,448
That's all Mr. Fauvel
needs to save the company.

1256
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:03,383
Me? What do I-I...

1257
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,216
Monsieur Dior, I am sorry.

1258
01:23:05,217 --> 01:23:07,454
Go on, pet. You can do
it. Tell him your plan.

1259
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:09,456
- Uh...
- Go on.

1260
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,239
A world without elegance,

1261
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,408
without distinction,
without Dior,

1262
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,742
no, it's impossible.

1263
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,746
Yet how can the House of Dior
surmount its current problems?

1264
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:25,640
Rather than the world
coming to Avenue Montaigne,

1265
01:23:25,673 --> 01:23:27,374
Dior must go out to the world

1266
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:29,777
with a range of goods
available to all.

1267
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:34,081
Uh, perfume, stockings,
luxury that...

1268
01:23:34,114 --> 01:23:36,383
that the ordinary
woman can afford.

1269
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,098
That would no longer
be the House of Dior.

1270
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,766
It would no longer
be haute couture.

1271
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,602
Our reputation is founded
on our exclusivity.

1272
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,229
Stop, Loulou.

1273
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:46,426
<i>Oui.</i>

1274
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,860
Monsieur Fauvel, you
have ten minutes.

1275
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,300
What?

1276
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:56,336
Oh, right.

1277
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,438
Good luck, love.

1278
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,460
And you as well.

1279
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:25,465
<i>Merci.</i>

1280
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,230
We've won the strike!

1281
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:30,274
Throw Avallon in jail!

1282
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,487
Here's to the workers!

1283
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,835
Ten years ago, when the House of
Dior presented its first collection,

1284
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,296
exclusivity was key, it's true.

1285
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:55,262
But today, there's a new woman,

1286
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:57,397
a modern woman who
knows what she wants

1287
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,701
and needs to be able to buy it.

1288
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:02,235
Today, there's Mrs. Harris.

1289
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,171
Oh.

1290
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:07,642
The <i>maître's</i> agreement
to our plan means that,

1291
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:11,512
far from losing jobs,
we will need more.

1292
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:13,881
Many, many more.

1293
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:26,259
Bravo!

1294
01:25:48,516 --> 01:25:50,450
Are you sure this
is the right street?

1295
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:53,253
Must be. This is where I
send her check every month.

1296
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:54,922
There won't be a
speck of dust inside.

1297
01:25:54,956 --> 01:25:57,357
You can bet your life.

1298
01:25:58,225 --> 01:26:01,294
This is it.

1299
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,201
No.

1300
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:09,570
Leave me in peace.

1301
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:10,772
Just a word.

1302
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:12,974
Why? I concede.

1303
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,442
The victory is
yours, Mrs. Harris.

1304
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,756
Madame Colbert, I beg you.

1305
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,394
Who's there?

1306
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,232
It's nothing, don't
worry. I'll be right back.

1307
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,109
What do they want?

1308
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,277
Don't worry.

1309
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:43,705
My husband... He was
damaged in the war.

1310
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:45,272
He requires constant care.

1311
01:26:45,305 --> 01:26:47,642
Which you either do or pay for.

1312
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,443
No wonder you got all
that front on you.

1313
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:51,546
Say what you want, please.

1314
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:54,582
Madame, I'm so sorry
to have offended you.

1315
01:26:54,615 --> 01:26:56,684
I hold you in the highest
regard, and it was

1316
01:26:56,718 --> 01:26:58,586
never my intention to
force a change on...

1317
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:01,723
The future you describe
makes perfect sense,

1318
01:27:01,756 --> 01:27:03,725
but I want no part of it.

1319
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,860
Uh, no, please.

1320
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,360
You must not think of leaving.

1321
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:10,263
Perhaps I have been
too long in my post,

1322
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:12,499
too long the invisible
woman behind the great man.

1323
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:14,001
Fighting talk.

1324
01:27:14,035 --> 01:27:15,570
You go, girl.

1325
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:19,874
I'm not a revolutionary
like you, Mrs. Harris.

1326
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:22,442
I simply wish to be left alone.

1327
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,479
Well, that's... that's
all fine and dandy,

1328
01:27:25,513 --> 01:27:28,415
and Lord knows you deserve it,

1329
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:30,585
but you know it'll fall
apart without you, don't you?

1330
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:32,720
Trust me, I've seen
it over and over.

1331
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:36,624
When the lady ups and leaves,
the gent don't last ten minutes.

1332
01:27:37,759 --> 01:27:39,694
You're needed.

1333
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,662
Now more than ever.

1334
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,331
Who else is gonna keep
things up to scratch?

1335
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:46,701
Not André or Monsieur Dior.

1336
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:49,537
What would two men
know about that?

1337
01:27:50,538 --> 01:27:53,808
You and me, you know,
we're two peas in a pod.

1338
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:55,610
We clean up everybody's mess

1339
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:57,912
and make everything
in the garden lovely.

1340
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,446
We're the ones they rely on.

1341
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:00,782
They don't even know what we do,

1342
01:28:00,815 --> 01:28:03,785
but as sure as eggs
is eggs, without us,

1343
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:05,385
it all goes tits up.

1344
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:16,396
Perhaps a conversation
with <i>le maître</i> is required.

1345
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,601
Perhaps.

1346
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,539
And tomorrow, you tell
Natasha how you feel.

1347
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:27,108
Oh, but Mademoiselle
Natasha has left Dior.

1348
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,544
She's leaving Paris.

1349
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:33,648
Like you, Mrs. Harris, she
wishes to follow her dream.

1350
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:40,463
Keep looking, love. She's
got to be here somewhere.

1351
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:42,089
She's gone. It's for the best.

1352
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:43,724
You're gonna get yourself

1353
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:46,527
a good clip round the ear
in a minute if you don't...

1354
01:28:46,561 --> 01:28:48,095
Hang on.

1355
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:50,463
Hang on a minute. I know.

1356
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,576
Here.

1357
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,646
Oh.

1358
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:07,648
Oh.

1359
01:29:07,682 --> 01:29:09,717
Oh. Madame Dior.

1360
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,985
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1361
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,721
Oh, well, not so bad yourself.

1362
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:17,658
Uh, we're looking for a girl.

1363
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:21,762
Um, she's... she's a bit upset.

1364
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:23,898
Um...

1365
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,779
The most intelligent, the most
adorable woman you've ever seen.

1366
01:29:26,901 --> 01:29:29,604
She's a Dior model.

1367
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,534
That one over there?

1368
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,442
- Oh, Natasha.
- Natasha.

1369
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,458
What happened?

1370
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:44,018
This life, it's-it's not for me.

1371
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:46,020
No, of course it isn't.

1372
01:29:46,053 --> 01:29:47,454
Stuck on a pedestal,

1373
01:29:47,487 --> 01:29:49,190
paraded around like
a beautiful doll.

1374
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,026
Anyone can see the
girl doesn't want it.

1375
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,461
Mrs. Harris is right.

1376
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:56,496
It's not who I am.

1377
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:59,499
As Sartre would say, y-you
find yourself conflicted

1378
01:29:59,533 --> 01:30:02,770
between <i>être-en-soi
et être-pour-soi.</i>

1379
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,907
Between "for itself"
and "in itself."

1380
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,576
<i>Être-en-soi</i> being those
aspects of human life

1381
01:30:08,609 --> 01:30:10,177
that involves consciousness,

1382
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:13,648
whereas physical facts
are <i>être-pour-soi.</i>

1383
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,453
Existentialists!

1384
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:17,652
In which case,

1385
01:30:17,685 --> 01:30:19,053
things would be
what they are not.

1386
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,688
<i>Exactement.</i>

1387
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:22,123
Things are what they are not,

1388
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:24,926
and they're not
what they're not.

1389
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:34,235
André, for God's
sake, just kiss her.

1390
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:36,871
Yes. For God's
sake, just kiss me.

1391
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:41,876
Hmm.

1392
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:52,698
Stay in Paris with me, Natasha.

1393
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,368
But I have already
told Monsieur Dior.

1394
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,620
You can still study philosophy.

1395
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,862
To make the invisible visible.

1396
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:05,700
You did not find love
in Paris, Madame Dior?

1397
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:08,602
- Oh, no. No.
- Oh.

1398
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:13,975
I thought it was
too late, but...

1399
01:31:15,543 --> 01:31:17,878
now I'm not so sure.

1400
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,672
- Hello, love.
- Hello, Ada.

1401
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:57,678
Oh. All right, all right.

1402
01:32:57,711 --> 01:32:59,013
Gordon Bennett.

1403
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,315
All right.

1404
01:33:01,348 --> 01:33:03,184
All right.

1405
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:04,685
Oh, hello, love. Come in.

1406
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,087
Oh, thank God you're back.

1407
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,388
Oh, well, not long.

1408
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,956
Do you want a cuppa?

1409
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,391
No time.

1410
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:12,726
- This is an emergency.
- Oh. Right.

1411
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,629
Okay, well, deep breath
and tell me what's up.

1412
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:18,966
I can't go, but if I don't...

1413
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:21,635
Oh, it's so important to make
a good impression, you know?

1414
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:23,871
I do. Who you trying to impress?

1415
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,840
Mr. Korngold, the producer.

1416
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,242
I'm to partner him to the
big dinner at the Café Royal.

1417
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,177
- Ooh.
- Everybody will be there.

1418
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:32,146
It's a priceless opportunity.

1419
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:33,848
But look.

1420
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:41,689
Oh, well, yeah, it's a
bit... it's a bit crumpled,

1421
01:33:41,722 --> 01:33:43,724
but we can steam that
out in a jiffy, love.

1422
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,893
- Don't you worry.
- No, look.

1423
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:47,094
Oh.

1424
01:33:47,995 --> 01:33:50,231
Oh, dear. Yeah, that's
not gonna come out

1425
01:33:50,264 --> 01:33:51,932
without a good, long soak.

1426
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,702
I'm not sure the
satin's gonna like that.

1427
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:55,903
Ain't you got another one?

1428
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,180
What about that
lovely blue dress?

1429
01:33:57,204 --> 01:33:59,240
- It's at the cleaner's.
- Oh.

1430
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:01,142
Oh, my God.

1431
01:34:01,175 --> 01:34:03,878
I'm going to die.

1432
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,880
All right. Come on,
now. That's enough.

1433
01:34:05,913 --> 01:34:08,382
Nobody wants to hear that.

1434
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,417
But you don't understand.

1435
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:13,220
Nearly all Mr. Korngold's
girls become stars.

1436
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:15,956
It's my chance to lift
myself out of the rut

1437
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:18,726
and be seen at last.

1438
01:34:18,759 --> 01:34:21,395
Well, being seen isn't
everything, love.

1439
01:34:21,428 --> 01:34:24,131
It is for me.

1440
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:39,813
Come on. Stand up.

1441
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:41,248
It's your lucky day.

1442
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,217
What?

1443
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,818
Why?

1444
01:34:45,452 --> 01:34:46,954
'Cause I think I can help you.

1445
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:48,455
You just said you couldn't.

1446
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:51,225
I can't do anything
if you don't get up.

1447
01:34:55,963 --> 01:34:56,931
Right.

1448
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:59,833
Take off your clothes.
You can borrow my dress.

1449
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,805
Don't be ridiculous.

1450
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:07,441
Just do as I say, and a
bit less of your nonsense.

1451
01:35:07,474 --> 01:35:09,743
Go on, behind the screen.

1452
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,087
Mrs. Harris?

1453
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:29,163
Oh.

1454
01:35:29,196 --> 01:35:31,432
You look lovely, ducks.

1455
01:35:31,465 --> 01:35:33,867
Just the ticket.

1456
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:36,837
How was your trip?
I should've asked.

1457
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,973
- Where did you go?
- Oh.

1458
01:35:39,006 --> 01:35:40,508
Paris. Yeah, it was...

1459
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:42,109
You said you'd
only be gone a day.

1460
01:35:42,142 --> 01:35:44,345
Everything went to
pieces without you.

1461
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:45,813
It was magical.

1462
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:48,449
I mean, you know how
tidy I am... normally.

1463
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:50,150
So romantic.

1464
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:52,486
Mrs. H.

1465
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,121
You dark horse.

1466
01:35:54,154 --> 01:35:56,123
Oh.

1467
01:35:57,559 --> 01:35:58,993
Oh, God. That's him.

1468
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:01,996
Oh. He knew where to come, then?

1469
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,266
I knew you'd rescue me, darling.

1470
01:36:05,299 --> 01:36:06,534
You're my fairy godmother.

1471
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,300
Hello.

1472
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,945
Miss Penrose?

1473
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,949
Oh.

1474
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:24,078
<i>Dear Mrs. H,</i>

1475
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:26,246
<i>Sorry about the dress,
but please don't worry.</i>

1476
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,414
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1477
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:32,920
<i>I was checking my
lipstick in the mirror</i>

1478
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:36,457
<i>when suddenly I
went up in flames.</i>

1479
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:44,431
<i>I might have burnt to a crisp</i>

1480
01:37:44,465 --> 01:37:47,368
<i>if a helpful friend
hadn't come to my rescue.</i>

1481
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:56,276
<i>Mr. Korngold says I should sue.</i>

1482
01:37:57,478 --> 01:37:59,313
<i>Gone to my mum's to recover.</i>

1483
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:58,365
Ada?

1484
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:00,100
You there?

1485
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,738
Yeah.

1486
01:40:03,771 --> 01:40:05,507
Sorry, Vi.

1487
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:15,650
You give up the ghost, woman?

1488
01:40:15,683 --> 01:40:18,252
You want to scare us to death?

1489
01:40:18,285 --> 01:40:20,254
Oh, all right, Archie?

1490
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:23,725
Uh, sorry about your door.

1491
01:40:23,758 --> 01:40:25,827
Uh, she was, um...

1492
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,095
Best intentions and all.

1493
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,801
I'll get some glass, yeah?

1494
01:40:33,835 --> 01:40:35,803
Fix it up good as new.

1495
01:40:35,837 --> 01:40:37,271
Thank you.

1496
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,787
Well, there's no
need to say a word.

1497
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,589
You're famous.

1498
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:58,125
At least the dress you gave up
everything to go and get is.

1499
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:01,261
Why you give it to
that no-good girl, eh?

1500
01:41:01,295 --> 01:41:04,666
You're too soft, and
that's the truth.

1501
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,068
It had to be seen.

1502
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:11,071
It's only right.

1503
01:41:12,472 --> 01:41:14,709
Oh, Vi.

1504
01:41:14,742 --> 01:41:17,277
I never got to wear it.

1505
01:41:17,912 --> 01:41:19,614
Not even once.

1506
01:41:20,615 --> 01:41:23,551
Oh, Ada, my darling.

1507
01:41:24,552 --> 01:41:27,454
I'm so sorry, eh?

1508
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,357
Hey.

1509
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,694
We don't need no fancy dresses.

1510
01:41:32,727 --> 01:41:37,197
We'll go shake our tail feather
down at the Legion Dance,

1511
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:40,100
and they'll all
be looking at us.

1512
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,371
Aw.

1513
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:51,613
Oh, morning, Mr. Newcombe.

1514
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:52,890
Enjoy your holiday, Mrs. Harris?

1515
01:41:52,914 --> 01:41:54,247
Very much, thank you.

1516
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,216
Missed your touch
about the place.

1517
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:57,885
Oh.

1518
01:41:57,919 --> 01:41:59,687
Are you quite all right?

1519
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:03,543
Not quite meself today.

1520
01:42:04,324 --> 01:42:06,360
Not sure who that is, even.

1521
01:42:06,393 --> 01:42:09,496
Bit of an existential crisis.

1522
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:12,634
Paris will do that to you.

1523
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,636
Chin up, Mrs. H.

1524
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:16,771
The revolution is coming.

1525
01:42:49,837 --> 01:42:51,471
Did you read about the girl

1526
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:53,875
who set fire to
herself in a Dior gown?

1527
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:57,679
Ghastly publicity
stunt, I suppose.

1528
01:42:57,712 --> 01:43:00,347
What a waste.

1529
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:08,723
Will you please accept
my notice, Lady Dant?

1530
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:12,994
I will require full and final
settlement of your account

1531
01:43:13,027 --> 01:43:14,729
by the end of the week.

1532
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:16,203
You can't leave me.

1533
01:43:17,474 --> 01:43:20,210
Them days are over when you
can treat people like scum

1534
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:21,781
and expect loyalty in return.

1535
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,070
Yeah. Good day, milady.

1536
01:43:27,688 --> 01:43:29,242
There you go.

1537
01:43:31,278 --> 01:43:33,715
Be right as rain in no time.

1538
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,819
Who's that, then?

1539
01:43:43,953 --> 01:43:45,249
Mrs. Ada Harris?

1540
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:47,742
- Sign here, please.
- Oh.

1541
01:43:53,568 --> 01:43:55,970
- Thank you.
- Just a mo'. There's more.

1542
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:57,538
More?

1543
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:04,779
Oh.

1544
01:44:05,646 --> 01:44:07,380
Are you sure? It's
not me birthday.

1545
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:09,070
You are Ada Harris?

1546
01:44:09,398 --> 01:44:11,438
Well, not sure
about that, either.

1547
01:45:00,001 --> 01:45:02,402
<i>Chère Madame Harris,</i>

1548
01:45:02,435 --> 01:45:05,740
<i>We hope your return journey
to London was pleasant,</i>

1549
01:45:05,773 --> 01:45:09,510
<i>but we were troubled by a photo
we saw in the social pages.</i>

1550
01:45:09,544 --> 01:45:11,946
<i>We knew immediately
that once again</i>

1551
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:14,582
<i>you had been too kind.</i>

1552
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,644
You've got it wrong! Stop!

1553
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:18,562
<i>It seems the rubbish king</i> It's
a mistake, I'm telling you!

1554
01:45:18,586 --> 01:45:21,421
<i>Was stealing from his workers.</i>

1555
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:23,406
Georges! Georges!

1556
01:45:23,431 --> 01:45:25,087
<i>Since his assets were seized,</i>

1557
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:27,435
<i>Madame Avallon failed to
attend her final fitting</i>

1558
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,864
<i>or settle the bill
for her dress.</i>

1559
01:45:30,865 --> 01:45:33,100
<i>We kept all your measurements,
of course,</i> Eighty-five.

1560
01:45:33,134 --> 01:45:36,149
<i>And were quickly able
to alter it for you.</i>

1561
01:45:36,469 --> 01:45:39,025
<i>If it needs any
final adjustments,</i>

1562
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:41,352
<i>we know you have the skill
to do these yourself.</i>

1563
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:46,523
<i>We all agreed it was</i> Office of
Christian Dior. I'm listening.

1564
01:45:46,547 --> 01:45:48,115
<i>The least we could do.</i>

1565
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:51,384
<i>The publicity has resulted in
a great increase in orders.</i>

1566
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:58,394
Could you wrap these up please?

1567
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:01,494
<i>You will no doubt
recognize these blooms</i>

1568
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:03,898
<i>as Princess Margaret's Delight.</i>

1569
01:46:03,931 --> 01:46:05,800
<i>We hope you enjoy the flowers</i>

1570
01:46:05,833 --> 01:46:08,401
<i>and that you will
keep your new dress</i>

1571
01:46:08,435 --> 01:46:10,771
<i>well away from naked flames.</i>

1572
01:46:23,651 --> 01:46:26,153
<i>We send it to you
with all our love</i>

1573
01:46:26,187 --> 01:46:28,623
<i>and our very warmest thanks.</i>

1574
01:46:31,525 --> 01:46:33,160
<i>From Christian</i>

1575
01:46:33,194 --> 01:46:35,696
<i>and all your friends
at the House of Dior.</i>

1576
01:47:04,258 --> 01:47:06,560
Lovely. Thank you.

1577
01:47:16,971 --> 01:47:18,205
G-Good to see you.

1578
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:19,840
- See you later.
- All right.

1579
01:47:23,844 --> 01:47:25,146
There you go, love.

1580
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:26,814
Get that down you.

1581
01:47:26,847 --> 01:47:28,816
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1582
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:15,896
Thank you, Vi.

1583
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:18,132
Oh, Ada.

1584
01:48:21,635 --> 01:48:23,070
You all right, Archie?

1585
01:48:23,104 --> 01:48:24,905
Never better.

1586
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:26,173
S-Sorry.

1587
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:28,075
I just...

1588
01:48:28,109 --> 01:48:29,677
What?

1589
01:48:30,978 --> 01:48:32,913
You seem different.

1590
01:48:34,315 --> 01:48:36,784
Well, it's haute
couture, you know?

1591
01:48:36,817 --> 01:48:37,785
Is it, now?

1592
01:48:37,818 --> 01:48:39,720
Know what?

1593
01:48:39,754 --> 01:48:41,889
It's not the frock. I
mean, it's lovely and all,

1594
01:48:41,922 --> 01:48:43,557
but, uh...

1595
01:48:43,591 --> 01:48:45,760
no, it's you.

1596
01:48:45,793 --> 01:48:47,294
You...

1597
01:48:47,328 --> 01:48:49,530
You're just beautiful.

1598
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,135
Thank you, Archie.

1599
01:48:55,102 --> 01:48:56,637
That's very nice of you.

1600
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:59,140
No, I mean, you've
always been beautiful.

1601
01:48:59,173 --> 01:49:00,641
Inside and out.

1602
01:49:00,674 --> 01:49:02,877
Just, there's something...

1603
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:05,913
I don't know, like, a
new spark or something.

1604
01:49:07,281 --> 01:49:08,649
A <i>je ne sais quoi?</i>

1605
01:49:08,682 --> 01:49:10,818
That'll be the fella.

1606
01:49:14,388 --> 01:49:16,857
I owe you a dance, don't I?

1607
01:49:17,691 --> 01:49:19,627
I think you do.

1608
01:49:21,195 --> 01:49:22,730
I'd like to claim that dance

1609
01:49:22,763 --> 01:49:24,665
with the loveliest
girl in the room.

1610
01:49:26,133 --> 01:49:27,835
It's your lucky day.

1611
01:49:30,771 --> 01:49:32,173
Oh.

1612
01:49:32,206 --> 01:49:33,974
All right.

1613
01:49:55,162 --> 01:49:57,832
There is hope for us all.

1613
01:49:58,305 --> 01:50:58,500
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
