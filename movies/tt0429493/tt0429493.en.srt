2
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,893
Only a hardheaded gringo...
Would come down here...

3
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,104
On a rescue mission...
ALL ALONE

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,982
This gringo is not going to talk.

5
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,609
Then kill him.

6
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,695
C'mon, the General's expecting us.

7
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,575
You can't use your gun...

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,870
...Shoot
him with his.

9
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,341
lt's not working.

10
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,310
This asshole's gun has
no firing pin.

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,230
Leave him.

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,193
The dogs haven't had to
kill for their food in a while.

13
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,906
Next time, amigo,

14
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,159
plan ahead.

15
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,998
Oh, l'm such a bad Catholic.

16
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,251
No, you're just sick in the head.

17
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,546
Don't forget the General's money.

18
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,674
That gringo bribed the wrong cop...

19
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,596
...and brought a gun
with no firing pin.

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,093
Catch me if you can
I'm in 'em old school Barkley's

21
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,638
Back to the fence
puffin' on that Bob Marley

22
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,389
Flow like oregano

23
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,559
You already know my competition's
stiffer than Ronald Regan

24
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,852
Let it go

25
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,646
For you be a mother...

26
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,066
You scrap it's too animated
like The lncredibles

27
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,901
Let this beef go around like the tenty six's

28
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,070
lt's young Game of flame

29
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,447
Welcome to the House of Pain

30
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,078
Where's my girl, fool?

31
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,538
She cool, man. She in there.
She's still fine as hell.

32
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,374
So that's it?
Bada-bing, you out of the game?

33
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
Done with the whole trade?

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,335
- Yeah.
- Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

35
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,711
You either keep doing that,

36
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,588
or you do a 15-year bid
in a Mexican prison

37
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,632
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

38
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,969
Same old shit. You choose
how to flush the toilet, brother.

39
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,762
That's right. Easy way or the hard way.

40
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,829
Come on!

41
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,669
Okay, street soldier. Shit.

42
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,214
But watch yourself, B.A., now,
you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

43
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,056
What's up, girl? You miss me?

44
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,394
Because l missed you. Yes, l did.
lt's been too long, baby.

45
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,312
Way too long.

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,988
Heck of a place.

47
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,906
Just a heck of a beautiful place.

48
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,743
ls this a time-share?
I'd love to get in on this.

49
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,038
l like this whole Santa Fe motif
you got going here, Tuco.

50
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,583
lt's very Arizona, very Tex-Mex.
lt's good. lt's good.

51
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,126
Maybe we can get the guy at my six

52
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,462
to whip up a couple of quesadiches,
you know?

53
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,761
l want the flames to be seen
by the Martians.

54
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,347
Americano, gringo.

55
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,808
- Army lntelligence.
- Who's that?

56
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,351
- You, man.
- No.

57
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,729
You're not so intelligent
because you're stuck in some tires.

58
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,272
l'm happy. l'm happy.

59
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,108
Doesn't get any better than this, right?

60
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,777
- l'm living the dream.
- You are!

61
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,405
You're gonna come here...

62
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,576
...to throw me in a bag across the border...

63
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,787
...but instead you have sex with my wife.

64
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,747
Well, first of all, she's so hot,

65
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,875
and we both hate you.
So that's just sort of how it...

66
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,129
- Good morning!
- Good morning, man!

67
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,923
Now it's a party!

68
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,426
- ls that your best shot?
- Now it's a party, man!

69
00:06:50,118 --> 00:07:00,335
A- ha, okay, what's up?
Shut up

70
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,837
Whoa!

71
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,258
Okay, what's up? Shut up

72
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,346
l got a pocket full of B's
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go...

73
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,516
Oh, hell, no.

74
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,643
Slide over slowly.

75
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,603
You jacking me?

76
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,730
What is this, opposite day?

77
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,860
l'm not a thief. But if l don't reach
my friend in time, then he dies.

78
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,655
If you ain't a thief,
l guarantee you ain't a killer.

79
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,869
Take your left hand off the wheel
and your right hand off the shifter now.

80
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,371
You ain't gonna
shoot me in the head, pops.

81
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,082
You know that ain't happening.

82
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,044
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

83
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,504
You shoot a total stranger?

84
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,506
l don't even know you, fool. Damn.

85
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,300
It'll heal, l promise.

86
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,468
- Here, wrap it in this.
- l know how to make a tourniquet, fool.

87
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,179
l know it hurts,
but l had to make a point with you.

88
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,722
That ain't what's pissing me off.

89
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,682
You shooting my van
is what's pissing me off, man.

90
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,350
What's wrong with you?

91
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,190
You Army Ranger, son?

92
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,860
Be real careful
of what you say next, pops.

93
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,654
And be ready to empty that burner
if you start shit-talking my battalion.

94
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,575
Never shall l fail my comrades.

95
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,954
Gallantly will l show the world
that l am a specially selected soldier.

96
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,958
Energetically will l meet
the enemies of my country.

97
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,379
l shall defeat them on the field of battle

98
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
for l am better trained.

99
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,385
And l will fight with all my might.

100
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,229
Colonel Hannibal Smith.
75th Ranger Regiment.

101
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,023
4th Battalion. Fort Benning, Georgia.

102
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,485
l know who you are, sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

103
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,863
l mean, it was till l was dishonorably
discharged for some bullshit.

104
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,202
l don't subscribe to coincidence, Corporal.

105
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,205
l believe that, no matter how random
things might appear,

106
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,414
there's still a plan.

107
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,878
We fed him to the dogs.

108
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,257
That here in the middle
of the Mexican desert,

109
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,092
when l needed him most,

110
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,969
I'd find a fellow Ranger.

111
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,973
Boy.

112
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,975
Now, l need your help to save another.

113
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,270
Bad news for you today!

114
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,940
This rescue that's coming,
we fed him to the Rottweilers

115
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,108
- about an hour ago.
- You know what's funny?

116
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,902
ls that you actually believe
that you got me.

117
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,821
You actually think
you're gonna kill me.

118
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,155
Can you drive?

119
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,491
Better than anybody you've ever seen, sir.

120
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,579
Nobody knew where you were hiding...

121
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,708
There was no intel...until now, asshole.

122
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,627
In a few minutes
l'm gonna be having a cold beer,

123
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,506
and you are gonna be on fire.
Take care, my friend.

124
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,885
- Alpha, Mike...
- No!

125
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,638
...Foxtrot.

126
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,600
Think about it.

127
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,399
Adiós, mother...

128
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,999
Hannibal!

129
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,794
What are you doing?

130
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,218
Get in!

131
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,721
B.A., move.

132
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,403
This is bullshit!

133
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,908
Ahora, muerto!

134
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,411
Stop it! Please stop!

135
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,206
Please stop! Stop it! Stop! Please stop!

136
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,088
How's your day going?

137
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,840
This is not going to taste good.

138
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,769
Baby, l just threw up.

139
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,397
Let me get some gum.
Let me just get some gum.

140
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,774
Did you see that?
Did you see Tuco's face?

141
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,943
When you came over,
that was unbelievable!

142
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,528
- How many times did l say it?
- The timing was perfect.

143
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,197
- How many times did l say it, Face?
- lt was so beautiful.

144
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,574
- l told you not to take down Tuco alone.
- What?

145
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,159
Well, you...

146
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,786
You know what? l'm sorry.

147
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,873
l'm sorry l didn't have
the Hannibal Smith How-to Manual.

148
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,876
- Okay? l had to move.
- And that move snowballs, Face.

149
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,837
You almost got yourself killed.

150
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,172
Which almost got me killed
and almost got him killed.

151
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,633
Five-year-old.

152
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,720
You look like you got a real bad attitude.

153
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,222
What?

154
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,974
Did l shoot up your van?

155
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,060
Am l wearing your favorite shirt?

156
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,186
This is your favorite shirt?

157
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,814
Yeah, pretty boy, that's my favorite shirt.

158
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,191
Did you get shot for me, too?

159
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,735
- And carjacked.
- By me.

160
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,574
Wait,
and he still got you to drive?

161
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,292
Thank you. Peck.

162
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,669
Baracus. lt's all good.

163
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,714
See, Face, this is what happens
when we forget about plans

164
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,215
and just fire blind.

165
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
l'm sorry.

166
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,344
l'm so sorry that
l have feelings for a human being,

167
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,263
- that l fell in love.
- Love?

168
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,975
Wait a minute. What about Miss Croatia
three weeks ago?

169
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,521
Rescue sex.

170
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,733
l was just trying to save her.

171
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,942
- Save her?
- Yeah.

172
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,110
Save her? How?

173
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,489
Please, do share with us
your plan, Face.

174
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,700
Okay, l hadn't thought about that yet.

175
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,494
Exactly. l had to.

176
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,121
Her plane ticket.

177
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,874
Her work visa and her new passport.

178
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,293
And don't bullshit me
that this was about her, Face.

179
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,462
This was all about Tuco.

180
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,380
Do you have a mag?

181
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,078
- Mike.
- Boss man. How the hell are you?

182
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,038
- Still chewing the same dirt?
- l am, unfortunately.

183
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,831
- And out here in lovely Mexico.
- Good.

184
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,293
- So what have you got for me?
- l got a fast bird doing pizza runs.

185
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,629
- The call sign is "Hatchet."
- Hatchet. Okay.

186
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,673
And that is whatever you want it to be.

187
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,799
This is yours.

188
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,552
General, may l remind you,
they don't take to the gringos.

189
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,011
l owe you one, okay?

190
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,514
- Let's not wait till Bragg again, huh?
- Three years.

191
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,435
And the kid. Still you and the chicks.
- B.A. What?

192
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,063
How am l gonna just leave my girl
like this, after all that?

193
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,481
l had to fight to get her back.

194
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,567
Leave the keys
and we'll come back for her. Come on.

195
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,111
Looking shabby.

196
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,532
- What is the deal, brother?
- Shoot anything that moves, okay?

197
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,659
- This is worse than Colombia.
- l know Tuco, man.

198
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,287
Don't worry about it.
I'll take her to war college in Saint Tropez.

199
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,913
I'll get you all their numbers,
so don't worry about it.

200
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,208
- Face, look after the Corporal.
- Yeah. Okay.

201
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,377
And you're covered in gas,
which l think is interesting.

202
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,559
Find a treatment room, Corporal.

203
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,020
Make it quick. l'm gonna find our pilot.

204
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
Hey.

205
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,992
Hey, Doc, you got a second
for a wounded vet?

206
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,872
Highly decorated combat pilot.

207
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,541
You ask him,
he thinks he's the best in the world.

208
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,627
But he's a functioning lunatic.

209
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,128
Last week he tried to escape
by jump-starting an ambulance.

210
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,006
Clear.

211
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,507
Damn it!

212
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,259
My kind of guy.

213
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,348
lt almost hit your tattoo there.

214
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,932
Has anyone seen Mr. Murdock?

215
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,769
- The old Ranger tat.
- Mr. Murdock?

216
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,481
Would you think l was crazy
if l told you l had one of these?

217
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,524
Something wrong with your eyes, man.

218
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,194
- Mr. Murdock?
- Not while l'm operating, nurse.

219
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,071
- Not now.
- Why are you off the ward?

220
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,448
ls that gas? ls that you?

221
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,617
- l smell gas.
- What do you mean, "ward"?

222
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,035
- What ward?
- This man is a patient here.

223
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,912
ls this you?
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

224
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,124
Honestly, l'm a practicing doctor
at Johns Hopkins University.

225
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,752
- Did you ask him to do a lightning bolt?
- l asked for no lightning bolt.

226
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,837
- l'm calling security.
- What's wrong with this fool?

227
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,381
- ls he crazy?
- lt is you.

228
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,091
- You on fire, man.
- What? What's that?

229
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,801
- What the...
- Oh, Jesus!

230
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,178
- You Rangers. l like you!
- Are you crazy?

231
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,646
Hey! Hey, come on!

232
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,483
Corporal, off. Back off!

233
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,068
This is a hospital.

234
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,279
- Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
- Met him?

235
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,823
He lit my arm on fire.

236
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,075
He stitched a lightning bolt in mine, man.

237
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,160
Look at me, son.

238
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,747
l'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

239
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,998
The best, sir.

240
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
l'm not getting on a chopper
with this nut job.

241
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,585
Yeah, that's a good...
ls he another one of your projects?

242
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,755
l'm a real soldier. l'm a Ranger, baby.

243
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,549
l'm worried!

244
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,926
l'm a Ranger, sir.

245
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,678
That's good enough for me.

246
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,138
You have been released into our care

247
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,181
- and reinstated, Captain.
- l'm not even close to good with that.

248
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,766
Thank you, sir.

249
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,476
Let's get the hell out of here.

250
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,198
You gorgeous old rust bucket, you.

251
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,658
Did you miss your daddy?

252
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,828
Face, what's the most important part
of a well-oiled plan?

253
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,204
To be one step ahead of the enemy,

254
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,124
- not to be running away from him.
- Who says we're running?

255
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,959
What, we're going to go in this dinosaur

256
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,252
- with this freak show?
- Yep.

257
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,881
You spin me right round, baby
Right round

258
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,800
- Rotors are good, sir.
- Who is this guy?

259
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,016
Come on! Let's go!

260
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,476
We've got gringos to kill!

261
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,186
Murdock, get this thing in the air.

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,729
Hold on, boys!

263
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,981
l'm gonna try something
l saw in a cartoon once.

264
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,484
What you talking about cartoons for?
Get us the hell out of here!

265
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,194
We got a hot chopper to your six.

266
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,740
l'm blocking bullets.
We're bulletproof.

267
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,492
We're bulletproof, boys!

268
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,160
Oh, heads up.

269
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,837
l see you, gringo!

270
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,715
You pancaked my van!
l'm gonna kill you, fool!

271
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,884
You can't park there.
That's a handicap zone.

272
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,386
- l knew you was crazy! l knew...
- This is a mistake.

273
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,230
Fire! Fire! Fire!

274
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,404
Blow them out of the sky.

275
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,911
I've never tried this before!

276
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,789
Did you see that?

277
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,041
Did you see
how he turned the helicopter?

278
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,130
Whoa! There's nothing like some good
air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

279
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,674
Don't look at me! Look there!

280
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,469
He's only got heat seekers left.

281
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,720
Captain, get us out of here.

282
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,014
Hold on, this could get ugly!

283
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,600
Here we go! Come on, baby, climb!

284
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,318
Fire the missiles.

285
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,780
Whoa! Missiles! Come on, come on.

286
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,950
That's how we deal
with heat seekers, chaps.

287
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,994
We go cold.

288
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,541
What the hell?

289
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,001
Face, get him in here!

290
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,087
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

291
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,964
Got him!

292
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,340
Restart. Restart.

293
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,763
Close the door!

294
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,433
l know you're Airborne Rangers,
but that was ridiculous!

295
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,936
You're gonna be okay.

296
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,899
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco,
not the other way around!

297
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,777
One step ahead of the game
isn't a plan, kid.

298
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,156
Two to three steps ahead.

299
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,825
Beating an enemy's move
before it's even made.

300
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,660
That's a plan.

301
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,580
Hatchet, Hatchet, lock on my LC.

302
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,291
General Tuco, you are currently engaged

303
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,919
in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.

304
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,464
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You engaged me.

305
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,007
Repeat.

306
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,428
You are engaged in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.

307
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,642
Over United States air space.

308
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,228
- What?
- Alpha, Mike...

309
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,148
- Foxtrot!
- ...Foxtrot!

310
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,903
- In other words, Adiós, mother...
- Oh, no.

311
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah!

312
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,913
Well done, Captain.

313
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,790
- That was awesome.
- That wasn't awesome.

314
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,459
- You are a genius!
- l'm never flying again in this thing!

315
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,252
l never should have doubted you, boss!

316
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,922
There's a plan in everything, kid.

317
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,550
And l love it when a plan comes together.

318
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,330
Gunpowder cooking.
Nothing like it.

319
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,460
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

320
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,962
Nuke it.

321
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,548
- Nuke it!
- Mmm-hmm.

322
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,137
Murdock, burn the hell out of it,

323
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,306
like it was damned.

324
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,475
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

325
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,983
You want secret sauce?
- No, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

326
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,819
The secret's out. You crazy.
Everybody knows.

327
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,780
No one can do an anti-freeze
marinade like you can, Murdock.

328
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,992
But l got a little Bell's palsy
last time l ate that.

329
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,494
lt's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

330
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,288
Yes, sir.
l'm having that conversation right now.

331
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,248
We will enforce that.
I've got it well in hand, sir.

332
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,752
l don't think you want me to be
in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

333
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,337
Visitors.

334
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,345
Yeah.

335
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,686
Wow, l'm a little taken aback.
l'm not gonna lie.

336
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,646
Lieutenant.

337
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,648
Oh, l'm sorry, am l supposed
to call you Lieutenant back?

338
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,275
No, you're supposed to call me Captain.

339
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,235
Captain. Captain?

340
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,779
That's right.

341
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,573
Captain Crunch. Look at you. Wow.

342
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,452
So, l guess you said no to the kids,
no to the family.

343
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,329
Just no ladder you can't climb, huh?

344
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,332
No, no, honey, l just said no to you.

345
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,211
Hello. My name's Percy.

346
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,671
Would you like some pork?

347
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,216
If l broke every bone in your hand,
could you still do that?

348
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,135
This is crazy. Three years?

349
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,179
We haven't seen each other
for three years,

350
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,389
this is what we're gonna talk about?

351
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,394
What would you like to discuss?

352
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,191
Did you take my Steely Dan CD?

353
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,026
l'm not even going to respond to that.

354
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,195
We listened to it,
like, nine times in a row.

355
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,490
We were drinking that crappy cabernet.
You remember that?

356
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,493
We were doing something else.
What were we doing?

357
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,579
Do you remember what it was
we were doing? lt was in a bedroom.

358
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,997
You don't remember?

359
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,583
The only thing l remember is leaving.

360
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,546
Which is my fondest memory of you.

361
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,679
You guys are the best.
Stay out of trouble, you hear me?

362
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,266
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

363
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,769
Keep that on.

364
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,906
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
l'm with Central lntelligence.

365
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,119
l knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

366
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,621
Yeah, l come from a long line of Lynches.

367
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,667
You ever stop to consider that maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

368
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,878
is because nobody knows your real names?

369
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,172
What can l do for you, Mr. Lynch?

370
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,675
l need you to help me to stop
Saddam's former flunkies

371
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,428
from stealing over a billion dollars
in the next 30 hours.

372
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,724
Now, the only mint outside of the U.S.
capable of printing our money

373
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,225
belonged to the Shah of Iran.

374
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,311
During the Iran-Iraq War, it went missing.

375
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,062
Rumor was, Saddam had stolen it.

376
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,064
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

377
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,442
Well, you didn't get the engraving plates.

378
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,111
lt didn't matter.

379
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:52,489
They would have had to rebuild a mint
just to print those bills.

380
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,074
Well, sir,

381
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,077
it's happening as we speak.

382
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,126
Fedayeen thugs have seized
what's left of the Iraqi National Mint

383
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,504
to run off billions of dollars
in unbacked American currency.

384
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,132
How are they planning on
moving the plates and a billion dollars

385
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,468
- out of Baghdad?
- Armored convoy,

386
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,095
manned with former Iraqi spec ops.

387
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,432
You know, high speed, shoot-to-kill types.

388
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,809
So how do you plan on stopping them?

389
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,568
Listen, there's some rumors
about some top-secret plates

390
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,196
being smuggled out of the city
by Saddam loyalists.

391
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,281
Do you know anything about this?

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,326
Seriously, if you're going to make
a play for these plates,

393
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,119
l'm waving you off right now.

394
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:41,664
'Cause it's my responsibility
and it's my ass.

395
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,499
l'm serious.

396
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,376
- Face?
- Mmm-hmm.

397
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,127
l will court-martial you.

398
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,380
- Whoo! Okay.
- Hey.

399
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,924
Get the memo.

400
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:56,345
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith
and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

401
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,930
You know,

402
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,475
you never came back.
l thought you were gonna come back.

403
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,852
Well, this is me, coming back.

404
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,029
You think those clowns
can really pull this off?

405
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,156
Listen, listen, l would never tell him this,

406
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,326
but they are the best clandestine unit
in the four branches,

407
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,495
and they specialize in the ridiculous.

408
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:23,914
Shadow Peck and the rest of them.

409
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,042
- Do not let them out of your sight.
- Yes, ma'am.

410
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,006
- Doesn't diablo mean "devil"?
- Yeah, man.

411
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,510
God damn it, Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

412
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,762
If this were my operation
and you wanted it,

413
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,974
- you would have the mission.
- You let Black Forest deploy on this,

414
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,184
and it's an international incident,
l promise you.

415
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
They're not soldiers.

416
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,772
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

417
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,525
- Who's running the ground team?
- Brock Pike.

418
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,070
Pike.

419
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,824
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character.
Come on.

420
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,870
Hannibal, we have been ordered,
ordered, mind you,

421
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,705
to stay out of Baghdad.

422
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,499
- Cut, dried, the end.
- General,

423
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,794
we should find him
a little wiggle room, don't you think?

424
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:15,049
You know, l knew another Lynch,
a CIA stooge.

425
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,051
Stationed in Laos, '68.

426
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
- No relation.
- Are you sure?

427
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,930
'Cause you remind me of him.

428
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,185
l'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

429
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,314
I'll be back here in 48.
l'm assuming we're green and go.

430
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,232
Notify me otherwise.

431
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,943
He's wearing body armor in the HQ.

432
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,239
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

433
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,921
Russ, let's do some good
on the way out the door here.

434
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,966
Those plates are gonna do
all kinds of damage.

435
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,510
Let me go get them.

436
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,638
Forget about it, Hannibal.
Steer clear of this one.

437
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,097
Well clear of it.

438
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,976
This is a gauntlet run
right through the heart of Sadr City.

439
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,023
Saddam Hussein
was a certifiable madman,

440
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,192
but even he wasn't crazy enough

441
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,445
to go into that place
more than once in 30 years.

442
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,532
We pulled out of there a week ago
and already it's the Wild West.

443
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,659
You actually sound worried.

444
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,496
- And you actually seem offended.
- Yeah.

445
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,665
Well, this isn't about
you losing a step now.

446
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,083
l want you to know that.

447
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,710
- Hey.
- Hey.

448
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,088
l'm 10 times the man l was
when you met me.

449
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,048
- Uh-huh.
- And twice as fast.

450
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,967
Russ,

451
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,637
the boys and l can get this done,
minus the bloodshed.

452
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,181
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

453
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,641
Don't make me beg.

454
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,560
I'd hate to see you beg, Hannibal.

455
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,065
You've been my friend for a long time.

456
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,651
More importantly,

457
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,612
you and those boys have possibly been

458
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,117
the most valuable military asset
l have ever had at my disposal.

459
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,912
Now, you asked me not to make you beg.

460
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,749
Right now, l'm begging you.

461
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,086
Hannibal, please, let this one go.

462
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:21,133
Russ, this is too big an enterprise.
We can't let these bozos do this.

463
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,843
lt's way too big.

464
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,430
And you'd do it
with or without my blessing?

465
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,515
No, that l wouldn't.

466
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,517
l need your blessing.

467
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,399
l'm not so sure that it is a blessing.

468
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,695
Good hunting, my friend.

469
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Thank you.

470
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,578
How'd it go with the old man?

471
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,205
Same old, same old. What you got there?

472
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,999
Pictures of my new baby.

473
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,752
Oh, look at her.
Who's a proud papa?

474
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,796
These pictures are the closest
Murdock gets to that van.

475
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,507
lt's ready for me when l go back to LA.

476
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,929
Listen, B.A.,
we're extending our stay a little bit.

477
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,430
We're going back into Baghdad.

478
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:10,515
l thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad.

479
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,267
- That's true, but l'm...
- Smith.

480
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,146
- Pike.
- l understand you and your grunts

481
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,440
are now stealing my gigs. l don't like that.

482
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:21,693
l figured you Black Forest guys
would be busy

483
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,947
installing a dictatorship
or overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

484
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,744
lt's still the weekend, yet.
That's nine-to-five stuff, pops.

485
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,163
Look at you clowns.

486
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,706
You're not soldiers.

487
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,084
You're assassins in polo shirts.

488
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,965
We'll make in a week
what you guys make in a year.

489
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,758
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

490
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,469
or brains.

491
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,680
And you're short on both.

492
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,102
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

493
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,565
They make you wear
the yellow shirt there, B.A.?

494
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,776
What's that stand for, "Barely Able"?

495
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,740
Get out of my way, punk.

496
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,827
Hey, don't sweat them.

497
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,955
They might have just done us a favor.
A big one.

498
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,708
Let me see, we got one medium tank left.

499
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,960
l'm telling you,
there's a reason she came back.

500
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,379
Face, l told you, forget about her.

501
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,880
The levels of ambition on this woman...

502
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,882
l ain't stepping foot
in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

503
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,094
No gliders, paper planes, ultra-lights.

504
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,096
- You ever gonna let me live that down?
- No.

505
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,224
Mexico was a long time ago,
and l saved your life.

506
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,393
How about thanking me
for not whooping your ass at the hospital?

507
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,978
l was an Airborne Ranger until l met you.

508
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,604
And you chickened out just like...

509
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,107
-263 jumps.
- Just a thank-you would have been nice.

510
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,276
And one helicopter ride with you
screws it up.

511
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,404
Airborne Ranger with a fear of flying.
Like a punk!

512
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,365
B.A., for the last time,
nobody leaves the truck

513
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,535
once we take it over. Okay?

514
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,956
My cousin takes me to this party
where this amazing cover band

515
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,918
does this trash metal version of Hello
by Lionel Richie.

516
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah. lt goes...

517
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,590
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

518
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,258
Guys, how long have they been in there?

519
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,343
- About three hours.
- Three hours.

520
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,429
Three hours?

521
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,265
They've been in there for three hours?
They haven't come out at all?

522
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:16,725
No one came out to take a leak, nothing?

523
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,310
- No.
- Nope.

524
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,109
I've been here for three seconds
and that sounds odd to me.

525
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,028
I've been watching that tent like a hawk.

526
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,198
Really? lt looks like you're eating
some risotto and sitting on your ass.

527
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,616
l don't know. l wanted the soup.

528
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,952
- l wasn't eating risotto. l had...
- lt's not risotto.

529
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,544
Yeah, boys.

530
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,636
Yeah, he wants to fight, doesn't he?

531
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,808
Damn, this is awesome.
They got us a stripper, too.

532
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,727
You got that hot enlisted look. Me likey.

533
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:05,565
Before l throw you in the stockade,
where are they?

534
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,193
They didn't tell us... Captain.

535
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,155
They just gave us a case of beer
and 50 bucks apiece.

536
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,865
l got a hundred.

537
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,659
Oh, did you get a hundred?

538
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,667
You think we get to keep the hair?

539
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,586
Staging, movement, action plan.

540
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,588
There's a nice read for you.

541
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,802
Hell, yeah, Hannibal.
This is it right here.

542
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,888
This is bat-shit insane.

543
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,268
- lt's perfect.
- This is beyond nuts, boss.

544
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,567
lt gets better.

545
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,696
B.A., you'll need a piece
of contoured metal to make a skid plate.

546
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,822
Let's go, fool.

547
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,449
Murdock,
we'll need a car battery, too.

548
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,162
See if the boys at Black Forest
can help us out.

549
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,872
Press credentials, we need them.

550
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,457
Hit the media tent
and see what's lying around.

551
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,751
Sorry, my friend, l see you've put

552
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,587
the South African microphone
at the bottom.

553
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,797
You can't always put the CNN on top.

554
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,091
Private, there are two mics.
l don't know if there is something...

555
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,680
l was a moving man in my younger days

556
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:21,057
Murdock,
we need a news camera.

557
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,642
See what you can do.

558
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,647
All right, sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

559
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,317
Hello. l'm...

560
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,319
l'm in love with you.

561
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,945
Listen, we're doing a preliminary poll of...

562
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,323
What are we talking about?
Of the pull-out.

563
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,327
We're gonna need airbags,
lots of them.

564
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,746
- What bureau are you with, darling?
- Le Monde.

565
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,247
Are you French?

566
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,880
Hello, this is General Parker. l need...

567
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,048
Okay. lt's for you.

568
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,800
Hey, fool, you need to call
an air strike on yourself.

569
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,430
- We're good, mate. I'll meet you.
- No, l think we need to get going now.

570
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,683
You need to understand
what l'm telling you right now.

571
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,269
B.A.,
we're gonna need a magnet.

572
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,355
- Yeah!
- A powerful one.

573
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,693
You ever seen Blue Man Group?

574
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,197
I'll pick up the rest.

575
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,042
l'm just gonna go for it.

576
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,297
Ooh, la, la.

577
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,050
What would you give for one chance

578
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,720
to come back here and tell our enemies

579
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,390
that they may take our lives,

580
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,560
but they'll never take our freedom!

581
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,569
Ready to go downtown?

582
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,905
Good luck tomorrow.

583
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,324
- Thank you.
- Give 'em hell.

584
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,750
General Morrison,
where the hell is Hannibal Smith?

585
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,841
Captain, you would do well
to revise your tone and readdress me.

586
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,594
General, l have authority under DClS
that supersedes your command,

587
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,724
so last time, before this becomes
embarrassing for the both of us,

588
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,394
where is Hannibal Smith?

589
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,274
Would you excuse us, General?

590
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,367
Captain, in nearly 40 years
of being in this army,

591
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:46,786
l have learned to control my temper

592
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:51,207
and my voice when in the presence
of a subordinate officer

593
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,295
who, for at least the time being,
seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

594
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,298
Now, it is my understanding

595
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,300
that you have a question for me.
ls that correct?

596
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,885
You are correct, sir.

597
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:06,139
Then when you are prepared to
remember that you are still an officer

598
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,893
in the United States Army,
in spite of your civilian attire,

599
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,897
and are ready to present that question
in a military fashion,

600
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,107
then perhaps we could get somewhere
with this discussion.

601
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,236
If you have sent an Alpha Team into
Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

602
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,615
that is a direct violation of a DoD order.

603
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,368
Well, and as much as you have
this kind of knowledge,

604
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:30,955
l can't help wondering why it is that
you need to ask anything of me.

605
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,877
l will take that as your confirmation, sir.

606
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,053
They go mobile in three hours.

607
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,932
The plates and over a billion dollars

608
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,685
will be loaded into the back of a semi
at the mint.

609
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:57,315
They're overland for exactly
4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

610
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,739
That's our window, and it closes fast.

611
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,538
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

612
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,713
Face, your point of entry
is under the hotel.

613
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:25,051
It'll be packed with foreign press
and private security.

614
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,781
B.A., you're in this alleyway
on a stopwatch.

615
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,367
Make sure the bike has V-tins or better.

616
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:51,744
l got something
a whole lot better than that.

617
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,248
- Bam!
- What about me, boss man?

618
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,752
l had a little
helicopter here someplace.

619
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,798
You got some barrel rolls?
Some mid-air stalls?

620
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:08,178
l'm looking for my next
near-death experience.

621
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,180
Only air support this time,
Captain,

622
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,682
but I'll get you in on the next one.
l promise.

623
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:17,270
B.A., l need you
to pop that clutch at 0630.

624
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,608
ls that me?

625
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,320
Oh, no, l forgot. l'm in an Iraqi sewer.
Thanks, boss!

626
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,285
Timing is everything, Face.

627
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,456
This is all about the bull's-eyes.

628
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,172
Why not?

629
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,553
From under the semi, you'll
take out the truck directly behind you.

630
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,356
Huh?

631
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,777
Now, these guys
are gonna be onto you, Face.

632
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,612
B.A., that's your cue for throttle.

633
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,740
Be sure to look both ways
before crossing.

634
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,825
And have a nice full tank of gas.

635
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,839
You'll have
multiple hostiles on board, B.A.

636
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,427
Escort them from the premises.

637
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:53,741
If any stragglers sneak up behind,
don't worry, l got your back.

638
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,672
Gotcha, kid.

639
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,924
Attaboy.

640
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,430
That's all fine in theory, but l still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

641
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,514
l do.

642
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:18,558
B.A. ! Hang a right!

643
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,893
All right! Hang on!

644
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,401
Watch out! Watch out!
- Heads down!

645
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,821
Oh! Nice one, B.A. !

646
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,159
Face, get the airbags!

647
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:39,620
Gotta make sure
this thing stays locked for later!

648
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,247
Beautiful!

649
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,083
One, two, three.

650
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,425
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy
on impact, right?

651
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,095
B.A., get in the container.

652
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,640
Contact, rear!

653
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,225
Shit!

654
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,037
See, this is the part of the plan
l don't trust!

655
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,539
Don't worry, Face! The rope will hold!

656
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,626
If l was worried, I'd be nailing myself
to the container right now!

657
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,461
Hang on, boys!

658
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,400
Bam! Come on! l smoked you!

659
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,068
You boys see that down there?

660
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,362
Murdock? What is that fool doing here?

661
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,364
Don't lock me in here.
l ain't playing with y'all!

662
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,658
Hey, boss,
you ever play that game at the fun fair

663
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,952
where you try to pick up
a stuffed animal with the claw?

664
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,496
This is a lot like that.

665
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,540
That's it!

666
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,375
Did you lock this?

667
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,835
You locked it, didn't you?

668
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,670
Hannibal, open this door right now, man!

669
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,964
What the... Are you hooking this thing?

670
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,091
- You hooking this up to a helicopter?
- l got you.

671
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,260
What the hell's going on?
You ain't that crazy!

672
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,470
Tell me we ain't flying!
l'm gonna kill you, fool!

673
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,473
- Boss, is that Bosco?
- Get me out of here!

674
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,475
- That's not good.
- Let me out of here!

675
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,478
That's not good.
He is not happy.

676
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,859
Agent Lynch,
l'm patching surveillance

677
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,318
from the General's tent to you now.

678
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,529
Sir,
l have an inbound V-22 tilt-rotor

679
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,114
on approach from the northwest.

680
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,701
Identified friendly.
Landing under the General's orders.

681
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,745
Alpha Delta Alpha, stand down.
Checked, friendly.

682
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,790
Those are our boys.
D- block perimeter around LZ

683
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,001
for essential cargo touchdown.

684
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,738
Russ, we are in the net.

685
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,949
Copy that. l will be there in five.

686
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,368
I've got a big bottle of Blue Label waiting.

687
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,246
A bottle? Make it a case, Scrooge.

688
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,789
See you in a few.

689
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,958
Who's gonna let him out?

690
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,502
- You!
- You!

691
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,130
What you don't realize is,
now l gotta kill all of y'all!

692
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,842
I'll kill all of y'all!
Hannibal first, then Murdock!

693
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,802
- Boss man.
- l'm gonna save Face for last!

694
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,596
- Let me try something.
- Go for it.

695
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,098
ls it weird that l'm more scared now
than what we just did?

696
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,392
Bosco, it's Murdock.

697
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,186
Murdock, open this door!

698
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,731
I'll make you some of that
coconut-curry tapenade that you love.

699
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,483
That might work.

700
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,486
With toast points?

701
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,613
Hell, yeah, with toast points.
What, you're gonna have that

702
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,365
- with plain old chips?
- Let's do this.

703
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,451
- Damn! You tricked me.
- There he is.

704
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,161
- There he is!
- l hate that!

705
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,288
- Come on!
- Get away from me, man!

706
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,124
The only reason l don't kick y'all asses
is 'cause you all outrank me.

707
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,043
You should know better!
You know l hate flying!

708
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,295
- l'm wet! l stink!
- Hoo! Yeah!

709
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,838
And l can't spend none of that money!

710
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,799
- Money can't buy happiness.
- Damn, man!

711
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,177
Hey, Murdock, you cooking tonight.
You better get your apron on.

712
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,474
l love it when a plan comes together.

713
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,774
- Hannibal, who was that?
- General?

714
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:38,192
- ls that the General?
- Russ.

715
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,736
- Get there. Get in there.
- General!

716
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:42,822
- Russ!
- General!

717
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,532
General!

718
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,158
Jesus Christ.

719
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,416
Pike.

720
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,042
Contact rear!

721
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,336
Get in there!

722
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,259
Get there, get there!

723
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,152
After conferring,
we've decided to demote you

724
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:05,738
to the rank of First Lieutenant.

725
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,616
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing personal,

726
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,409
but you lost those plates.

727
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,536
Those were your responsibility.

728
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,330
Consider yourself lucky.

729
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,831
Others are going to prison over this.

730
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,375
Good day, Director McCready.

731
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,335
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

732
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,880
Colonel Smith,
this court has been unable to recover

733
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:27,259
any direct order from General Morrison
for you to conduct the mission

734
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,345
for which you're being tried.

735
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,807
Your Honor,
this was a covert operation

736
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,226
and no official orders were given.

737
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,938
So the one individual who can verify

738
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,774
the legitimacy of this operation
is deceased. ls that correct, Colonel?

739
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,901
No, Your Honor, not deceased.

740
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,195
General Morrison was murdered.

741
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:48,781
Colonel, I've been around a long time.

742
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,785
I've seen units like yours.
They're outlaws.

743
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,538
Units like that pose a direct threat

744
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,082
to the fabric and fundamentals
of our military.

745
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,337
Your Honors, why hasn't Black Forest
been brought to trial?

746
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,300
Black Forest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

747
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,846
Where's the plan, boss? Where is it?

748
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,764
Where's the escape hatch?
Because l don't see it.

749
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,350
- This mission isn't over, Lieutenant.
- What mission?

750
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:21,230
l clear our names.
We find Pike and the plates.

751
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,190
No matter what.

752
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,362
Your Honors, these men were acting
under my command.

753
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,240
Any judgment should be levied
against me, and me alone.

754
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,491
Absolutely not, sir.

755
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,744
We were all participating
in this operation willingly.

756
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,995
l don't wanna be tried separately.

757
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,663
l refuse to be tried separately, sir.

758
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,916
In accordance with
the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

759
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,793
this court is rendering guilty verdicts

760
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,296
for each member of this Alpha Unit,
or A-Team,

761
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,008
and mandating incarceration
in separate maximum-security facilities

762
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,178
for a period of up to 10 years.

763
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,806
You're all hereby stripped of formal rank

764
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,184
and dishonorably discharged.

765
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,397
This is bullshit, man.

766
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:06,192
This session is adjourned.

767
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,740
Disgraceful.

768
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,034
- Do not touch me, okay?
- Captain, stand down.

769
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,660
Order! Order!

770
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,954
Absolute disgrace!

771
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,207
You happy? Are you happy, Charissa?

772
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,875
Colonel, control your men!

773
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,878
- Get your hands off me!
- This is a disgrace!

774
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,403
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch.
Long time.

775
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,907
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

776
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,492
A lot of cameras in here.

777
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,285
Yeah, there are.

778
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,039
Yeah, well, they seem to be having
some technical issues at the moment.

779
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,667
May not show up till playback.

780
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:06,919
Hannibal. Can l call you Hannibal?

781
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,339
l can't call you Colonel anymore.

782
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:11,924
Six months.

783
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,386
Been waiting for you to bust out of here

784
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,472
and round up the rest
of the Backstreet Boys

785
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,015
and lead me to those plates.

786
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,018
Six months and not a peep.

787
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,980
Everybody thought you and your team
were working with Pike.

788
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,691
Mmm. Everybody except you.

789
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,990
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me
and my boys up and stole those plates.

790
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,330
And l know where he is.

791
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,167
Nobody knows where he is.

792
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,882
lt's a single image of him.

793
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,552
Taken about a month ago,
somewhere in Europe.

794
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:00,139
We think it's a grab from a CCTV camera.

795
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,101
Frankfurt, Germany.

796
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,439
How did you get that in here?

797
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,316
Time, Lynch.

798
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,610
Give me a minute and l'm good.

799
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,570
If I've got an hour, l'm great.

800
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,823
You give me six months, l'm unbeatable.

801
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:19,491
l know Pike.

802
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,784
Who's the Arab?

803
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,912
We don't know.

804
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,081
We think he's the deep, dark,
hidden hand in this whole thing.

805
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,001
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

806
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:34,340
Lynch, we have common
enemies and you have limited choices.

807
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,051
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

808
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,385
l wouldn't be so sure.

809
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,888
Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

810
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,766
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press.

811
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,353
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

812
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,897
So, what would you need from me?

813
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,942
l swore to my team
that l would clear our names.

814
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,861
You of all people must understand
the value of a name.

815
00:51:59,532 --> 00:52:00,532
Now, listen.

816
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,746
l want full reinstatement
and clean records

817
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,499
for myself and my team.

818
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,834
l can't get you out of here.

819
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,796
Not legally, at least.

820
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,509
This is something the boys at Langley
do very, very well.

821
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,260
Make sure the dosage is right.

822
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:24,515
And when l say right, l mean perfect.

823
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,354
Don't seem like happiness will come along

824
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,693
Cuban. What a shame.

825
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:41,615
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed

826
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,328
Just can't seem to get ahead in life

827
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:52,918
Ooh, nothing l do ever turn out right

828
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,172
Won't somebody help me, please?

829
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:03,262
'Cause I've been lonely for so long

830
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,057
Don't seem like happiness will come along

831
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,894
I've been lonely...

832
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,371
You are not permitted

833
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,791
in my dojo!

834
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:39,381
So, Satan walks into this bar...

835
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,511
Wait a minute.
What's this, a lap pool?

836
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,971
A dry steam room?

837
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:48,599
Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.

838
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,518
How in the hell do you pull this off?

839
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,062
lt's not who you know, Bob,
it's how you know them.

840
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,732
Oh! Did your boy get back
from Afghanistan?

841
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,777
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home.
His mother and l are real grateful.

842
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,654
- Captain.
- Hey.

843
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,573
You left
something on the bed.

844
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:10,954
- Could have hid those.
- Why would l want to do that?

845
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,956
I'll see you at 8:00.

846
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,211
And now you want to build...
- A lap pool and a dry steam.

847
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,641
Overlooking a sun deck.

848
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,434
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

849
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,687
Ah! Come on. lt's my pleasure, baby!

850
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,945
Beautiful.

851
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,200
Listen, now l know
this is good for the body,

852
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,993
but how do you protect the face?

853
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:54,623
You don't mess with it, kid.

854
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,209
Gotcha.

855
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,754
- Thanks for the tan.
- You got it.

856
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:05,425
Smith has escaped, Lieutenant.

857
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,804
Let me go after him.

858
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,640
Smith and his team were working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

859
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,976
l can get those plates back for you, sir.

860
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:17,062
You know l can.

861
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,273
Holla what? Holla who?

862
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,860
Holla me.

863
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,656
Hey.

864
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,910
Hey! Let me out! Hey, hey! Hey!

865
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:37,958
l see him standing there,
and l was like, "What?"

866
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:43,338
And then it turned black
and l woke up, and my face was numb,

867
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,882
and l just...

868
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,342
And you mopped up the footprints
that led out,

869
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,678
ignored the fact that your lab coat,

870
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:52,723
pass card, car keys and car were missing.

871
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,433
Looks like he ate Smith.

872
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,519
Gilbert, you've either deliberately

873
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,272
aided and abetted
a federal fugitive's escape,

874
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,277
or you're the single dumbest human being
I've ever come into contact with.

875
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,446
- You smell that?
- Don't talk about it.

876
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,865
Would you like to know
which way l'm leaning?

877
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,911
Forward.

878
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,414
l would test this man's urine, on the hour.

879
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,683
l was a week away
from my parole hearing.

880
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,102
You are really tan.

881
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,483
Told you the mission wasn't over.

882
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,780
l'm putting the team back together.

883
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,866
l need you, Face.
l can't do this without you.

884
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,997
Warden, how did Smith arrange
a personal visit without your consent

885
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,667
or your signature? How does that happen?

886
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,419
How the hell did this guy do that?

887
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,923
Seal that up, nobody goes in there.

888
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,928
Log-in pages from the day in question
have been removed.

889
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,555
- Why does that not surprise me?
- Torn out.

890
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,600
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

891
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:21,103
- Subtle. lt's a good book.
- Right.

892
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,897
This is surveillance
from all around the prison, right?

893
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,023
Mmm-hmm.

894
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,733
What you're watching is a signal jammer.

895
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,944
Every time he walks through
one of these things,

896
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,822
we get massive interference.
He waltzes in here and waltzes out.

897
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,740
Nobody knows who he is.

898
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,201
God.

899
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,499
Yes. The cigar that Colonel Smith
broke out of prison with.

900
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,501
Yeah. Wanna hear the crazy part?
- Yes.

901
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:49,923
Lab reports show lethal amounts of,
wait for it, tetrodotoxin.

902
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,134
Tetrodotoxin? What is that?

903
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:55,220
- The near-death drug.
- Yes, that sleeping beauty thing.

904
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:57,264
Yeah. And you know
who likes to use that, right?

905
00:57:57,598 --> 00:57:59,599
- Who?
- Our friends at Langley.

906
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,726
lt's one of their favorites.

907
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,771
Come on, do you really think that
the CIA came to the prison to visit Smith?

908
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,733
This sounds kind of crazy,
but l think the CIA broke him out.

909
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,027
Who put us on?

910
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,573
The same guy that put us on in Baghdad.
Lynch, CIA.

911
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,452
What are we talking about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

912
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,203
All of the above.

913
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,208
What about Pike and the plates?

914
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,044
Payback.

915
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,088
What are they exchanging?
What is that?

916
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,590
ls that how he got this in here?

917
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,180
One of these things is not like the other.

918
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,431
l suck at these games.

919
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,643
Where's this plate from?
What is that plate?

920
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:47,898
lt's an "F." Frankfurt, Germany.

921
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,025
Oh, Frankfurt, Germany.

922
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,944
Smith is talking to us.
This is not accidental.

923
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,989
With this guy, there's a plan
and two to back it up.

924
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:59,159
l take it you didn't get religion inside.

925
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,079
No. l got revenge.

926
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:04,498
Good.

927
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,877
l know a couple of guys
that'll feel the exact same way.

928
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,837
l'm counting on it.

929
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:39,199
Emergency exit now.

930
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,660
Hannibal.

931
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,882
Baracus, don't do it!

932
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,761
Where he going?
What's he doing, man?

933
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,681
Baracus! God damn it!

934
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,189
Sosa.

935
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,607
Lieutenant,
Peck's already gone.

936
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,733
What?

937
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,069
Baracus and Murdock are left.
Handle it, Lieutenant.

938
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,320
Right. Okay.

939
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,905
l don't want to be embarrassed
like this again. Do you?

940
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,575
Okay. No, no, no, no.
We're gonna catch and deploy from here.

941
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,659
Peck escaped.

942
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:25,203
- Oh, hell. You think Smith is involved?
- Definitely.

943
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,039
Get graphics on him and Smith.
Anything that'll ID them instantly.

944
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,125
l know they got Murdock
in a psych ward in Mannheim.

945
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,710
Right. Okay.
Where the hell is B.A. Baracus?

946
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,473
How did you know that once that door
was extracted

947
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,601
- that it would take his weight?
- l just did. He's...

948
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,228
- You know, he's what, 225, 230 pounds?
-230. Yeah.

949
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,939
Remember the gag we did in Venezuela
seven years ago?

950
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:55,233
Venezuela. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

951
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,027
But that was a midget.

952
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,529
Yeah, l wouldn't go for that.

953
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,698
- Hey, big guy. There he is.
- Yeah! He's back.

954
01:01:01,782 --> 01:01:03,575
- Yeah, it's good to be back.
- Come on.

955
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,327
- lt's good to be back.
- My man.

956
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,287
- lt's good to see you, bud.
- You, too, bro. You, too.

957
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,748
- Thanks.
- You look well.

958
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,750
lt's good to see you guys.

959
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,839
- What?
- Where's the Mohawk?

960
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,592
What, you don't like my new do, man?

961
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:24,221
Do l like it? Well, we got you the clippers.
l thought...

962
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,097
Yeah, l used them.

963
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,435
Hey. What's up, big guy?

964
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,606
Come on, you can speak to us.

965
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,025
Guys...

966
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,446
l can't kill anybody.

967
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:47,702
- What do you mean?
- I've taken a vow.

968
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,038
- Vow?
- Of non-violence.

969
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,416
I'll still do anything for you guys,
you know that.

970
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,753
But l just can't kill, man.

971
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,297
Old habits may die hard,

972
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,509
but they still gotta die.

973
01:02:03,427 --> 01:02:06,680
When l was a kid,
all you heard in the hood was,

974
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,600
"Bosco's a badass, out collecting scalps."

975
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,312
That's where the Mohawk came from.

976
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,315
Was always at war.

977
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,484
And that's what warriors are for.

978
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,487
Hannibal, man. l don't miss that life.

979
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:26,032
I'll help you get Murdock,
and right that wrong,

980
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,577
- but l can't kill.
- Even Pike?

981
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:32,122
Even if killing him would clear your name?

982
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,668
My conscience is the only thing
l need clear.

983
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:40,213
Now, where's that crazy-ass fool?

984
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,009
Transference.

985
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,345
Healing feelings.

986
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,348
You can't warehouse these things,
you know?

987
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,852
You have to express to progress.

988
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,273
We gotta empower your emotional tower

989
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:02,319
and send out a wavelength
of self-love and acceptance.

990
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:07,657
Thank you.

991
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,339
Clear.

992
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:28,636
He seems completely impervious to it.
lt's impossible to develop a base reading.

993
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,388
Have you increased the voltage?

994
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,098
Every single session, yes.

995
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,808
- Healing feelings, baby.
- And?

996
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,396
ls that all you got? Here we go.

997
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,481
Clear.

998
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,232
Yee-ha!

999
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,404
Yeah, l think
l might have felt something there.

1000
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,336
Oh, no, l won't sleep.

1001
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,171
Howard Little.

1002
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:06,591
You have a package here
from an Annabelle Smith.

1003
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:10,553
l don't know
any Annabelle Smith.

1004
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:15,141
Sure you do, Howie.

1005
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:17,852
Sure you do, baby. Annabelle.

1006
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,523
Remember the nurse from Da Nang?
The redhead, double amputee?

1007
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,317
Professional hang glider? Yes!

1008
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,361
Guys.

1009
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,113
Annabelle.

1010
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,073
Yeah. Yeah.

1011
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,199
Annabelle.

1012
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:35,120
Annabelle.
You have outdone yourself. Look at this.

1013
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,372
- lt's so real.
- Beauty.

1014
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,957
A movie in three dimensions.

1015
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,042
Stand-to, soldier.

1016
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,088
- Jerries advancing on the western front.
- Good heavens.

1017
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,631
Got a secret mission for you.

1018
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,135
Take these
and distribute them amongst the men.

1019
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,719
- Yes, sir.
- Don't fail the Queen.

1020
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,138
- No, sir.
- Great.

1021
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,222
Yes, sir.

1022
01:04:54,598 --> 01:04:56,808
Movie, movie, movie...

1023
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,685
l knight you.

1024
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,062
Sir, you have to put your head down.
Stand up and do it again.

1025
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,939
Movie, movie...

1026
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,151
Now let's sing to the Queen.
When l ask you... Not yet.

1027
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,777
- Movie, movie...
- Movie, movie...

1028
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,490
You get glasses! You get glasses!

1029
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,867
Ball!

1030
01:05:14,034 --> 01:05:15,952
When you kneel,
you put your head down straightaway.

1031
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:17,829
Looking me in the eye is disrespectful.
Do you understand?

1032
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:19,330
Movie, movie...

1033
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,333
You're looking me in the eye now.
That's wrong.

1034
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:24,919
Movie, movie, movie...

1035
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,963
Aquaman? Hello.

1036
01:05:27,339 --> 01:05:28,423
You get glasses! You get glasses!

1037
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,011
Rise, Sir 3D,
and enjoy your motion picture.

1038
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,971
- Movie! Movie!
- Movie! Movie!

1039
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,436
Boy, could l use two hours of not this.

1040
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,565
Pass out the sedatives
and order some pizzas for these freaks.

1041
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,068
- Movie, movie...
- Movie, movie...

1042
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,739
Movie...

1043
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,741
Shit.

1044
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,076
Excuse me,
can l help you with something?

1045
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,579
Yes. Captain Murdock, where is he?

1046
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,207
Right through there.
- Thank you.

1047
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,791
El diablo.

1048
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,920
Okay. Settle down.

1049
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,379
No talking during the movie.

1050
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,091
Down in front!

1051
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,680
Look, it's 3D, man!

1052
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,432
l'm sick of 3D.

1053
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,976
Captain Murdock.

1054
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,854
You remember me from Baghdad?

1055
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,280
Okay, this is pointless.
This guy is fried.

1056
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,657
Yeah, there's a reason
why he's in here.

1057
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,992
And his entire team has escaped,
except him.

1058
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,870
Movie!

1059
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,706
Take a look around anyway.
Let's make sure he's alone.

1060
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,625
Yes, ma'am.

1061
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,864
Oh, Captain, your chariot awaits.

1062
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,242
Sorry, boys, gotta run!
Can't finish the movie.

1063
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,660
Do let me know how it ends.

1064
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:22,829
Charissa, where are you hiding?
Stay beautiful, baby.

1065
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,914
- Punch it, B.A.
- Let's go, fool.

1066
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,168
Get the truck!

1067
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,547
She's actually shooting at us.

1068
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,173
You guys should see these bullets in 3D!

1069
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,718
- Murdock, get in here!
- lt's like we're actually being shot at!

1070
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,469
You are getting shot at, you crazy-ass fool!

1071
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,265
- Stop right there!
- Ram it.

1072
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,808
Hey! l said halt!

1073
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,022
Damn! Sorry, dude.

1074
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,774
lt looks like they're headed for the tarmac.

1075
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,609
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1076
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,701
- Gentlemen.
- Holy shit, that's Hannibal Smith.

1077
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:05,371
Are any of you armed
and/or wanted federal fugitives?

1078
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,458
- No.
- Well, we're both.

1079
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,001
- Which means...
- This is a bad idea.

1080
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:11,419
This is a bad idea.

1081
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,504
Stop being a baby.
You're a grown-ass man. Get on the plane.

1082
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,215
- You're taking the plane?
- And that's why l joined the Army.

1083
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,343
We gotta finish the escape.
Man up and get in there.

1084
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,679
The best and brightest.
Appreciate it, boys. That'll be all.

1085
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,431
Who's got the keys?
l just need your keys.

1086
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:25,600
What you talking about keys?
You don't need no keys for no plane.

1087
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,144
- l do need keys.
- For what? This is a bad idea.

1088
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:29,896
We just broke
this guy out of a psych ward.

1089
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,731
Hannibal, you let the real pilots go.

1090
01:08:31,815 --> 01:08:33,524
- B.A., relax. You're gonna be fine.
- Take one of these.

1091
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,195
What is this? Will it knock me out?
lt better knock me out,

1092
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,613
'cause if it don't,
l'm gonna knock you out.

1093
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,239
Bosco, the buttons are confusing me.

1094
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,283
- Shut up, Murdock.
- Come on, Murdock. Let's go.

1095
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,619
You gonna fly this plane?
Forget it. I'll turn myself in.

1096
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,204
What does this do?
- Come on.

1097
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:48,206
- Come on, Murdock.
- l got lucky.

1098
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,458
Hang on, boys.

1099
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,717
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1100
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,139
Face, your girlfriend is back.

1101
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,725
- Reverse now.
- Son of a bitch!

1102
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,519
Move your ass now.

1103
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:13,398
- The C-130 versus the Mercedes-Benz.
- Lift us off, Murdock.

1104
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,526
- How about faster?
- Faster!

1105
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,735
l'm trying. l got it pinned!

1106
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,372
Oh, my God!

1107
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:42,635
Get us to flight control.

1108
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:47,223
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are expecting slight turbulence.

1109
01:09:47,307 --> 01:09:50,059
Please remain in your seats
until the captain has turned off

1110
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,270
the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign.

1111
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,606
Don't worry, boys! Turbulence has never
brought down a plane!

1112
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:00,903
What the hell is that?

1113
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:05,283
But we got inbound subsonic UAVs
with missile lock!

1114
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:07,702
And they bring down planes all the time!

1115
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:13,416
Okay, they're coming in.
Launching countermeasures!

1116
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:21,883
Whoa!

1117
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,471
Did you see that? That's my diversion!

1118
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,598
They die on this version.

1119
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,981
Hang on! Hang on! Hold on!
We're going over.

1120
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,776
Murdock,
what the hell are you doing?

1121
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,988
You boys remember Mexico?

1122
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,866
Whoa!

1123
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,743
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck,

1124
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,204
if you look out of the right-hand side
of the aircraft, you'll notice

1125
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,456
that your right wing is on fire.

1126
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,128
Tango reacquired.
Missile lock pending, sir.

1127
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,090
Lieutenant Charissa Sosa, DClS.
Major, do not shoot that aircraft down.

1128
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,717
Scramble fighters and force them to land.

1129
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,260
There are federal fugitives on that plane.

1130
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,678
They've also stolen property
from the U.S. Army.

1131
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,431
Billy, Billy, l need you to get the nose-cam
view up here on my monitor now.

1132
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,724
lt's up, sir. Here it is.

1133
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:17,647
Missile away, sir.

1134
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,695
We have shoot-down. Hercules has been
intercepted and destroyed.

1135
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,114
Sorry, Lieutenant. l'm sorry.

1136
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,128
- l don't believe it.
- We have chute deployment on the Buford.

1137
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,338
What?

1138
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:44,715
l want these drones taken offline
right now!

1139
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,801
- They're 3,000 miles away.
- Whoever is running those drones.

1140
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,469
Get me a direct line
to whoever is running those drones.

1141
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,888
We gotta get these drones to stand down
or l'm gonna be on bitch duty.

1142
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,682
l need to get those men alive!

1143
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,022
Everybody okay?

1144
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:02,233
What are the chances
they think we're dead?

1145
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:06,988
Not great.

1146
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,824
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.
- We ain't on that plane.

1147
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:10,992
Hannibal!
- Yeah?

1148
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,703
If we're under 20,000 feet,
we can still breathe, right?

1149
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,329
What are you talking about, 20,000 feet?

1150
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,291
- Let's fire up the old weapons system.
- What the hell, man?

1151
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,335
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy.
l'm gonna pop a window!

1152
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,258
Yeah!

1153
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,678
What you got, bitches? What you got?

1154
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,765
Yeah!

1155
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,143
Let me have a turn, Face! Come on!

1156
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:40,104
- Why are we in a falling tank?
- Because the plane exploded!

1157
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:41,939
What... What? When?

1158
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:43,316
Recently!

1159
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,943
- The Reapers shot it down!
- What Reapers?

1160
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:51,616
The same ones
that are still trying to kill us!

1161
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,118
- l blame you, Hannibal!
- Technically, we're not flying.

1162
01:12:54,202 --> 01:12:56,579
l know! Because we're falling, fool!

1163
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,545
Oh, Jesus!

1164
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:08,758
UAV-2 has splashed down.
We just lost one of the drones.

1165
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:11,260
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

1166
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:13,971
Brace yourselves!

1167
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,307
Awesome!

1168
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,727
Face, get on to the main gun!

1169
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:22,063
There's a lake a half-mile away
from this position.

1170
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:25,066
- What the hell am l trying to hit?
- Trust me!

1171
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,985
- Rotate the turret 82 degrees.
- Fire in the hole!

1172
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:30,946
- Fire!
- Boom!

1173
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,325
Fire!

1174
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:40,081
Are they trying to shoot down
that other drone?

1175
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,833
No. They're trying to fly that tank.

1176
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,379
- He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank, fool!

1177
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,547
- Rotate 16 degrees!
- Got it!

1178
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,840
Fire!

1179
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,555
Rotate 34 degrees now!

1180
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,599
- Hannibal...
- Wait...

1181
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:00,101
Fire!

1182
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,523
Control, we have lost...
- ls that a confirmed hit?

1183
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,692
Bring turret full-front and wait!

1184
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,988
Murdock! Close the hatch!

1185
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,657
Hatch, okay! Did that work?
Did that work?

1186
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,242
- Boss!
- Come on, baby.

1187
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,828
- Come on.
- Hatch control?

1188
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,789
l'm too young to die!

1189
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,166
Boss! l'm aiming at nothing!

1190
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,168
Come on.

1191
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,421
lt's been an honor, gentlemen.
- Come on, baby.

1192
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,048
The greatest ride is the last ride, Colonel!

1193
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,718
- Fire everything!
- Come on, baby!

1194
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,145
Get right with God, y'all! This is it!
- Come on!

1195
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:45,187
Yee-ha!

1196
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,614
lt's not fair to the fish!

1197
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,117
You're cheating!

1198
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,621
You with your nagging...

1199
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,124
...you're chasing them away!

1200
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,021
All right. Busy bees, busy bees.

1201
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,692
Guys, you can take your coats off.
Hot as hell in here.

1202
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,360
l'm sweating like a whore in church.

1203
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,570
- Sir.
- Yeah?

1204
01:15:34,654 --> 01:15:37,865
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C-130 over Mannheim, Germany,

1205
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:39,742
by two Reaper drones.

1206
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:42,036
l'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch,

1207
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,164
but it says
that they were shot down in a tank.

1208
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:50,211
NORAD's calling it an X-out,
but there is a conflicting report.

1209
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,505
l'm sure there is.

1210
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,090
I've got a German Hausfrau
who says she saw a tank

1211
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:59,011
drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee
with a guy resembling Murdock...

1212
01:15:59,095 --> 01:16:01,347
Excuse me, which way to Berlin?

1213
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,391
- ...asking for directions to Berlin.
- That's impossible.

1214
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,729
Well, this will be the second time
Smith has died this week.

1215
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,439
ls that possible?

1216
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,739
- What have you got for me?
- Look at this.

1217
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,993
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison,

1218
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:25,454
but with no ID on the subject yet.

1219
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,832
Hello, handsome.

1220
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,669
Wait, I've seen this person before.

1221
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,379
l know this guy.

1222
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,092
Baghdad.

1223
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:42,388
Get me a clean patch to Langley.
We're going fishing.

1224
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,014
l barely even heard about it.

1225
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,684
l mean, l heard bits and pieces of it,
but how much of that was us?

1226
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,102
- So, l have a...
- l was talking.

1227
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,603
- lt's never us.
- Can you stop?

1228
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,981
l have a DoD hardline
from Lieutenant Sosa.

1229
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,732
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

1230
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,110
He's not available, ever.

1231
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,195
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

1232
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,700
General Morrison's tent?

1233
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,452
Out.

1234
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:08,497
Why do we have her?

1235
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:12,293
She's got a fantastic personality.
That's why.

1236
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:14,211
With whom am l speaking?

1237
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:19,133
This is Lieutenant Sosa.
ls this Agent Lynch?

1238
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,467
l'm sorry, l don't have a first name.

1239
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,054
Neither do l.
So, what can l do you for, Lieutenant?

1240
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,181
l'm looking at an image of you

1241
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:29,268
from the disciplinary barracks
at Fort Carson.

1242
01:17:30,186 --> 01:17:31,270
She's hot.

1243
01:17:31,354 --> 01:17:34,231
Did you visit
former Colonel Hannibal Smith in prison?

1244
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,739
l don't know what you're talking about,
former Captain.

1245
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,575
Agent Lynch,
if you facilitated Smith's escape

1246
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,785
and are currently aiding and abetting him...

1247
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:50,873
Ooh. Buddy.

1248
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,833
If you can make something like that stick,

1249
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,419
your next promotion
should be in the five-star range.

1250
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,547
And if you're helping to retrieve
those engraving plates,

1251
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:03,385
l'm going to have to go out of my way
to disappoint you.

1252
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:17,024
l want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

1253
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:20,319
l wanna know everything. l want active
intercept taps on everything she's got.

1254
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:22,237
l want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

1255
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,198
You realize she's DoD.

1256
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,952
l don't care if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1257
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:32,039
Boss, check this out.

1258
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:35,250
We've tracked this photograph of Pike
to the Königsbank in Frankfurt.

1259
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,045
Our surveillance
has him and an unknown Arab

1260
01:18:38,129 --> 01:18:40,506
making regular trips
from the train station to the bank

1261
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,549
all over the last month.

1262
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:44,718
- Pike's getting sloppy.
- Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1263
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,388
what are the odds that Smith and his team
are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1264
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,808
No, no, no, this is a direct
pull-down from the Pentagon's database.

1265
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,560
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.

1266
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,398
l think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

1267
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,192
Pike has been moving
the stolen engraving plates

1268
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:03,153
to the Königsbank Tower in Frankfurt
over the past month.

1269
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,823
Tomorrow, the last of the cases
containing these plates

1270
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,242
will be transferred to the Arab.

1271
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:10,577
This will mark the only time
in the last six months

1272
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,454
that all of the plates
have been in one location.

1273
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,791
lt's our best and only shot
at getting them back.

1274
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,545
They leave the Königsbank Tower
for the 7:15 train to Zürich.

1275
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,675
Gentlemen, we're gonna make sure
they miss that train.

1276
01:19:25,468 --> 01:19:26,927
- Face?
- Yeah.

1277
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,138
Time to bring in your former flame.

1278
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:30,597
If she's as good as l think,

1279
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:34,309
then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt
to intercept those plates.

1280
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:39,314
- Why would you tip her off?
- She's a crusader,

1281
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:41,358
and we're gonna need her teed up
at some point.

1282
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,901
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

1283
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,695
Charissa Sosa...

1284
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:47,656
Charissa Sosa...

1285
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,158
Now the wrinkle.

1286
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,704
If Sosa's onto us,
we can assume that Lynch is onto her.

1287
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,542
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,

1288
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,544
he won't hesitate to kill her.

1289
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,671
Face, get to the train station.

1290
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,176
This is Sosa.

1291
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,888
If there's a threat from Lynch, deal with it.

1292
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:12,681
Hello?

1293
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:16,060
Shoot is green.
Say again, shoot is green.

1294
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,479
Hello?

1295
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,737
Something's wrong.

1296
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,826
We're marked, guys. Pull back.
l don't like this at all.

1297
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,620
See. Don't be seen.

1298
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,334
Hello, beautiful.
- You have got some balls.

1299
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,960
- You put a drop phone on me?
- l had to, babe.

1300
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,838
lt's the only way l could talk to you.
Lynch has all your comm lines.

1301
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:48,342
- l want you to pull your team now.
- l'm gonna find you, Face.

1302
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,220
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

1303
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,679
Not if l find you first.

1304
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,356
Come on, all right... Okay. Okay.

1305
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,694
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1306
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,989
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to save you!

1307
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,495
Charissa.

1308
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:21,041
Come on, you know we're innocent.
You know this.

1309
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,169
You're lying. Like you lied in Baghdad.

1310
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,172
l did not know.
l knew nothing about the plates.

1311
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,424
At that... At that time.

1312
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,969
You are completely full of shit!

1313
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,470
Will you stop selling yourself on that

1314
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,180
and avoiding the fact that you lied to me!

1315
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,348
- You're the one that misled me.
- When?

1316
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:38,517
- Come on. You wanna go there?
- Yeah, let's go there.

1317
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:40,394
You heard l was a player
and you wanted to play.

1318
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,646
And then l got serious and you freaked!

1319
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,898
- Oh, l freaked? l did not freak!
- Yes, you did.

1320
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,527
You panicked and you ran.

1321
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,368
Charissa, come on.

1322
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,663
l'm a federal fugitive.
You know exactly how wanted l am.

1323
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:03,834
You think l came to Frankfurt
to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1324
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,379
l'm here because we didn't do this.
l'm here because we were set up.

1325
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:11,091
l'm here because, in the end,
the truth is worth the risk.

1326
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,306
And l believe in you,
even if you don't believe in me.

1327
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:24,479
God, l forgot how beautiful you are.

1328
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,862
Hold on to that phone.

1329
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,375
OH MY GOD!

1330
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,585
HE'S GOT A GUN!

1331
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,086
RIGHT THERE! HE'S GOT A GUN!

1332
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,880
A GUN!

1333
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:51,340
Sucker.

1334
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,135
- Oh, shit.
- Where's Peck?

1335
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,222
Excellent question. Find him!

1336
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,558
Please stay calm
and go to the nearest exit.

1337
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:33,090
Meet you up on corridor three.

1338
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,429
Three to base. We're all clear at this time.

1339
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,309
Give me confirmation
as soon as the package is secure.

1340
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,106
We need a video feed.

1341
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,294
Okay, let's dance.

1342
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,880
Coming down. Positions, prepare to move.

1343
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,466
As always, stay close to me, sir.

1344
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:33,150
Closing off the 10th floor.

1345
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,779
Tenth floor, we need backup.

1346
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:39,656
Get back! Get back!

1347
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,241
l can't see anything.

1348
01:24:41,492 --> 01:24:42,659
How we doing there, big man?

1349
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,411
Murdock, here comes the Arab.

1350
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:46,163
And here's a long drive

1351
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,165
hit deep into left center field.

1352
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,210
Murdock's back, he's at the wall,
and he makes the catch!

1353
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:54,504
l can't breathe.

1354
01:24:55,339 --> 01:24:56,673
lt's a trap!

1355
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,802
Pete, we need backup!

1356
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,028
B.A., l lost the case.

1357
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:20,489
l'm taking fire. l'm out of here.

1358
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,166
B.A., get to those plates.

1359
01:26:28,432 --> 01:26:30,559
Deutsche Federal is responding
to explosions and shots fired

1360
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:32,769
- at the Königsbank building.
- Get us out of this mess and get us

1361
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,938
- to that building as soon as possible.
- Yes, ma'am.

1362
01:26:56,627 --> 01:26:59,212
You made me work for this one, Baracus.

1363
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,048
l didn't think l was this out of shape.

1364
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,301
l am, unfortunately.

1365
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,386
Where's the rest of the team, huh?

1366
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,640
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot, the asshole.
What's his name?

1367
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:20,317
l'm gonna take this one out of your ass,
Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1368
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,698
Come on. What are you doing?
What, are you tired?

1369
01:27:26,782 --> 01:27:27,949
l'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1370
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:30,035
No, you're not gonna hurt me,
l'm gonna hurt you.

1371
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,709
- l don't wanna kill you, man.
- You don't wanna kill me?

1372
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:39,711
You're not gonna kill me.
l'm gonna kill you, Baracus.

1373
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:40,921
l'm not playing with you, Pike.

1374
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,049
Here we go, because l got two guns.
l'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1375
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:46,509
So, as soon as
that hammer goes back, it's on.

1376
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,303
l swear to God, I'll do it.

1377
01:27:48,387 --> 01:27:50,388
You're not a coward, are you?

1378
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:53,099
Are you?

1379
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:58,271
Whoopsy.

1380
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,439
Damn!

1381
01:27:59,523 --> 01:28:01,107
- Need a ride, big fella?
- You're a life-saver, man.

1382
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,275
l couldn't shoot him.

1383
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,203
Get out of the way! Get down! Get down!

1384
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:41,064
U.S. Military!
Put them down. Put them down.

1385
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,151
This is U.S. Military. We got him.

1386
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,154
Yeah, this is about
the right amount of cops.

1387
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,366
That's cute.
You're lucky there are people around.

1388
01:28:51,742 --> 01:28:54,244
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1389
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:02,919
You eat that cold?

1390
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,671
Any way l can get it.

1391
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:07,424
There's a leak in the roof.

1392
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,508
There's a lot of them.

1393
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,094
ls that them?
- l got it.

1394
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,851
All right. Not a peep out of the Arab.

1395
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,769
Sosa was at the train station.

1396
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,105
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

1397
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,149
Did you talk to her?

1398
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,943
l had no choice, okay?
Just trust me on that.

1399
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,863
l trust you
to make historically bad decisions

1400
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,364
as far as women are concerned.

1401
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,783
What part of you
is thinking at the moment?

1402
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,119
Lynch's men moved in on her
and l had to react.

1403
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:37,579
That's why you wanted me there
in the first place...

1404
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,748
To stop them! Not to engage her!

1405
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:41,249
l couldn't do one without the other.

1406
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,878
Please. Somehow l doubt that.

1407
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,797
Hey. What are you so pissed about?
We got the plates.

1408
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,216
You wanted her teed up. She's teed up.

1409
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,635
She knows we didn't steal them.

1410
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:55,972
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

1411
01:29:57,808 --> 01:29:58,892
What?

1412
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:07,233
You had to know.

1413
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,241
You had to know if you left me alive,
that this was coming.

1414
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,124
How could you not?

1415
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:35,428
You taught me almost everything l know.

1416
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:40,600
Hannibal. You know who this is?

1417
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:53,446
We all do.

1418
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:58,868
Morrison?

1419
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,829
Hell, no.

1420
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,498
Jesus Christ.

1421
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:08,545
Not so sure that it is a blessing,
but good hunting, my friend.

1422
01:31:11,298 --> 01:31:12,382
Thank you.

1423
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,051
You son of a bitch.

1424
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:23,434
Morrison? Holy shit.

1425
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:31,943
You're not a general.

1426
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,404
How could you do this to him?

1427
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,739
How could you do this to us?

1428
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,826
You know nothing about leading men.

1429
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:44,706
l knew if Lynch helped me escape,
you had to be part of it.

1430
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,170
You and Pike were making a play
on those plates with Lynch,

1431
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,504
and you turned on him.

1432
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:53,923
The way you turned on us.

1433
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,342
Lynch was never gonna cut us in.

1434
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,763
He was gonna use us.

1435
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,267
He brought you on as insurance.

1436
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:08,021
He never thought you'd betray
your oldest living friend.

1437
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,774
l just hit first, Hannibal. l'm a fighting man.

1438
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,484
You're a liar and a traitor!

1439
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,862
Then don't draw this out. Kill me.

1440
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:18,489
That's a fantastic idea!

1441
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,116
Whoa! Whoa!

1442
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,118
Bos, let me do this.

1443
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,746
Face, l ain't killing nobody.

1444
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:27,957
You're not, Bosco. l am.

1445
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,210
No matter what he says,
do not kill him, okay?

1446
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,045
You guys don't wanna watch?
Just turn your heads.

1447
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,881
- l'm not gonna be party to it neither.
- l wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

1448
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:36,257
but he's our ticket out.

1449
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,468
He knows what he's talking
about for once. Listen to him.

1450
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:41,429
- Face, he is our only evidence.
- Murdock, Murdock...

1451
01:32:41,513 --> 01:32:42,847
Do you understand?
- He put us here.

1452
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,850
You can blow his head off
after he testifies, okay?

1453
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:46,893
He's ruined it!

1454
01:32:46,977 --> 01:32:48,519
- Think what you're doing, Face.
- All right.

1455
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:50,313
- If you can't handle it...
- Boys, enough.

1456
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,692
Enough! That's enough, Face.

1457
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,070
Enough! Step down!

1458
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:58,821
Everybody outside.

1459
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:00,531
l got him.

1460
01:33:00,824 --> 01:33:03,326
- l don't want you to have to do it.
- Face, outside.

1461
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,495
Stand down, soldier.

1462
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:08,164
Face. Now!

1463
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,625
- Fucking stupid.
- You okay, man?

1464
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:15,588
You knew Morrison
was masquerading as the Arab.

1465
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,840
- Why not share that?
- l wasn't 100% sure.

1466
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,425
How about 99%?

1467
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,262
Would you think
it was worth mentioning then?

1468
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,305
Lynch, what did you think?

1469
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:26,599
You think I'd just kill him on the spot?

1470
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,102
l was certain of it. l still am.

1471
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:31,104
Do you have the plates?

1472
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:32,855
l wouldn't be calling you if l didn't.

1473
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,319
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison,
and reclaim your lives.

1474
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,572
l want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements

1475
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:44,075
for myself and for each of my men.

1476
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,119
From the White House,
the State Department

1477
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,246
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1478
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,831
You hear me?

1479
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,751
l'm gonna need a little more time.

1480
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:56,337
How much?

1481
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:03,886
Give me five minutes.

1482
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:05,888
l'm waiting.

1483
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:17,692
Don't you get it, Hannibal?

1484
01:34:19,069 --> 01:34:21,404
We fight for them, we bleed for them,
we die for them...

1485
01:34:21,488 --> 01:34:23,197
They don't give a rat's ass.

1486
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,325
Death and destruction,

1487
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:28,703
they're selling it like it was on
the goddamn commodities exchange.

1488
01:34:28,787 --> 01:34:31,664
Don't push this off on them.
This is not about them.

1489
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:35,501
Your war protest was
stealing billions of dollars!

1490
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:37,962
Who are you?

1491
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:40,590
l am a general. You are a colonel.

1492
01:34:40,674 --> 01:34:44,344
l say, "Jump," and you say, "How high?"
End of story.

1493
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:45,428
lt is now.

1494
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,601
l saw your tomb at Arlington.

1495
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:55,772
You died a national hero.

1496
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:09,994
Death's too easy.

1497
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:13,206
And the last thing we need now
is another lie.

1498
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,334
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.
You owe me that much.

1499
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:18,002
You owe me!

1500
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:20,588
You're gonna tell them we're innocent.

1501
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:24,133
You owe me.

1502
01:35:25,969 --> 01:35:28,054
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1503
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,224
What are you fighting for now,
you and those boys?

1504
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:34,102
Your ranks? Your reputations?

1505
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:35,269
They're shit!

1506
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:37,647
You're convicts!

1507
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,109
Plates, no plates, you are federal fugitives,

1508
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:44,987
and when they're done with you, Hannibal,
they just fucking burn you.

1509
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:50,034
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword,
you're clear to engage.

1510
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,453
"Broadsword."
Did you come up with that?

1511
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,914
That's awesome. "Broadsword."

1512
01:35:55,165 --> 01:35:56,666
"Broadsword."

1513
01:35:59,169 --> 01:36:00,753
Boss, could you do that?

1514
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,007
To us?

1515
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:07,176
What Morrison did?

1516
01:36:08,303 --> 01:36:10,012
No. Not in a million years.

1517
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,558
Yeah, but you didn't see it coming, though.

1518
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,476
How long did you know it was him?

1519
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:16,853
Are you guys crazy?

1520
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:19,605
l know you are, but, Face,
are you accusing him?

1521
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:21,190
Hey! Hey!

1522
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:26,028
I'd rather face a firing squad
than betray you boys.

1523
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,905
Don't let this tear us apart.

1524
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,574
Not now.

1525
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:32,785
Not when we need each other
like no other time before.

1526
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,709
Move!

1527
01:36:51,763 --> 01:36:54,557
Wow. That's awesome.

1528
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:57,351
That looks exactly like Call of Duty,
doesn't it?

1529
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,604
All right. Here's the deal. No press release.

1530
01:36:59,688 --> 01:37:01,981
Keep local law enforcement
and media off-site.

1531
01:37:02,065 --> 01:37:04,567
Get a three-mile cordon,
ditto the no-fly zone.

1532
01:37:04,651 --> 01:37:09,113
Get an agency scrub team out there
and get me the goddamn plates back.

1533
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:15,161
The German police have your entire team
in custody in the Königsbank Tower.

1534
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:20,875
l don't do teams, babe. That's Smith's bag.
l'm strictly a solo act.

1535
01:37:29,801 --> 01:37:32,053
l like to travel light.

1536
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:36,599
Stuff like loyalty doesn't fit
in the overhead bins.

1537
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:40,895
l thought you and Smith
were working together.

1538
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,105
You thought wrong.

1539
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:46,567
Yes, we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

1540
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,738
If you want to deal, we can deal.

1541
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:55,785
How about l dedicate my immediate future

1542
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,412
to destroying yours?

1543
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,667
How about you get smart and start dealing

1544
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,211
before somebody else does?

1545
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:08,631
Former Captain.

1546
01:38:08,715 --> 01:38:10,883
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1547
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,719
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

1548
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:16,889
then this troubled young loner
belongs to me.

1549
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,266
Let's go.

1550
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,810
How the hell
did they get an extradition order?

1551
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:23,688
Sorry, Pike.
At least with me, there are rules.

1552
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,691
CIA's got rules.
Our rules are just cooler than yours.

1553
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:29,151
- Go.
- You know, Lynch,

1554
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:32,822
if l could seal this room with you inside,
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

1555
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,074
That's not nice.

1556
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:37,201
Lynch? Had to be.

1557
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,746
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1558
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:44,542
If that gunship is still around,
it won't read our body heat.

1559
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:48,838
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill us,
didn't even bother locating the plates.

1560
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:51,924
Where do we stand
on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1561
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,010
You pissed? You should be.

1562
01:38:54,177 --> 01:38:57,513
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1563
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,182
And without Morrison, we got nothing.

1564
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:04,020
- What do we do, boss?
- l don't know, Murdock.

1565
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,355
- l don't know.
- l do.

1566
01:39:08,358 --> 01:39:11,902
This guy Lynch,
l think l got him figured out.

1567
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,530
- You got a plan, kid?
- How do we get out of here?

1568
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:17,325
Give me 20 minutes.

1569
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:25,666
So, Morrison's dead.
Smith and his team are dead.

1570
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,794
Another 15 minutes or so,
we locate those engraving plates.

1571
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,421
What is this? Are you gloating?

1572
01:39:30,505 --> 01:39:33,883
No, this is me beating you
after you burned me.

1573
01:39:34,217 --> 01:39:36,302
- We had a deal, remember?
- Not you and me.

1574
01:39:36,386 --> 01:39:38,137
- You, me and Morrison.
- Not you and me, directly.

1575
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:40,806
And you two collude and cut me out.

1576
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:44,685
Hey. What are you doing? In the car?

1577
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,270
Are we doing...
Are we gonna do this in the car?

1578
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:48,439
- You doing this?
- He's gonna do it.

1579
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:51,025
Way to go.
That's brilliant, right there.

1580
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:52,777
What are you doing? What is he doing?

1581
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:54,570
- Jesus.
- How's it going, Kyle?

1582
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,739
- You all right?
- l'm good.

1583
01:39:56,865 --> 01:39:59,617
Brother, you are far from good.
What are you doing?

1584
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:01,661
lt's a European silencer.

1585
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:05,081
lt's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise.
You're holding a gun like that?

1586
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:06,999
You've held a gun like that before
and you're still here?

1587
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,584
That's amazing.

1588
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,336
- Don't point that thing...
- Jesus. Final request,

1589
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,004
don't let this guy shoot me, please.

1590
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,513
So, if Sosa knows we're alive...

1591
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:23,057
She'll believe
Morrison is alive, too.

1592
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:26,102
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm lines.

1593
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,065
This is Sosa.

1594
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,776
General Morrison
is in my possession.

1595
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:37,446
What? l'm sorry.
l can't hear you. Who is this?

1596
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:40,741
- Okay, this was not well thought out.
- No shit.

1597
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,702
l mean, look at this.
Am l to teach you how to kill me?

1598
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:44,495
Hey, do me a favor, all right?
Put the barrel...

1599
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:46,038
Put the gun flush to my head.

1600
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,873
Are you sure?
- There you go, right there.

1601
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,377
- ls that going to go through?
- Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1602
01:40:51,461 --> 01:40:52,753
There you go. We're okay. We're okay.

1603
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,674
Never cuff a man in a seated position
with his hands behind his back.

1604
01:40:56,758 --> 01:40:58,592
Makes it impossible to see the hands.

1605
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,177
That was cool.

1606
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:02,221
- You like that?
- l like that.

1607
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:03,889
l like that a lot.

1608
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:05,683
Are you all right, you idiot?

1609
01:41:05,767 --> 01:41:08,644
- Yeah. lt was a good hit.
- Please handcuff him.

1610
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,646
We don't need to use them again.
We don't need the cuffs.

1611
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,897
Who are you talking to?

1612
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:12,940
- Brad, phone or gun.
- Jesus.

1613
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,735
Phone or gun. Pick.
- Hey, hey.

1614
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,363
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, l didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1615
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:20,740
l really wanna shoot you.

1616
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,825
You gotta hear this, sir.

1617
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:24,535
ls this Smith?

1618
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:27,413
From a former colonel
to a former captain,

1619
01:41:27,497 --> 01:41:30,541
l know I've got about 30 seconds
before you lock this signal.

1620
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:33,753
- So listen, we can prove our innocence.
- Leave that on the floor like that?

1621
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:36,255
Okay. All right. Now, go back.

1622
01:41:36,339 --> 01:41:38,924
Did you say you have Morrison?
You have General Morrison?

1623
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:41,135
- Correct.
- You have him alive?

1624
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:44,972
And well, despite Lynch
trying to wipe us out wholesale.

1625
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:49,351
Too much to explain now
but Morrison's testimony frees us

1626
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,270
and fries Lynch.

1627
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:54,523
Uh-oh.

1628
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,400
Well, not without the plates.

1629
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,319
Also in my possession.

1630
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,448
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead,
and l want to keep it that way.

1631
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,991
All right. We'll deal.
- Give me a pen.

1632
01:42:04,075 --> 01:42:05,534
- Where and when?
- Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1633
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,912
LA docks, 48 hours, dawn.
- You still use a pen?

1634
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,957
l deliver Morrison and the plates.

1635
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:16,003
In return, l want a retrial
in front of a civilian court.

1636
01:42:16,546 --> 01:42:18,672
All right. We'll deal.

1637
01:42:19,382 --> 01:42:21,509
LA docks, 48 hours from now.

1638
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:25,304
Any bullshit from your end,
and that's it, deal's off.

1639
01:42:28,099 --> 01:42:30,476
- Did we get him?
- No.

1640
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,438
Pike.

1641
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:37,358
You believe in second chances?

1642
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:38,567
Uh...

1643
01:42:39,277 --> 01:42:40,402
l do now.

1644
01:42:41,112 --> 01:42:42,488
Too much?

1645
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,865
l thought you were spot-on.

1646
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,410
My turn.

1647
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:00,923
Hold on to that phone.

1648
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,808
This is Sosa.

1649
01:43:10,892 --> 01:43:12,268
Hello, beautiful.

1650
01:43:12,894 --> 01:43:14,270
Thank you.

1651
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,447
They got the raw end of the deal,
didn't they? Look at B.A.

1652
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:27,658
He looks like a huge banana.

1653
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:30,077
Good morning, my friend.

1654
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,161
Good morning.

1655
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:38,210
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1656
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:42,840
What passport did l give you?

1657
01:43:42,924 --> 01:43:45,384
You're from Tanzania.
My mother is from Tanzania.

1658
01:43:45,468 --> 01:43:46,969
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell happened?

1659
01:43:56,646 --> 01:43:59,356
- ...converting Africans to Judaism.
- This is station six...

1660
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:00,482
Stuff like that.

1661
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,027
Let's get ready to move.
There's three to my right.

1662
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:04,820
There's two behind me
and one at the northeast exit.

1663
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:10,743
Wait a sec.

1664
01:44:14,706 --> 01:44:15,998
Shalom.

1665
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,838
- What's he doing?
- lt's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1666
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,426
There is a God.

1667
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,929
- You speak Swahili?
- You don't?

1668
01:44:30,513 --> 01:44:32,181
You got enough
to work with, kid?

1669
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:33,265
We will.

1670
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:36,977
You and l have some major favors
moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1671
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:40,105
lt's a deep-sea freighter,
shipping strictly black-market merch.

1672
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,774
How do we get out to her?

1673
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,359
A boat. A plain old boat.

1674
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,195
This is what l'm talking about, Murdock.
Traveling the open seas in style.

1675
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:49,740
This is the way l like to travel. Classy-like.
The way people used to, safe.

1676
01:44:49,824 --> 01:44:50,908
- Yeah...
- We don't need a plane.

1677
01:44:50,992 --> 01:44:54,203
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1678
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:55,371
What?

1679
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,123
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1680
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,710
Just not today.

1681
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:04,546
Murdock, don't you remember what l said?

1682
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,298
- l said you have to catch him...
- You have to catch him...

1683
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,467
- ...after you inject him.
- ...after you inject him.

1684
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:11,804
My bad.

1685
01:45:38,581 --> 01:45:41,375
Damn it! My head, man.

1686
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:49,466
- Coconut-curry tapenade, your favorite.
- Give me that, fool.

1687
01:45:49,884 --> 01:45:51,927
You get them toast points?

1688
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:54,513
Voilà. Toast points.

1689
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:59,226
Y'all knocked me out again, huh?

1690
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:03,188
Okay, now, the whole injection,
knocking out,

1691
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,691
Hannibal and Face.

1692
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,819
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1693
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:11,905
Why do l feel like l fell on my face?

1694
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,116
Huh? Tell me that.

1695
01:46:16,202 --> 01:46:17,202
Uh...

1696
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:19,663
Lynch is a paradox.

1697
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,623
Murdock, you done with that?

1698
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:26,211
This is a guy who needs anonymity,
but he loves theatricality.

1699
01:46:27,756 --> 01:46:30,215
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1700
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:34,970
Where is it?

1701
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:38,015
Very nice.

1702
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,769
So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible,

1703
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:44,188
and never gets his hands dirty
if he can help it.

1704
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:45,814
But we're gonna change all that.

1705
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,566
You can't hustle a hustler, fool.

1706
01:46:50,361 --> 01:46:54,073
No sparks, no flames,
not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1707
01:46:54,157 --> 01:46:55,657
Easy, easy.

1708
01:46:56,826 --> 01:46:59,912
This guy is never
at the flashpoint of anything.

1709
01:47:02,665 --> 01:47:05,209
He's safe and sound somewhere,
pulling the strings.

1710
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,378
Mama. Mama.

1711
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:10,756
Hey, boss. Why so many
of these damn things anyway?

1712
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,884
Because overkill is underrated, my friend.

1713
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:19,264
So we're gonna bring this guy
down to ground level.

1714
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,724
Mama. Mama.

1715
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,102
This way, Lynch. Lynch.

1716
01:47:24,187 --> 01:47:26,730
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1717
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:33,028
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1718
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,531
Any questions?

1719
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,244
What's up, boss man?

1720
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:41,703
Hey, B.A.

1721
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:44,081
lt's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1722
01:47:45,875 --> 01:47:48,377
Well, l can't promise you it won't.

1723
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:51,588
Let me read you something real quick.

1724
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:55,717
"Victory attained by violence
is tantamount to defeat,

1725
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,679
"for it is momentary."

1726
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,473
Gandhi.

1727
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:06,311
"lt is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts,

1728
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,731
"than to put on the cloak of non-violence
to cover impotence."

1729
01:48:12,318 --> 01:48:13,819
Who said that?

1730
01:48:14,237 --> 01:48:15,445
Same guy.

1731
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,992
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1732
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,245
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1733
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:46,351
For life is but an opera

1734
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:51,315
lt's off, isn't it?

1735
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:53,442
l think it's higher.

1736
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:58,071
No, it's good. lt's not that, Murdock.

1737
01:48:58,156 --> 01:48:59,615
Face, what's wrong? Come on, man.

1738
01:49:00,283 --> 01:49:02,993
l don't know, man.
l'm just thinking past this.

1739
01:49:03,077 --> 01:49:07,247
You know, we've always come back alive,

1740
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:11,043
the four of us, 'cause of the old man.

1741
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,461
- l know.
- l'm not him.

1742
01:49:12,545 --> 01:49:14,129
Face, l know this.

1743
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,340
Murdock, l'm not Hannibal.

1744
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:20,969
Who has the most to lose on this, Face?

1745
01:49:21,387 --> 01:49:22,512
Me.

1746
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:25,474
And l trust you.

1747
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,770
Yeah, l know,

1748
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,147
but you're crazy.

1749
01:49:36,986 --> 01:49:38,487
Not that crazy.

1750
01:49:56,589 --> 01:49:58,173
Our eagles may have landed.

1751
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,383
Everybody ready to roll?

1752
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:00,759
Copy
Team one on the move.

1753
01:50:00,843 --> 01:50:02,552
Acknowledged.
Team to en route.

1754
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:12,312
All right, guys, everybody ready?

1755
01:50:13,147 --> 01:50:14,856
Curtain's about to come up.

1756
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,318
Show time.

1757
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,784
That's Smith right there. Watch him.

1758
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,663
Ground team is in position?

1759
01:50:29,747 --> 01:50:31,164
Standing by.

1760
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:33,792
In position.

1761
01:50:36,337 --> 01:50:38,046
Shoot Team One. Affirmative.

1762
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:39,881
Spotter One. 10-8.

1763
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,259
Let's chattermark on comms for now.

1764
01:50:42,343 --> 01:50:45,053
Morrison's the primary tango.
Plates are the package.

1765
01:50:47,056 --> 01:50:48,140
Yeah.

1766
01:50:48,891 --> 01:50:51,685
Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa.
l want this call.

1767
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:53,687
You lied to me, Sosa. We had a deal.

1768
01:50:53,771 --> 01:50:55,856
l want that goddamn call in my...
Thank you.

1769
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,108
We had a deal,
but l'm changing the deal.

1770
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,193
Are you kidding me, Sosa?
Are you kidding me?

1771
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:03,280
This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here.

1772
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:05,490
Listen, or remain at-large fugitives

1773
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:07,659
- for the foreseeable future.
- Uh-oh. No! No, no.

1774
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,078
For God sakes,
I've got Morrison here and the plates.

1775
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,581
l'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!

1776
01:51:12,665 --> 01:51:14,333
We're not doing this on the docks.

1777
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:16,043
Now listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1778
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,670
Now you listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1779
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,089
l need you to do it on my terms
or nothing at all.

1780
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:23,008
To hell with that,
and to hell with you, Sosa!

1781
01:51:23,092 --> 01:51:24,217
Ah. She burned him.

1782
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:27,846
Face, B.A., we're bugging out.
Sosa's jammed us.

1783
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:30,891
Murdock, get the chopper down here in 10.

1784
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,353
Okay, he's moving him.

1785
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:35,687
You got him? He's moving him.

1786
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:37,481
For the love of God, relax.

1787
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,775
l am relaxed. He's moving him.

1788
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,735
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.

1789
01:51:41,819 --> 01:51:44,863
- That's Morrison, right there. Take him.
- Wait, does he have the plates?

1790
01:51:44,947 --> 01:51:46,365
Smith has the plates. Go now.

1791
01:51:46,449 --> 01:51:49,159
- Take him, he's right there. Kill him.
- I've got Morrison, taking a shot.

1792
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:54,247
A little too close for comfort, kid.

1793
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:55,624
What just happened?

1794
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:57,167
What the hell is he doing?

1795
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,294
Where are they?
Somebody talk to me.

1796
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,338
Come on,
did that thing crush them or what?

1797
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:06,051
This was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1798
01:52:09,722 --> 01:52:13,183
Everybody just be cool. Pay attention.
No hasty moves.

1799
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:18,313
So, you beat a guy like Lynch
by drawing him in with three things.

1800
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:20,315
What the hell are they doing?

1801
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,525
Distraction.

1802
01:52:24,153 --> 01:52:26,863
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1803
01:52:28,699 --> 01:52:30,075
Diversion.

1804
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,124
This is a diversion!
Stay eagle on those containers.

1805
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:40,001
They're breaking for the exits! Open fire!

1806
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:41,837
Do not engage! Back off!

1807
01:52:42,004 --> 01:52:43,588
Ground teams, engage!

1808
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:48,760
Holy shit!

1809
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:55,851
Ground team, re-engage.

1810
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:57,602
You are being played by Smith.

1811
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,564
He's trying to draw your eye line, Lynch.
Come on, be smart.

1812
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:01,857
Take them! Take them!
Take them! Take them!

1813
01:53:04,902 --> 01:53:08,280
Contact! Tower house and bow!
lt's Peck and Baracus!

1814
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:16,163
And division.

1815
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:20,250
lt's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1816
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:22,085
- Get the hell out of there!
- No, no, no.

1817
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:30,719
What is happening? What is going on?

1818
01:53:31,262 --> 01:53:32,554
Nice one, kid.

1819
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,264
lt's Peck and Baracus!

1820
01:53:34,348 --> 01:53:35,932
- Shoot them!
- Shut up! l know what l'm doing.

1821
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:38,727
Okay, paintballers, time to go pro.

1822
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,607
B.A., get to your secondary position.

1823
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:47,235
Okay. Game-changer.

1824
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,238
Here's what l think of your best-laid plans.

1825
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:53,408
Shit!

1826
01:53:57,371 --> 01:53:58,705
Jesus Christ!

1827
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,458
So much for the grand scheme, Smith.

1828
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:02,667
What the hell was that?

1829
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:04,544
Face, what the hell was that?

1830
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:07,672
Pike hit the ship with a SMAW!
He punched a hole in the hull!

1831
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:09,174
What about the plan?

1832
01:54:09,258 --> 01:54:11,718
Pike just blew up the plan!
We are ad-libbing!

1833
01:54:11,802 --> 01:54:13,178
Bosco, get out of there!

1834
01:54:13,262 --> 01:54:14,596
l'm going for Hannibal.

1835
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,599
- Cover me. l'm going for those plates.
- Yes, sir.

1836
01:54:22,104 --> 01:54:24,898
The boat is going over! Get out of there!

1837
01:54:24,982 --> 01:54:26,441
Bos, hang on!

1838
01:56:11,547 --> 01:56:13,173
Oh! Jeez!

1839
01:56:15,384 --> 01:56:16,468
Shit.

1840
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:19,929
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground.
l'm running low on ammo, man.

1841
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:33,568
Shit!

1842
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:35,904
How are you doing, handsome?

1843
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:38,657
Shit, can you cycle that weapon.
Nice work.

1844
01:56:38,741 --> 01:56:40,617
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1845
01:56:40,701 --> 01:56:42,077
Where are they when you need them?

1846
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,124
Don't take this too personally,
but look here,

1847
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:51,002
smile, wait for the flash.

1848
01:56:54,423 --> 01:56:55,674
Baracus.

1849
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,687
Bosco!

1850
01:57:21,283 --> 01:57:22,492
Lynch.

1851
01:57:26,038 --> 01:57:31,543
Lynch.

1852
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:35,880
Come on, Lynch.

1853
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:40,885
Lynch.

1854
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:45,974
Come on, Smith! Stop bullshitting.

1855
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:48,727
Lynch. Come on, Lynch.

1856
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:54,482
Lynch...

1857
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,526
Where am l?

1858
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:01,239
Come on, Lynch.

1859
01:58:04,076 --> 01:58:05,285
Lynch.

1860
01:58:06,036 --> 01:58:07,954
Where am l, Lynch?

1861
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,124
Come on, Lynch.

1862
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:14,377
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1863
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:17,255
Lynch!

1864
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:36,107
There you are, Hannibal.
Been looking all over for you.

1865
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:39,277
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1866
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:43,448
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but...

1867
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:47,410
You had this whole sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

1868
01:58:47,495 --> 01:58:50,955
and the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1869
01:58:52,249 --> 01:58:57,128
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

1870
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:00,548
There's your monkey wrench.

1871
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
Hannibal, don't do this.

1872
01:59:02,134 --> 01:59:06,387
You know, Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world...

1873
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:08,348
You owe me that much.
- ...but you drop a few bullets

1874
01:59:08,432 --> 01:59:10,058
- into the batter...
- Hannibal, don't do this.

1875
01:59:10,142 --> 01:59:12,310
Lynch, no!
- Hannibal, please.

1876
01:59:12,394 --> 01:59:13,728
Oh, God.

1877
01:59:15,564 --> 01:59:17,607
...and that cake don't bake.

1878
01:59:17,691 --> 01:59:21,402
Uh-oh. Your witness,
your gun, your problem.

1879
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:27,367
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1880
01:59:33,123 --> 01:59:36,042
Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

1881
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:41,339
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

1882
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,883
l'm bleeding. You're bleeding.

1883
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:46,719
Don't get up.

1884
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,769
God damn it!

1885
01:59:55,312 --> 01:59:58,147
Your muay Thai is as bad
as yourjujitsu, Lynch.

1886
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:02,068
Better stick with a gun.

1887
02:00:02,152 --> 02:00:05,405
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1888
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:23,798
l told you l would shoot you.

1889
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:26,968
Kevlar saved your life.

1890
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,138
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if l pop you in the head.

1891
02:00:30,222 --> 02:00:32,348
lt does if you melt it down.

1892
02:00:33,976 --> 02:00:35,518
Hannibal, don't do this.

1893
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,770
- Hannibal, please.
- So, you beat a guy like that

1894
02:00:37,855 --> 02:00:39,814
by drawing him in with three things.

1895
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:42,901
- Distraction.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?

1896
02:00:42,985 --> 02:00:44,485
Diversion.

1897
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:46,112
And division.

1898
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:50,742
Hannibal, don't leave me alive.

1899
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:53,828
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1900
02:00:57,249 --> 02:00:58,625
What the...

1901
02:01:13,223 --> 02:01:14,641
That's good.

1902
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:18,269
Surprise.

1903
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:20,855
Agent Burress.

1904
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,691
What did you call me?

1905
02:01:24,526 --> 02:01:26,569
Agent Vance Burress?
Isn't that your name?

1906
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:29,197
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here,

1907
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:33,451
and unless you have a piece of paper
that looks exactly like...

1908
02:01:34,161 --> 02:01:35,578
That's funny. That's what l said.

1909
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,205
She's quoting me.

1910
02:01:37,456 --> 02:01:39,165
Easy, easy.

1911
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,252
You're under arrest for attempted murder,

1912
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,296
violations of the Civil False Claims Act,

1913
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,883
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1914
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,385
Easy.

1915
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,139
l guess the plan went okay,

1916
02:01:55,224 --> 02:01:58,810
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which l didn't account for at all.

1917
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:00,895
Bullets didn't go through.

1918
02:02:01,897 --> 02:02:03,606
Hannibal, don't do this.
Hannibal, please.

1919
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:05,692
How are you feeling, man?

1920
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:07,402
Not... Not good.

1921
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:09,529
- What's wrong?
- Not good.

1922
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,781
l feel sane.

1923
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:14,325
l should have shot you in the head
a long time ago.

1924
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:17,161
ls it crazy
that l'm feeling your anxiety right now?

1925
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:18,246
Do l look anxious to you?

1926
02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:20,248
You think l'm beaten?

1927
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:23,584
l'm bleeding, l'm not sweating.

1928
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:26,713
Let's take him out of here, guys.
Go ahead, princess.

1929
02:02:30,718 --> 02:02:34,470
What's the difference between
a concussion and a contusion?

1930
02:02:35,472 --> 02:02:38,015
- lt don't matter, bro. You tore up.
- Murdock, that was beautiful.

1931
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,684
You were right. The helmet worked.

1932
02:02:39,768 --> 02:02:41,769
Ketchup worked great.

1933
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:44,689
You did a great job. You okay?

1934
02:02:44,773 --> 02:02:45,940
- Yeah.
- Got your bell rung?

1935
02:02:46,024 --> 02:02:49,694
Just let Hannibal
make the plans next time.

1936
02:02:50,195 --> 02:02:52,321
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay?

1937
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:54,282
How's the conscience, big guy?

1938
02:02:55,993 --> 02:02:57,285
At peace.

1939
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,088
Keep it turning.

1940
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:11,340
We already got them on the exits.

1941
02:03:11,425 --> 02:03:14,010
- We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.
- Which one of you is Sosa?

1942
02:03:14,094 --> 02:03:15,678
- l am. l am.
- l need to talk to Sosa.

1943
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:17,513
As of right now your prisoner
is to be remanded

1944
02:03:17,598 --> 02:03:19,432
- into federal custody.
- l have a warrant for this man.

1945
02:03:19,516 --> 02:03:22,101
As of right now...
- I'll tell you what... l'm a doc.

1946
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:23,686
Let me doctor you up. Let me help you out.

1947
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,022
Do you need stitches?
Please tell me you need stitches.

1948
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:27,523
l can stitch you up really good.

1949
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,485
Gentlemen.

1950
02:03:32,654 --> 02:03:33,988
The Central lntelligence Agency

1951
02:03:34,072 --> 02:03:36,407
believes in and evinces
a profound moral ethic,

1952
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:38,743
as well as an unshakable
professional standard.

1953
02:03:38,827 --> 02:03:42,997
As such, we would like to extend
our most sincere apologies

1954
02:03:43,081 --> 02:03:44,499
for what's happened here.

1955
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:48,795
- Good day and God bless.
- Where are you taking him?

1956
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:52,590
Who?

1957
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:59,347
l never got your name.

1958
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:03,601
My name is Lynch.

1959
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:07,063
Of course it is.

1960
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:11,025
Did he just say Lynch?

1961
02:04:15,447 --> 02:04:16,781
Let it go.

1962
02:04:23,288 --> 02:04:24,497
Hey. Do not touch me.

1963
02:04:25,332 --> 02:04:26,624
Take it easy, guys.

1964
02:04:26,708 --> 02:04:29,377
Everybody, stand down!
Stand down!

1965
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:32,380
- Get those plates.
- Everybody, stand down!

1966
02:04:32,464 --> 02:04:35,216
- That's an order. Hey, you, stand down.
- What is wrong with you?

1967
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:36,509
Lieutenant.

1968
02:04:36,593 --> 02:04:37,760
Sir, when did you arrive? l had no idea...

1969
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,720
- Just give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

1970
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:43,307
Get your hands off me, tough guy.

1971
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:50,314
Well, that's one hell of a mess.
But we did get the plates.

1972
02:04:51,733 --> 02:04:54,986
Unfortunately, l'm gonna have to charge
you all with escaping lawful custody.

1973
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,779
What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

1974
02:04:56,864 --> 02:05:00,575
B.A., we were wrongly convicted,
but it's still illegal to break out of jail.

1975
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:01,993
Director McCready, Smith and his team

1976
02:05:02,077 --> 02:05:03,536
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

1977
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:07,707
They're still level-10 federal fugitives
and l need that off my desk.

1978
02:05:07,791 --> 02:05:09,792
This is chickenshit, sir.

1979
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:12,295
Yeah, well, you know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

1980
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:15,756
but for you, Captain, we're re-promoting
you to your former rank.

1981
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,174
So, look, they're gonna be delivered

1982
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:18,801
to the U.S. Marshals Service
here in Long Beach.

1983
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:20,720
- And there should be a C-5 transport...
- l understand, but...

1984
02:05:20,804 --> 02:05:22,096
...on the tarmac in half an hour.

1985
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,599
- This needs to be done.
- This is really unfair, sir.

1986
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:27,351
- This is bullshit.
- l'm like Harry Houdini.

1987
02:05:27,811 --> 02:05:29,061
l chew through your cuffs.

1988
02:05:29,146 --> 02:05:31,898
- Get up. Step up. Get in there!
- Step up!

1989
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:34,233
Let's go. Get moving.
- Stop. Wait, stop.

1990
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:36,027
Move it.
- Wait.

1991
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:38,279
- This is so wrong.
- lt got a little aggressive.

1992
02:05:38,363 --> 02:05:39,864
- Don't worry about it.
- This is really, really wrong,

1993
02:05:39,948 --> 02:05:42,450
and l'm going to do everything l can
to fix it.

1994
02:05:42,534 --> 02:05:45,119
- l know you will.
- l'm so sorry, Face.

1995
02:06:21,114 --> 02:06:22,698
Nice plan, Face.

1996
02:06:23,241 --> 02:06:27,036
Yeah. We just traded Lynches,
and we're going back to prison.

1997
02:06:27,162 --> 02:06:29,080
We returned the plates.
We can hold our heads high.

1998
02:06:29,164 --> 02:06:30,373
We did the right thing.

1999
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:33,626
Yeah, and look what they did to us.
This is some bullshit.

2000
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,878
They burned us again, Hannibal.

2001
02:06:36,004 --> 02:06:38,798
We trusted the system and it turned on us.

2002
02:06:38,882 --> 02:06:42,009
Remember, boys, no matter
how random things might appear,

2003
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:44,637
there is still a plan. Kid.

2004
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:49,350
Well, l don't mean
to steal your line, boss, but...

2005
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:59,610
Yeah.
- l love it when a plan comes together.

2006
02:07:05,158 --> 02:07:06,742
Still wanted
by the government,

2007
02:07:07,285 --> 02:07:09,954
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

2008
02:07:12,165 --> 02:07:14,250
If you have a problem,

2009
02:07:15,252 --> 02:07:17,253
if no one else can help,

2010
02:07:18,213 --> 02:07:20,214
and if you can find them,

2011
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,216
maybe you can hire

2012
02:07:24,803 --> 02:07:26,262
the A-Team.

2013
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:08,711
Yeah!

2014
02:12:09,305 --> 02:13:09,501
