3
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:15,812
Do you know
what time it is?

4
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,645
Can't sleep.

5
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,914
There are tabs
for that.

6
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,718
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

7
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,786
Dreams again?

8
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,659
Wanna fight?

9
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:34,428
I slipped.

10
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,363
Right, you slipped

11
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,365
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

12
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,264
I was already slipping

13
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,533
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

14
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,136
The two events
were not related.

15
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:42,705
Tell me about this dream.

16
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,744
- Anything new?
- No.

17
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,714
You have to let go
of the past.

18
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,982
I don't remember my past.

19
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:56,651
It's causing you doubt,

20
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,454
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

21
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:07,664
Control it.

22
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,532
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

23
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,000
with the
Supreme Intelligence.

24
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,872
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

25
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,176
Humor is a distraction.

26
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,379
And anger?

27
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,816
Anger only serves
the enemy.

28
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,660
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

29
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,696
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

30
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:43,030
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

31
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,865
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

32
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,635
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

33
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:48,905
in its true form.

34
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:52,006
You know that.

35
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,742
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

36
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:58,278
So it's sacred.
It's personal.

37
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,414
No Kree divulges it, ever.

38
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,417
Who do you see?

39
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:03,584
- Your brother?
- No.

40
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:04,852
- Father?
- No.

41
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,021
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

42
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,424
It's me you see,
isn't it?

43
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,425
I see
what you're trying to do.

44
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:12,893
- Is it working?
- Yes.

45
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,762
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

46
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:17,364
What is the point
of giving me these...

47
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,066
if you don't want me
to use them?

48
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,935
I want you to use them.

49
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,837
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

50
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,805
of showing you
how to use them.

51
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:25,673
I know how.

52
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:26,974
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

53
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:27,977
knock me down without them.

54
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,781
Control your impulses.

55
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,916
Stop using this,
start using this.

56
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,922
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

57
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,297
Vers.

58
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:25,065
Intelligence.

59
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,135
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

60
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,804
I am.

61
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:33,407
You struggle
with your emotions...

62
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,778
with your past,
which fuels them.

63
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,714
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

64
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,918
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,987
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

66
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,991
then take over our planets.

67
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,693
Horrors that you remember...

68
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,331
and so much that you do not.

69
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,736
It's all blank.
My life.

70
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,438
You're supposed
to take the form

71
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,106
of who I most admire...

72
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:10,744
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

73
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,813
Perhaps this is a mercy

74
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,749
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

75
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:19,653
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...

76
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,156
put your people's needs
before your own.

77
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:24,692
We've given you
a great gift.

78
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:27,129
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

79
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:29,964
I want to serve.

80
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,032
Then master yourself.

81
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,704
What was given
can be taken away.

82
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:40,174
I won't let you down.

83
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,411
We'll know soon enough.

84
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,480
You have a mission.

85
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,150
Serve well, and with honor.

86
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,771
This can't be good.

87
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,806
Must be another
Skrull attack.

88
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,143
Whatever it is, it's big.

89
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,677
Has a Skrull
ever simmed you?

90
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,845
Once.

91
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:20,214
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

92
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:22,616
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy...

93
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,852
and the face staring back
was my own.

94
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,053
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

95
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,688
then it would be
less disturbing.

96
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,790
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

97
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,025
You never laugh.

98
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:34,094
I laugh on the inside.

99
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,496
I'm not doing that now.

100
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:36,664
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

101
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,865
you're quite handsome.

102
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,066
Well, thank you.

103
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,669
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

104
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,705
All right.

105
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,573
Prepare for...

106
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,510
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

107
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,780
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

108
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,748
This time, Torfa.

109
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,849
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

110
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,155
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

111
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,723
The Skrull general, Talos,

112
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,591
has sent kill units
to find him.

113
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,160
Should they reach him
before we do...

114
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:07,561
the intelligence
he's acquired

115
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,131
over three years
is as good as theirs.

116
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,066
The Accusers will bomb

117
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:14,168
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

118
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,638
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

119
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,774
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

120
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:23,043
The Torfan populace.

121
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,545
We are not to interfere
with them,

122
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,546
nor them with us.

123
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:29,083
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

124
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:31,085
Proceed with caution.

125
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,255
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

126
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,724
This is
a dangerous mission.

127
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,660
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

128
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:41,128
if that is our fate today.

129
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,262
For the good of all Kree.

130
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:43,265
For the good
of all Kree!

131
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,203
Vers,
track Soh-Larr's beacon.

132
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,908
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

133
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,195
Locals on the periphery.

134
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,695
Maybe a dozen.

135
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,130
Minn-Erva?

136
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,169
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

137
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,169
Repeat.

138
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:45,285
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

139
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,888
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

140
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,123
Only one way in,
only one way out.

141
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,858
We can get past the locals.

142
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,461
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

143
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:54,862
You don't have to go
with me. I'll go alone.

144
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:55,865
No, you won't.

145
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,003
Right. We keep a close radius.

146
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,040
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

147
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:07,276
Come on.

148
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,088
Att-Lass, you getting this?

149
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,392
Copy. I see them.

150
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:33,769
Get back!

151
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:35,338
Commander?

152
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:45,946
Get back! Back!

153
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,717
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

154
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:51,952
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

155
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,756
Does anybody copy?

156
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,128
I don't wanna hurt you.

157
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:02,965
Keep back!

158
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:07,370
Stay back!

159
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,141
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

160
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,844
They're just starving.

161
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,036
HGX-78.

162
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,841
TRT79-VVX6.

163
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,246
Get back.

164
00:12:58,488 --> 00:12:59,489
Skrulls!

165
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,373
Vers!

166
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,575
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

167
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,445
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

168
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:42,465
Incoming!

169
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,470
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

170
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,806
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

171
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:53,408
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

172
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,642
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

173
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:57,177
How did you know the code?

174
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,416
How about
I tell you my secret...

175
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,453
when you've told me yours?

176
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:08,491
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

177
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,136
<i>Where are we?</i>

178
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:24,474
<i>Stand by.</i>

179
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,477
Where's your head at?

180
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:31,011
In the clouds.
Where's yours?

181
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,513
On my shoulders.

182
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:34,349
About to show these boys
how we do it.

183
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,916
You ready?

184
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:36,983
Higher, further,
faster, baby.

185
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:37,986
That's right.

186
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,298
<i>This can't be right.</i>

187
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,166
<i>Go back even further.</i>

188
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,241
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

189
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:15,390
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

190
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,524
What the hell
are you thinking?

191
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:17,558
You don't belong out here!

192
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,259
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>

193
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,661
You let him drive.

194
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:22,164
<i>Let me try something.</i>

195
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,966
Give up already!

196
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,470
You don't belong out here!

197
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:32,205
You're not strong enough.

198
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,476
You'll kill yourself.

199
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:41,114
They'll never let you fly.

200
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:43,518
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

201
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,753
You're a decent pilot.

202
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:46,788
But you're too emotional.

203
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,056
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

204
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,568
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

205
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,671
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

206
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:04,639
And so,

207
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,274
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

208
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,610
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

209
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,246
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

210
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:15,516
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

211
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,751
<i>Charming memory.</i>

212
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:18,084
<i>Hang on.</i>

213
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,389
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

214
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,626
Goose likes you.

215
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,260
She doesn't typically
take to people.

216
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:28,663
Early start to your morning.

217
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,096
Uh, late night, actually.

218
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:32,165
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

219
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,099
Sound familiar?

220
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,704
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

221
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,805
Wonderful view, isn't it?

222
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:40,040
I prefer the view
from up there.

223
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,342
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

224
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:43,478
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

225
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,180
<i>Stand by.</i>

226
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,217
Sound familiar?

227
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,588
Wonderful view, isn't it?

228
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,623
I prefer the view
from up there.

229
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,057
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

230
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,158
<i>What's that
on her shirt?</i>

231
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,362
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

232
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,665
Wonderful view, isn't it?

233
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,602
I prefer the view
from up there.

234
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,203
- <i>Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?

235
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,072
<i>Look down.</i>

236
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,107
<i>Focus.</i>

237
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,777
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

238
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,745
Do you hear that, too?

239
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,382
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

240
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,049
<i>Got it.</i>

241
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,455
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

242
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,394
<i>Interesting.</i>

243
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,496
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

244
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,301
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

245
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:41,869
That's no MiG, Lawson.

246
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:44,505
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

247
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,676
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

248
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,745
<i>Focus.</i>

249
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,380
<i>Open, please.</i>

250
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:53,748
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

251
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,815
<i>You're almost there.</i>

252
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,686
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

253
00:17:58,421 --> 00:17:59,622
<i>Focus!</i>

254
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:03,125
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

255
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,195
This doesn't make any sense.

256
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:28,416
Do we have any information
we can act on?

257
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,217
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

258
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,353
We're on our way.

259
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:35,221
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

260
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:38,394
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

261
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,096
And everything we're after.

262
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:49,672
Oh!

263
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,939
That did something.

264
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:53,376
Try that again.

265
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:05,888
Not yet!

266
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,632
What did you do to me?

267
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,600
Now we're just after
a little information.

268
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,302
What did you put in my head?

269
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,205
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

270
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,307
But those aren't my memories.

271
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,843
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

272
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:31,345
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

273
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,547
They really did
a number on you.

274
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,715
Enough of your mind games.

275
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,617
What do you want?

276
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,888
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

277
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,657
and her light-speed engine.

278
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,525
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

279
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,163
Really? Then why is she
in your head?

280
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,260
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

281
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,263
how these things come off,
would ya?

282
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:22,897
No?

283
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:24,299
Fine.

284
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:47,990
Hmm.

285
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:56,959
Hey.

286
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:03,633
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>

287
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,884
You leaving so soon?

288
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,421
We're just getting to know
each other.

289
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,807
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

290
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:56,679
Hello? Do you copy?

291
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:28,108
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

292
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,445
Is this C-53?

293
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,682
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

294
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:36,951
Yeah. I understand you.

295
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,018
Oh, good.

296
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,056
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

297
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,727
Sort of. Uh,
the movie theater has its own guy.

298
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,997
Where can I find
communications equipment?

299
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,205
Thank you.

300
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,240
Track the pod.
Find the girl.

301
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:34,877
She knows more
than she knows.

302
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,214
Hey.

303
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:40,916
This one's taken.

304
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:53,193
Come on.

305
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:54,362
<i>Vers?</i>

306
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:55,631
Vers?

307
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:58,299
Verify. CTC-39.

308
00:25:58,301 --> 00:25:59,767
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

309
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:00,936
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

310
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,670
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

311
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,639
Skrull ambush.

312
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:07,241
I thought we'd lost you.

313
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,376
Did you find Soh-Larr?

314
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:09,877
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

315
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,945
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

316
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,181
That's impossible.

317
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:16,183
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

318
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,751
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

319
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:18,852
The machine that they used...

320
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,255
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

321
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:22,390
Vers, where are you?

322
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:24,792
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

323
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:27,194
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

324
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,796
<i>Who?</i>

325
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,032
She's who I see.

326
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:33,736
<i>She's what?</i>

327
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:35,738
<i>Vers?</i>

328
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:37,807
Vers, what?

329
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,408
She's a scientist.

330
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,643
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

331
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:44,244
I have to get to her
before they do...

332
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:45,946
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

333
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,750
No. You've been
caught once already.

334
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:51,118
How far is C-53?

335
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,821
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

336
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:55,956
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

337
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,025
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

338
00:26:58,027 --> 00:26:59,993
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

339
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,095
<i>We're sorry.</i>

340
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,262
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

341
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:02,763
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>

342
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:04,967
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

343
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,502
Vers?

344
00:27:07,504 --> 00:27:09,002
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

345
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,105
Vers?

346
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,941
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

347
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:15,945
She's stronger
than you think.

348
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,781
Ever been to C-53?

349
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:20,383
Once.

350
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,351
It's a real shithole.

351
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:36,799
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

352
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,308
Did you call this in?

353
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,056
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

354
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:06,026
Excuse me, miss.

355
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:08,463
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

356
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,932
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

357
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:14,437
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

358
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:17,338
Oh.

359
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,007
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

360
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,344
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

361
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:27,848
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

362
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,850
Could I see
some identification, please?

363
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:31,352
Vers. Kree Starforce.

364
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:32,453
We don't carry
our identification

365
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:33,521
on little cards.

366
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:34,723
Vers?

367
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:37,226
Starforce?

368
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:40,194
How long you plan
to be in town?

369
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,362
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

370
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,829
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

371
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,401
that are infiltrating
your planet.

372
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:46,769
Skrulls?

373
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:48,336
Shapeshifters?

374
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:51,408
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

375
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:55,075
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

376
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,978
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

377
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,351
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

378
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,320
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

379
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:07,388
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

380
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,491
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

381
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,761
You're under arrest.

382
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:21,804
Rook!

383
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:23,906
Rook, let's roll!

384
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,915
Did you see her weapon?

385
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,016
I did not.

386
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:47,062
Watch it!

387
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:22,097
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

388
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:45,954
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

389
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,095
"Trust me, true believer."

390
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,209
Get off!

391
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,600
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

392
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:42,605
Let's greet them
at the station.

393
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:56,251
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>

394
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,288
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

395
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,156
And, uh,
where'd everybody go?

396
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,160
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

397
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:34,715
We need an ambulance!

398
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:36,182
Someone call 911!

399
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:37,718
Hey! You all right?

400
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone okay?

401
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:40,688
Anyone else see that?

402
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,425
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

403
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:34,609
Nice scuba suit.

404
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,716
Lighten up, honey, huh?

405
00:35:41,718 --> 00:35:43,586
Got a smile for me?

406
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,124
Freak.

407
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:12,278
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

408
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,649
Whatever he runs on,

409
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,216
it's not
on the periodic table.

410
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,688
You're saying
he's not from around here?

411
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:20,757
Hey, how's your eye?

412
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:24,257
Well, I'd say fine...

413
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:26,562
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

414
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:34,402
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

415
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:36,437
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

416
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,340
And the woman said
that there were more?

417
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:41,409
The word she used
was "infiltration."

418
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:42,576
You believe her?

419
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,879
Not till I saw this.

420
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:47,948
What's your plan?

421
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,917
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

422
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:52,319
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

423
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,254
that fits her description.

424
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:56,991
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

425
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:59,427
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

426
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:00,430
Good.

427
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:04,266
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

428
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:07,501
Not even our own men.

429
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:08,705
Yes, sir.

430
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:26,353
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

431
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:29,859
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

432
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:37,299
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

433
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,971
I will finish
what we started.

434
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,648
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

435
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,419
No one in or out.

436
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:33,354
Boom!

437
00:38:58,548 --> 00:38:59,980
What can I get ya?

438
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:01,551
Where was
this photograph taken?

439
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:03,717
An airport.

440
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,052
Where's Pegasus?

441
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,121
That's classified.

442
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:10,493
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

443
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:14,795
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

444
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:16,630
Grunge is a good look
for you.

445
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:18,165
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

446
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,867
It was cool, you know?

447
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:22,837
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

448
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,874
Got to watch
an alien autopsy.

449
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,609
Typical nine-to-five.

450
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:29,543
So you saw one?

451
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,515
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

452
00:39:33,482 --> 00:39:35,716
but I can't unsee that.

453
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:38,419
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

454
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,788
You think I'm one of
those green things.

455
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,156
Can't be too careful.

456
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:47,127
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

457
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:48,662
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

458
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:50,764
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

459
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,700
No. The DNA would match.

460
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:53,901
Want my AOL password?

461
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:55,936
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

462
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,940
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

463
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,041
You wanna get personal.

464
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:02,943
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

465
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,578
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

466
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,046
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

467
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:07,548
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

468
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,616
Do I pass?

469
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:10,017
Not yet. First job?

470
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,886
Soldier. Straight out of
high school.

471
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:13,153
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

472
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:14,521
- Then?
- Spy.

473
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:15,656
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

474
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:16,891
We were everywhere.

475
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:19,760
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

476
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:21,495
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

477
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:22,663
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

478
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:23,764
for the past six years...

479
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:24,865
trying to figure out
where our

480
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:25,933
future enemies
are coming from.

481
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,134
Never occurred to me

482
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,670
they would be coming
from above.

483
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:31,005
Name a detail so bizarre

484
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,441
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

485
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:38,514
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

486
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:41,949
You didn't need that,
did you?

487
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,686
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

488
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:46,020
Okay. Your turn.

489
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:47,757
Prove you're not a Skrull.

490
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:58,933
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

491
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,234
you're not a Skrull?

492
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:01,637
That's a photon blast.

493
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,070
And?

494
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:04,073
A Skrull can't do that.

495
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,540
So, a full bird colonel

496
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,808
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

497
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,179
must have pretty high
security clearance.

498
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:11,881
Where's Pegasus?

499
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,621
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

500
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:22,556
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

501
00:41:22,558 --> 00:41:26,727
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

502
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:29,263
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.

503
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:32,935
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

504
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,103
They believe
that she developed

505
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:38,105
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

506
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:39,742
Light-speed engine?

507
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,142
Gotta admit, that's not

508
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,711
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

509
00:41:43,713 --> 00:41:45,313
Well, it's still early.

510
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:47,581
And you,
what do you want?

511
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,883
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

512
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:50,886
And?

513
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:58,592
Look, war is
a universal language.

514
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:01,295
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

515
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,699
You got a personal stake
in this.

516
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,609
<i>This is government property.</i>

517
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,611
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

518
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:20,781
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

519
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:22,918
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

520
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,853
<i>One moment.</i>

521
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:29,990
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

522
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,725
Everybody calls me Fury.

523
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:35,763
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

524
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:37,231
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

525
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:38,966
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

526
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:40,134
What about your kids?

527
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:42,069
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

528
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:43,304
<i>You are cleared
for access.</i>

529
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:44,307
Thank you.

530
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:16,136
Oh, hold up.

531
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,874
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

532
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:21,877
Put that on.

533
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:25,346
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

534
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:28,148
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

535
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,883
help with the covert part
of your job?

536
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:32,088
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

537
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,290
Lose the flannel.

538
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:47,402
How can I help you?

539
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,605
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

540
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,041
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

541
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:56,245
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

542
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,281
Do you know her?

543
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,920
Follow me.

544
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:06,622
Hmm.

545
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,628
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

546
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,630
No.

547
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:18,100
Well, this ain't it.

548
00:44:25,342 --> 00:44:26,740
Is that a communicator?

549
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:30,110
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

550
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:31,312
Who are you paging?

551
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:35,050
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

552
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:14,888
After you.

553
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,524
Impressive.

554
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:19,295
Oh, you should see what I
can do with a paperclip.

555
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:32,274
Hey, there. How are you?

556
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:37,144
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

557
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:39,780
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

558
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:42,015
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

559
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:43,150
What's your name?

560
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:46,053
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

561
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:47,056
Fury?

562
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,325
Hmm?

563
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,894
I'll be back.

564
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:57,432
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

565
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,001
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

566
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:05,806
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

567
00:46:05,808 --> 00:46:06,940
When all you had to do was...

568
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:08,345
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

569
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:27,497
Huh. Lawson.

570
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:40,843
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

571
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,278
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

572
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,784
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

573
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:52,389
Kree glyphs?

574
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:54,023
Hmm?

575
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,992
Lawson is not cuckoo.

576
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:01,094
She's Kree.

577
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:03,598
Well, she's dead.

578
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,265
What?

579
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,067
She crashed
the Asis aircraft

580
00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:09,136
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

581
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:11,238
Took a pilot down
with her.

582
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,508
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

583
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,546
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

584
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,983
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

585
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,021
When did this crash happen?

586
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:29,892
Six years ago. 1989.

587
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:33,226
Who was the pilot?

588
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:36,497
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

589
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:40,967
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

590
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:43,005
Last person
to see them alive.

591
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:49,412
You okay?

592
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,382
Mm-hmm.

593
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:55,284
Back in a minute.

594
00:48:25,348 --> 00:48:27,582
This isn't about
fighting wars.

595
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:29,184
It's about ending them.

596
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:36,990
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

597
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:40,060
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

598
00:48:40,062 --> 00:48:42,697
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>

599
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:44,432
I just discovered
a mission report

600
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:46,266
sent from C-53.

601
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:47,368
There's only so much

602
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,072
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

603
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:58,078
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

604
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,682
She was working
on a unique energy core.

605
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:03,183
Experimenting with tech

606
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:06,054
that apparently could
help us win the war.

607
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,194
She still here?

608
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,697
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

609
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:18,733
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

610
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:20,703
I want to
question her alone.

611
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,674
Excellent work, Nicholas.

612
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,445
Does it say anything
about me?

613
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,313
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

614
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:33,246
<i>Why would it?</i>

615
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:36,684
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

616
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:38,388
<i>On C-53?</i>

617
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,289
Mar-Vell is who I see

618
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:43,724
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

619
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:47,194
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

620
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,530
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

621
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:51,499
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

622
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:53,434
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

623
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:55,770
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

624
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:59,241
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

625
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,510
She's on sublevel six.

626
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,144
I'll get off on five...

627
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:07,315
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

628
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:10,451
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

629
00:50:10,453 --> 00:50:13,423
Right. Like we did
in Havana.

630
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:25,366
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>

631
00:50:25,368 --> 00:50:27,735
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

632
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:30,304
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

633
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:32,007
Together.

634
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:35,712
Okay.

635
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:55,063
Vers!

636
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:58,033
Vers!

637
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:16,551
Fury's colluding
with the target.

638
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,885
Then why would he call us in?

639
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,453
All I know is
we take him in, too.

640
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:20,588
Dead or alive.

641
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,889
Dead or alive?

642
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:37,941
Go. Go, go!

643
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,622
Was it something I said?

644
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,674
Mmm-mmm.

645
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:35,763
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

646
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:39,769
but they do
kinda complete the look.

647
00:52:40,503 --> 00:52:41,704
Don't you think?

648
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:00,488
You called them in?

649
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,824
My bad.

650
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:18,005
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

651
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:19,742
They're not down here.

652
00:53:21,276 --> 00:53:22,311
Let's try up there.

653
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:32,853
- What?
- Your communicator.

654
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:34,922
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

655
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:07,421
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

656
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:08,556
Uh, we'll see.

657
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:09,959
That's a yes or no question.

658
00:54:13,996 --> 00:54:14,997
Yes.

659
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:20,268
That's what I'm talking about!

660
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,731
We got a stowaway.

661
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:53,903
Hang on, Goose.

662
00:54:59,075 --> 00:55:00,275
Goose.

663
00:55:03,446 --> 00:55:04,447
No, Goose.

664
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:09,416
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

665
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:11,085
Yes, that's right.

666
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:13,454
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

667
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:14,755
You the good kitty,
that's right.

668
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:15,892
See anyone you know?

669
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,426
Funny story.

670
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:22,965
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

671
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,065
That was six years ago.

672
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,468
So, you think
you're the pilot

673
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,803
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

674
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:31,138
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

675
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,473
could probably tell us.

676
00:55:32,475 --> 00:55:34,074
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:36,777
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

678
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,448
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

679
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:42,917
That agent...

680
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,985
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

681
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:47,054
Coulson. The new guy.

682
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:48,656
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

683
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:50,393
Yeah, well, give him time.

684
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:54,061
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

685
00:55:54,063 --> 00:55:56,497
Went with his gut
against orders.

686
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:57,932
That's a really
hard thing to do.

687
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,967
But it's what
keeps us human.

688
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:02,603
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

689
00:56:02,605 --> 00:56:03,737
Oh, I can see that about you.

690
00:56:04,874 --> 00:56:09,043
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

691
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:10,477
I'm guessing that's not

692
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,112
standard
Kree operating procedure.

693
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:14,481
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

694
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,757
Ronan.

695
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,793
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

696
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,194
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

697
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:28,596
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

698
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:30,064
It was a trap

699
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:32,900
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

700
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:34,034
<i>Give us their location.</i>

701
00:56:34,036 --> 00:56:35,903
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

702
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:38,839
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

703
00:56:38,841 --> 00:56:41,041
No, we'll handle this.

704
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:43,143
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

705
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:45,479
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>

706
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:46,547
<i>Where are they?</i>

707
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,117
- They are...
- Lost.

708
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:51,919
They are lost for now.

709
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:53,654
But we will find them.

710
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:57,026
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

711
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,666
Maintain the course
for C-53.

712
00:57:22,885 --> 00:57:25,054
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

713
00:57:27,189 --> 00:57:28,756
Auntie Carol?

714
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,693
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

715
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:34,595
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

716
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:36,666
But we knew they were lying.

717
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:40,870
I'm not really
who you think I am.

718
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:52,146
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

719
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:55,282
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

720
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:56,984
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

721
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:58,719
There is no such thing.

722
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:00,087
'Cause if there were,

723
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:02,790
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

724
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:03,859
You don't believe me?

725
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,600
No way!

726
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:15,669
That's so cool!

727
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:17,104
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

728
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:18,539
with those hands.

729
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,640
Like what? Show us.

730
00:58:19,642 --> 00:58:20,943
Maybe later.

731
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:23,677
I kept all your stuff.

732
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:25,813
I'll go get it.

733
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:27,483
You want to give her
a hand with that?

734
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:28,784
Hmm?

735
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,735
You don't remember anything?

736
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:50,539
I see flashes.

737
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:52,975
Little moments.

738
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:55,578
But I can't tell
what's real.

739
00:58:57,813 --> 00:59:01,682
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

740
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:03,919
maybe it'll all
make sense.

741
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:10,325
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

742
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:12,760
Your usual move.

743
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:15,696
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

744
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:18,232
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

745
00:59:18,234 --> 00:59:20,934
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

746
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:22,236
at doing something
that mattered.

747
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:25,139
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

748
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:26,073
and I wasn't about to argue,

749
00:59:26,075 --> 00:59:28,175
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

750
00:59:28,177 --> 00:59:30,611
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

751
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:32,179
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

752
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:33,280
Since it violates
the predetermined

753
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:34,382
rules of engagement.

754
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:35,849
I definitely
don't remember those.

755
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:37,651
Hmm. Of course you don't.

756
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:47,861
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

757
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:51,865
She said
she had lives to save.

758
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:53,267
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

759
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:54,402
but you said that...

760
00:59:54,404 --> 00:59:58,205
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

761
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:03,077
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.

762
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,014
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

763
01:00:07,016 --> 01:00:10,818
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

764
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,358
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

765
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,892
I know this must be
hard for you.

766
01:00:18,894 --> 01:00:20,830
Oh, what?
This part right here?

767
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:23,966
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

768
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:31,205
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

769
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:32,739
in a mission so secret

770
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:34,810
they act like it never
even happened.

771
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:40,348
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

772
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,251
too damn stubborn to die.

773
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:46,454
And now you come up in here
after six years...

774
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:48,689
with your supercharged
fire hands...

775
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:50,791
and you expect me
to call you...

776
01:00:50,793 --> 01:00:52,329
I don't even know what.
Vers?

777
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,098
Is that really
who you are now?

778
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:00,136
I don't know.

779
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,842
Come look!

780
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:14,982
This is me and you
on Halloween.

781
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:18,353
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

782
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:20,087
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

783
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:22,055
You didn't get along
with your parents...

784
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:23,824
so Mom said
we became your real family.

785
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:25,393
This is us on Christmas.

786
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:26,528
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

787
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,463
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

788
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:29,796
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

789
01:01:29,798 --> 01:01:30,864
And this is right after
you graduated.

790
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:32,099
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

791
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:34,335
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

792
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:35,736
And this is you with Mom

793
01:01:35,738 --> 01:01:37,004
right after a good day
of training.

794
01:01:37,006 --> 01:01:38,306
These were
your three favorite guys.

795
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:42,042
Oh, wait. I forgot.

796
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:43,744
Your jacket.

797
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:45,078
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

798
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,782
after I spilled
ketchup on it.

799
01:02:00,196 --> 01:02:02,298
That was all
that survived the crash.

800
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,267
Or so we thought.

801
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,905
Don't answer that.

802
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:13,541
It's just my neighbor.

803
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:15,277
They can change into anyone.

804
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,049
Hi there.

805
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,052
What do you want?

806
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:26,220
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

807
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:27,888
This is my friend, Carol.

808
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,191
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

809
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,560
Yowzers.

810
01:02:32,562 --> 01:02:35,796
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

811
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:38,499
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

812
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:39,833
and I was just wondering...

813
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:41,001
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

814
01:02:41,003 --> 01:02:42,202
to get a closer look-see?

815
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:44,539
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

816
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:47,843
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

817
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,176
Mmm.

818
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:50,811
You're really working
overtime

819
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:54,181
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

820
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:56,984
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

821
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:58,586
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

822
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,490
- Uh...
- Okay.

823
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:06,827
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

824
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:08,061
You never know
when you're gonna need

825
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:09,765
to borrow some sugar.

826
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,602
Now, hang on a second.

827
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:18,306
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

828
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:21,277
making a mess
of your friend's house...

829
01:03:22,077 --> 01:03:23,478
It's a lovely home, miss.

830
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,780
Oh, my God!

831
01:03:25,214 --> 01:03:27,147
What the hell?

832
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:32,021
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

833
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:35,188
Just don't kill me.

834
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,157
That would really complicate
the situation.

835
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:39,960
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

836
01:03:39,962 --> 01:03:41,329
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

837
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:43,096
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

838
01:03:43,098 --> 01:03:46,867
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

839
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,135
Without deception.

840
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:49,339
And who is that out there?

841
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,873
Okay, that's a fair point...

842
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,475
but I'm sure
that you understand

843
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:56,910
I had to take
some precautions.

844
01:03:56,912 --> 01:04:00,113
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

845
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:01,281
with your hands bound.

846
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:02,517
I just wanna talk.

847
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:03,584
Last time we talked,

848
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,018
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

849
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,522
That was before I knew
who you were.

850
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:10,826
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

851
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,094
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

852
01:04:14,096 --> 01:04:17,130
of your voice
from a plane crash

853
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:18,599
six years ago...

854
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:23,404
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

855
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:26,139
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

856
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:27,342
How'd you get it?

857
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:28,509
She don't understand.

858
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:30,043
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

859
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:31,479
that kind of allows me

860
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:33,648
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

861
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,015
Call me
"young lady" again...

862
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:36,317
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

863
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,853
it's not supposed to be.

864
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,191
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

865
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:43,725
Your ass.

866
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:46,627
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

867
01:04:46,629 --> 01:04:48,596
But, look,
I just need your help

868
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:50,097
decoding some coordinates.

869
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,099
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

870
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:55,237
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

871
01:04:58,006 --> 01:05:00,175
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

872
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,942
Deal.

873
01:05:03,045 --> 01:05:05,078
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

874
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,414
How'd that get in here?

875
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:07,517
Hmm?

876
01:05:09,017 --> 01:05:10,117
The cat?

877
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:11,619
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

878
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:12,921
That's not a cat.

879
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:16,123
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

880
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,627
Mom?

881
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:26,367
Monica.

882
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:28,003
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

883
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:57,331
What's happening?

884
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,635
It's loading.

885
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,171
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

886
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:08,609
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

887
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:10,711
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

888
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:12,346
<i>My laboratory.</i>

889
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:14,649
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

890
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:15,683
<i>Oh, no.</i>

891
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:18,151
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

892
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:19,620
<i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>

893
01:06:19,622 --> 01:06:21,522
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

894
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:24,057
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

895
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:26,126
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

896
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:27,129
Yes, ma'am.

897
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:35,470
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

898
01:06:35,472 --> 01:06:37,072
I never should have
brought you along.

899
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:43,245
Here come some G's.

900
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,467
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

901
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:17,212
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

902
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:22,251
Stay with me, Lawson!

903
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,869
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

904
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:44,539
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

905
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,307
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

906
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:48,444
Yeah! I copy.

907
01:07:51,246 --> 01:07:52,247
Doc?

908
01:07:53,248 --> 01:07:54,617
Your blood.

909
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:57,351
It's blue.

910
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:00,490
Yeah, but, uh,
how's my hair?

911
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:04,360
Help me out, will ya?

912
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:10,565
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

913
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:12,165
Lawson?

914
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,669
You remember what I said about
our work here?

915
01:08:14,671 --> 01:08:15,772
What it's for?

916
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:18,306
To end wars?

917
01:08:18,308 --> 01:08:21,811
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

918
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:24,547
Damn it!

919
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:27,582
My name is not Lawson.

920
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:30,685
My real name is Mar-Vell,

921
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:33,621
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

922
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,190
I would say
that you're delusional...

923
01:08:37,192 --> 01:08:38,726
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

924
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:41,227
and your blood is blue.

925
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:45,231
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

926
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:47,167
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

927
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:48,469
any more regrets.

928
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:51,204
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

929
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:52,807
You gotta save 'em without me.

930
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:53,808
Save who? How?

931
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,210
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

932
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:58,448
What are you doing?

933
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:20,470
We have no interest
in hurting you.

934
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,036
No?

935
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:24,907
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

936
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,910
The energy core.

937
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:30,311
Where is it?

938
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:32,747
Pararescue's on the way.

939
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:34,915
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

940
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:37,752
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

941
01:09:37,754 --> 01:09:38,788
No, wait!

942
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,629
You mean that energy core?

943
01:09:51,266 --> 01:09:52,368
No!

944
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:39,513
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

945
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:40,516
Hold your fire.

946
01:10:50,526 --> 01:10:52,560
There's nothing left.

947
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:54,296
The core has been destroyed.

948
01:11:03,773 --> 01:11:05,775
She absorbed its power.

949
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:09,812
She's coming with us.

950
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,001
He lied to me.

951
01:11:34,704 --> 01:11:36,804
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

952
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:39,540
Now, you understand.

953
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:42,076
What?
What do I understand now?

954
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:44,111
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

955
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:45,414
He killed her...

956
01:11:46,115 --> 01:11:48,015
'cause she found out
that she was

957
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:51,452
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

958
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:52,953
No.

959
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:55,389
Your people are terrorists.

960
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,924
They kill innocents.

961
01:11:56,926 --> 01:11:58,859
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

962
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:02,563
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

963
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:06,634
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

964
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:09,737
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

965
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,872
and they destroyed
our planet.

966
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,609
And the handful of us
that are left

967
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,778
will be slaughtered next...

968
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,784
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

969
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:24,618
The core that she found

970
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,387
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

971
01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:28,155
capable of carrying us
to safety.

972
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:32,328
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

973
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,063
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

974
01:12:36,065 --> 01:12:37,598
wasn't to fight wars...

975
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,099
but to end them.

976
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:44,740
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

977
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,907
Well, I already destroyed it.

978
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,676
No, you destroyed
the engine.

979
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:51,812
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

980
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:56,183
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

981
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:57,820
we can find it.

982
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,357
You'll use it
to destroy us.

983
01:13:03,593 --> 01:13:06,562
We just want a home.

984
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:16,070
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

985
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:18,072
Can't you see it now?

986
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:19,575
You're not one of them.

987
01:13:22,612 --> 01:13:24,013
You don't know me.

988
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:27,884
You have no idea
who I am.

989
01:13:29,986 --> 01:13:32,388
I don't even know
who I am!

990
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:35,858
You are Carol Danvers.

991
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:39,226
You are the woman
on that black box

992
01:13:39,228 --> 01:13:41,864
risking her life
to do the right thing.

993
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:45,633
My best friend...

994
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:48,636
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

995
01:13:48,638 --> 01:13:50,704
when no one else did.

996
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:55,910
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

997
01:13:55,912 --> 01:13:59,246
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

998
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:02,518
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

999
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:04,654
You hear me?

1000
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,823
Do you hear me?

1001
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:17,033
Come here. Come here, girl.

1002
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:19,101
I got you.

1003
01:14:23,506 --> 01:14:26,707
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1004
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:28,943
but you were our only lead.

1005
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:31,211
We discovered
that your energy signature

1006
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:34,016
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1007
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,752
Now we know why.

1008
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:42,591
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1009
01:14:43,693 --> 01:14:45,526
I just need your help

1010
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:49,730
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1011
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:52,900
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1012
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:54,969
For orbital position
and velocity.

1013
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:56,804
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1014
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,138
'cause it's not on Earth.

1015
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,073
That was the location

1016
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:00,674
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1017
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,042
If we track its course,

1018
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:04,611
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1019
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:06,182
It's just basic physics.

1020
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:09,552
In orbit?

1021
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:13,287
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1022
01:15:13,289 --> 01:15:16,223
I mean, you're
my science guy, right?

1023
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,959
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1024
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:21,795
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1025
01:15:21,797 --> 01:15:23,664
Mmm. We're going
to space?

1026
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:24,732
In what?

1027
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:26,633
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1028
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:28,869
I can handle
the modifications.

1029
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,606
Mmm. Your science guy.

1030
01:15:37,347 --> 01:15:38,981
Well, I could use
a copilot.

1031
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:42,916
No. No, I can't.

1032
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:44,952
I can't leave Monica.

1033
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:48,255
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1034
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,624
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1035
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:52,693
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1036
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:53,729
and you used to do that.

1037
01:15:55,365 --> 01:15:57,332
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1038
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:58,999
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1039
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:00,834
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1040
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:01,935
with
a technologically-superior

1041
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:02,938
foreign enemy.

1042
01:16:03,373 --> 01:16:04,938
Correct?

1043
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,006
That's what I'm saying.

1044
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,274
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1045
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:08,675
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1046
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:09,910
in the history
of missions...

1047
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,779
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1048
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:12,982
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1049
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:14,882
What?

1050
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:16,083
I just think
you should consider...

1051
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,322
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1052
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:28,396
What's going on around here?

1053
01:16:28,398 --> 01:16:29,663
I know, I know.

1054
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,067
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1055
01:16:36,072 --> 01:16:38,406
Your mom's lucky.

1056
01:16:38,408 --> 01:16:39,907
When they were
handing out kids,

1057
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:42,109
they gave her
the toughest one.

1058
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,112
Lieutenant Trouble.

1059
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:45,748
You remembered.

1060
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:48,584
Is that mine?

1061
01:16:49,285 --> 01:16:51,419
No, no.

1062
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:54,288
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1063
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,990
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1064
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,860
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1065
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:02,930
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1066
01:17:02,932 --> 01:17:04,800
with any sense of style...

1067
01:17:06,035 --> 01:17:07,103
Hmm?

1068
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:10,239
Whoa.

1069
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,043
No.

1070
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:17,314
Uh-uh.

1071
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:20,415
Definitely not.

1072
01:17:23,386 --> 01:17:25,821
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1073
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,033
Hmm.

1074
01:17:39,336 --> 01:17:41,003
How do I look?

1075
01:17:44,441 --> 01:17:45,875
Fresh.

1076
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:07,861
What took you so long?

1077
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:10,831
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

1078
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,267
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1079
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:15,037
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1080
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,406
Okay, then let's do this.

1081
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:21,875
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1082
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:24,778
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1083
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,948
But you would never
tell me who.

1084
01:18:27,384 --> 01:18:30,784
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1085
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:32,320
The transfusion.

1086
01:18:32,322 --> 01:18:34,522
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1087
01:18:34,524 --> 01:18:35,724
Whose blood?

1088
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:39,362
Hmm.

1089
01:18:46,835 --> 01:18:50,873
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1090
01:18:55,412 --> 01:18:57,010
What have you done with her?

1091
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,981
You're too late.

1092
01:19:15,465 --> 01:19:16,499
She knows?

1093
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:34,815
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1094
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:35,949
Come at once.

1095
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,185
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1096
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:41,221
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

1097
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,027
Passing 500 and climbing.

1098
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:51,466
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1099
01:19:51,468 --> 01:19:54,935
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1100
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:57,838
And as long as he continues
to freak you out...

1101
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,106
like that...

1102
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:01,509
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1103
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:04,512
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1104
01:20:04,514 --> 01:20:06,314
Can I ask you something?

1105
01:20:06,316 --> 01:20:08,516
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

1106
01:20:08,518 --> 01:20:10,385
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1107
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:12,019
Can you all do it?

1108
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:13,954
Physiologically? Yeah.

1109
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,223
But, uh, it takes practice...

1110
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:20,160
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1111
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:22,863
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1112
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,399
What about a filing cabinet?

1113
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:27,468
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet?

1114
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,869
A Venus flytrap?

1115
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:29,936
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1116
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:31,171
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1117
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:32,973
Switching engines

1118
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:35,210
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1119
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:45,285
Hey.

1120
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:48,155
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1121
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:49,158
Pretty much.

1122
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,960
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1123
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:26,596
Where is it?

1124
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:33,133
It's here.
It's gotta be here.

1125
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:38,341
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1126
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:46,046
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1127
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:50,745
Is that it? The core?

1128
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:53,182
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1129
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,356
Whoa.

1130
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:04,193
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1131
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,239
We're not alone.

1132
01:23:42,297 --> 01:23:43,566
Talos!

1133
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:56,412
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1134
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:20,235
It's okay.

1135
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:26,841
We didn't know what to do.

1136
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:30,411
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1137
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:32,178
or the Kree would find us.

1138
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:34,283
You did the right thing.

1139
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,593
It's okay, it's okay.

1140
01:24:45,595 --> 01:24:47,664
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1141
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:51,632
I am not gonna hurt you.

1142
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:53,536
She led me to you.

1143
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:55,738
I'm so sorry.

1144
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:58,839
I didn't know.

1145
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:00,075
Carol.

1146
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:03,578
This is war.

1147
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:07,082
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1148
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:09,850
But we're here now.

1149
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:13,088
You found my family.

1150
01:25:15,925 --> 01:25:17,892
This is just the beginning.

1151
01:25:17,894 --> 01:25:20,797
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1152
01:25:21,898 --> 01:25:24,667
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1153
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:44,785
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1154
01:25:44,787 --> 01:25:46,787
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1155
01:25:49,425 --> 01:25:51,726
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1156
01:25:51,728 --> 01:25:52,829
Uh-uh.

1157
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:07,207
What did you do
to your uniform?

1158
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:09,343
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1159
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:11,211
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

1160
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:12,680
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1161
01:26:12,682 --> 01:26:15,248
Let 'em go.
You can have me.

1162
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,784
And the core?

1163
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:18,386
You lied to me.

1164
01:26:18,388 --> 01:26:22,390
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1165
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:28,696
What's given
can be taken away.

1166
01:26:42,512 --> 01:26:43,611
Back here! Move, move!

1167
01:26:43,613 --> 01:26:46,181
Get over here. Get down!

1168
01:26:46,683 --> 01:26:49,352
Let's go! Go, move!

1169
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:30,424
There she is.

1170
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:33,863
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1171
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:36,630
This jacket.

1172
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:38,634
It's killer,
by the way.

1173
01:27:40,036 --> 01:27:41,635
Oh.

1174
01:27:41,637 --> 01:27:43,871
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1175
01:27:43,873 --> 01:27:45,706
Let me out.

1176
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,641
No can do.

1177
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:51,545
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1178
01:27:51,547 --> 01:27:53,481
With what exactly?

1179
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:54,882
Your power comes from us.

1180
01:27:54,884 --> 01:27:56,817
You didn't give me
these powers.

1181
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:57,985
The blast did.

1182
01:27:57,987 --> 01:27:59,453
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1183
01:27:59,455 --> 01:28:00,556
to control them
on your own.

1184
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:13,667
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

1185
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,669
<i>Threat: high.</i>

1186
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,512
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1187
01:28:26,048 --> 01:28:27,748
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1188
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,952
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1189
01:28:31,087 --> 01:28:32,653
That thing's
clearly busted.

1190
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:34,757
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1191
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:37,560
Eject the others into space.

1192
01:28:40,463 --> 01:28:42,498
You did good, Ace.

1193
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,132
Thanks to you...

1194
01:28:45,134 --> 01:28:47,368
those insidious shapeshifters

1195
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,936
will threaten
our borders no more.

1196
01:28:48,938 --> 01:28:51,472
I used to believe
your lies...

1197
01:28:51,474 --> 01:28:54,108
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1198
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,810
You're talking
about destroying them

1199
01:28:55,812 --> 01:28:57,645
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1200
01:28:57,647 --> 01:28:58,846
And neither will I.

1201
01:28:58,848 --> 01:29:02,149
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1202
01:29:02,151 --> 01:29:03,818
You stole me.

1203
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,654
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1204
01:29:14,664 --> 01:29:16,566
It's cute how hard you try.

1205
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:20,403
But remember...

1206
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:22,970
without us...

1207
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:24,040
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1208
01:29:25,808 --> 01:29:27,107
<i>Stay down!</i>

1209
01:29:27,109 --> 01:29:28,776
...you're weak.

1210
01:29:28,778 --> 01:29:30,711
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1211
01:29:30,713 --> 01:29:32,112
You're flawed.

1212
01:29:32,114 --> 01:29:33,482
<i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>

1213
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:35,516
Helpless.

1214
01:29:35,518 --> 01:29:36,584
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1215
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:38,986
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1216
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:40,688
We saved you.

1217
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:42,156
- <i>Control it.</i>
- <i>I told you,</i>

1218
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:43,224
- <i>Carol.</i>
- <i>They'll never</i>

1219
01:29:43,226 --> 01:29:44,491
- <i>let you fly.</i>
- <i>This ain't</i>

1220
01:29:44,493 --> 01:29:45,559
- <i>a game for little girls.</i>
- <i>You kiss like a horse.</i>

1221
01:29:45,561 --> 01:29:46,729
<i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>

1222
01:29:49,799 --> 01:29:52,869
Without us,
you're only human.

1223
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:55,638
You're right.

1224
01:29:56,839 --> 01:29:58,941
I'm only human.

1225
01:30:32,909 --> 01:30:36,510
On Hala,
you were reborn...

1226
01:30:36,512 --> 01:30:37,813
Vers.

1227
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:45,755
My name is Carol.

1228
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:02,038
She's trying to break out.

1229
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:49,752
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1230
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,252
But what happens when...

1231
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:57,526
I'm finally set free?

1232
01:32:37,933 --> 01:32:40,701
You know you're glowing,
right?

1233
01:32:40,703 --> 01:32:41,704
I'll explain it later.

1234
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:45,739
Take the Tesseract.

1235
01:32:45,741 --> 01:32:46,974
Leave the lunchbox.

1236
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,709
- Me?
- Yes.

1237
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:50,110
I'm not touching that thing.

1238
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:51,180
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1239
01:32:57,053 --> 01:32:58,220
Whoa!

1240
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:07,661
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1241
01:33:07,663 --> 01:33:10,331
Take the Flerken with you.

1242
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:12,101
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1243
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:15,905
I'm picking you up now.

1244
01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:21,610
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1245
01:33:26,782 --> 01:33:27,783
Oh, hey, guys.

1246
01:33:31,687 --> 01:33:33,222
Arm wrestle
for the Tesseract?

1247
01:33:36,326 --> 01:33:38,992
I used to find you amusing.

1248
01:33:38,994 --> 01:33:39,995
Let's put an end to this.

1249
01:34:15,365 --> 01:34:16,333
Okay.

1250
01:34:16,899 --> 01:34:18,132
Good kitty.

1251
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:06,282
You knew all along.

1252
01:35:07,384 --> 01:35:08,815
Is that why
we never hung out?

1253
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:09,919
No, I just never
liked you.

1254
01:35:17,126 --> 01:35:18,127
Incoming!

1255
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:27,736
Hey, in a hurry?

1256
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:31,939
Don't make me do this.

1257
01:35:31,941 --> 01:35:32,942
Okay.

1258
01:35:48,824 --> 01:35:49,825
Come on, do your thing!

1259
01:35:50,993 --> 01:35:52,061
Come on!

1260
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:55,929
Come on!

1261
01:35:58,968 --> 01:36:00,335
Damn it, Goose.

1262
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:01,438
Pick a side.

1263
01:36:05,808 --> 01:36:07,841
Take them
to the hangar, too.

1264
01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:09,544
We'll blast them all
into space.

1265
01:36:11,548 --> 01:36:12,748
Play it cool.

1266
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:15,418
Just like Havana.

1267
01:36:17,253 --> 01:36:19,487
Do you have the thing?

1268
01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:21,123
Flerken kitty ate it.

1269
01:36:34,437 --> 01:36:36,069
Come on, move!

1270
01:36:36,071 --> 01:36:37,206
Move!

1271
01:36:37,873 --> 01:36:39,108
Follow my lead.

1272
01:36:43,112 --> 01:36:44,113
Cover her eyes.

1273
01:36:52,522 --> 01:36:54,288
Onto the ship!

1274
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,058
Let's go! Let's go!

1275
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:21,248
Nice diversion.

1276
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,052
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1277
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:22,275
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1278
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:23,346
On it.

1279
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,184
You all right, friend?

1280
01:38:30,252 --> 01:38:32,187
Never better.

1281
01:38:37,025 --> 01:38:38,661
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1282
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:20,295
Yes! Boom!

1283
01:40:36,312 --> 01:40:37,480
Whoo!

1284
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,217
What the hell was that?

1285
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:07,644
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1286
01:41:59,862 --> 01:42:01,529
That's impossible.

1287
01:42:01,531 --> 01:42:03,898
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1288
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,603
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1289
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,573
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1290
01:42:14,944 --> 01:42:16,278
Take her down.

1291
01:42:36,231 --> 01:42:37,265
Whoo!

1292
01:43:26,749 --> 01:43:28,685
Return to the jump point.

1293
01:43:29,719 --> 01:43:31,821
We'll be back
for the weapon.

1294
01:43:33,456 --> 01:43:34,624
The core?

1295
01:43:36,492 --> 01:43:37,727
The woman.

1296
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:27,410
I'm so proud of you.

1297
01:44:29,412 --> 01:44:30,778
You've come a long way

1298
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:33,380
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1299
01:44:33,382 --> 01:44:35,549
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1300
01:44:35,551 --> 01:44:37,852
long enough to take me on?

1301
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:40,590
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

1302
01:44:42,024 --> 01:44:43,891
I always told you...

1303
01:44:43,893 --> 01:44:45,392
you'll be ready

1304
01:44:45,394 --> 01:44:47,795
the day you can knock
me down as yourself.

1305
01:44:47,797 --> 01:44:49,497
This is that moment.

1306
01:44:49,499 --> 01:44:52,032
This is that moment, Vers!

1307
01:44:52,034 --> 01:44:53,434
Turn off the light show...

1308
01:44:53,436 --> 01:44:56,706
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1309
01:45:12,121 --> 01:45:14,323
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1310
01:45:30,006 --> 01:45:32,373
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1311
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:34,008
I can't go back empty-handed.

1312
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:35,943
You won't be empty-handed.

1313
01:45:35,945 --> 01:45:38,512
I'm sending you
with a message.

1314
01:45:38,514 --> 01:45:41,782
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1315
01:45:41,784 --> 01:45:44,587
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1316
01:45:46,489 --> 01:45:47,790
You can't do this.

1317
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:10,444
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1318
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,880
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1319
01:46:12,882 --> 01:46:14,014
Ow!

1320
01:46:14,016 --> 01:46:15,549
Mother Flerken!

1321
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:16,984
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1322
01:46:16,986 --> 01:46:18,621
It's just a scratch.

1323
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:20,356
No.

1324
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:29,730
I can't believe

1325
01:46:29,732 --> 01:46:31,131
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1326
01:46:31,133 --> 01:46:32,766
and I missed it.

1327
01:46:32,768 --> 01:46:34,568
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1328
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,737
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1329
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:38,873
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1330
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:40,774
I'll consider it...

1331
01:46:40,776 --> 01:46:43,911
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1332
01:46:43,913 --> 01:46:45,112
How's your eye?

1333
01:46:45,114 --> 01:46:47,548
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1334
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:48,849
Just so I'm clear...

1335
01:46:48,851 --> 01:46:50,484
you were Soh-Larr...

1336
01:46:50,486 --> 01:46:52,920
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1337
01:46:52,922 --> 01:46:55,522
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1338
01:46:55,524 --> 01:46:58,525
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1339
01:46:58,527 --> 01:46:59,860
It is a little like stealing.

1340
01:46:59,862 --> 01:47:01,595
Whose side are you on here?

1341
01:47:01,597 --> 01:47:03,097
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1342
01:47:03,099 --> 01:47:06,467
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1343
01:47:06,469 --> 01:47:08,068
I could go back
to being your boss.

1344
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:09,169
Uh, please don't.

1345
01:47:09,171 --> 01:47:12,206
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1346
01:47:12,208 --> 01:47:14,842
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1347
01:47:14,844 --> 01:47:16,877
Don't ever change
your eyes.

1348
01:47:16,879 --> 01:47:18,512
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1349
01:47:18,514 --> 01:47:20,180
I was trying
not to panic...

1350
01:47:20,182 --> 01:47:21,751
I'll help you find a home.

1351
01:47:22,818 --> 01:47:23,920
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1352
01:47:25,988 --> 01:47:28,489
They can stay here
with us.

1353
01:47:28,491 --> 01:47:30,057
Can't they, Mom?

1354
01:47:30,059 --> 01:47:32,693
They won't
be safe here, baby.

1355
01:47:32,695 --> 01:47:34,261
Auntie Carol's right.

1356
01:47:34,263 --> 01:47:35,464
They need their own home.

1357
01:47:36,632 --> 01:47:38,832
I'll be back
before you know it.

1358
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:42,202
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1359
01:47:42,204 --> 01:47:45,172
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1360
01:47:45,174 --> 01:47:46,740
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1361
01:47:46,742 --> 01:47:48,544
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1362
01:47:58,154 --> 01:48:00,690
Keep the Tesseract
on Earth.

1363
01:48:01,257 --> 01:48:02,589
Hidden.

1364
01:48:02,591 --> 01:48:04,627
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1365
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:06,560
Mar-Vell.

1366
01:48:06,562 --> 01:48:07,928
That's what I said.

1367
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:10,531
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1368
01:48:10,533 --> 01:48:11,932
Mar-Vell.

1369
01:48:11,934 --> 01:48:13,067
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1370
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:14,503
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1371
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,216
Not ringing any bells?

1372
01:48:29,218 --> 01:48:31,253
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1373
01:48:46,736 --> 01:48:48,836
I upgraded it.

1374
01:48:48,838 --> 01:48:51,207
Range should be a couple
galaxies, at least.

1375
01:48:53,909 --> 01:48:56,210
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1376
01:48:56,212 --> 01:48:59,849
For emergencies only, okay?

1377
01:49:04,354 --> 01:49:07,221
Well...

1378
01:49:07,223 --> 01:49:09,757
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1379
01:49:09,759 --> 01:49:11,794
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1380
01:49:13,963 --> 01:49:15,831
Oh!

1381
01:49:28,611 --> 01:49:30,646
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1382
01:49:35,985 --> 01:49:37,820
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1383
01:49:39,822 --> 01:49:40,990
Hmm.

1384
01:49:47,063 --> 01:49:49,797
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1385
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:04,613
Go on.

1386
01:51:11,481 --> 01:51:14,283
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1387
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:20,390
So, is it true?

1388
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,990
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1389
01:51:22,992 --> 01:51:26,260
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1390
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:30,197
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1391
01:51:30,199 --> 01:51:31,267
Understood.

1392
01:51:32,902 --> 01:51:33,867
I'm sorry to report

1393
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:35,102
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1394
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:37,338
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1395
01:51:38,974 --> 01:51:40,874
I'll let you know
when it does.

1396
01:51:40,876 --> 01:51:42,178
Then what?

1397
01:51:42,811 --> 01:51:44,111
Sir?

1398
01:51:44,113 --> 01:51:45,078
We have no idea

1399
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:48,449
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1400
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:50,518
And our one-woman
security force

1401
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,052
had a prior commitment...

1402
01:51:52,054 --> 01:51:53,856
on the other side
of the universe.

1403
01:51:56,526 --> 01:51:58,761
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1404
01:52:00,363 --> 01:52:02,229
We need to find more.

1405
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:03,364
More weapons?

1406
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:05,265
More heroes.

1407
01:52:05,267 --> 01:52:06,967
You think you can find
others like her?

1408
01:52:06,969 --> 01:52:09,972
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1409
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,274
Get some rest, sir.

1410
01:52:13,343 --> 01:52:15,211
You got
a big decision to make.

1411
01:55:14,357 --> 01:55:16,091
This is a nightmare.

1412
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:20,028
I've had better nightmares.

1413
01:55:22,164 --> 01:55:23,198
Hey.

1414
01:55:24,266 --> 01:55:26,401
So, that thing just stopped

1415
01:55:26,403 --> 01:55:28,170
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1416
01:55:30,105 --> 01:55:32,673
What do we got?

1417
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:35,275
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

1418
01:55:35,277 --> 01:55:36,377
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1419
01:55:36,379 --> 01:55:37,512
We did.

1420
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:41,315
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1421
01:55:41,317 --> 01:55:43,250
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1422
01:55:43,252 --> 01:55:44,719
We don't even know
what this is.

1423
01:55:44,721 --> 01:55:47,455
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

1424
01:55:47,457 --> 01:55:50,190
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1425
01:55:50,192 --> 01:55:52,595
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1426
01:55:55,532 --> 01:55:57,065
Where's Fury?

1427
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:36,250
