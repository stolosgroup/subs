2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,036
"Senator Samuel Foley dead."

3
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,745
Died here at Saint Vincent's.

4
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,517
"At the bedside was political
sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."

5
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,676
Long distance?

6
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:38,263
Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the governor's residence, Jackson City.

7
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,034
Oh, Joe!

8
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,169
Oh, no!

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,167
Couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

10
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,806
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him
I'm flying home tonight.

11
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,742
Right away.

12
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,036
What is it?

13
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,145
- Sam Foley's dead.
- Great saints!

14
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,280
Of all times...

15
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,645
...Foley had to go and die on us.

16
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,283
Who are you calling?

17
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,485
Taylor, my dear.

18
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,204
What's up, Happy?

19
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:03,980
Sam Foley died tonight.

20
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,119
That's too bad.

21
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,851
Well, don't get excited.
Is Paine coming?

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,563
Yes, Jim.

23
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,398
Yes, Jim.

24
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,964
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no.

25
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,668
My dear, this is no time for jokes.

26
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,498
I've got to appoint a new senator.

27
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,350
The governor will see all committees.

28
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,833
The governor will see all committees.

29
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,341
Tell him I won't wait any longer.

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,909
Probably got Taylor in there,
telling him what to do.

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,744
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,880
I can't put those howling citizens
off any longer.

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,116
They'll want something to say about
who takes Foley's place.

34
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,691
Ten to one they've got a man.

35
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,918
Relax, Happy.

36
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,391
Stop having kittens.

37
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,065
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine...

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,531
...I'll give them one more minute
to make up their minds.

39
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,260
You go tell Jim Taylor.

40
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,631
I will tell him.

41
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,865
It's high time I told Jim Taylor
a thing or two.

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,713
If you and Joe gab any longer
about this appointment...

43
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,141
...I'll see those committees.

44
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,282
You'll see them when we're finished.

45
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,179
But hurry, will you?

46
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,017
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,360
Jim...

48
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,359
...with this Willet Creek Dam
coming up...

49
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,828
...the man who takes Foley's place...

50
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,969
...can't ask any questions
or talk out of turn.

51
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,831
We must be absolutely sure of him.

52
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,563
That's why I say Horace Miller.

53
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,503
He'll take orders all right.

54
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,973
Suppose we don't try to go through
with this dam.

55
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,180
Suppose we postpone it
until next session of Congress.

56
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,382
Or drop it altogether.

57
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,152
That'd be a crime, Joe.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,084
After all the work we put in on it?

59
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,855
Burying it in this deficiency bill...

60
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,788
...as nicely as you please.

61
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,588
Having it approved.
It's rolling along.

62
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,662
Like taking candy from a baby.

63
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,323
Is it worth the risk of a scandal,
with a new man in the Senate?

64
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,901
Worth the risk?

65
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,163
What's the matter with you?

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,236
Where you're concerned,
I wouldn't take the slightest risk...

67
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,571
...especially with your great reputation
in the Senate.

68
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,138
Here, look.

69
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,109
Look at the campaign I started for you
in all my papers.

70
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,746
A little obscure, isn't it?

71
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,388
I don't know. Maybe.

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,221
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West...

73
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,190
...for the national ticket.

74
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,626
At the convention, anything can happen.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,892
If what you say is possible...

76
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,468
...why not do as I say
and drop things like this dam?

77
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,696
We can't do it, Joe.

78
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,668
We've been quietly buying all the land
around that dam...

79
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,311
...and holding it in dummy names.

80
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,108
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

81
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,547
It'll show that we're going to sell it
to the state...

82
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,915
...under phony names.

83
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,988
The smartest thing for us to do...

84
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,125
...is to push this dam through...

85
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,919
...and get it over with.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,227
All right, appoint Miller.

87
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,455
If you're sure he'll take orders.

88
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,724
Don't worry.
He'll take orders.

89
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,934
Come on.

90
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,168
Just a minute.
Just one more minute!

91
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,567
We've got your man.

92
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,402
Horace Miller.

93
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,827
A born stooge!

94
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,309
Horace will perform like a trained seal.

95
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,981
What did I tell you?

96
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,377
If I throw a party man like Miller...

97
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,984
For reasons I can't go into,
it's got to be him.

98
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,849
Do you understand?
Now make out your ticket.

99
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,080
Come on.

100
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,657
But I've got to see those
angry committees first.

101
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,952
Work for harmony.

102
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,095
Harmony!

103
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,529
In considering candidates who might have
the high qualifications...

104
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,291
...of U.S. senator...

105
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,334
...one name shone out like a beacon...

106
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,038
...the Honorable Horace Miller.

107
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,569
A party man.
He's Taylor's stooge!

108
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,719
Please!

109
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,609
New Citizens Committee
won't stand for this!

110
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,878
So they named their own candidate, eh?

111
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,084
Who?

112
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,820
- You won't like him.
- Come on, who?

113
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,780
Henry Hill.

114
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,287
That crackpot?

115
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,016
You should've killed that so fast...

116
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,353
I couldn't.

117
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,496
- Those men were...
- Never mind.

118
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,891
You forget about them.

119
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,328
That bunch is out for blood.
If l...

120
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,660
I said forget about them.

121
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,531
Horace Miller goes to the Senate,
and that settles it.

122
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,567
I won't send Horace Miller.

123
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,369
- You won't?
- No, I won't.

124
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,137
I won't let you callously
wreck my whole political future.

125
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,373
Your political future?

126
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,518
I bought it for you as a present.

127
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,381
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

128
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,387
You've got a nerve to sit and worry
about your future...

129
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,321
...when we're in a spot like this.

130
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,017
The man is Miller.

131
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,661
Hello, Dad.

132
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,998
What's the matter?
Is it getting you down?

133
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,297
Is what getting me down?

134
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,134
You're in a deuce of a pickle.

135
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,242
Looks like Henry Hill or else.

136
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,378
It's Horace Miller or else.

137
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,512
Peter!

138
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:59,176
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller,
Taylor or no Taylor.

139
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,512
May I ask
what Taylor has to do with this?

140
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,655
He's still running the show, ain't he?

141
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,587
I won't have conversation of this sort
carried on at dinner.

142
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,192
Why don't you listen to them
for a change?

143
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,855
No doubt they can make
this appointment for me with ease.

144
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,930
That's easy.
Jefferson Smith.

145
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,931
I beg your pardon?

146
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,501
He's the only senator to have.

147
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,331
He ought to be President.

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,973
I like Jeff Smith.

149
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,808
You too?
Now everybody's been heard from.

150
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,675
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know
him from a hole in the ground.

151
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,851
- Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
- Oh, a boy?

152
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,544
No, Dad. Jeff's a man.
Jeff Smith.

153
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,020
Biggest expert we got in wild game...

154
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,193
Right now he's the greatest hero
we ever had.

155
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,794
It's all over the headlines.

156
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,090
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

157
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,528
I did. What about it?

158
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,362
- Jeff put that out himself.
- Himself?

159
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,697
If you really want a senator...

160
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,668
I do not want a senator.

161
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,671
I do not want any more nonsense.

162
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,537
He's the greatest American we got.

163
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,110
He can tell you
what George Washington said, by heart.

164
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,544
And Stuff has the swellest
stuff in it.

165
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,841
What "stuff"?

166
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,882
Boys' Stuff.
The name of Jeff's paper.

167
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,111
He prints it. Look, here's one.

168
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,687
Everybody reads it.

169
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,552
All the kids in the state.
A million of them. Let me read...

170
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,661
I'm in no mood
to listen to childish prattle.

171
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,796
Prattle?

172
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:19,930
You're all wet.

173
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,463
You couldn't do better.

174
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,430
- Better than what?
- Jeff for senator.

175
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,864
Emma, if you please!

176
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,436
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?

177
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,231
Always looking for votes, aren't you?

178
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,568
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each,
and they vote.

179
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,300
If you want to do some good
in this state...

180
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,479
If you're ever going to
stand up like a man...

181
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,772
That settles it!

182
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,279
I won't be belittled by my own children
in my own home.

183
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,477
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point!

184
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,864
Henry Hill....

185
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,252
Horace Miller....

186
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,050
Miller? Hill?

187
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,210
Hill?

188
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,361
Miller?

189
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,862
Heads, Hill.

190
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,689
Tails, Miller.

191
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,684
That's good enough for me.

192
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,007
Good evening.

193
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,081
Is Jefferson Smith at home?

194
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,251
Won't you step in?

195
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,429
- A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
- Listen.

196
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,265
The simpleton of all times.
A big-eyed patriot.

197
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,305
Knows Lincoln
and Washington by heart.

198
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,500
Stands at attention
in the governor's presence.

199
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,441
Collects stray boys and cats.

200
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,807
He does what?

201
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,074
You know, a perfect man.

202
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,717
Never in politics in his life.

203
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,979
Wouldn't know what it's all about
in 2 years, let alone 2 months.

204
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,281
The important thing...

205
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,515
...this was the genius of the stroke...

206
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,091
...it means votes.

207
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,752
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 100,000 parents.

208
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,330
Look over those congratulations
pouring in.

209
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,864
I tell you, gentlemen...

210
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,901
You made this appointment
without asking me.

211
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,097
When lightning strikes...
- You didn't ask me.

212
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,370
Now wait a minute, Jim.

213
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,041
Happy may have hit on something here.

214
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,409
There, you see?

215
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,816
Do you really think you can
handle him in Washington?

216
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,717
Do you think it's all right?

217
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,186
I think it's all right.

218
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,620
A young patriot...

219
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,658
...recites Lincoln and Jefferson...

220
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,525
...turned loose in our nation's capitol.

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,927
I think it's all right.

222
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,624
Chick.

223
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:18,539
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's
the greatest appointment ever made.

224
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,405
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.

225
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,547
A star-spangled banquet!

226
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,089
And how did your governor
confer that honor?

227
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,251
Did he give it to some wealthy
citizen, merely to curry favor?

228
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,863
No!

229
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,866
Did he give it to some
unworthy political hireling?

230
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,367
What did he do?

231
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,556
He went down...

232
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,037
...among the people.

233
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,831
And there he found...

234
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,878
...a nugget.

235
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,612
It is in that spirit that
we're here tonight...

236
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,313
...to acclaim and wish Godspeed
to Senator...

237
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,756
...Jefferson Smith.

238
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,838
Thank you.

239
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,804
I can't help feeling...

240
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,243
...that there's been a big mistake
somehow.

241
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,244
Of course, I never could see...

242
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,651
...why we needed two senators
from this state...

243
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,225
...when we have a man like
Joseph Harrison Paine...

244
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,725
...representing us.

245
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,022
He doesn't remember me.

246
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,065
He knew my father very well.

247
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,928
Clayton Smith.

248
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,137
They...

249
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,071
...went to school together.

250
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,208
They were very good friends.

251
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,078
Just to... sit here with him...

252
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,716
...is a very great honor for me...

253
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,183
...because I remember Dad
used to tell me that...

254
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,984
...Joe Paine was the finest man
he ever knew.

255
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,954
Go on, get up. Take a bow!

256
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:29,465
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down there in Washington, senator.

257
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,173
I'll do my best.

258
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,071
Although with all my might...

259
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,614
...I can promise you one thing:

260
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,512
I'll do nothing to disgrace
the office of...

261
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,552
...United States Senate.

262
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,646
Senator Jefferson Smith...

263
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,320
...the Boy Rangers are very proud...

264
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,151
...to take this opportun...

265
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,690
Occasion!

266
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,022
We are happy to take this opportunity...

267
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,531
To present....

268
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,533
To resent this...

269
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,869
...small token
of our affection and esteem...

270
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,931
...to the best...

271
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,275
Friend!

272
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,370
Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

273
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,579
We all pitched in.

274
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,806
For to carry your laws when
you get to Washington.

275
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,588
It isn't much,
but if you insist, here's this week's.

276
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,816
Boys' Stuff.
Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.

277
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,720
You're just like your father.

278
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,488
- Thank you, sir.
- Even to the hat.

279
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,530
Same old dreamer too.

280
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,634
One look at you and I can see him...

281
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,203
...back at his roll-top desk,
hat and all, getting out his paper.

282
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,138
Always kept his hat on
so as to be ready to do battle.

283
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,835
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.

284
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,844
And champion of lost causes.

285
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,042
Dad used to say the only causes
worth fighting for were the lost causes.

286
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,684
You don't have to tell me.

287
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,515
We were a team, the two of us.

288
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,385
Struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

289
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,186
The twin champions of lost causes,
they called us.

290
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,693
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.

291
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,366
His last fight was his best, Jeff.

292
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,595
He and his little four-page paper...

293
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,068
...against that mining syndicate.

294
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,437
All to defend the right of one
small miner who stuck to his claim.

295
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,339
They tried everything.

296
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,207
Bribery...

297
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,176
...intimidation.

298
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,809
And then....

299
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,918
Ma found him slumped over his desk
that morning.

300
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,088
Shot in the back.

301
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,295
I was there.

302
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,398
I can see him.

303
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,692
At that old roll-top desk.

304
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,566
Still with his hat on.

305
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,974
Still with his hat on.

306
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,707
I know.

307
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,782
I suppose, Mr. Paine...

308
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,681
...when a fellow bucks up
against a big organization like that...

309
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,517
...one man by himself
can't get very far, can he?

310
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,095
Washington, huh?

311
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,157
Yes, senator, for the fifth time.
Washington.

312
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,362
I'd better see about my pigeons.

313
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,830
The porter has them.

314
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,004
Just a second. I'd better make sure.

315
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,066
Joe, my head's like a balloon.

316
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,540
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

317
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,007
They're all right.

318
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,181
That's fine. That ends that crisis.

319
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,849
Come along, senator.

320
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,677
Hello, Father!

321
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,283
- I saw!
- He's mine!

322
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,087
Let me get to him.

323
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,254
I don't care to meet him
till I get my money.

324
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,960
A dollar each, please,
for the milk fund.

325
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,389
That's $5.

326
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,732
You've got $5, haven't you?

327
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Can't seem to find anything
except keys.

328
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,909
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan
and her friends.

329
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,672
- Not the new senator?
- He's marvelous.

330
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,815
What have you got there, senator?

331
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,976
- They're pigeons.
- To carry messages back to Ma.

332
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,089
It's just for fun. The one that
makes it home in the best time...

333
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,519
...I'll enter in the Nationals.

334
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,090
- Joe!
- Hello, Chick.

335
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,057
- Hello, Joe.
- Carl, how are you?

336
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,490
Glad to see you, Bill.

337
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,432
Jeff, come here.

338
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,261
Meet Cook and Griffith,
from State Headquarters.

339
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,666
Great pleasure.
You'll do the old state proud.

340
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,934
Welcome. The wildlife here is
different from what you're used to.

341
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,643
They wear high heels.

342
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,037
We must see a lot of you...

343
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,775
- ...and your little feathered friends.
- Thank you very much.

344
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,911
Come on, Father.

345
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,289
Chick.

346
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:47,051
I've got him.
We'll be along.

347
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,283
Good luck, senator.

348
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,493
Goodbye.

349
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,930
Things sure happen fast around here.

350
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,395
You'll have to get yourself
out of low gear.

351
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,728
Let's get these bags and livestock.

352
00:18:58,837 --> 00:18:59,937
Okay, Chick.

353
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,006
Look, there it is!

354
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,835
Who? What?

355
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,800
The Capitol dome.

356
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,274
Yes, sir, big as life.

357
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,004
Been there a long time now.

358
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,215
Yes, sir.

359
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,344
This way, senator.

360
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,024
We thought we'd
meet him in short pants...

361
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,492
...with hatchets.

362
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,732
Taxi.

363
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,498
What's he got pigeons for?

364
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,701
What for?

365
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,296
Suppose there's a storm.
The lines are down.

366
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,939
How you going to get messages
back to Ma?

367
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,403
This way, senator.

368
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,837
Where is he?

369
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,044
Senator?

370
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,039
I told that Cookie to....

371
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,305
Let's find him.

372
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,515
Senator!

373
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,074
Senator Smith?

374
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,717
Positively not in the station.

375
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,905
What happened?

376
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,522
Did you look in the...?

377
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,184
I'll brain that guy.

378
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,259
Call Paine. Call Saunders.

379
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,191
Call the Marines. Call somebody!

380
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,341
Saunders?
McGann.

381
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,334
Has Smith showed up
at his office there yet?

382
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,368
What do you mean, the slip?
What's so funny?

383
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,539
Nothing.

384
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,231
Why don't you try a butterfly net?

385
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,670
If he shows up...

386
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,243
...Paine's waiting at the hotel
with newspapermen.

387
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,573
Let him know right away.
Understand?

388
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,274
I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One if by land and two if by sea.

389
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,282
- Diz?
- Yeah.

390
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,831
What do you think?
Daniel Boone's lost.

391
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,567
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

392
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,898
If your boyfriend's
going to blaze trails...

393
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,336
...I'm going to the press club.

394
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,535
Stick around. He might want us to
put on short pants and go hiking.

395
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,270
You wouldn't want to
miss the exercise.

396
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,540
When I think of exercise,
I have to lie down...

397
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,944
...until the feeling leaves me.

398
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,909
Wouldn't it be funny
if he was lost?

399
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,104
The Boy Ranger?

400
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,550
Oh, he'll show up.

401
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,815
He must have a compass with him.

402
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,519
Where would I go
if I were a Boy Ranger?

403
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,889
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!

404
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,498
Call all the hospitals.
And get me a bed while you're at it!

405
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,930
Boss, will you hold this
a minute?

406
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,467
Thank you, sir.

407
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,532
Here! Come back here!

408
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,700
...that from these honored dead
we take...

409
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,881
...increased devotion that
that cause for which they...

410
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,242
...gave the last full measure...

411
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,077
...of devotion...

412
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,253
...that we here highly....

413
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,944
- Resolve.
- Resolve...

414
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,483
...that these dead
shall not have died in vain.

415
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,251
That this nation...

416
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,897
...under God, shall have
a new birth of....

417
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,098
Freedom.

418
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,408
Freedom.

419
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:31,661
And that government, of the people...

420
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,004
...by the people...

421
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,121
...for the people...

422
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,036
...shall not perish from the earth.

423
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,913
Why don't they try the police?

424
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,744
Call out some bloodhounds...

425
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,113
...or Indian guides.

426
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,788
One place he knows
is the Senate office.

427
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,513
You stay there and wait.

428
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,055
All right,
another half-hour.

429
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,727
Just one half-hour.
Goodbye.

430
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,997
Oh, why don't I quit?

431
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,530
Eight to five,
little boy blue's plastered.

432
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,725
When Foley died, why didn't
I clear out?

433
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,996
How many times have I said
I'm fed up with politics and l...

434
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,865
No, I let them
talk me into staying.

435
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,103
Secretary to a leader
of little squirts.

436
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,314
Why? Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

437
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,848
Would you settle for a husband?

438
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,213
I sure would.

439
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,785
You know my old standing offer.

440
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,177
Diz Moore...

441
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,885
...poet of Washington correspondents.

442
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,927
Oh, that again.

443
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,431
I'd cherish you...

444
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:35,726
...and I'd stay sober.

445
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,562
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.

446
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,870
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once
with your hair combed or something....

447
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,534
I don't think even
that would do it.

448
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,837
No point in combing
my hair for nothing.

449
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,582
"Honorary appointment."

450
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:56,083
Scratch this and you'll find they need
a dope here for a couple of months.

451
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,983
Yes?

452
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,221
Yes!

453
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,002
What do you want?

454
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:05,358
Office of Jefferson Smith?

455
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,422
The man downstairs said...

456
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,408
They sure must have
picked the prize dummy...

457
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,244
Say, wait a minute!

458
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,643
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

459
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,102
Say, mister...

460
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:29,228
...what's your name?

461
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:30,329
Jefferson Smith.

462
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,682
Oh, yes, please...

463
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,256
...come right in, Mr. Smith.
This way.

464
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,584
Now, hold everything.

465
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,989
Stay there. Now, don't move!

466
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,190
Helen! Get me the Madison.
Senator Paine.

467
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,866
Hurry up, will you?

468
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,702
Is anything the matter?

469
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,829
My dear senator...

470
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,837
...it may be customary out on the
prairie to take leave of people...

471
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,703
...and not show up for five hours...

472
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,539
I'm very sorry
about that, Miss Sau...

473
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,510
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

474
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,913
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member
of the press. Mr. Moore, meet...

475
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,279
...the senator.

476
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,079
I'm very happy to know you.

477
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,814
I see you cut your way
through that forest.

478
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,426
Senator Paine. We've got him!

479
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,097
Came in on his own power,
and he's sober.

480
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,692
Next thing on the schedule,
I'll have him over there.

481
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,835
Now....

482
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,302
I'm awfully sorry.

483
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,406
It wasn't until I was well along
on the bus that...

484
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,768
Did you say bus?

485
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,604
It was one of those
sightseers, you know?

486
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,074
And...

487
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,748
...I've never been called
absent-minded before...

488
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,149
...but there it was, all of a sudden.

489
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,356
It was staring at me
through the station doors.

490
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,856
There what was?

491
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,359
The dome. The Capitol dome.

492
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,889
As big as life, sparkling away
under the old sun out there.

493
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,628
And l...

494
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,700
...I just...

495
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,066
...started to go toward it.

496
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,003
There was a bus outside and...

497
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,938
...I just naturally got aboard.

498
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,340
Most natural thing in the world.

499
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,046
I don't think I've ever been so
thrilled in my whole life.

500
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,479
And that Lincoln Memorial!

501
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,622
Gee whiz!

502
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,758
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.

503
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,398
He's looking right straight
at you as you come up those steps.

504
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,995
Just sitting there, like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

505
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,931
Well, he's got nothing on me.

506
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

507
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,304
If you're ready,
we'll go to the hotel.

508
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,639
Senator Paine's waiting for you.

509
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,885
This is my office?

510
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,686
No, you'll have a private office.

511
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,728
- In there.
- Private office?

512
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,628
In there?

513
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,204
Right in this door?

514
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,137
All right, now, senator....

515
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,815
Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

516
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,517
He's in there.

517
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,015
I'll see you later.

518
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,882
I got to go out
and drink this over.

519
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,483
Whose statue's that?

520
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,355
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.

521
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,029
You wouldn't? Oh, look!

522
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,499
Look at the Capitol dome!
It's all lighted up.

523
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,670
You better relax, senator.
You'll get yourself plum wore out.

524
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,932
Gee whiz! So many things
happening all at once.

525
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,610
Miss Saunders, what time
does the Senate....

526
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,870
Convene?

527
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,238
- Twelve noon.
- Twelve noon, huh?

528
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,916
Oh, boy, that'll be something!

529
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,718
You know what I better do
in the morning?

530
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,513
No, what had you better?

531
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,953
I think I better go out
to Mount Vernon.

532
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,319
Be sort of a fine thing to do.

533
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,061
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

534
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,265
Think it's a good idea?

535
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,435
Wonderful! Puts you
right in the mood.

536
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,399
What's that? What's that?

537
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,901
Movie houses.

538
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,270
Hi, Saunders.

539
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,277
I'm still asking myself, what is he:

540
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,813
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

541
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,017
Maybe an oyster.

542
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,985
When I think of myself playing straight
for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!

543
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,350
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fists.

544
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,925
I can't take it, Diz.
I quit. I'm through.

545
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,098
Now take it easy.
Simmer down. Here.

546
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,493
Take this.

547
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,964
Know what he's doing tomorrow
before taking the Senate seat?

548
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,695
Going up to Mount Vernon...

549
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,136
...to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

550
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,342
Who? Your boss?

551
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,239
A nut! I knew there was
a story in him. I smelled it!

552
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,038
Go chase an ambulance.

553
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,773
It's meat and drink to me.
Let me at him five minutes.

554
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,934
I'll make it right.

555
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,712
What do you mean "right"?

556
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,217
I'll tell you what I'll do.

557
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,719
World Series. A pass!

558
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,948
In a month it'll be worth 15 bucks.

559
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,109
Well!

560
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:03,227
You're not talking to this guy.

561
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,395
- What do you say?
- Nothing. Beat it.

562
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:07,760
How would your pals like
to get in on this?

563
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,160
- I want a scoop.
- Beat it!

564
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:13,064
That's out. Either it's lots of
reporters and tickets, or....

565
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,865
Better call him before
I change my mind.

566
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,406
Okay. I'll see you right here.

567
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,909
What are you going to do?

568
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,946
Get my whole fall outfit
and quit this job in style.

569
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,016
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

570
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,882
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

571
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,288
Tell us about yourself.

572
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,653
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.

573
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,294
Any special ax to grind?

574
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,622
- Ax?
- You know.

575
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,061
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes,
pension bill.

576
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,360
You must have one idea that would
be good for the country.

577
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,060
Well, I have got one idea.

578
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,863
That's what we want.

579
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,371
For the last couple years,
I've thought it would be...

580
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,807
...a wonderful idea to have a
national boys' camp in our state.

581
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,913
Boys' camp?
Sure. Very good!

582
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,515
If we could get
poor kids off the streets...

583
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,652
...out of the cities for
a few months in the summer...

584
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,220
...and let them learn something
about nature...

585
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,583
...American ideals....

586
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,849
Marvelous.

587
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,549
What would it
cost the government?

588
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,854
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see...

589
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,089
...the government just
lends us the money for the camp...

590
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,233
...and then the boys...

591
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,871
...pay it back by sending pennies,
nickels, nothing more than a dime.

592
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,539
That's really something.

593
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,170
Government's got enough
to do without...

594
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,072
The government's
putting too much dough...

595
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,871
...in too many places now, boys.

596
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,106
Well, now, senator, tell me...

597
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,908
...what do you think of
the girls in this town?

598
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,916
Down at the station,
four of them...

599
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,521
...kissed me when
I got off the train.

600
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,655
Were they pretty?
- Pretty?

601
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,191
That Miss Susan Paine...

602
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,260
...is about the
prettiest I ever saw.

603
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,762
Senator, you got a good eye!

604
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,627
How about some more pictures?

605
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,200
You're a nature lover...

606
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,893
...can you handle sign language?

607
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,163
I could manage, if...

608
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,841
What about birdcalls?
You know any?

609
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,806
- Can you make a sound like an eagle?
- How about a bobwhite?

610
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,105
Here's one. I'm the
only one in the state...

611
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,389
...that knows this one.

612
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:05,743
We could use that!

613
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,203
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?

614
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,806
Do I actually see this?

615
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,536
What is it?

616
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,382
Did you want to see me?

617
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,645
What's this I hear about your quitting?
- I'm not a nurse.

618
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,822
Stop being funny.

619
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,973
How'd this happen?

620
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:49,957
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Yes, you have. How'd it happen?

621
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,492
I merely took him home.

622
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,358
I didn't tuck him in.
That's McGann's job.

623
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,762
McGann just phoned. Smith's
gone again. Do you know where?

624
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,961
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

625
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,503
That's fine.

626
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,005
Now you go back to Smith's office...

627
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,200
...and get him
to the Senate by 12:00.

628
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,311
Senator, I wasn't
given a brain...

629
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,641
...just to tell a Boy Ranger
the time.

630
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,873
Don't be a fool.

631
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,415
If certain things happen...

632
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,179
...you'll get one of the biggest jobs
in Washington.

633
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,188
When I came here, my eyes were
big blue question marks...

634
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,155
...now they're big
green dollar marks.

635
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,453
Smart girl, eh?

636
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,693
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a bonus.

637
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,264
I mean, keep Smith away...

638
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,061
...from anything that
smacks of politics.

639
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,964
Including Willet Creek Dam?

640
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,365
Including Willet Creek Dam.

641
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,305
Now go back to your work.

642
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,878
This is it, senator.

643
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,712
The United States Senate.

644
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,921
Come on.

645
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,625
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.

646
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,657
- How do you do?
- How do you do, senator?

647
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,804
Page!

648
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:00,295
- Glad to see you.
- Thank you.

649
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,466
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

650
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,793
Right this way, sir.

651
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,764
Well, goodbye.

652
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,836
Wish me luck.
- Sure.

653
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,233
Bye.

654
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,326
So that's the boy wonder?

655
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,163
I don't know what the Senate's
coming to.

656
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,597
- Hi, Diz.
- Hello, Saunders.

657
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,298
Daryl, Sweeney.

658
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,071
I see you got Daniel Boone
in all right.

659
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,837
Daniel in the lion's den.

660
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,077
Nice job you and
the ambulance chasers did...

661
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,250
...in the papers this morning.

662
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,645
- Did you like it?
- Great.

663
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,983
Here you are, Senator.

664
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,521
Not a bad desk, either.

665
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,716
Daniel Webster used to use it.

666
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,258
Daniel Webster sat here?

667
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,520
Holy mackerel!

668
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,993
Give you something to shoot at,
if you figure on doing any talking.

669
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,724
I'm just going to
sit and listen.

670
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,835
That's the way to get re-elected.

671
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,301
This is the calendar for the day.

672
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,632
You'll find this
and a manual, in here.

673
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,826
Anything else...

674
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,204
...just snap for a page.

675
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,935
Where's the majority leader?

676
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,204
Majority leader?

677
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,076
Right over there.
Senator Agnew.

678
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,944
That's Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

679
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,450
Where's the press gallery?

680
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,089
There,
above the vice president's chair.

681
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,124
Those in the front row
represent the big news services.

682
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,327
What's up there?

683
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,428
That's for guides
and sightseers...

684
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,656
...who come in for five minutes
at a time to rest their feet.

685
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,862
That section is reserved
for the senators' friends.

686
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,502
Front row, the empty one, is for
the President and his guests.

687
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,649
I see.

688
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,141
Over the clock
is the diplomatic section.

689
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,014
They and the pageboys are the only
real class we have here.

690
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,185
- Thanks so much.
- I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.

691
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,115
I want to give you
a Boy Ranger button.

692
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,255
Swell!

693
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,017
What's your name?
- Richard Jones.

694
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,384
Thanks ever so much.

695
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,592
Good luck, senator.
Keep your left up.

696
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,129
- See you in the White House, Joe.
- You're not kidding!

697
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,959
- Jeff.
- Hello, senator.

698
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,192
I was in committee.

699
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,494
That's all right, sir.

700
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,729
I see you had a little publicity.

701
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,633
Have you got your credentials?

702
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,676
Miss Saunders gave them to me.

703
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,070
Is that right?

704
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,241
That's fine.

705
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,384
When the vice president
calls you...

706
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,850
- ...I'll meet you in the center aisle.
- Center aisle.

707
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,956
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

708
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,557
He won't mind.

709
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,987
The Senate will come to order.

710
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,092
Chaplain will pray.

711
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,657
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father...

712
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,059
...in these critical days...

713
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,168
...when our beloved country labors with
such grave problems...

714
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,667
...look upon us...

715
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,308
...and give us the strength
to be just and merciful...

716
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,477
...so we may best
serve our people...

717
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,611
...and our fellow men
everywhere.

718
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,071
Amen.

719
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,316
- Clerk will read...
- Mr. President...

720
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,291
...I ask unanimous consent the reading
of the journal be dispensed with.

721
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,826
Is there objection?

722
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,859
Journal stands approved.

723
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,362
Mr. President.

724
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,296
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

725
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,486
Clerk will call the roll.

726
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,467
- Mr. Agnew.
- Here.

727
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,798
- Mr. Albert.
- Here.

728
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,201
- Mr. Alfred.
- Here.

729
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,604
88 senators have answered
to their names, all as present.

730
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,542
- Mr. President.
- Senator Paine.

731
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,546
I present the credentials of
Honorable Jefferson Smith...

732
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,618
...who has just been appointed
by the governor of my state.

733
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,254
The designate is present.

734
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,254
I ask that the oath of office be
administered at this time.

735
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,893
The senator designate will
present himself.

736
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,229
The oath will be administered.

737
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,079
Mr. President...

738
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,909
...I rise to a question of order.

739
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,642
- Here it comes.
- I seek to ascertain if the gentleman...

740
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:54,348
...about to be sworn in is aware
of the responsibilities of his office.

741
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,753
I refer to his
shameless performance...

742
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,053
...for the newspapers.

743
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,396
A versatile performance,
I grant you...

744
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,362
...and one that his party,
no doubt, will applaud.

745
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,835
But one that lowers his rank...

746
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,267
...to the level of a
sideshow entertainer...

747
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,033
...and reflects on the sincerity,
if not the sanity...

748
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,803
...of the highest body
of lawmakers in the land.

749
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,106
I seek to learn if this
is the gentleman's conception...

750
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,714
...of the nature of his office.

751
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,867
I don't understand.

752
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:24,613
The designate has no voice here
until taking the oath of office.

753
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,086
Mr. President,
I will answer the gentleman.

754
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,725
My colleague was innocent
in this matter.

755
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,417
He was completely misquoted.

756
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,087
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will
personally vouch for him.

757
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,928
He has the greatest respect for his
office and for these gentleman.

758
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,602
Mr. President.

759
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,666
The swearing in of the senator
designate is the order of business.

760
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,105
The gentleman will raise
his right hand.

761
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,573
Do you swear to support...

762
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,612
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

763
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,511
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

764
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,313
...and that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

765
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,649
That you take this obligation freely...

766
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,918
...without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

767
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:09,031
...and that you will faithfully
discharge the duties of this office...

768
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,127
...so help you God?

769
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,863
I do.

770
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,971
Senator, you can talk
all you want to now.

771
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,369
Meet the majority leader.

772
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,909
He'll be a good friend to you.

773
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,238
How do you do, sir?

774
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,007
Any friend of Joe's
is a friend of mine.

775
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,379
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

776
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,988
- Mr. President.
- Senator MacPherson.

777
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,953
The shameless way the
deficiency bill has been delayed...

778
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,957
...is nothing short of criminal.

779
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:42,223
Government agencies are
in desperate need of these funds.

780
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,426
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage....

781
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,674
- Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

782
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,781
Smith's punching everybody
he meets. I just got away.

783
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,041
Uh-oh, Tarzan!

784
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,091
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

785
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,525
You act like
something's on your mind.

786
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,530
Why don't you tell the people
the truth?

787
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,531
- The truth?
- He wants the truth!

788
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,034
The man wants the truth.

789
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,207
"'What is the truth?' said
jesting Pilate...

790
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,932
...and would not stay for an answer."

791
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,202
How do you want it?
Dished out or in a bottle?

792
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,909
People pick up their papers,
and what do they read?

793
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:08,312
This morning they read that a
clown arrived in Washington...

794
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,110
...parading like
a member of the Senate.

795
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,315
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart....

796
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,520
We're the only ones who can
be honest in what we tell the voters.

797
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,258
We don't have to be re-elected,
like politicians.

798
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,665
We tell them when phonies and
crackpots come here to make their laws.

799
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,032
If you want the truth,
why are you in the Senate?

800
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,708
What do you know about making laws?
Or what the people need?

801
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,843
I don't pretend to know.

802
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:35,434
Then what are you doing
in the Senate?

803
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,672
What's he doing?
Why, honorary appointment!

804
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,816
When the country needs men who know
and have courage as it never did before...

805
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,990
...he's going to decorate a chair
and get honored.

806
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,622
But he'll vote! Just like his
colleague tells him too.

807
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,626
Like a Christmas tiger,
he'll nod his head and vote...

808
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,129
..."Yes!"

809
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,925
You're not a senator.

810
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,669
You're an honorary stooge.
You ought to be shown up.

811
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,301
Have a drink, senator?

812
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,600
It'll taste better than the truth.

813
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,245
Hey, senator.

814
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,883
Don't let it get you down.

815
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,956
100 years from now,
nobody'll know the difference.

816
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,602
The point is, sir,
they're right.

817
00:44:24,702 --> 00:44:27,389
I'm just sitting in the Senate,
decorating a chair.

818
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:32,035
If I'm going to vote, I ought
to study the bills that are coming up.

819
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,252
The bills?

820
00:44:33,352 --> 00:44:37,737
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a
Christmas tiger, like they said.

821
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:42,303
These bills are put together by
legal minds after long study.

822
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:46,142
I can't understand half of them
myself, and I was a lawyer.

823
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,284
Come on. Forget it.

824
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,248
I'll advise you how to vote.

825
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,354
I know you will.
That's the point.

826
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,524
There's no reason for me
to be here.

827
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:59,321
Didn't you say something about
wanting to create a national boys' camp?

828
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,021
- You were in earnest, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

829
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,461
Why don't you do it?
There's a job for you.

830
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,795
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

831
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,369
It will be great experience.

832
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:12,008
Senator Paine, I've been
aching to mention it to you.

833
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,804
If I could do that one thing
while I'm here, I'd feel...

834
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,481
What's to stop you?
Saunders will help you.

835
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,616
Well, I'll do it.
I will!

836
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,545
I knew if anyone could help me,
you could.

837
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,221
Thank you again for your time.

838
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,388
Good night.

839
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:28,151
Where are you running off to?

840
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,724
I'm anxious to get
back to the office.

841
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,762
The man on the front page!

842
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,129
- He just dropped in for a minute.
- How do you do, senator?

843
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,803
How do you do, Miss Paine?

844
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,232
I'm on my way to the office.

845
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,187
- How are the pigeons?
- They're fine.

846
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:46,001
I miss the dear little things.

847
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,940
I released one this morning
with a letter.

848
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:53,014
He flew right straight up in the air
to get his bearings.

849
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:57,278
He went around the Capitol dome,
then headed west, like a bat out of...

850
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,216
Just like a rifle shot.

851
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,653
I suppose by about this time...

852
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,952
...he's probably over Kentucky.

853
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,924
Isn't that wonderful, Father?

854
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,421
And was the letter to your girl?

855
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,125
No, I don't have a girl.

856
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,167
Don't you think I'd better
hold this for you?

857
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,134
No, I think I'd better go.

858
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,432
Good night.

859
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,402
Doggone!

860
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,112
It's all right, sir.

861
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,839
That's all right, my boy.
Don't bother.

862
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,180
Gee, I'm sorry.

863
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,325
Good night.

864
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:37,688
Good night, Jeff.

865
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,953
Good night.

866
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,301
Oh, Father!

867
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,875
Dear me!

868
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:55,103
At the expense of
some of the furniture...

869
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,779
...you've made another conquest.

870
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,208
Not old Honest Abe!

871
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,747
And with Honest Abe's ideals.

872
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,278
A rare man these days, Susan.

873
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,724
We're going ahead with it.

874
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:08,825
Ahead with what?

875
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:10,926
My bill for
a national boys' camp.

876
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,220
Where's my briefcase?

877
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,760
Do I understand...

878
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,158
...that you're going to present a bill?

879
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,356
Senator Paine and I decided...

880
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,091
Senator Paine decided with you?

881
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,498
I should have
been the one to think of it.

882
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,638
My dear senator...

883
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:25,799
...have you the faintest idea
how to get a bill passed?

884
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,000
No. You're going to help me.

885
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,508
If I were triplets I could.

886
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,704
Senator Paine said
you'd help me.

887
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,448
What do we have to have?

888
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,140
Look, do you mind...

889
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,321
...if I give you a rough idea
what you're up against?

890
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,522
No, go ahead.

891
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,184
A senator has a bill in mind,
like your camp, right?

892
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,379
What does he do?

893
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:48,224
He has to sit down
and write it.

894
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,923
The why, when, where, how
and everything else.

895
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,101
That takes time.

896
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:53,429
But this one is so simple.

897
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,437
I see. This one's simple.

898
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,766
- And with your help...
- Oh, I'm helping.

899
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,942
Simple, and I'm helping...

900
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,601
...so we knock it off in record time,
say three or four days.

901
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,371
Oh, a day.

902
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,742
- A day?
- Yes, just tonight.

903
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,293
Tonight.

904
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:10,909
I don't want to complain...

905
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,557
...but in civilized countries
there's an institution called "dinner."

906
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,117
I'm sort of hungry myself.

907
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:22,155
Couldn't we have some stuff brought
in on trays, like big executives?

908
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,799
Oh, sure.

909
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,968
Dinner comes in on trays.

910
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,467
We light into this...

911
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,038
And we finish the bill before morning.

912
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,265
It's dawn.

913
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,876
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.

914
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,011
How?

915
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:37,273
You get to your feet...

916
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,540
...take a breath,
and start spouting.

917
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,652
Not too loud. A couple of
the senators might want to sleep.

918
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,049
A curly-headed pageboy
takes it to the desk...

919
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,316
...where a clerk reads it,
refers it to a committee...

920
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,460
Committee, huh? Why?

921
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,364
Committees. Small groups
of senators have to sift a bill down...

922
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,762
...study it,
and report to the Senate.

923
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,801
Can't take a bill
nobody ever heard of...

924
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,337
...and discuss it among 96 men.
Where would you get?

925
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,599
I see that.

926
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,573
Good.
Now, where are we?

927
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,245
Some committee's got it.

928
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,378
Days are going by, senator.

929
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,379
Days, weeks!

930
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,445
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.

931
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,145
It goes to the House of
Representatives for a vote...

932
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,825
- ...but waits on the calendar.
- Calendar?

933
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,854
That's the order of business.

934
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,927
Your bill has to stand back in line...

935
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,963
- ...unless the steering committee...
What's that?

936
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,700
Steering committee?

937
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,089
Do you really think
we're getting anywhere?

938
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:39,174
Tell me, what's
the steering committee?

939
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,643
Committee of the
majority party leaders.

940
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,814
They decide when a bill is important
enough to be at the head of the list.

941
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,015
Well, this is.

942
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,512
Pardon me. This is.

943
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,344
Where are we now?
- Over in the House.

944
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,745
Oh, yeah. House.

945
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:56,016
More amendments, more changes,
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

946
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,389
The Senate doesn't like what the
House did; they make more changes.

947
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,995
The House doesn't like
those changes. Stymied.

948
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,199
So?

949
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,561
So they appoint men from each House
to go into a huddle...

950
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,794
...called a conference,
and they battle it out.

951
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:11,462
Finally, if your bill is still alive
after all this vivisection...

952
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,506
...it comes to a vote.

953
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,244
Yes, sir!

954
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,677
The big day finally arrives...

955
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,348
...and Congress adjourns.

956
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,944
Catching on, senator?

957
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,216
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

958
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:31,660
Pardon me?

959
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,456
I said, shall we start...

960
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,663
Oh, sure.

961
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,073
Why not?

962
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:39,100
Do you mind if I take the time
to go get a pencil?

963
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,600
- Go right ahead!
- Thank you very much.

964
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,864
Go right ahead.
And lots of paper too.

965
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,671
Now, the...
Doggone it!

966
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,778
Ever have so much to say about
something, you just couldn't say it?

967
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,574
- Try sitting down.
- I did. I got right back up.

968
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,184
Let's get down to particulars.

969
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,080
How big is this thing?
Where is it?

970
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,686
How many boys will it accommodate?

971
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,187
You've got to have all that
in it, you know?

972
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,858
And something else, Miss Saunders.

973
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:07,462
The spirit of it. The idea.

974
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,358
How do you say it?

975
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,900
That's what's got to be in it.

976
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,628
The Capitol dome.

977
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,673
On paper?

978
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:20,469
I want to make that come to life
for every boy in this land.

979
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,202
Yes, and all lighted up
like that too.

980
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,614
You see, boys forget what
their country means...

981
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,547
...by just reading "the land
of the free" in history books.

982
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,448
They get to be men
and forget even more.

983
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:38,325
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.

984
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,362
Men should hold it up
in front of them...

985
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,930
...every single day of their
lives and say...

986
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,657
...I'm free...

987
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,264
...to think and to speak.

988
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,968
My ancestors couldn't.
I can...

989
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,435
...and my children will.

990
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,478
Boys ought to
grow up remembering that.

991
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,479
And that steering committee,
they've got to see it like that.

992
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,915
I know Senator Paine will do
all he can to help me, because...

993
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,815
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?

994
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,624
- He knew my father real well.
- He did?

995
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,129
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of character, his ideals.

996
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,589
Let's get on with this.

997
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,598
This camp will be in your state?

998
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,239
About 200 of the most beautiful
acres that ever were.

999
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,567
You've never been
out in that country, have you?

1000
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,743
I've been over every single foot of it.

1001
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,377
You have to see it yourself.

1002
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,640
I don't know. The prairies, and
wind leaning on the tall grass...

1003
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,507
...lazy streams down in the meadows...

1004
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,688
...angry little midgets of water
up in the mountains.

1005
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,982
Cattle moving down the slope,
against the sun.

1006
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,749
Campfires...

1007
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,961
...and snowdrifts....

1008
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,466
Everybody ought to have some
of that, sometime in his life.

1009
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,396
My dad had the right idea.

1010
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,499
He had it all worked out.

1011
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,705
He used to say to me, "Son...

1012
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,374
...don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

1013
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,578
Because every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star...

1014
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,271
...is filled with
the wonders of nature."

1015
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,974
He used to say to me...

1016
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,154
..."Did you ever notice how grateful
you are to see daylight...

1017
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:16,018
...after coming through
a long, dark tunnel?"

1018
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,787
"Well," he'd say, "always try to see
life around you...

1019
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,964
...as if you just came
out of a tunnel."

1020
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,759
Where did you come from?

1021
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,039
I guess I've always lived
in a tunnel.

1022
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,574
You mean here?

1023
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,939
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.

1024
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,571
Have you always had to work?

1025
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,372
Since I was about sixteen.

1026
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,514
Sixteen?

1027
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:41,607
I take it your parents couldn't...

1028
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,115
No, Father was a doctor.

1029
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,754
He thought more of ethics
than he did of collections.

1030
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,583
Speaks well for Father,
but it wasn't so...

1031
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,525
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.

1032
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,225
Hasn't been easy, has it?

1033
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,556
No complaints.

1034
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,631
For a woman, you've done awfully well.

1035
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,234
Have l?

1036
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:05,406
I've never known anyone as capable
and intelligent....

1037
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,642
I don't know where I'd be in this
bill if it wasn't for your help.

1038
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,908
I don't know where you are with it.

1039
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,915
Gee whiz, we've got to get
going with this.

1040
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,988
All right, now, let's see.

1041
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,819
Everybody calls you just plain
"Saunders." Why can't l?

1042
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,156
Go right ahead.

1043
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,365
Saunders.

1044
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,726
That's much better.

1045
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,494
"Hello, Saunders."
"Good morning, Saunders."

1046
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,999
- "How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
- Terrible, thank you.

1047
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,109
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business
straightened out.

1048
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,711
All right, now! I...

1049
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,471
What's your first name?

1050
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:46,907
Why?

1051
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,451
Everybody calls you
just "Saunders."

1052
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,415
I also answer to whistles.

1053
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,815
You've got a first name?

1054
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,616
Yes, but we just better
forget about it.

1055
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,383
All right, all right.

1056
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,093
I was just curious.

1057
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,494
A picture popped into my mind of
a pump without a handle or something.

1058
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,827
Of course, I know what it is.
Violet.

1059
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,130
No, it isn't.

1060
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,341
Abigail?

1061
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,142
Letitia?

1062
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,676
Lena?

1063
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,641
You might as well tell me.
I've got a lot more.

1064
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,544
All right. You win.

1065
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,775
It's Clarissa.

1066
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,547
Clarissa.

1067
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,227
All right, Saunders, let's go!

1068
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,823
Now, Susan's an awfully
pretty name, isn't it?

1069
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,191
Susan? Susan Paine?
Oh, it's beautiful.

1070
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,837
She's a beautiful woman,
isn't she?

1071
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:47,109
Isn't she a beautiful girl?
I think she's about the most beautiful...

1072
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,313
We've got to get started on this,
or we'll never get it finished.

1073
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,381
Get set, because I'm going to talk
much faster than you can write.

1074
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,642
You ready?

1075
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,514
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres...

1076
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,917
...situated in Ambrose County,
Terry Canyon.

1077
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,787
Running a quarter mile on
either side of Willet Creek.

1078
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,862
What?

1079
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:09,523
Willet Creek. W-I-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.

1080
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,732
In Terry Canyon?

1081
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,663
You don't know it, do you?

1082
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,936
You've never been there, you said.

1083
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,574
You've discussed this with
Senator Paine, haven't you?

1084
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:21,777
No, no. Why?

1085
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,610
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

1086
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,442
There's no reason to
talk it over with him.

1087
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,847
"A quarter of a mile on
either side of Willet Creek."

1088
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:35,252
And the land to be bought by the
contribution of the boys...

1089
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,825
...the money to be loaned to us by
the United States.

1090
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,531
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1091
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,330
What did you get me
out of bed for?

1092
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,267
Sit tight.
The show's about to commence.

1093
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,373
Mind telling me what's going on?

1094
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,508
Certainly.

1095
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:56,374
There's the principal
actor in our little play.

1096
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,843
"Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.

1097
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,693
- Here, one of the supporting characters.
Who?

1098
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,234
That gorilla in man's clothing,
McGann.

1099
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,962
You mean Puss-in-Boots?

1100
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:07,800
Mostly Puss.

1101
00:57:09,243 --> 00:57:12,695
Another prominent character in
our play, the Silver Knight.

1102
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,370
Soul of honor on a tightrope.

1103
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:17,050
You wouldn't be a little goofy,
would you?

1104
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:21,247
Don Quixote will stand up in a
minute and speak two important words...

1105
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,547
..."Willet Creek."

1106
00:57:22,657 --> 00:57:25,521
Then the Silver Knight
will fall off his tightrope...

1107
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:28,388
...and "Puss" will jump
out of his boots.

1108
00:57:29,096 --> 00:57:30,720
It is so ordered.

1109
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,399
Introduction of new bills...

1110
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:35,159
...and joint resolutions.

1111
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:37,654
Mr. President!

1112
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:51,383
The chair recognizes the rather
strong-lunged junior senator...

1113
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:53,086
...Mr. Smith.

1114
00:57:54,422 --> 00:57:56,012
I'm sorry.
I have a bill...

1115
00:57:56,123 --> 00:57:58,157
You may speak a little louder.

1116
00:57:58,259 --> 00:57:59,386
But not too loud.

1117
00:58:03,464 --> 00:58:05,088
I have a bill to propose.

1118
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:11,662
Order, gentlemen.

1119
00:58:12,173 --> 00:58:15,572
Our junior senator
is about to make a speech.

1120
00:58:20,881 --> 00:58:22,187
You may proceed.

1121
00:58:28,889 --> 00:58:33,255
"Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives...

1122
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:36,686
...that there be appropriated
as a loan...

1123
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:41,066
...a sum sufficient to create
a national boys' camp...

1124
00:58:41,202 --> 00:58:44,169
...to be paid back to the
U.S. Treasury...

1125
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,033
...by contributions from
boys of America.

1126
00:58:47,842 --> 00:58:49,068
This camp...

1127
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:52,302
...to be situated on land at
and adjacent to...

1128
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:55,243
...the headwaters of a stream
known as Willet Creek...

1129
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:57,110
...in Terry Canyon...

1130
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,718
...for the purpose of bringing together
boys of all walks of life...

1131
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,425
...from various parts of the country.

1132
00:59:07,995 --> 00:59:11,394
Boys of all creeds, kinds
and positions.

1133
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:17,000
To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding.

1134
00:59:17,104 --> 00:59:19,365
To bring about a healthful life...

1135
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,633
...to the youth of this
great and beautiful land."

1136
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,911
Our senator will make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

1137
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:16,119
I'm getting leery of him. We call him
dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.

1138
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:20,426
When he finds out a dam is going up
where he wants his boys' camp...

1139
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,898
...he's going to ask questions.

1140
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:25,162
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.

1141
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:28,639
This deficiency bill
will be read tomorrow.

1142
01:00:28,743 --> 01:00:29,776
Tomorrow?

1143
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,369
He'll hear that section
on the Willet Dam. He can't be there.

1144
01:00:33,481 --> 01:00:37,483
I'll take him to see monuments, even if
I have to hit him on the head with one.

1145
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:38,777
That won't work.

1146
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:41,079
This boy's honest, not stupid.

1147
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:42,889
Susan.

1148
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,786
My daughter won't carry out
such assignments.

1149
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:08,073
Senator!
If you let me handle your publicity...

1150
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:11,851
Down, everybody!

1151
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:19,521
Who are those people?

1152
01:01:19,727 --> 01:01:21,818
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.

1153
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:23,758
"Get my son in or out of West Point..."

1154
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:28,458
This machine creates a fever 10 miles
away. It'll make you a fortune.

1155
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:30,627
Long-distance fevers.

1156
01:01:30,738 --> 01:01:33,636
A woman wrote a song to replace
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1157
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:35,399
Want to hear it?
- Not today.

1158
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:38,601
I feel like a house afire.
Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.

1159
01:01:38,712 --> 01:01:40,541
- How did I do?
- Great.

1160
01:01:40,648 --> 01:01:43,376
My heart was right up to here
all the time.

1161
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:45,882
What did Paine think?
- Tickled pink.

1162
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:47,576
Oh, boy! I hope so.

1163
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:51,750
What's all this?
- From boys who read about your camp.

1164
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:53,586
Already? All these letter...

1165
01:01:53,694 --> 01:01:56,888
Those are only local. Wait till they
start pouring in from all over.

1166
01:01:56,997 --> 01:02:01,397
You mean... I'd better open one up.
Let's see what they say here.

1167
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,933
Look, there's money.
Let me see.

1168
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:09,031
"Dear Senator Smith...

1169
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:12,474
...I'd like to come to camp.
I shine shoes at the station.

1170
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,330
Here's 9 cents."
Isn’t that wonderful?

1171
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:20,248
And he signs it, "Yours truly,
Stinky Moore."

1172
01:02:20,354 --> 01:02:22,081
Isn't that marvelous?

1173
01:02:22,189 --> 01:02:26,623
If there's money in each one of these,
what will we do with it?

1174
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:28,923
A bank! That's perfect.

1175
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:33,361
You can see how important
this bill will be. Is there any paper?

1176
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:35,091
Second drawer.

1177
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:37,667
That's fine.
I'll be pretty busy tonight.

1178
01:02:38,205 --> 01:02:39,966
Not another bill?

1179
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:43,676
Letters. I'm busting with news!

1180
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:45,674
I introduced a bill.
Me, Jeff Smith!

1181
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:47,369
I spoke in the Senate!

1182
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:51,073
Want to dictate them?
- The letters? I couldn't talk letters.

1183
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,378
I'll sit here
and scratch them down.

1184
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:54,587
And say...

1185
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,087
...I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

1186
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:03,127
And if I tell it right, you'll get the
best jar of preserves you ever tasted.

1187
01:03:03,264 --> 01:03:05,355
Thank you very much.

1188
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:09,893
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.

1189
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:11,469
Don't mention it.

1190
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:16,569
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean....

1191
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:23,725
Who?

1192
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:24,909
Susan Paine.

1193
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,546
How do you do?
Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.

1194
01:03:28,656 --> 01:03:31,623
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you've got to help me.

1195
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,988
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith
from the Senate tomorrow.

1196
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,333
You're what?

1197
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:44,131
I'm to turn my glamour on for him.
You sympathize, don't you?

1198
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:45,463
Awkward, isn't it?

1199
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,641
Take him out and buy him
a suit of clothes that fits...

1200
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,037
...and a hat that he can hang on to.

1201
01:03:51,145 --> 01:03:54,339
And a manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

1202
01:03:54,448 --> 01:03:58,143
As one woman to another,
I hate to ask you to do this, but....

1203
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:00,286
As one woman to another, of course.

1204
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,613
Thanks, and...

1205
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:03,050
Just a minute.

1206
01:04:03,657 --> 01:04:05,190
Miss Paine.

1207
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:08,628
Susan Paine?

1208
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,854
She wants to talk to me?

1209
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:14,232
What does she...?

1210
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:17,726
Holy mackerel.

1211
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:23,406
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

1212
01:04:24,378 --> 01:04:25,478
Yes.

1213
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,680
Fine.

1214
01:04:29,683 --> 01:04:30,783
What?

1215
01:04:34,688 --> 01:04:36,415
What? Escort you?

1216
01:04:41,595 --> 01:04:43,686
I'd be delighted.

1217
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,729
All right.

1218
01:04:46,266 --> 01:04:47,731
Reception for a princess?

1219
01:04:48,235 --> 01:04:49,859
She wants me to...

1220
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,435
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

1221
01:04:52,106 --> 01:04:53,400
Goodbye.

1222
01:04:53,507 --> 01:04:56,098
What do you know?
A reception for a princess.

1223
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,505
- Can you imagine?
- Get your hat.

1224
01:04:58,612 --> 01:05:01,806
We have a lot of shopping to do
before tomorrow.

1225
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,974
Where are your bitters?

1226
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:08,018
In the thing there.
Behind the thing.

1227
01:05:08,288 --> 01:05:11,323
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

1228
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,324
It's these clouts below the belt
I can't take.

1229
01:05:16,597 --> 01:05:20,827
Siccing that horrible dame on him
when he's goofy about her.

1230
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:22,852
What dame?

1231
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,003
Paine.

1232
01:05:26,707 --> 01:05:28,172
Better be nice to her.

1233
01:05:28,275 --> 01:05:30,935
Her dad's the party choice
for the White House.

1234
01:05:31,045 --> 01:05:34,046
She may be the next
First Lady of the land.

1235
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:38,447
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan "Paine-In-The-Neck."

1236
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:42,811
He isn't going to be hurt enough.
She has to twist a knife in him too.

1237
01:05:42,923 --> 01:05:44,650
The regal jackass.

1238
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:47,053
"I'll turn my glamour on him,"
she says.

1239
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:48,353
What's it to you?

1240
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,325
Nothing. I'm just saying...

1241
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:52,123
Then stop worrying.

1242
01:05:52,232 --> 01:05:54,994
I told you, the dopes
will inherit the earth.

1243
01:05:55,135 --> 01:05:59,729
I wonder if this Don Quixote
hasn't got the jump on all of us.

1244
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,532
If it isn't a curse to go
through life wised up like you and me.

1245
01:06:03,644 --> 01:06:07,942
If you're going to wonder,
let's go down and do it over a steak.

1246
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:11,075
Come on, snap out of it.
Drink up!

1247
01:06:11,185 --> 01:06:13,116
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

1248
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,145
And to Don Quixote.

1249
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:18,981
Do you know how I felt?

1250
01:06:19,093 --> 01:06:21,127
How did you feel? Quick.

1251
01:06:21,795 --> 01:06:23,920
I felt just like a mother.

1252
01:06:24,665 --> 01:06:28,394
Sending her kid off to school
for the first time.

1253
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:34,205
Watching the little fellow
toddling off in his best bib and tucker.

1254
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:37,709
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

1255
01:06:42,616 --> 01:06:44,809
Say, who started this?

1256
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,884
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.

1257
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,553
Well, cut it out, see?

1258
01:06:53,026 --> 01:06:54,388
Who cares, anyway?

1259
01:06:55,696 --> 01:06:57,058
I apologize.

1260
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:58,356
All right, then.

1261
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:04,096
After all, what's it to me?
So they drop him out of a balloon.

1262
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:06,738
All I care is,
I don't want to be around.

1263
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,500
I'm squeamish, see?
That's what I am.

1264
01:07:11,578 --> 01:07:12,678
No, sir.

1265
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:16,180
I don't have to take it.
I won't be party to murder.

1266
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,317
I'm going to quit.
I'm through.

1267
01:07:18,418 --> 01:07:20,918
Again?
It's a good idea.

1268
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,467
Let's get married.

1269
01:07:35,669 --> 01:07:37,498
It's a good idea.

1270
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:39,122
When?

1271
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,398
Anytime.

1272
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,241
Tonight?

1273
01:07:43,577 --> 01:07:44,803
You don't mind?

1274
01:07:45,445 --> 01:07:46,978
I'd cherish you.

1275
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:51,350
You're a good egg, Diz.

1276
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:52,813
I know.

1277
01:07:53,587 --> 01:07:56,087
Maybe we could clear out of this town.

1278
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,451
Get to feel like people.

1279
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,622
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.

1280
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,321
- Tunnel?
- A tunnel.

1281
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,735
You've never seen prairie grass...

1282
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:13,269
...with the wind leaning on it,
have you, Diz?

1283
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:16,237
Does the wind get tired out there?

1284
01:08:18,245 --> 01:08:20,813
Or angry little mountain streams...

1285
01:08:21,915 --> 01:08:24,813
...or the sun moving
against the cattle?

1286
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:29,353
You've never seen anything like that,
have you, Diz?

1287
01:08:30,157 --> 01:08:31,451
Have you?

1288
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,490
Do we have to?

1289
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:42,158
I can't think of anything more sappy.

1290
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:44,136
Then let's get going.

1291
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,338
Where?

1292
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,839
We're getting married.

1293
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:49,975
That's right.

1294
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:55,875
In case you don't know, I want to
give you a chance to back out.

1295
01:08:55,983 --> 01:08:57,024
What?

1296
01:08:57,124 --> 01:08:58,981
My first name's Clarissa.

1297
01:08:59,086 --> 01:09:00,653
I know. It's okay.

1298
01:09:01,622 --> 01:09:04,953
Don't say "okay."
Say you think it's beautiful.

1299
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,921
Okay. I mean...

1300
01:09:07,027 --> 01:09:11,063
You don't know any name offhand
that you like better, do you?

1301
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:12,629
Not offhand.

1302
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:15,063
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?

1303
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:16,268
Susan?

1304
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:20,463
I won't take it, see?

1305
01:09:20,774 --> 01:09:22,899
I won't be party to murder, see?

1306
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:27,706
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that Taylor mob is low enough...

1307
01:09:27,814 --> 01:09:30,576
...but helping that dame
cut him in little bits...

1308
01:09:30,684 --> 01:09:33,344
...nobody's going to make me do that!
No, sir.

1309
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,787
You said it.

1310
01:09:34,887 --> 01:09:38,322
I'm going to get out of there right now.
Right now.

1311
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,993
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.

1312
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,186
Everything I own.
My extra hat, everything.

1313
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:45,965
Wait a minute.

1314
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:48,157
We're getting married!

1315
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:49,763
See you later.

1316
01:09:56,576 --> 01:09:57,676
Saunders?

1317
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:07,046
What do you want?

1318
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:09,722
- You should have been there.
- I know.

1319
01:10:09,823 --> 01:10:12,858
It was a wonderful party, and
your suit went over big...

1320
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,788
...and she looked beautiful.

1321
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,756
And when you left she said...

1322
01:10:16,863 --> 01:10:18,624
..."Thank you, Mr. Smith."

1323
01:10:18,732 --> 01:10:23,098
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

1324
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:24,497
Horseradish.

1325
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,780
What are you looking at?
You didn't think I was a lady, did you?

1326
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:38,780
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.

1327
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:41,613
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.

1328
01:10:41,722 --> 01:10:43,813
There's a lot I can't take.

1329
01:10:43,924 --> 01:10:45,821
Can't take a simple...

1330
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:51,088
Why don't you go home?

1331
01:10:51,298 --> 01:10:55,164
Tell your little streams about your camp
and the land of the free.

1332
01:10:55,268 --> 01:10:58,531
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

1333
01:10:58,638 --> 01:10:59,932
Now go home!

1334
01:11:00,374 --> 01:11:02,840
That's all I wanted to tell you.

1335
01:11:03,643 --> 01:11:05,768
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

1336
01:11:08,415 --> 01:11:09,880
That's me.

1337
01:11:11,385 --> 01:11:14,386
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a...

1338
01:11:16,123 --> 01:11:17,554
Wait a minute.

1339
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:20,095
Why don't I do this right?

1340
01:11:20,536 --> 01:11:24,094
So you want to be a senator?
Build a camp on Willet Creek?

1341
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:25,306
See this?

1342
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,872
Deficiency bill.

1343
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:31,103
Section 40. A dam going up where you
think your camp will be.

1344
01:11:31,213 --> 01:11:33,508
Ever hear of it?

1345
01:11:33,616 --> 01:11:37,083
They read about it in the Senate today,
but you didn't hear.

1346
01:11:37,186 --> 01:11:39,777
That's why that ritzy dame
took you in tow.

1347
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:44,255
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

1348
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,485
Go ahead.
Be a senator.

1349
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:49,596
Try and mess up
Mr. Taylor's little graft.

1350
01:11:49,698 --> 01:11:51,356
But if you can't...

1351
01:11:51,467 --> 01:11:54,536
...and you can't in 9 million years...

1352
01:11:55,037 --> 01:11:59,198
Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

1353
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:01,974
Come on, Diz.

1354
01:12:07,349 --> 01:12:09,007
Hey! This way.

1355
01:12:12,922 --> 01:12:16,389
Come on, kid.
We'll dig up a preacher.

1356
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,523
We're going to get married.

1357
01:12:28,737 --> 01:12:31,237
Come on, I'll take you home.

1358
01:12:39,114 --> 01:12:42,976
There are 100 other places in the state
that really need the water.

1359
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:47,245
Kenneth Allen owns some land there.
He didn't mention a dam.

1360
01:12:47,356 --> 01:12:50,584
There's something wrong here.
I know there is.

1361
01:12:50,693 --> 01:12:53,762
I won't vote on it till I get
some questions answered.

1362
01:12:53,862 --> 01:12:56,453
- Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
- I am?

1363
01:12:56,565 --> 01:13:00,066
Trying to understand everything about
a project that took two years to set up.

1364
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:03,898
- The reasons, the benefits.
- The benefits? Who is Taylor?

1365
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:06,506
What's he got to do with this?

1366
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:09,507
What makes you think
he's got anything to do with it?

1367
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:13,043
I've heard that this is all
his idea to get graft.

1368
01:13:15,584 --> 01:13:17,584
Do you know what you're saying?

1369
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:21,586
You're accusing me of framing a bill
for one individual's benefit.

1370
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,691
Of helping to put through
a scheme for graft.

1371
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:26,821
Long distance?

1372
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:29,259
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.

1373
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:32,056
Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer?
Manna from heaven.

1374
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:34,064
Didn't even know how to tell time.

1375
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,430
Will you tell me
exactly what he's done?

1376
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:39,471
He's about to blow the machine
to smithereens, and you with it.

1377
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:41,336
Me, Jim? How?

1378
01:13:41,443 --> 01:13:43,443
You wouldn't understand that.

1379
01:13:43,545 --> 01:13:46,876
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs,
I'm on my way to Washington.

1380
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:51,746
No matter what happens, I'm all ready
for that Boy Ranger of yours.

1381
01:13:51,854 --> 01:13:54,013
Take your instructions
from Ken Allen.

1382
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:56,623
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.

1383
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:59,453
Use your high office to help Alan
get things done.

1384
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,856
Do you understand?

1385
01:14:01,964 --> 01:14:03,497
I doubt it.
Come on, Alan.

1386
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:08,431
I haven't been able to show him a single
monument. Not even one that high.

1387
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,902
No, he's been on our tail.
You've got to keep this guy off of us.

1388
01:14:12,007 --> 01:14:16,009
Ever since he found out we represent
the Creek, he's been running us ragged.

1389
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:19,703
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here like this.

1390
01:14:19,882 --> 01:14:21,609
You proved how you can handle him.

1391
01:14:21,717 --> 01:14:24,411
You're the one that started him
writing bills.

1392
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,246
Chick, let him in.

1393
01:14:26,355 --> 01:14:30,391
- You didn't ask Smith here?
What do you think?

1394
01:14:30,492 --> 01:14:33,390
Don't open that door.
Jim, you can't do this.

1395
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,497
Let him in, Chick.

1396
01:14:36,732 --> 01:14:38,390
All right, Jim.

1397
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,067
You can count me out.

1398
01:14:43,305 --> 01:14:45,703
Good morning, senator.
Come right in.

1399
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:54,375
What did you mean, count you out?

1400
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:57,450
You can't come here and
pull that steamroller stuff.

1401
01:14:57,553 --> 01:14:59,416
Your methods won't do here.

1402
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:02,215
He's a senator.
However it happened, he's a senator.

1403
01:15:02,324 --> 01:15:03,618
This is Washington.

1404
01:15:03,726 --> 01:15:07,592
Steamroller stuff?
My methods don't go in Washington?

1405
01:15:07,696 --> 01:15:09,195
They've done well by you.

1406
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:13,129
That's beside the point.
This boy's different. He's honest.

1407
01:15:13,235 --> 01:15:15,803
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do it!

1408
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:19,770
What am I supposed to do? Stand around
and let that drooling infant...

1409
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:23,604
...wrap that Willet Creek Dam
appropriation around my neck?

1410
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:25,245
Not me.

1411
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:28,815
Either he falls in line with us...

1412
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:32,748
...or I'll break him so wide open
they'll never find the pieces.

1413
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:35,685
Jim, I won't stand for it.

1414
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,415
You won't stand for it?

1415
01:15:37,526 --> 01:15:40,720
I don't want any part
of crucifying this boy.

1416
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,358
I see.

1417
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:48,869
Our steamroller methods are too hard
for your sensitive soul. Is that it?

1418
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:52,807
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

1419
01:15:54,243 --> 01:15:57,278
My methods have been all right
for the past 20 years.

1420
01:15:57,379 --> 01:16:00,175
Since I picked you
out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall...

1421
01:16:00,282 --> 01:16:02,509
...and made you look like a senator.

1422
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:04,549
And now you can't stand it?

1423
01:16:04,653 --> 01:16:07,187
Maybe you don't have to stand it.

1424
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:10,586
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy
can go home together.

1425
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:14,592
- You don't have to...
- It's all right, it's all right.

1426
01:16:15,831 --> 01:16:20,061
Seems a shame, though, to part company
like this after all these years.

1427
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:24,228
Especially now, with a national
convention coming up.

1428
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,371
Joe, I put everything I have
behind you.

1429
01:16:28,477 --> 01:16:30,670
And so did all of our friends.

1430
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:33,541
I guess we'll survive.

1431
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:37,511
We'll just find somebody else
who's got a little more sense.

1432
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:42,452
In the meantime, you go in and
explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.

1433
01:16:42,558 --> 01:16:45,058
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

1434
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,820
If he can't find enough facts
to break you with...

1435
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:51,090
...send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.

1436
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:54,902
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

1437
01:17:02,344 --> 01:17:03,843
Come here, will you?

1438
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:15,749
It's just that I like the kid.

1439
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:18,923
I don't want to see you
get too rough on him.

1440
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:22,689
I'm glad you came to your senses.

1441
01:17:22,798 --> 01:17:25,423
You had me scared there for a minute.

1442
01:17:25,534 --> 01:17:29,331
Go back to your office. I'll call you
when I get through with Smith.

1443
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,411
"The Silver Knight."

1444
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:51,625
Hello, senator.

1445
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:54,992
I was just passing through.
I thought I'd like to meet you.

1446
01:17:55,097 --> 01:17:57,597
Sit down. You met all
the boys here, I suppose.

1447
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:00,529
They say you've been
on your toes since you got here.

1448
01:18:00,636 --> 01:18:02,226
That's fine.

1449
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:06,166
You know, some people told me
that you were dumb.

1450
01:18:06,275 --> 01:18:07,865
I think you're smart.

1451
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:10,510
You're smart enough
to understand a situation...

1452
01:18:10,612 --> 01:18:12,805
- ...when it's explained to you.
- Like what?

1453
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,778
Well, for instance...

1454
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:16,678
...building a dam on Willet Creek.

1455
01:18:16,785 --> 01:18:18,910
Just what's your interest in this?

1456
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:20,520
What's my interest?

1457
01:18:22,457 --> 01:18:25,754
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

1458
01:18:25,861 --> 01:18:29,453
Owning a lot of its industry,
newspapers and other odds and ends.

1459
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:33,498
If I felt you had the welfare
of the state at heart like I have...

1460
01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:36,364
...I'd say you were a man to watch.

1461
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:38,738
Now, what do you like?

1462
01:18:39,074 --> 01:18:40,141
Business?

1463
01:18:40,241 --> 01:18:42,367
If you do, you can pick any job...

1464
01:18:42,477 --> 01:18:44,272
...in the state and go to the top.

1465
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:45,774
Or politics.

1466
01:18:46,448 --> 01:18:50,541
If you like being senator, there's
no reason why you can't come back...

1467
01:18:50,652 --> 01:18:52,811
...and stay there
as long as you want.

1468
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:54,886
If you're smart.

1469
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,388
Now, you take the boys here,
or Joe Paine.

1470
01:18:57,492 --> 01:18:59,184
They're doing all right.

1471
01:18:59,294 --> 01:19:01,123
They don't have to worry about...

1472
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:03,422
...being re-elected or anything else.

1473
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:04,599
They're smart.

1474
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,597
They take my advice.

1475
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:10,732
You tell these men
and Senator Paine what to do?

1476
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,031
Why, yes.

1477
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,471
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past 20 years.

1478
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:19,346
You're a liar.

1479
01:19:28,623 --> 01:19:30,520
I've got to see Senator Paine.

1480
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,420
Senator Paine is out of town.

1481
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:34,618
Out of town?
He couldn't be.

1482
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,427
Hello, Jeff.
Come in.

1483
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:43,933
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

1484
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:46,632
He said he's told you
what to do for 20 years.

1485
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:48,707
I called him a liar.

1486
01:19:49,444 --> 01:19:51,409
Come over here and sit down.

1487
01:19:51,513 --> 01:19:53,672
I don't feel like sitting down.

1488
01:19:53,949 --> 01:19:55,983
Oh, I know how you feel.

1489
01:19:57,386 --> 01:19:59,954
I was hoping you'd be
spared all this.

1490
01:20:00,522 --> 01:20:02,453
I was hoping that you would...

1491
01:20:02,557 --> 01:20:05,888
...see the sights, absorb some history,
and go back to your boys.

1492
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:09,655
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there.

1493
01:20:09,765 --> 01:20:10,991
This is a man's world.

1494
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,996
It's brutal,
and you've no place in it.

1495
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:16,967
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice.
Forget Taylor and what he said.

1496
01:20:17,072 --> 01:20:19,072
Forget you ever heard
of Willet Creek Dam.

1497
01:20:19,174 --> 01:20:21,469
But you still haven't
answered me, sir.

1498
01:20:21,576 --> 01:20:25,874
Can a man like Taylor tell you
and those other men what to do?

1499
01:20:27,382 --> 01:20:29,575
Listen, Jeff, please...

1500
01:20:30,085 --> 01:20:31,846
...and try to understand.

1501
01:20:31,987 --> 01:20:34,885
I know it's tough to run
head-on into facts.

1502
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:38,457
This is a man's world,
and you got to check your ideals...

1503
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,254
...outside the door,
like you do your rubbers.

1504
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:45,193
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.

1505
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:47,465
I was you.

1506
01:20:47,736 --> 01:20:51,431
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

1507
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,937
And I made it.

1508
01:20:53,942 --> 01:20:55,509
I compromised.

1509
01:20:56,578 --> 01:21:01,513
So I could sit in that Senate and
serve the people in 1000 honest ways.

1510
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,778
You got to face facts.

1511
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:06,177
I've served our state well,
haven't l?

1512
01:21:06,288 --> 01:21:09,983
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants.

1513
01:21:10,559 --> 01:21:12,354
But I've had to compromise.

1514
01:21:12,461 --> 01:21:15,291
I've had to play ball.
You can't count on people voting.

1515
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:17,795
Half the time
they don't vote, anyway.

1516
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:21,867
That's how states and empires have been
built since time began, understand?

1517
01:21:28,276 --> 01:21:31,402
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

1518
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:36,842
I've told you all this because...

1519
01:21:37,652 --> 01:21:39,947
...I've grown very fond of you.

1520
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:42,887
About like a son, in fact.

1521
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:46,349
And I don't want to
see you get hurt.

1522
01:21:47,262 --> 01:21:52,231
When that deficiency bill comes up
tomorrow, don't say a word.

1523
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:55,699
Great powers are behind it,
who'll destroy you before you start.

1524
01:21:55,804 --> 01:21:57,394
For your own sake...

1525
01:21:57,806 --> 01:22:00,898
...and for the sake of
my friendship with your father...

1526
01:22:01,009 --> 01:22:02,167
...please...

1527
01:22:03,145 --> 01:22:05,236
...don't say a word.

1528
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:15,315
Owing to the urgency
of the deficiency bill...

1529
01:22:15,423 --> 01:22:17,582
...there is a unanimous
consent agreement...

1530
01:22:17,692 --> 01:22:21,159
...that no one will speak more than once
or longer than five minutes...

1531
01:22:21,263 --> 01:22:23,593
...on any section of the bill.

1532
01:22:24,032 --> 01:22:25,258
Clerk will read.

1533
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:30,900
"The bill for deficiency appropriations
for the fiscal year, Section One.

1534
01:22:31,006 --> 01:22:32,368
On emergency relief:

1535
01:22:32,474 --> 01:22:35,543
To create and erect
public improvements on rivers...

1536
01:22:35,644 --> 01:22:37,735
...harbors and roadways,
$150 billion.

1537
01:22:38,346 --> 01:22:39,396
Section 40:

1538
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:42,539
An appropriation to divert
and impound Willet Creek...

1539
01:22:42,651 --> 01:22:45,413
...to the natural basin
of Terry Canyon, $5 million."

1540
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,620
Mr. President?

1541
01:22:47,189 --> 01:22:49,985
Senator Smith desires
to be heard on Section 40?

1542
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:51,191
I do, sir.

1543
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:54,088
The senator understands
he's limited to five minutes?

1544
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:55,296
Yes, sir.

1545
01:22:55,864 --> 01:22:57,329
You may proceed, sir.

1546
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:01,969
Mr. President, this section of the bill,
this dam on Willet Creek...

1547
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:03,569
...is nothing but...

1548
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:07,041
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague?

1549
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:09,443
Why, yes, sir.

1550
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:11,068
You may proceed, senator.

1551
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:12,405
Mr. President...

1552
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:15,179
...I have risen to a difficult task...

1553
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:18,216
...to say from evidence
that has come to my attention...

1554
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,321
...I consider Senator Smith
unworthy to address this body.

1555
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,484
You boys go out
and get the senators.

1556
01:23:27,495 --> 01:23:29,961
Something going on inside,
come on.

1557
01:23:33,768 --> 01:23:37,065
The senator will suspend
until order is restored.

1558
01:23:37,539 --> 01:23:40,233
All senators are
wanted on the floor, please.

1559
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,639
What's going on?
- I don't know.

1560
01:23:59,995 --> 01:24:01,289
You may proceed.

1561
01:24:01,396 --> 01:24:02,724
I refer to the bill...

1562
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:06,765
...he has introduced for
the creation of a national boys' camp.

1563
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:10,062
He named a portion of land
to be dedicated to that purpose...

1564
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:14,332
...and to be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

1565
01:24:14,442 --> 01:24:15,600
Senators...

1566
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:20,941
...I have evidence to prove my colleague
owns the land described in his bill.

1567
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:28,756
He bought it the day after his
appointment to the Senate...

1568
01:24:28,857 --> 01:24:29,898
...and is holding it...

1569
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:33,460
...using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

1570
01:24:39,668 --> 01:24:41,463
Boy Ranger had a wreck.

1571
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:43,159
This doesn't make sense.

1572
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,164
Accordingly...

1573
01:24:46,775 --> 01:24:48,240
...I offer a resolution...

1574
01:24:48,343 --> 01:24:51,606
...an inquiry by the Committee
of Privileges and Elections...

1575
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:53,280
...as to the fitness
of my colleague...

1576
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,381
...to continue to
sit in this chamber.

1577
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,290
Order!

1578
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:07,152
Chairman, clear the galleries
unless order is restored.

1579
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:14,428
Flash! Ranger senator
branded by colleague.

1580
01:25:14,536 --> 01:25:16,968
Flash! Paine brings charges
to expel Smith.

1581
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:19,265
Where's Saunders?
- She'll have the lowdown.

1582
01:25:19,374 --> 01:25:22,307
I wish I knew. She left town
in that jalopy of hers.

1583
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:27,308
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys' camp built for his own profit.

1584
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:28,448
Give me a cigarette.

1585
01:25:28,548 --> 01:25:31,348
Paine's asked for a hearing
before the Committee.

1586
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:36,450
Well, frankly, my dear senators...

1587
01:25:36,558 --> 01:25:39,525
...the morning that Mr. Allen
burst into my office...

1588
01:25:39,627 --> 01:25:43,458
...bringing proof that Smith
had the deed to that campsite...

1589
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:44,893
...I was dumbfounded!

1590
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:48,796
Pardon me, what did you do when
this was brought to your attention?

1591
01:25:48,903 --> 01:25:51,870
I consulted with the head
of the Department of Records...

1592
01:25:51,973 --> 01:25:53,506
...Mr. Arthur Kim.

1593
01:25:53,808 --> 01:25:56,809
Mr. Kim, do you remember
recording such a deed?

1594
01:25:58,179 --> 01:26:01,339
On the date set forth here,
Mr. Allen came before me...

1595
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:02,914
...to record this deed...

1596
01:26:03,017 --> 01:26:06,211
...setting over 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

1597
01:26:06,488 --> 01:26:09,455
How long have you known
Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?

1598
01:26:09,557 --> 01:26:11,454
Oh, a good many years.

1599
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:15,891
He used my land by Willet Creek
every summer for his Boy Rangers.

1600
01:26:15,997 --> 01:26:17,689
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow.

1601
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:19,457
One day he made a proposition.

1602
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:23,068
Said he had a chance to sell that land
for at least $500 an acre.

1603
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:26,798
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

1604
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:29,772
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a
contract...

1605
01:26:29,878 --> 01:26:32,572
...guaranteeing me half,
if he made the sale.

1606
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,008
Mind you now...

1607
01:26:34,115 --> 01:26:36,308
...the whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

1608
01:26:36,418 --> 01:26:38,850
That contract you mentioned...

1609
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:40,020
...have you got it?

1610
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,622
That land wouldn't be
in his name if I didn't.

1611
01:26:42,724 --> 01:26:44,815
Yes, sir.
Signed and delivered.

1612
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:47,017
I never signed any such contract!

1613
01:26:47,128 --> 01:26:48,252
He certainly did!

1614
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:49,930
Just a moment, please.

1615
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:57,997
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion...

1616
01:26:58,106 --> 01:27:01,903
...that it is definitely in
Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

1617
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,010
As an expert on handwriting...

1618
01:27:04,112 --> 01:27:08,649
...I'd say the name of Jefferson
Smith on this contract has been forged.

1619
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:12,752
I would stake my whole 20 years
professional career...

1620
01:27:12,854 --> 01:27:16,185
...on the fact that
this is not a forgery...

1621
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:20,020
...but is Mr. Smith's own signature.

1622
01:27:20,161 --> 01:27:22,456
This is a very painful
duty for me.

1623
01:27:22,564 --> 01:27:24,689
This boy's the son
of my very best friend.

1624
01:27:24,799 --> 01:27:27,834
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped frame his bill.

1625
01:27:27,936 --> 01:27:30,630
When he presented it,
I went to congratulate him...

1626
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:33,238
...but pointed out
a dam was already going up...

1627
01:27:33,341 --> 01:27:35,966
...on the very site
he'd chosen for his camp.

1628
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:38,771
There are other
good campsites nearby...

1629
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,914
...so I suggested he choose another.

1630
01:27:41,115 --> 01:27:42,477
He became furious.

1631
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:44,413
He said, "Move the dam."

1632
01:27:44,519 --> 01:27:47,611
I was amazed at his violent reaction.
I couldn't understand.

1633
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:51,849
Until the evidence came to me that
he owned those very 200 acres.

1634
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,084
And as you have heard...

1635
01:27:53,194 --> 01:27:56,559
...had carefully laid plans
to make an enormous profit...

1636
01:27:56,664 --> 01:28:01,633
...out of the nickels and dimes scraped
together by the boys of this country.

1637
01:28:01,836 --> 01:28:03,096
Faced with that...

1638
01:28:04,105 --> 01:28:07,003
...regardless of my
personal feelings for the boy...

1639
01:28:07,108 --> 01:28:10,837
...my sense of duty told me his
expulsion from the Senate...

1640
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:12,876
...was the only possible answer.

1641
01:28:12,981 --> 01:28:15,106
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.

1642
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,181
Senator Smith, please.

1643
01:28:25,193 --> 01:28:26,783
Will you take the chair, please?

1644
01:28:38,373 --> 01:28:41,965
The Committee is ready
to hear you now, Senator Smith.

1645
01:28:49,984 --> 01:28:51,642
Keep your seats, gentlemen!

1646
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,877
Committee is not adjourned yet.

1647
01:28:53,988 --> 01:28:55,953
Quiet! Please!

1648
01:28:59,027 --> 01:29:03,325
That Ranger never knew what struck
him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

1649
01:29:03,431 --> 01:29:05,624
Which one of you girls wants this?

1650
01:29:08,937 --> 01:29:11,028
- Do you want it?
- Oh, yes.

1651
01:30:51,372 --> 01:30:53,963
You know, I had a hunch
I'd find you here...

1652
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:55,733
...when you weren't anyplace else.

1653
01:30:59,714 --> 01:31:01,111
How've you been, Saunders?

1654
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:02,509
Oh, all right.

1655
01:31:03,518 --> 01:31:05,279
Your husband.
How's he?

1656
01:31:06,988 --> 01:31:09,056
Old Diz.
We're not married.

1657
01:31:13,695 --> 01:31:18,232
Good thing I got back just when I did.
You know what I found waiting for me?

1658
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,867
Jar of preserves from your mother.

1659
01:31:20,968 --> 01:31:22,126
Oh, you did?

1660
01:31:23,638 --> 01:31:25,296
What was it, strawberry?

1661
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:28,301
That's the best kind.

1662
01:31:30,578 --> 01:31:33,647
I see by the papers
you certainly got to be a senator.

1663
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:38,414
You sure had the right idea
about me, Saunders.

1664
01:31:38,519 --> 01:31:42,680
You told me to go back home and
keep filling those kids full of hooey.

1665
01:31:44,225 --> 01:31:47,658
Just a simple guy, you said,
still wet behind the ears...

1666
01:31:47,762 --> 01:31:50,092
...lot of junk about American ideals.

1667
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:53,361
That's certainly
a lot of junk, all right.

1668
01:31:53,468 --> 01:31:56,469
- Now look, senator...
- I don't know...

1669
01:31:56,771 --> 01:31:59,135
...this is a whole new world to me.

1670
01:32:01,342 --> 01:32:03,273
What are you going to believe in...

1671
01:32:04,245 --> 01:32:07,837
...when a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears...

1672
01:32:07,949 --> 01:32:11,507
...that I've been robbing
kids of nickels and dimes?

1673
01:32:12,386 --> 01:32:15,512
A man I've admired
and worshiped all my life.

1674
01:32:15,623 --> 01:32:16,951
I don't know.

1675
01:32:17,525 --> 01:32:19,252
A lot of fancy words in this town.

1676
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,258
Some of them are carved in stone,
some of them....

1677
01:32:22,363 --> 01:32:26,729
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up
there so suckers like me can read them.

1678
01:32:27,301 --> 01:32:30,165
Then when you find out
what men actually do....

1679
01:32:30,605 --> 01:32:33,265
Well, I'm getting out
of this town so fast...

1680
01:32:33,374 --> 01:32:37,342
...away from all the words and the
monuments and the whole rotten show.

1681
01:32:38,179 --> 01:32:39,405
I see.

1682
01:32:40,715 --> 01:32:43,340
When you get home,
what will you tell those kids?

1683
01:32:43,718 --> 01:32:45,786
Well, I'll tell them the truth.

1684
01:32:45,887 --> 01:32:48,512
Might as well find it out
now as later.

1685
01:32:49,757 --> 01:32:52,087
I don't think they'll believe you.

1686
01:32:52,693 --> 01:32:56,251
They're liable to look up at you
with hurt faces and say...

1687
01:32:56,364 --> 01:32:58,728
..."Jeff, what did you do? Quit?

1688
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:00,628
Didn't you do something about it?"

1689
01:33:01,068 --> 01:33:03,432
Well, what do you expect me to do?

1690
01:33:04,138 --> 01:33:06,172
An honorary stooge
like me against...

1691
01:33:06,274 --> 01:33:10,037
...the Taylors and Paines
and machines and lies.

1692
01:33:10,344 --> 01:33:13,379
Your friend Mr. Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

1693
01:33:13,481 --> 01:33:17,449
So did every other man who tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

1694
01:33:17,552 --> 01:33:21,179
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

1695
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:23,516
All the good that ever came
into this world...

1696
01:33:23,624 --> 01:33:26,488
...came from fools with faith
like that. You know that.

1697
01:33:26,961 --> 01:33:30,224
You can't quit now. Not you.

1698
01:33:30,464 --> 01:33:32,828
They aren't all Taylors and Paines
in Washington.

1699
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:36,162
That kind just throw big shadows,
that's all.

1700
01:33:36,571 --> 01:33:40,300
You didn't just have faith in Paine,
or any other living man.

1701
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:42,635
You had faith in something bigger.

1702
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:46,677
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness...

1703
01:33:46,781 --> 01:33:49,714
...and this country
could use some of that.

1704
01:33:50,384 --> 01:33:53,976
So could the whole cockeyed world.
A lot of it.

1705
01:33:54,856 --> 01:33:56,753
Remember the first day
you got here?

1706
01:33:56,858 --> 01:33:58,687
Remember what you said
about Mr. Lincoln?

1707
01:33:58,793 --> 01:34:01,862
That he was waiting for
someone to come along?

1708
01:34:01,963 --> 01:34:03,030
You were right.

1709
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:07,600
He was waiting for a man who could
see his job and sail into it.

1710
01:34:07,702 --> 01:34:11,465
Who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

1711
01:34:11,572 --> 01:34:13,936
I think he was waiting for you.

1712
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:16,541
He knows you can do it.
So do l.

1713
01:34:17,044 --> 01:34:19,009
What?
Do what, Saunders?

1714
01:34:19,113 --> 01:34:22,512
You make up your mind you won't quit,
and I'll tell you what.

1715
01:34:22,617 --> 01:34:25,083
Been thinking about it
all the way back here.

1716
01:34:25,186 --> 01:34:29,620
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water,
but I think you can do it.

1717
01:34:36,831 --> 01:34:37,931
Clarissa...

1718
01:34:38,866 --> 01:34:40,365
...where can we get a drink?

1719
01:34:40,468 --> 01:34:41,568
Now you're talking.

1720
01:34:41,736 --> 01:34:43,701
Come on over to my place.

1721
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,647
Mr. Dearborn.

1722
01:34:57,952 --> 01:34:59,383
Mr. Dernell.

1723
01:34:59,687 --> 01:35:01,152
Mr. Dwight.

1724
01:35:01,656 --> 01:35:03,656
They're going to
expel Smith today, eh?

1725
01:35:03,758 --> 01:35:06,224
Where are the drums?
Where's the guillotine?

1726
01:35:06,327 --> 01:35:07,519
In fact, where's Smith?

1727
01:35:07,628 --> 01:35:10,322
Hasn't stopped running
since he left the Committee.

1728
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:11,589
- Mr. Singleton.
- Here.

1729
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:12,732
Mr. Smith.

1730
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:13,866
Here!

1731
01:35:22,543 --> 01:35:23,837
That guy's batty.

1732
01:35:23,945 --> 01:35:26,513
The clerk will continue
with the roll call.

1733
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:30,246
Here comes Saunders.

1734
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:38,756
Is this some of your shenanigan?

1735
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:40,460
What's the matter?

1736
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,222
Pray, Diz,
if you know how.

1737
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,963
Did you have anything to do with
bringing him in here?

1738
01:35:46,133 --> 01:35:47,723
Are you crazy?

1739
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:52,835
Ninety senators have answered
to their names.

1740
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,268
Quorum is present.

1741
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:56,640
Proceeding now to the regular order.

1742
01:36:08,689 --> 01:36:09,789
Mr. President.

1743
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,548
Senator MacPherson.

1744
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:15,354
I desire to call up the report
of the Committee...

1745
01:36:15,463 --> 01:36:18,555
...on the expulsion
of Jefferson Smith.

1746
01:36:21,702 --> 01:36:23,531
Clerk will read the report.

1747
01:36:24,338 --> 01:36:26,406
"The Committee on Privileges
and Elections reports...

1748
01:36:26,507 --> 01:36:29,167
...it appears to the satisfaction
of the Committee...

1749
01:36:29,276 --> 01:36:31,367
...after hearing
a number of witnesses...

1750
01:36:31,479 --> 01:36:33,809
...that justice
requires that Smith...

1751
01:36:33,914 --> 01:36:36,175
...no longer continue
a member of this body.

1752
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:40,413
They report this resolution with
recommendation that the same do pass.

1753
01:36:40,588 --> 01:36:44,920
Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate."

1754
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:55,127
I move for the immediate
adoption of the resolution.

1755
01:36:56,237 --> 01:36:58,498
- I addressed the chair first.
- I have the floor.

1756
01:36:58,606 --> 01:37:00,640
I'm asking for
a roll call on the passage...

1757
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:02,672
...of the resolution
without further delay.

1758
01:37:02,777 --> 01:37:05,744
The senator can have
nothing to say that would not...

1759
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:10,613
However, Senator Smith
is still a member of this body...

1760
01:37:10,718 --> 01:37:14,049
...and has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

1761
01:37:14,155 --> 01:37:15,552
You were about to recognize me.

1762
01:37:15,656 --> 01:37:17,553
That was merely your impression.

1763
01:37:17,658 --> 01:37:19,123
Let him speak!

1764
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:25,896
Before proceeding further...

1765
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,366
...I remind the visitors in the gallery
they are here as our guests...

1766
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:32,387
...and should conduct
themselves as such.

1767
01:37:32,487 --> 01:37:35,633
And I might add that their sentiments
in no way will affect...

1768
01:37:35,743 --> 01:37:38,141
...the judgement of this chair.

1769
01:37:43,717 --> 01:37:45,444
The chair recognizes...

1770
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:48,852
...Senator Smith.

1771
01:37:51,525 --> 01:37:52,592
Thank you, sir.

1772
01:37:52,692 --> 01:37:54,022
Diz, here we go.

1773
01:37:54,495 --> 01:37:58,429
I guess the gentlemen are
in a big hurry to get me out of here.

1774
01:37:58,933 --> 01:38:02,059
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't blame them much.

1775
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:05,238
And I'm willing to go
when they vote it that way...

1776
01:38:05,339 --> 01:38:08,420
...but before that happens,
I've got a few things to say.

1777
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,737
I tried to say them once before and l
got stopped colder than a mackerel.

1778
01:38:11,846 --> 01:38:13,846
I'd like to get them said
this time.

1779
01:38:13,948 --> 01:38:16,642
I'm not going to leave
until I do get them said.

1780
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,374
Will the senator yield?

1781
01:38:18,486 --> 01:38:21,248
- Senator yields?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not!

1782
01:38:21,889 --> 01:38:23,115
No, sir.

1783
01:38:23,457 --> 01:38:27,391
I yielded the floor once before, and
I was practically never heard of again.

1784
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:28,921
No, sir.

1785
01:38:29,864 --> 01:38:32,626
And we might as well all get together
on this "yielding" business...

1786
01:38:32,733 --> 01:38:33,857
...right off the bat now.

1787
01:38:37,404 --> 01:38:39,563
I had some pretty good
coaching last night...

1788
01:38:39,673 --> 01:38:41,707
...and I find that if l
yield only for a question...

1789
01:38:41,809 --> 01:38:44,139
...or point of order or personal
privilege, that I can...

1790
01:38:44,245 --> 01:38:46,870
...hold this floor
almost until doomsday.

1791
01:38:47,081 --> 01:38:49,308
In other words, I've got
a piece to speak...

1792
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:51,245
...and blow hot or cold,
I'm going to speak it.

1793
01:38:51,352 --> 01:38:52,510
Will the senator yield?

1794
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,415
Will Senator Smith yield?
- Yield how?

1795
01:38:54,522 --> 01:38:56,590
Will he yield for a question?
- All right.

1796
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:58,724
I wish to ask my junior colleague...

1797
01:38:58,826 --> 01:39:00,518
...this piece he intends to speak...

1798
01:39:00,628 --> 01:39:03,595
...does it concern Section 40 of
that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?

1799
01:39:03,697 --> 01:39:06,459
Every aspect of this matter,
everything...

1800
01:39:06,567 --> 01:39:08,225
...was dealt with
in committee hearings.

1801
01:39:08,335 --> 01:39:11,302
- Mr. President?
- I ask my distinguished colleague...

1802
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:13,234
...has he one scrap
of evidence to add now...

1803
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,806
...to the defense he did not give and
could not give at that same hearing?

1804
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:17,807
I have no defense
against forged papers!

1805
01:39:17,912 --> 01:39:19,138
The committee ruled otherwise!

1806
01:39:19,513 --> 01:39:22,605
The gentleman
stands guilty as charged.

1807
01:39:23,017 --> 01:39:24,846
And I believe I speak
for every member...

1808
01:39:24,952 --> 01:39:28,579
...when I say that no one cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character...

1809
01:39:28,689 --> 01:39:32,281
...has to say about any section
of any legislation before this House!

1810
01:39:32,393 --> 01:39:34,723
- Order, order, gentleman!
- Mr. President...

1811
01:39:34,862 --> 01:39:38,557
...I stand guilty as framed because
Section 40 is graft.

1812
01:39:38,732 --> 01:39:41,562
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you...

1813
01:39:41,669 --> 01:39:44,169
...that a certain man in my state,
Mr. James Taylor...

1814
01:39:44,271 --> 01:39:46,532
...wanted to put through this dam
for his own profit.

1815
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,800
A man who controls
a political machine...

1816
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:52,501
...and controls everything else
in my state.

1817
01:39:52,613 --> 01:39:55,204
A man even powerful enough
to control congressmen.

1818
01:39:55,316 --> 01:39:57,907
I saw three of them in his room
the day I went to see him.

1819
01:39:58,018 --> 01:40:00,382
Will the senator yield?
- I will not yield!

1820
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:06,321
This same man,
James Taylor, came down here...

1821
01:40:06,427 --> 01:40:08,927
...and offered me a seat
in this Senate for the next 20 years...

1822
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:13,162
...if I voted for a dam that he knew
and I knew was a fraud...

1823
01:40:13,334 --> 01:40:15,834
...but if I dared to open
my mouth against that dam...

1824
01:40:15,936 --> 01:40:17,526
...he promised to break me in two.

1825
01:40:17,638 --> 01:40:20,502
I got up here and
I started to open my mouth...

1826
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,108
...and the long and powerful arm
of Mr. Taylor...

1827
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:26,905
...reached into this sacred chamber and
grabbed me by the scruff of the neck...

1828
01:40:27,014 --> 01:40:28,342
Mr. President, a point of order.

1829
01:40:28,449 --> 01:40:29,516
Mr. President?

1830
01:40:29,616 --> 01:40:31,048
Senator Paine will state it.

1831
01:40:31,352 --> 01:40:33,613
It was I who rose in this
chamber to accuse him.

1832
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:36,449
He's saying that I was carrying out
criminal orders on falsified evidence.

1833
01:40:36,557 --> 01:40:39,671
He has imputed to me conduct
unworthy a senator, and I demand...

1834
01:40:39,771 --> 01:40:41,691
...that he yield the floor.

1835
01:40:41,795 --> 01:40:44,887
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the congressmen in that room!

1836
01:40:44,999 --> 01:40:46,099
I was in that room!

1837
01:40:48,269 --> 01:40:49,734
Order, gentlemen.

1838
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:53,169
I accuse this man.

1839
01:40:53,274 --> 01:40:55,808
By his tone, by his careful
denials...

1840
01:40:55,909 --> 01:40:59,206
...he is trying to plant
damaging impressions on my conduct.

1841
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:01,471
I'll tell you why
we were in that room.

1842
01:41:01,582 --> 01:41:04,776
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected
citizen of our state...

1843
01:41:04,885 --> 01:41:06,919
...had brought with him
the evidence against this man...

1844
01:41:07,021 --> 01:41:08,952
...and we were urging him to resign.

1845
01:41:09,056 --> 01:41:12,922
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace
upon a clean and honorable state.

1846
01:41:13,027 --> 01:41:14,458
But he refused!

1847
01:41:14,561 --> 01:41:15,603
Mr. President...

1848
01:41:15,703 --> 01:41:17,843
There is only one answer
to a man like him.

1849
01:41:17,943 --> 01:41:21,057
The truth, which I rose and gave
to this body.

1850
01:41:22,102 --> 01:41:23,533
Mr. President...

1851
01:41:23,637 --> 01:41:26,706
...he is trying to blackmail this
Senate as he tried to blackmail me.

1852
01:41:26,807 --> 01:41:28,807
To prevent his expulsion, he'll
even try to...

1853
01:41:28,909 --> 01:41:31,603
...hold up this Deficiency Bill,
vital to the country...

1854
01:41:31,712 --> 01:41:33,780
...which must be passed
immediately!

1855
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:35,573
Have I the floor?

1856
01:41:35,749 --> 01:41:38,909
I have lost all patience
with this brazen character.

1857
01:41:39,019 --> 01:41:41,713
I apologize to this body
for his appointment.

1858
01:41:41,989 --> 01:41:43,920
I regret I ever knew him.
I'm sick...

1859
01:41:44,024 --> 01:41:45,421
...of this contemptible young man.

1860
01:41:45,526 --> 01:41:48,891
And I refuse to stay here
and listen to him any longer.

1861
01:41:49,063 --> 01:41:51,859
I hope every member
of this body feels as I do.

1862
01:41:51,965 --> 01:41:54,226
Get off the floor! Yield the floor!

1863
01:41:56,003 --> 01:41:57,263
Gentlemen!

1864
01:41:57,371 --> 01:42:00,372
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

1865
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:03,371
Mr. President, what does
the gentleman want of this body?

1866
01:42:03,477 --> 01:42:04,771
I'll tell you, sir!

1867
01:42:04,878 --> 01:42:07,446
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

1868
01:42:07,548 --> 01:42:10,344
The people of my state, they know me
and they know Mr. Taylor.

1869
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:12,451
When they hear my story,
they'll rise up...

1870
01:42:12,553 --> 01:42:15,281
...and kick Taylor's machine
to kingdom come.

1871
01:42:15,389 --> 01:42:17,980
I want one week to go back there
and bring you proof.

1872
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:20,524
In the meantime, I want
this Senate's promise...

1873
01:42:20,627 --> 01:42:23,457
...that I won't be expelled and
this bill will not be passed.

1874
01:42:23,564 --> 01:42:25,393
Will the senator yield?
- For a question.

1875
01:42:25,499 --> 01:42:29,228
Has the gentleman the effrontery to
stand, convicted and in disgrace...

1876
01:42:29,336 --> 01:42:31,768
...and try to force postponement
of the Deficiency Bill?

1877
01:42:31,872 --> 01:42:33,564
- For one week.
- Mr. President!

1878
01:42:33,674 --> 01:42:35,435
I appeal to the senator.

1879
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:38,941
Is he fully aware that this bill
has been months in both Houses...

1880
01:42:39,046 --> 01:42:40,807
...delayed and delayed?

1881
01:42:40,914 --> 01:42:42,948
Millions will be
without food and shelter.

1882
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,277
Public works will be
at a standstill!

1883
01:42:45,386 --> 01:42:46,748
Will we keep
relief from the country?

1884
01:42:46,854 --> 01:42:48,387
The people of my state
need permanent relief...

1885
01:42:48,489 --> 01:42:50,216
...from crooked men riding their backs!

1886
01:42:50,324 --> 01:42:52,119
Mr. President, if the Senate yields...

1887
01:42:52,226 --> 01:42:55,227
...to this sort to blackmail,
it'll become a laughingstock.

1888
01:42:55,329 --> 01:42:57,624
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen.

1889
01:42:57,731 --> 01:43:00,026
An insult to our colleague,
Senator Paine.

1890
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:02,202
I, for one, will follow
the senator's example...

1891
01:43:02,302 --> 01:43:06,304
...and refuse to remain in this chamber
as long as that man holds the floor!

1892
01:43:16,984 --> 01:43:18,608
Order, gentlemen!

1893
01:43:19,953 --> 01:43:23,682
I guess I'll have to speak to
the people of my state from right here!

1894
01:43:25,159 --> 01:43:26,283
I'll tell you...

1895
01:43:26,393 --> 01:43:28,859
...wild horses won't drag me
off this floor until those...

1896
01:43:28,962 --> 01:43:32,361
...people have heard everything I've
got to say, if it takes all winter!

1897
01:43:38,472 --> 01:43:40,199
Filibuster!

1898
01:43:54,087 --> 01:43:56,712
Well, Mr. President,
we seem to be alone.

1899
01:43:58,826 --> 01:44:02,259
I'm not complaining
for social reason, it's just....

1900
01:44:02,362 --> 01:44:06,626
I think it'd be a pity if these
gentlemen missed any of this. And....

1901
01:44:21,181 --> 01:44:24,114
I call the chair's attention to...

1902
01:44:26,587 --> 01:44:27,711
...to Rule Five...

1903
01:44:27,821 --> 01:44:29,616
...of the Standing Rules of the Senate.

1904
01:44:29,723 --> 01:44:31,654
Section... Section Three.

1905
01:44:32,192 --> 01:44:34,760
"If it shall be found that
a quorum is not present...

1906
01:44:34,862 --> 01:44:37,556
...a majority of
the senators present..."

1907
01:44:38,165 --> 01:44:39,857
And that looks like me.

1908
01:44:42,803 --> 01:44:46,270
"...may direct the sergeant at
arms to request, and if necessary...

1909
01:44:46,373 --> 01:44:49,442
...compel the attendance
of the absent senators."

1910
01:44:50,143 --> 01:44:52,575
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.

1911
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:00,276
The absence of a
quorum being suggested.

1912
01:45:01,522 --> 01:45:03,715
- Bring the call to quorum.
- Call to quorum.

1913
01:45:04,892 --> 01:45:08,018
There's no hurry, Mr. President.
I got plenty of time.

1914
01:45:12,232 --> 01:45:14,960
Quorum call! Call to quorum!

1915
01:45:22,576 --> 01:45:24,576
All senators wanted on the floor!

1916
01:45:27,481 --> 01:45:29,481
Clerk will call the roll.

1917
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,674
- Mr. Agnew.
- Here.

1918
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:33,375
Mr. Albert.

1919
01:45:33,487 --> 01:45:34,713
Mr. Alfred.

1920
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:36,479
- Mr. Ashman.
- Here.

1921
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:40,584
Joe, get this! Smith got the
floor and is holding it.

1922
01:45:40,694 --> 01:45:42,159
Just as they were
about to kick him out!

1923
01:45:42,262 --> 01:45:43,920
He did it, Diz. It's wonderful!

1924
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:45,564
It was terrific!

1925
01:45:45,666 --> 01:45:48,997
A filibuster! This is the miracle l
wanted. What a yarn!

1926
01:45:49,102 --> 01:45:51,329
Get everything
he says back to that home state.

1927
01:45:51,438 --> 01:45:52,522
It's a pleasure!

1928
01:45:52,622 --> 01:45:54,697
They're going
to hear this in Patagonia.

1929
01:45:54,808 --> 01:45:57,536
In protest,
the whole Senate body walked out!

1930
01:45:57,644 --> 01:45:59,541
Not that straight stuff.
Kick it up.

1931
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:01,737
Get on his side.
Fight for him, understand?

1932
01:46:01,848 --> 01:46:03,347
You love this monkey, don't you?

1933
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:06,644
What do you think? Now
go to work. Do as I tell you.

1934
01:46:06,887 --> 01:46:09,820
Take this: This is the most
titanic battle of modern times.

1935
01:46:09,923 --> 01:46:12,491
A David without even a slingshot
rises to battle...

1936
01:46:12,593 --> 01:46:14,684
...against the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine...

1937
01:46:14,795 --> 01:46:17,523
...allegedly crooked inside and out.

1938
01:46:18,198 --> 01:46:20,027
For my money
you can drop the "allegedly."

1939
01:46:20,133 --> 01:46:21,757
We're bringing everybody up
from headquarters.

1940
01:46:21,868 --> 01:46:24,801
Where are they? Come on,
get these telegraphs moving!

1941
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,298
- You get Hendricks?
- They're looking for him.

1942
01:46:28,408 --> 01:46:30,135
"They're looking for him." An editor.

1943
01:46:30,243 --> 01:46:32,106
Why isn't he at his desk,
where he belongs?

1944
01:46:32,212 --> 01:46:34,473
Don't you think you
better get back to that Senate?

1945
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:36,478
The boy's talking to that state.

1946
01:46:36,583 --> 01:46:38,810
If he can raise public opinion
against us...

1947
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:40,884
He'll never get started.

1948
01:46:40,988 --> 01:46:44,524
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours.
I've done it all my life.

1949
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:46,693
I'll blacken this punk so....

1950
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:48,761
Leave public opinion to me.

1951
01:46:48,862 --> 01:46:50,395
Now, go back into the Senate...

1952
01:46:50,497 --> 01:46:52,531
...and keep those senators lined up.

1953
01:46:52,633 --> 01:46:55,429
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

1954
01:46:56,837 --> 01:46:58,962
I haven't got
the stomach for it anymore.

1955
01:46:59,072 --> 01:47:03,722
If he convinces those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out.

1956
01:47:03,822 --> 01:47:05,036
This is the works, Joe!

1957
01:47:05,145 --> 01:47:07,736
Either we're out of business or
we're bigger than ever.

1958
01:47:07,848 --> 01:47:11,884
We can't stop at anything until
we smash this yokel...

1959
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:13,027
Hendricks on the phone.

1960
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:14,552
Go back to the Senate,
will you?

1961
01:47:14,655 --> 01:47:17,315
Hello, Hendricks.
Well, the chips are down.

1962
01:47:17,424 --> 01:47:21,290
Keep everything that Smith says,
or any other pro-Smith stuff...

1963
01:47:21,395 --> 01:47:23,725
...out of all our newspapers.
Understand?

1964
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:26,524
And all the others
you can line up in the state.

1965
01:47:27,634 --> 01:47:31,670
Those broken-down opposition papers,
who won't play ball with us...

1966
01:47:31,772 --> 01:47:34,534
...I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

1967
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:38,744
Stall their deliveries. Push them off
the street. I don't care!

1968
01:47:38,845 --> 01:47:41,345
Bury them for 24 hours.
That'll give me plenty of time.

1969
01:47:41,448 --> 01:47:44,517
And you defend the machine.
Hit this guy!

1970
01:47:44,618 --> 01:47:47,983
The usual thing. Criminal, and
blocking a relief bill...

1971
01:47:48,088 --> 01:47:49,678
...and starving the people.

1972
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,120
Joe, will you get back
into that Senate?

1973
01:47:54,861 --> 01:47:56,986
And Hendricks,
get the hoi polloi excited.

1974
01:47:57,097 --> 01:48:00,223
Have them send protest letters,
wires, anything you like.

1975
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:03,527
Buy every minute you can
of every radio station in the state...

1976
01:48:03,637 --> 01:48:05,637
...and keep them
spouting against Smith.

1977
01:48:05,739 --> 01:48:07,602
I don't care what it costs.
Pay out.

1978
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:09,537
Get moving.
Get the whole state moving!

1979
01:48:15,048 --> 01:48:18,083
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt
to turn your attention...

1980
01:48:18,185 --> 01:48:20,947
...from the true facts which
are beyond question.

1981
01:48:21,054 --> 01:48:24,146
Jefferson Smith was caught
red-handed, stealing from boys.

1982
01:48:24,257 --> 01:48:26,917
Relief will be stopped.
Men thrown out of jobs.

1983
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:40,333
- I've seen filibustering, but...
- Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.

1984
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,531
We've got to get
him off the floor.

1985
01:48:42,642 --> 01:48:46,075
As long as Mr. Smith holds that
floor legitimately...

1986
01:48:46,179 --> 01:48:48,247
...he's going to continue to hold it.

1987
01:48:48,348 --> 01:48:50,882
If you ask me,
that fellow's making sense.

1988
01:48:50,984 --> 01:48:53,780
Sense? You call
blackmail sense, Henry?

1989
01:48:53,887 --> 01:48:56,581
Joe, I didn't like
this boy from the beginning.

1990
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:58,553
But we feel that
no man who wasn't sincere...

1991
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:00,817
...could fight like this
against these odds.

1992
01:49:00,927 --> 01:49:02,858
I'm very glad
to know that, Martin.

1993
01:49:02,963 --> 01:49:06,760
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know
you'd take his word against mine.

1994
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:08,662
Yes, that's what it means!

1995
01:49:08,769 --> 01:49:10,860
If he's that much right,
then I'm wrong.

1996
01:49:10,971 --> 01:49:13,437
Joe, can't we
work out some deal...

1997
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:16,803
...to pull that Willet Dam out and
let the Deficiency Bill go through?

1998
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:18,705
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.

1999
01:49:18,812 --> 01:49:21,142
It's a question of my honor
and reputation.

2000
01:49:21,248 --> 01:49:25,648
The integrity of the Committee,
the integrity of the Senate itself.

2001
01:49:25,752 --> 01:49:27,649
If you want to throw out
Section 40, go ahead.

2002
01:49:27,754 --> 01:49:30,846
- I'll resign.
- Now, wait a minute, Joe.

2003
01:49:30,957 --> 01:49:32,820
This is a lot of nonsense.

2004
01:49:32,926 --> 01:49:35,494
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.

2005
01:49:35,595 --> 01:49:37,128
We've got to go on with this.

2006
01:49:37,230 --> 01:49:39,264
Break him, keep him talking.

2007
01:49:39,366 --> 01:49:42,594
No relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

2008
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:45,032
- ls that how you feel, John?
- For once, I agree with you.

2009
01:49:45,138 --> 01:49:46,899
It's time to relieve
the floor.

2010
01:49:47,007 --> 01:49:50,008
How a man that green
knows as much as he does....

2011
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:51,234
Can't go on much longer.

2012
01:49:51,344 --> 01:49:52,911
"...that they're entitled
by their creator...

2013
01:49:53,013 --> 01:49:54,876
...with certain inalienable rights...

2014
01:49:54,981 --> 01:49:58,050
...and that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of..."

2015
01:50:01,054 --> 01:50:03,554
Well, looks like
the night shift's coming on.

2016
01:50:06,459 --> 01:50:09,995
Senator will please suspend until
order is restored.

2017
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,958
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.

2018
01:50:20,069 --> 01:50:23,002
Half of official Washington is here
to see democracy's finest show...

2019
01:50:23,105 --> 01:50:26,003
...the filibuster: The right
to talk your head off.

2020
01:50:26,108 --> 01:50:29,302
The American privilege of free speech
in its most dramatic form.

2021
01:50:29,411 --> 01:50:31,479
The least man in that chamber...

2022
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:34,114
...once he gets and holds that floor,
by the rules...

2023
01:50:34,216 --> 01:50:37,308
...can hold it and talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

2024
01:50:37,419 --> 01:50:40,352
Providing always
that he does not sit down...

2025
01:50:40,456 --> 01:50:43,719
...and that he does not leave the
chamber or stop talking.

2026
01:50:43,826 --> 01:50:45,223
The galleries are packed.

2027
01:50:45,327 --> 01:50:48,863
In the diplomatic gallery are the
envoys of two dictator powers.

2028
01:50:48,964 --> 01:50:51,692
They have come here to see
what they can't see at home...

2029
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,333
...democracy in action.

2030
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,395
"...life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness...

2031
01:50:56,505 --> 01:50:59,870
...and to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men...

2032
01:50:59,975 --> 01:51:02,976
...deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed...

2033
01:51:03,078 --> 01:51:07,012
...that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends...

2034
01:51:07,116 --> 01:51:10,845
...it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it."

2035
01:51:11,186 --> 01:51:12,617
How am I doing?

2036
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:18,382
- Quit stalling and move!
- Clark, Jim.

2037
01:51:18,627 --> 01:51:20,251
- Oh, Clark...
- Mr. Taylor?

2038
01:51:20,362 --> 01:51:21,690
Yes, wait a minute

2039
01:51:22,031 --> 01:51:23,496
Phone Senator Paine about it.

2040
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,530
This is
Jim Taylor in Washington.

2041
01:51:25,634 --> 01:51:26,928
About this Smith filibuster.

2042
01:51:27,036 --> 01:51:29,468
Newspapers
in the Southwest must realize...

2043
01:51:29,571 --> 01:51:31,263
...that this bill
he's trying to block...

2044
01:51:31,373 --> 01:51:32,963
...will affect your section
as well as any.

2045
01:51:33,075 --> 01:51:34,972
It's the patriotic duty of every
newspaper...

2046
01:51:35,077 --> 01:51:36,508
Wait a minute. Yes?

2047
01:51:36,612 --> 01:51:38,270
- Jackson City calling.
- Hold them!

2048
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,448
We've got to keep hammering
at this man until we smash him!

2049
01:51:41,984 --> 01:51:45,281
I get a great kick out of that part
of the Declaration of Independence.

2050
01:51:45,721 --> 01:51:49,382
You're not going to have a country
that can make these rules work...

2051
01:51:49,491 --> 01:51:52,082
...if you haven't got men that have
learned to tell human rights...

2052
01:51:52,194 --> 01:51:53,488
...from a punch in the nose.

2053
01:51:58,567 --> 01:52:00,225
That's good for a headline.

2054
01:52:00,336 --> 01:52:02,802
It's a funny thing about men,
you know.

2055
01:52:02,905 --> 01:52:04,905
They all start life being boys...

2056
01:52:06,408 --> 01:52:09,136
...I wouldn't be surprised if
these senators were boys once.

2057
01:52:09,244 --> 01:52:11,574
That's why it seemed
like a good idea...

2058
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,441
...to get the boys out
of crowded cities...

2059
01:52:13,549 --> 01:52:16,482
...and stuffy basements for a
couple of months out of the year...

2060
01:52:16,585 --> 01:52:19,210
...and build their bodies
and minds for a man-sized job...

2061
01:52:19,321 --> 01:52:22,117
...because they're going to be
behind these desks someday.

2062
01:52:23,192 --> 01:52:26,386
It seemed like a good idea, getting
boys from all over the country...

2063
01:52:26,495 --> 01:52:30,053
...boys of all nationalities and
ways of living.

2064
01:52:30,165 --> 01:52:31,265
Getting them together...

2065
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:34,792
...let them find out what makes
different people tick.

2066
01:52:34,903 --> 01:52:38,097
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents
for all your rules...

2067
01:52:38,207 --> 01:52:42,710
...if behind them they didn't have a
little ordinary everyday kindness...

2068
01:52:42,811 --> 01:52:46,677
...and a little looking out
for the other fellow too.

2069
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:57,424
That's pretty important, all that.

2070
01:52:59,061 --> 01:53:02,028
It's just the blood and bone
and sinew of this democracy...

2071
01:53:02,131 --> 01:53:05,064
...that some great men handed down
to the human race, that's all!

2072
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:08,703
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys' camp ought to be...

2073
01:53:08,804 --> 01:53:13,363
...to pay off some political army,
that's a different thing. Oh, no!

2074
01:53:13,475 --> 01:53:16,738
If you think I'm going back and
tell those boys in my state...

2075
01:53:16,845 --> 01:53:18,810
..."Fellows,
forget about it.

2076
01:53:18,914 --> 01:53:22,916
All I've been telling you about the
land you live in is a lot of hooey.

2077
01:53:23,018 --> 01:53:27,350
This isn't your country. It belongs to
a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.

2078
01:53:27,456 --> 01:53:30,252
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that,
they got another thing coming!

2079
01:53:40,235 --> 01:53:43,099
I just wanted to
find out if you still had faces.

2080
01:53:49,778 --> 01:53:52,142
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

2081
01:53:53,449 --> 01:53:57,280
I know I'm being disrespectful to
this honorable body.

2082
01:53:57,653 --> 01:54:02,087
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place.

2083
01:54:02,191 --> 01:54:06,625
And I hate to stand here and
try your patience like this, but l...

2084
01:54:06,728 --> 01:54:09,388
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!

2085
01:54:09,498 --> 01:54:12,692
You wouldn't care to put that
to a vote, would you, senator?

2086
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:17,930
Will the senator yield for a question?
- I yield.

2087
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,870
In view of the gentlemen's touching
concern for the senators...

2088
01:54:20,976 --> 01:54:23,840
...and the fact that he's been
talking for 7 1/2 hours...

2089
01:54:23,946 --> 01:54:26,310
...and must be very, very tired...

2090
01:54:26,415 --> 01:54:29,109
...would he permit a motion to recess
until the morning...

2091
01:54:29,218 --> 01:54:33,482
...at which time he may better continue
with his profound babblings.

2092
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:35,088
No. No, don't!

2093
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,760
Ask him!

2094
01:54:47,536 --> 01:54:50,127
Mr. President, what happens
in the morning...

2095
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:51,772
...I mean, about my...

2096
01:54:51,874 --> 01:54:55,137
...having this floor to
go on with my "babblings"?

2097
01:54:55,244 --> 01:54:58,313
If the senator permits
this motion for a recess...

2098
01:54:58,413 --> 01:54:59,946
...he won't have the floor
in the morning...

2099
01:55:00,048 --> 01:55:01,809
...to babble with or anything else...

2100
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:05,809
...unless he is recognized first
by this chair.

2101
01:55:13,529 --> 01:55:15,688
As I was saying, gentlemen...

2102
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:18,499
...I'm either dead right
or I'm crazy...

2103
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,634
...and I feel fine.

2104
01:55:20,736 --> 01:55:23,566
What have you got, Dick?
- From Miss Saunders.

2105
01:55:49,765 --> 01:55:51,355
Is the senator yielding the floor?

2106
01:55:54,102 --> 01:55:56,500
Yield? Oh, no!

2107
01:55:57,806 --> 01:55:59,168
I feel fine!

2108
01:56:01,977 --> 01:56:05,012
The Constitution of the United States.

2109
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:14,116
Page one, top left-hand corner.

2110
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:16,214
"We the people of the United States...

2111
01:56:16,325 --> 01:56:18,017
...in order to form
a more perfect union...."

2112
01:56:18,126 --> 01:56:20,126
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!

2113
01:56:20,762 --> 01:56:23,160
Brady's column too?
Holy smokes!

2114
01:56:23,265 --> 01:56:24,349
What's the matter?

2115
01:56:24,449 --> 01:56:26,831
This is murder,
you got to call him off.

2116
01:56:26,935 --> 01:56:28,969
- He's getting nowhere.
What are you talking about?

2117
01:56:29,137 --> 01:56:31,330
Not one word of what he says
is being printed in that state.

2118
01:56:31,506 --> 01:56:32,573
Oh, no!

2119
01:56:32,673 --> 01:56:35,369
Taylor has practically every paper
in the state lined up...

2120
01:56:35,477 --> 01:56:37,238
...and he's feeding them
doctored-up junk!

2121
01:56:37,346 --> 01:56:40,506
- One man muzzling a whole state?
- And how!

2122
01:56:40,649 --> 01:56:42,842
Freedom of the press!

2123
01:56:44,653 --> 01:56:46,948
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!

2124
01:56:48,156 --> 01:56:51,248
Jeff has a paper there,
Boy Stuff, right?

2125
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,693
Terrific!

2126
01:56:52,793 --> 01:56:56,127
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

2127
01:56:56,231 --> 01:56:58,458
If I give you a raft
over the phone now...

2128
01:56:58,567 --> 01:57:00,430
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.

2129
01:57:00,535 --> 01:57:02,102
Can you print it out...

2130
01:57:02,204 --> 01:57:04,602
...and spread a billion copies of it?

2131
01:57:04,706 --> 01:57:06,205
Swell!

2132
01:57:06,308 --> 01:57:08,239
Get ready to take it down,
will you, Mrs. Smith?

2133
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:09,494
All right.

2134
01:57:09,594 --> 01:57:12,704
Boys, everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

2135
01:57:14,216 --> 01:57:15,544
All right, here we go!

2136
01:57:15,817 --> 01:57:16,975
All ready, Clarissa.

2137
01:57:17,352 --> 01:57:19,716
She called me Clarissa!

2138
01:57:20,322 --> 01:57:22,287
Okay, Ma!

2139
01:57:23,191 --> 01:57:25,452
"Jeff Tells Truth.

2140
01:57:25,727 --> 01:57:26,987
Shows Up Taylor."

2141
01:57:27,329 --> 01:57:29,829
I want the whole morning edition.
Push him off the floor!

2142
01:57:29,965 --> 01:57:32,033
Start your campaign
for protests. Wired!

2143
01:57:32,601 --> 01:57:35,636
"Willet Dam is a fraud to
line the pockets of the Taylor machine."

2144
01:57:35,737 --> 01:57:37,930
Here's your front-page editorial.
Wait!

2145
01:57:38,707 --> 01:57:39,899
"A convicted thief representing you...

2146
01:57:40,008 --> 01:57:42,133
...holds the floor of
the United States Senate."

2147
01:57:42,344 --> 01:57:43,809
All right, boys. Hurry up!

2148
01:57:43,912 --> 01:57:46,242
She said rush!
Get cracking now!

2149
01:57:55,357 --> 01:57:57,516
Come on!
Bring on the paper!

2150
01:58:35,797 --> 01:58:39,298
"...charity wanteth not itself...

2151
01:58:39,768 --> 01:58:41,301
...is not propped up...

2152
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:47,131
...and now abideth faith...

2153
01:58:47,909 --> 01:58:50,443
...hope, charity...

2154
01:58:50,779 --> 01:58:52,346
...these three.

2155
01:58:54,282 --> 01:58:57,146
The greatest of these is charity."

2156
01:59:39,427 --> 01:59:40,511
Read about Jeff.

2157
01:59:40,611 --> 01:59:43,220
Boy's Stuff circulars.
Peddled by 9 million kids.

2158
01:59:43,331 --> 01:59:46,730
What are you standing there for?
Get the boys out! Kill it!

2159
02:00:00,682 --> 02:00:02,943
Get these papers out of here.

2160
02:00:08,423 --> 02:00:11,424
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

2161
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:26,933
Wire Congress!

2162
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:35,975
Are we going to let a man like Jeff
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

2163
02:00:37,819 --> 02:00:39,181
Are you for Joe Paine?

2164
02:00:42,591 --> 02:00:44,625
Hurray for Jeff Smith!

2165
02:01:00,277 --> 02:01:02,196
Children hurt all over the city.

2166
02:01:02,392 --> 02:01:04,128
Tell Jeff to stop!

2167
02:01:04,438 --> 02:01:06,904
Yes, all right.

2168
02:01:07,007 --> 02:01:08,335
Goodbye.

2169
02:01:10,143 --> 02:01:13,663
"Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 16 minutes.

2170
02:01:13,763 --> 02:01:16,577
It's the most unusual and spectacular
thing in the Senate annuls.

2171
02:01:16,683 --> 02:01:18,273
One lone and simple American...

2172
02:01:18,385 --> 02:01:20,180
...holding the greatest
floor in the land.

2173
02:01:20,287 --> 02:01:23,083
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

2174
02:01:23,323 --> 02:01:25,948
But those tired Boy Ranger legs
are buckling.

2175
02:01:26,059 --> 02:01:27,820
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.

2176
02:01:27,928 --> 02:01:30,826
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington...

2177
02:01:30,931 --> 02:01:32,862
...is here to be in on the kill."

2178
02:01:33,734 --> 02:01:36,302
There's no compromise with truth.

2179
02:01:36,403 --> 02:01:39,438
That's all I got up
on this floor to say.

2180
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,337
When was it?

2181
02:01:42,175 --> 02:01:43,537
A year ago, it seems like.

2182
02:01:43,643 --> 02:01:46,735
Terrible things are happening.
I've got to stop him.

2183
02:01:46,847 --> 02:01:48,426
They're listening to him.
Anything might happen now.

2184
02:01:48,526 --> 02:01:52,142
Just get up off the ground.
That's all I ask.

2185
02:01:52,252 --> 02:01:55,651
Get up there with that lady
that's on top of this Capitol dome.

2186
02:01:55,756 --> 02:01:57,949
That lady that stands for liberty.

2187
02:01:58,692 --> 02:02:01,886
Look at this country through her eyes
if you want to see something.

2188
02:02:03,163 --> 02:02:05,197
But you won't just see scenery.

2189
02:02:05,298 --> 02:02:08,299
You'll see the whole parade of what
man's carved out for himself...

2190
02:02:08,402 --> 02:02:10,527
...after centuries of fighting.

2191
02:02:10,904 --> 02:02:13,632
Fighting for something better
than just jungle law.

2192
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:17,840
Fighting so he can stand on
his own two feet, free and decent...

2193
02:02:17,944 --> 02:02:19,409
...like he was created.

2194
02:02:19,513 --> 02:02:22,343
No matter what his race,
color or creed.

2195
02:02:24,584 --> 02:02:26,276
That's what you'd see.

2196
02:02:27,487 --> 02:02:29,748
There's no place
out there for graft...

2197
02:02:29,856 --> 02:02:31,787
...or greed or lies...

2198
02:02:31,892 --> 02:02:34,722
...or compromise with human liberties.

2199
02:02:34,828 --> 02:02:38,455
If that's what the grownups
have done with this world...

2200
02:02:38,565 --> 02:02:40,496
...we better get those
boys' camps started fast...

2201
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,725
...and see what the kids can do.

2202
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:45,400
It's not too late.

2203
02:02:45,806 --> 02:02:48,739
Because this country is
bigger than the Taylors...

2204
02:02:48,842 --> 02:02:51,035
...or you or me or anything else!

2205
02:02:52,746 --> 02:02:55,747
Great principles don't get lost once
they come to light.

2206
02:02:55,849 --> 02:02:57,883
They're right here!

2207
02:02:58,018 --> 02:03:00,552
You just have to see them again.

2208
02:03:03,824 --> 02:03:05,482
Mr. President.

2209
02:03:05,826 --> 02:03:07,257
Will the senator yield
for a question?

2210
02:03:07,894 --> 02:03:09,757
Will Senator Smith yield
to his colleague?

2211
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:12,221
Yes, I yield for a question.

2212
02:03:12,332 --> 02:03:15,959
The senator has said he is speaking
to the people of his state.

2213
02:03:16,069 --> 02:03:19,161
He has been waiting,
as he so fancifully puts it...

2214
02:03:19,272 --> 02:03:21,806
...for them to come
marching here in droves.

2215
02:03:21,975 --> 02:03:25,135
Would the gentlemen be interested
in what those people have to say?

2216
02:03:25,245 --> 02:03:26,972
Here it comes.

2217
02:03:27,114 --> 02:03:28,909
Yes, sir, you bet I would.

2218
02:03:30,317 --> 02:03:31,401
Mr. President.

2219
02:03:31,501 --> 02:03:33,246
Have I permission to bring in...

2220
02:03:33,353 --> 02:03:35,444
...evidence of
the response of my state?

2221
02:03:35,555 --> 02:03:37,486
Is there objection?

2222
02:03:38,592 --> 02:03:39,784
You may proceed, senator.

2223
02:03:39,893 --> 02:03:41,358
Pageboys!

2224
02:04:16,763 --> 02:04:20,458
I can't stand it. I can't stand
to see him hurt like this.

2225
02:04:20,567 --> 02:04:22,100
Public opinion made to order.

2226
02:04:22,202 --> 02:04:23,826
Taylor-made.

2227
02:04:24,171 --> 02:04:27,832
There it is.
There's the gentleman's answer.

2228
02:04:27,941 --> 02:04:30,532
Telegrams. 50,000 of them...

2229
02:04:30,644 --> 02:04:32,302
...demanding that he yield this floor.

2230
02:04:32,412 --> 02:04:34,036
I invite the Senate to read them.

2231
02:04:34,181 --> 02:04:36,010
I invite my colleague to read them.

2232
02:04:36,116 --> 02:04:38,878
The people's answer to
Mr. Jefferson Smith.

2233
02:05:22,696 --> 02:05:24,696
Stop, Jeff! Stop!

2234
02:06:09,643 --> 02:06:13,235
I guess this is just another
lost cause, Mr. Paine.

2235
02:06:18,351 --> 02:06:21,750
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

2236
02:06:22,255 --> 02:06:23,913
Mr. Paine does.

2237
02:06:25,959 --> 02:06:29,586
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

2238
02:06:29,996 --> 02:06:32,155
He fought for them once.

2239
02:06:32,565 --> 02:06:36,260
For the only reason that any man
ever fights for them.

2240
02:06:39,406 --> 02:06:42,907
Because of just one plain, simple rule:

2241
02:06:43,643 --> 02:06:44,937
Love thy neighbor.

2242
02:06:46,613 --> 02:06:47,907
In this world today...

2243
02:06:48,014 --> 02:06:49,172
...full of hatred...

2244
02:06:49,282 --> 02:06:52,283
...a man who knows that one rule
has a great trust.

2245
02:06:52,385 --> 02:06:55,113
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.

2246
02:06:55,588 --> 02:06:58,816
And I loved you for it,
just as my father did.

2247
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:02,494
And you know you fight for lost causes
harder than for any others.

2248
02:07:02,929 --> 02:07:05,259
Yes, you even die for them.

2249
02:07:06,933 --> 02:07:09,627
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.

2250
02:07:12,806 --> 02:07:14,703
You think I'm licked.

2251
02:07:16,843 --> 02:07:18,308
You all think I'm licked!

2252
02:07:20,146 --> 02:07:22,180
Well, I'm not licked!

2253
02:07:22,282 --> 02:07:25,442
I'm going to stay right here
and fight for this lost cause!

2254
02:07:25,552 --> 02:07:29,247
Even if this room gets
filled with lies like these...

2255
02:07:29,989 --> 02:07:34,549
...and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

2256
02:07:35,595 --> 02:07:37,890
Somebody will listen to me.

2257
02:08:01,321 --> 02:08:03,389
He's okay. He just fainted.

2258
02:08:15,668 --> 02:08:17,395
- Let me go!
What's the matter, Joe?

2259
02:08:17,504 --> 02:08:19,868
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

2260
02:08:19,973 --> 02:08:21,506
Expel me!

2261
02:08:21,608 --> 02:08:22,834
Expel me, not him!

2262
02:08:22,942 --> 02:08:24,168
Willy Taylor's a fraud!

2263
02:08:24,277 --> 02:08:26,402
It's a crime against
the people who sent me here...

2264
02:08:26,513 --> 02:08:29,207
...and I committed it! Every word
that boy said is the truth!

2265
02:08:29,315 --> 02:08:31,474
Every word about Taylor
and me and graft...

2266
02:08:31,584 --> 02:08:33,948
...and the rotten political
corruption in my state!

2267
02:08:34,053 --> 02:08:36,678
Every word of it is true!
I'm not fit for office!

2268
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:38,824
I'm not fit for
any place of honor or trust!

2269
02:08:38,925 --> 02:08:40,788
Expel me, not that boy!

2270
02:08:50,003 --> 02:08:51,934
We did it! We did it!

2271
02:08:56,443 --> 02:08:58,636
Order gentlemen! Please!

2272
02:09:08,321 --> 02:09:09,421
He did it!

2273
02:09:09,522 --> 02:09:11,317
Let go of me!

2274
02:09:14,994 --> 02:09:16,721
Yippee!

2275
02:09:17,305 --> 02:10:17,247
