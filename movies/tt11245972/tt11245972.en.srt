- Hello?
- Hello

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,300
Is Cristina there?

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,433
No, she's not available
May I take a message?

5
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,200
Sorry, I'm a friend of hers from group...
Oh, shit

6
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,633
From her shit?

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,866
Look, just tell her I'm from group
I'm Charlie She's got my number

8
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,633
She goes to your group?

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,766
I shouldn't have...

10
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,900
Just tell her that Charlie called

11
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,500
I will do exactly that, Charlie,

12
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,509
once you tell me
what kind of group we're talking about

13
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,800
Is it AA? NA?

14
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,433
You sound exactly like she describes you

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,533
She talks about me in group?

16
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,133
I don't think
I can really talk about that

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,300
What does she say about me?

18
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,033
She loves you very much

19
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,733
What does she love about me?

20
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,566
She loves that you're creative

21
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,833
You love art and TV and movies

22
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,333
Lots of people love movies

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,533
Yeah, but she says you love scary movies

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,866
and that you guys have that in common

25
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,166
She's proud of making a fan out of you

26
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,500
- She is?
- Yeah

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,366
She told me the other day, she wonders...

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,700
what's your favorite scary movie?

29
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:53,533
The Babadook It's an amazing meditation
on motherhood and grief

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,700
Isn't that a little fancy pants?

31
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,766
Well, it's elevated horror

32
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,500
Uh-huh
What does that mean, "Elevated horror"?

33
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,400
It's scary but with complex emotional
and thematic underpinnings

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,966
It's not just some schlocky, cheeseball
nonsense with wall-to-wall jump scares

35
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,900
Sounds kind of boring to me

36
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,166
Have you ever seen Stab?

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,300
Once, I think

38
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,933
At a sleepover when I was, like, 12

39
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:29,100
You live in Woodsboro
and you don't know Stab?

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Your mother loves that movie
She talks about it all the time in group

41
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,200
How well do you remember the original?

42
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,933
I don't know
I mean, it was super '90s

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,533
It was really over-lit
and everyone had weird hair

44
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,633
Do you remember the beginning?

45
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,766
Not really

46
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,509
It started with a kill scene, right?
They always started with a kill scene

47
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah, that's right That's right

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,900
It's a girl at home, alone

49
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,566
She answers a wrong number
and starts talking with the killer

50
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,633
who makes her play a game

51
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,366
Would you like to play a game...

52
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,300
Tara?

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,933
Systems armed

54
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,633
This isn't fucking funny, Amber

55
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,366
I told you, this isn't Amber

56
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,400
Amber's looking
particularly fetching tonight

57
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:52,066
She really shouldn't leave her phone
lying around for anyone to clone

58
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,200
What do you want?

59
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,233
I told you, I want to play a game

60
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
Stab movie trivia, three rounds

61
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:03,366
You call the cops, she dies
You get a question wrong, she dies

62
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:07,333
Her parents aren't home
I can be in that room in 15 seconds

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,466
You want a warmup question?

64
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,433
I told you I don't know these movies!

65
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,400
Ask me about something I do know

66
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:18,300
Ask me about It Follows
Ask me about Hereditary

67
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Ask me about The Witch

68
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,900
In the first Stab movie,

69
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:26,400
what Woodsboro native was introduced
as the franchise's main character?

70
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,266
It's Sidney Prescott!

71
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,433
It's Sidney Prescott and she lived on Elm

72
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,266
Correct
You see, you're gonna do great at this

73
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,600
Okay, question one...

74
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,166
No, I got that one right It should count

75
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:43,300
Anyone could have gotten that one right
Sidney's in every movie but the last one

76
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,833
Question one:

77
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:49,400
Who wrote the original book
that the Stab movies are based on?

78
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,933
The chick from TV!

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,266
"The chick from TV"
is not gonna cut it, Tara

80
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,066
Gale Weathers!

81
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,866
It is Gale Weathers, you motherfucker!

82
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,466
Correct
Amber might live to see the sunrise

83
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,666
Question two: Who played the dumb bitch
at the beginning of Stab 1

84
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,633
who answers the phone
and gets carved up by the killer?

85
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,866
Fuck you

86
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,300
Is that the answer you're going with?

87
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,666
A non-answer
counts as a wrong answer, Tara

88
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:29,300
Time's running out

89
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:35,033
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock...

90
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,200
Heather Graham!

91
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,133
Correct! You pulled that one out

92
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,300
Now for the final question:

93
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,500
Who was the killer in Stab 1?

94
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,966
I know this one, you fuck

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,333
It's Billy Loomis!

96
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,566
He was Sidney's boyfriend,
and he was played by Luke Wilson,

97
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,200
and I got you, asshole!

98
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,666
I got it! I got it right!

99
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:08,500
Oh, I'm sorry, Tara,
but that's just not correct

100
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,266
What?

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,466
No, no, it is It is That is right

102
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:17,800
The correct answer is Billy Loomis
and Stu Macher

103
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:20,600
There are two killers
in the original Stab

104
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,700
I'm afraid someone's got to die now

105
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,233
No, no, no Amber, I'm coming

106
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,766
Fuck, fuck, fuck

107
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,433
Systems armed

108
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,900
The police are on their way, asshole!

109
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,233
All systems disarmed

110
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,733
Systems armed

111
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,200
-All systems disarmed
-Oh, my God No

112
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:22,866
Systems armed

113
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:26,200
All systems disarmed Systems armed

114
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,866
All systems disarmed

115
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,533
Systems armed

116
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:03,766
Hello?

117
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,500
Bonus question, Tara

118
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
Please stop

119
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:13,733
Do you think I made it inside your house
before you could rearm?

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,300
Help!

121
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,200
Excuse me, miss?

122
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,400
- What'd you just take?
- Your boner pills

123
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,833
Good luck getting it up now

124
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,766
You...

125
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,366
You are my boner pills

126
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,166
No No

127
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,266
You okay?

128
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:10,366
Yes

129
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,733
You don't have to check on me
all the time I'm not breakable

130
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, this I know

131
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,400
Shit

132
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,966
- Sam?
- Hey What's going on?

133
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,833
Tara... was attacked

134
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,866
What? Is she...

135
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,533
She's alive, but in bad shape

136
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:43,733
She was...

137
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,333
stabbed

138
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,966
Stabbed? What the fuck?

139
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,426
She made it through surgery
and the doctor said it went well

140
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,466
She's resting now

141
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,409
I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but...

142
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,766
I'm on my way

143
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,966
She's gonna be okay, Sam
We'll see you soon

144
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,533
Hey, wait, Wes!

145
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,633
Yeah?

146
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,633
Do they know who did this?

147
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,633
It's probably better
if you just come here

148
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:09,366
Wes

149
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,833
She said it was someone
in a fucking Ghostface mask

150
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,433
My sister was attacked

151
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,200
I gotta go

152
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,100
Wait, hey! I'm going with you

153
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,400
No, Richie...

154
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,033
No, Sam I'm coming with you

155
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,533
-Okay
-Okay Yeah

156
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:42,600
Attention, Panthers A reminder
that all classes and school activities

157
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,400
are canceled tomorrow
due to public safety concerns

158
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,533
That was Sam

159
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,033
- She's coming?
- Yeah

160
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,866
Watch everything get worse

161
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,700
Listen, all I'm saying is,
with everything going on right now,

162
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,066
I think it's time we take our relationship
to the next, most intimate level

163
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,166
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request

164
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,166
It's the smartest option
with a would-be killer on the loose

165
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,633
You know exactly where I am
and I know exactly where you are

166
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,242
Aw, you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend

167
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,633
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend

168
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Is this because you two
aren't having sex yet?

169
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,366
You actually bring up a very good point
Not that I want to sound

170
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,100
like a stereotypical jock
trying to get into his girlfriend's pants

171
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Great!

172
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,266
Don't do it, Liv
There's a psycho out there

173
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,576
You make yourself harder to find

174
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera, disable GPS

175
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Yes, thank you very much, Edward Snowden

176
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,433
Actually, your mother just interrogated me
about Tara's attempted murder,

177
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,100
which was very fun

178
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,800
I'm sure she's asking everybody
I mean, Ghostface is back

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,420
The press still isn't saying Ghostface

180
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,906
My mom doesn't want to cause a panic

181
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,733
It'll get out by the second
or third killing

182
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,733
Jesus, Mindy, there wasn't
a first killing Tara's alive

183
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,733
That means she could still die

184
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,000
- What the fuck?
- Or the killer could come back for her

185
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,233
Fuck! Mindy, come on

186
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,233
I'm just telling you, arm up, okay?
Pepper spray, check Taser, check

187
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,566
Girlfriend repellent, check

188
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,333
Nice Thank you

189
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,633
Oh, shit Is that... Vince?

190
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,133
Wait
The creep you hooked up with last summer?

191
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,266
Yeah, he worked with me and Tara

192
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,333
He worked with Tara?

193
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:14,133
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

194
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,600
posting the creepiest shit

195
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,566
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw

196
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:23,300
Maybe not the best idea to incite
violence right in front of the sheriff

197
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,566
Looks like he's leaving

198
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,633
Thanks anyway, boys

199
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,500
Tara says she fought back hard
You've got bruises

200
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,966
From football practice

201
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,033
Oh, sure

202
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,366
Tara's awake She just texted

203
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,166
I'm going to the hospital
You guys coming?

204
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,633
-Yeah
-Yeah

205
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,833
I can't, but I'll meet you guys later

206
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,300
All right

207
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,333
I've actually never seen Stab

208
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
You've never seen Stab?

209
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,000
Not even the one that came out last year?

210
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,066
I've never seen Gone With the Wind either,

211
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,700
but I don't consider it like a huge hole
in my cinematic education

212
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,133
Most of the Stab movies
are based on things that happened here

213
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,200
Define "things"

214
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Things like...

215
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,100
a guy named Billy Loomis and his friend
carved up a bunch of high-school kids

216
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,766
while wearing this Halloween ghost mask

217
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,400
You mean like in Halloween?

218
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,566
No Not like in Halloween

219
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:32,033
-Sounds a lot like Halloween
-All right, it's a little like Halloween

220
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,066
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

221
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,000
to put on the mask, kill his friends,
and get famous, too

222
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,300
The last time it happened was in 2011

223
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,966
And we came here voluntarily?

224
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,433
Well, I got to make sure Tara's okay

225
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,400
Yes, of course

226
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,200
And I got to make sure
we don't get sliced up by some lunatic

227
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,600
who saw Friday the 13th and thought,
"You know what?

228
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
That Jason guy,
he's got some pretty solid ideas"

229
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,666
Can I just ask you one question, though?

230
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,266
Yeah

231
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,066
Do you have any idea why

232
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:05,266
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

233
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,333
No

234
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,400
How are you feeling?

235
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,566
You came

236
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,133
Of course I came

237
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,833
This is my boyfriend, Richie

238
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,366
It's so nice to meet you
I'm so sorry if I'm intruding

239
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,300
Nice to meet you, too

240
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,933
Hi

241
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,033
Hi

242
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,600
-Thank you for calling
-Of course

243
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,900
Look at your hair! I like it

244
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:54,433
These are Chad and Mindy,
the twins And Wes

245
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,766
I used to babysit them all

246
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,000
Which is always how
I like to be introduced

247
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,400
And Amber Hey

248
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,333
Hi Nice to see you

249
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,533
-Hi I'm Richie
-Hi

250
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,166
- Where's Mom?
- She's stuck at a conference in London

251
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,466
She called me earlier

252
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,466
Yeah, for all of ten minutes

253
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,666
Look, guys, Tara's really tired
Maybe we should just give her some space

254
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,066
-Yeah
-Yeah

255
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,866
Not you, Sam

256
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,400
I want you to stay

257
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,133
Okay

258
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,233
-But the rest
-Yeah

259
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:36,133
If it's okay with you,
I could sleep here tonight

260
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,500
I'd really like that

261
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,866
Okay

262
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,433
- Do you have your extra inhaler?
- Yeah, I'll be fine

263
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Okay

264
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,466
Honey? Okay, I'll just be right outside

265
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,633
Thank you

266
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Bye

267
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,200
Sam, I was so scared

268
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,266
I know

269
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,533
It's okay

270
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
So what is she like, the sister?

271
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,733
Sam? Sam is so cool

272
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,266
You only say that because she let you
wear Pokemon onesies to bed for a year

273
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,366
That's true That's a true statement

274
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:23,033
No, trust me, Sam is not cool

275
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:27,500
Her dad left her mom Walks right out
when Tara's eight, Sam's 13

276
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,200
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops

277
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:33,533
And then, on Sam's 18th birthday,
she leaves

278
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,533
Ghosts them all

279
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Maybe Sam's changed
I just don't want to see Tara hurt again

280
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,366
So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

281
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,400
Well, someone has to

282
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,433
Okay, so no guys are good enough for her
and now her family's off-limits, too?

283
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,366
Mm, motive

284
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,166
"If I can't have her, no one can"

285
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,866
- What?
- We all know you have a crush on Tara

286
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,400
Okay Come on, Mindy

287
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,366
But we're all suspects

288
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Except maybe Liv

289
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:05,966
-Thank you
-You're way too boring to be a psycho

290
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,666
Yo, Liv You want a real drink?

291
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,433
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

292
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,466
Listen up, Uglier Michael Myers,
it was a summer fling It meant nothing

293
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,709
- Was I talking to you?
- I don't care who you're talking to

294
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,266
-Liv, let's go
-Don't talk to her!

295
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,176
-I don't want to hear your voice
-Shut your mouth

296
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,466
Better shut the fuck up

297
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,433
Get out of here or I'm calling the cops

298
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400

311
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,733
Just a bad dream

312
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,666
What are you watching?

313
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,533
Stab is on Netflix

314
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,700
What? I want to be prepared

315
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,566
I got to go find something to eat

316
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,666

00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,466
How you doing, Sam?

318
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,900
Antipsychotics aren't working
as well as they used to, are they?

319
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
Fuck you

320
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,900
You can't run from who you are, Sam

321
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,833
I'm just trying to help

322
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,033
Hey, when are you gonna tell her
why all this is happening?

323
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,266
Hello

324
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,466
Hello, Samantha

325
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,466
Who is this?

326
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:39,333
Someone who knows
your little family secret

327
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,800
You're the fuck who hurt my sister?

328
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,266
She's not the only one I'm gonna hurt

329
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:50,066
I had to get you
to come back here somehow, didn't I?

330
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,733
You want to fuck with me, asshole?

331
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,166
I'm right here Come and get me

332
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,066
With pleasure

333
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,433
Help!

334
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:23,333
Help! Help!

335
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,766
Somebody help me, he's trying to kill me!

336
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,566
What's going on? You're okay

337
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,633
Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

338
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:47,000
I've got a body outside a bar on Main,
and then you get attacked here

339
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,900
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

340
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,866
So? We know he called on my phone
before when he attacked Tara

341
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:56,500
Or, and I'm just spit-balling here...
you're the killer

342
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,809
And where were you when all this happened?

343
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,733
I was... watching Netflix

344
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,233
-Ooh, yeah Super-solid alibi, bro
-So where were you?

345
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,809
I was questioning Amber and her friends
at the sheriff's station

346
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,433
Yeah, I came as soon as I heard

347
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,142
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good, too

348
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,166
Both of you, stop it

349
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,166
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

350
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,233
Yes

351
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,633
And I can move you to a private floor

352
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,833
Deputy Vinson knows what he's doing,
you'll be safe

353
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,166
Like we've been so far?

354
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,700
Samantha, let's step outside

355
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:30,933
Nice to see you, Deputy Hicks

356
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
-So many fun memories
-It's "Sheriff" Hicks

357
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,033
I remember you, too...

358
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,233
and all the trouble
you used to cause your family

359
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,933
Your presence here is not helping

360
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,666
So maybe when the sun comes up,

361
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,333
you and your boyfriend can hit the road

362
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,400
and leave it to people
who actually care about this community

363
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,433
Well, she remains a delight

364
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:04,533
Are you okay?

365
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:08,133
Would you mind giving us a second?
I need to talk to Tara

366
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,066
Come on, Netflix, let's go

367
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,433
Do you remember when Dad left?

368
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,033
Parts, sure

369
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,700
I was eight
What does that have to do with anything?

370
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,933
It has to do with it

371
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Do you remember how...

372
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,600
Mom used to keep those boxes
up in the attic?

373
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,733
Well, I was up there once...

374
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:52,633
When I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents

375
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:57,366
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school

376
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,933
- Sam, what is...
- Please

377
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,533
I have to do this

378
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,000
So I found these old diaries

379
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,533
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

380
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,933
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

381
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,266
and I thought it could be cool to find out
how she and Dad got together

382
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,833
How romantic it must have been

383
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,400
So I read some

384
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,800
Only it wasn't romantic

385
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,766
Mom was dating Dad, but...

386
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:27,366
she was in love with this other guy...

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,533
and he got her pregnant

388
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,066
She told Dad it was his,
and that's why he proposed senior year

389
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,446
Sam, what are you talking about?

390
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,533
And I'm sitting there, in this attic...

391
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:38,733
and I'm 13...

392
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,533
and I just found out my dad isn't my dad

393
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:48,300
So I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

394
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,533
and shoving this diary in her face,

395
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,500
and I didn't even realize...

396
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,133
that Dad was standing right behind me

397
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,700
He didn't know

398
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,666
He found out right then from me

399
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,066
He left that night

400
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,866
I'm the reason he left

401
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,000
No

402
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,066
No, Sam...

403
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:16,933
Mom never forgave me

404
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:20,466
Then she made me promise never
to tell you because you were so young

405
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,200
And that's why I changed

406
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:28,566
and I got distant and weird with you

407
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,600
And I went out and I started doing
every drug that I could get my hands on

408
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,566
until I couldn't take it anymore
and I left town

409
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,066
I just couldn't be
around you anymore, Tara

410
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,633
Not only because I destroyed our family
that night, but because...

411
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:49,233
those diaries told me
who my real father was

412
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,566
It was Billy Loomis

413
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,800
And somebody knows,
and I think that's why you got hurt

414
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,600
And I'm so fucking sorry
that I never told you and then I ran away

415
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,966
-I'm so sorry
-Get out

416
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,533
Tara

417
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,300
You're gone for five years...

418
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,733
Five whole years

419
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,576
And then I get stabbed
and you want to come back

420
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,100
and drop all this shit on me?

421
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,600
I thought I was protecting you

422
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,166
Protecting me from what?

423
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,666
The truth?

424
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:24,533
-No No, I... Please, Tara
-Sam

425
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:27,600
-Sam, I need you to get the fuck out
-I'm so sorry

426
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,966
-Sam
-Please

427
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,800
Get the fuck out!

428
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,666
Hey, hey, hey It's okay, it's me

429
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,233
Were you listening at the door?

430
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
No, no, of course not

431
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:02,133
Okay, yeah, I was listening at the door

432
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,166
It doesn't freak you out...

433
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,466
that my real father was a serial killer?

434
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,133
I mean...

435
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,866
yeah

436
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,133
A great deal, yeah

437
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,866
Okay, well, then go I get it

438
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,333
I just got to stay and figure it out

439
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,833
I'm not leaving you here, Sam

440
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:23,800
You know that part in horror movies

441
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,533
where you want to yell at the characters
to be smart and get the fuck out?

442
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,600
This is that part, Richie

443
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,833
You should get the fuck out

444
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:38,800
But I'm staying

445
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,166
I love you

446
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,066
-You're such a dumbass
-I'm such a dumbass

447
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,700
So...

448
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,300
your sister won't talk to you

449
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,266
The police aren't gonna help

450
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:00,066
What's our next move?

451
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:04,566
We go talk to an expert

452
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,733
...a few temperatures here
Tuesday, Wednesday in the mid-50s,

453
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:14,200
and then finally we'll see
those mid-60s returning into next week

454
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:17,300
And just one night after a local teen
was attacked in her home

455
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,566
by an assailant in a Ghostface costume,

456
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,466
Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed

457
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:24,600
two more late-night attacks
that have left Woodsboro reeling

458
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,333
The first victim, Vincent Schneider,
was found dead

459
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,000
behind the Corner Pocket Pool Hall

460
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,433
A second victim, as yet unnamed,
was attacked

461
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,266
inside Woodsboro General Hospital,

462
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,266
but she escaped without injuries

463
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,133
Needless to say,
Woodsboro is on high alert today...

464
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:41,333
Live from Studio 1-A in Rockefeller Plaza...

465
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,300
Good morning I'm Gale Weathers

466
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,600
Before we dive in,
I want to tell you a little story

467
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,200
that happened on the way
to the studio this morning

468
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,266
I stopped to get a bacon,
egg and cheese at a bodega,

469
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,000
already a quintessentially New York...

470
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
Go away!

471
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,500
Sorry to bother you, Mr Riley!

472
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,166
We just want to ask you a few questions

473
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,233
I don't give interviews

474
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,133
We're not looking for an interview

475
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,666
Give me one good reason
why I should talk to you

476
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:10,700
I'm Billy Loomis's daughter

477
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,833
That's a terrible reason
for me to talk to you

478
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,966
My name is Samantha Carpenter

479
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:19,800
I was attacked last night at the hospital

480
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,133
The night before that,
my sister was stabbed seven times

481
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,666
I know you know what that's like

482
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:27,733
I'm just trying to protect my family

483
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,733
Five minutes That's all I'm asking

484
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,500
I'll give you two minutes

485
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,066
I'm missing a show I like

486
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,466
If I ever threaten to get bangs,
stage an intervention

487
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,733
Gale Weathers

488
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,666
-Weren't you two...
-Yeah

489
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Who's he?

490
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
This is Richie, my boyfriend

491
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,420
How long have you known him?

492
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,166
Six months?

493
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:01,433
Did he know who your dad was when you met?

494
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:06,233
Express any interest in Woodsboro
or the Ghostface killings?

495
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,033
What the hell are you talking about?

496
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,966
Your killer's obsessed
with the Stab movies, right?

497
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:15,400
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a Stab movie

498
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:17,833
Believe me, I know

499
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,166
Rule number one:

500
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,033
Never trust the love interest

501
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,966
They seem sweet, caring, supportive

502
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:28,300
Then welcome to act 3,
where they're trying to rip your head off

503
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,600
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked

504
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,866
And let me guess,
you were just in the other room,

505
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:36,133
conveniently unaccounted for
when she was attacked at the hospital

506
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:39,533
Do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

507
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,566
Rule number two:

508
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:46,200
The killer's motive is
always connected to something in the past

509
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,733
I'm related to Billy

510
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,533
Right, but then why kill
that random Vince guy?

511
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,333
That's for you to figure out

512
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,700
And rule number three,
and this is the most important rule:

513
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,700
The first victim always has a friend group
that the killer is a part of

514
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,066
Does your sister have
a close-knit group of friends?

515
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Yeah

516
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:08,900
She does

517
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,033
Then look for the killer there

518
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,933
If you can find out
why they're doing this,

519
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,433
you can figure out who's next

520
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,733
So help us

521
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,800
Help us figure out who is behind this

522
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,600
You kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times

523
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,100
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp

524
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,833
You think I want to do that again?

525
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,833
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

526
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,900
So if I'm in danger...

527
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,533
that means you're in danger

528
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:40,733
Come on

529
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,633
Let's do this together

530
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:47,866
Your time's up

531
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,733
Jesus!

532
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,133
Yeah, he's way more fun in the movies

533
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,533
Okay, what's next?

534
00:34:58,633 --> 00:34:59,633
The friends

535
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,100
Thanks so much for that, Kevin

536
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,766
Coming up after our local weather,

537
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,666
the pros and cons
of reuniting with old friends

538
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,333
Hello?

539
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:38,566
Hey, Sid, it's me

540
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:41,200
Dewey?

541
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,533
Oh, my God How long has it been?

542
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm just trying to get a run in
before I take the girls to school

543
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
How are you?

544
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm good, really good

545
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:51,833
How are you? How's Mark?

546
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,066
I think I'll keep him

547
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,500
How are things in the sheriff's business?

548
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,233
They're...

549
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,733
- They're fine But, Sid...
- Have you talked to Gale lately?

550
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:04,400
No Not in a couple years

551
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:07,366
I know things didn't end well
with you guys, but...

552
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,000
Sid...

553
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,366
it's happening again

554
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,033
What are you talking about?

555
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,400
Some idiot in a Ghostface mask

556
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,600
Three attacks so far One dead

557
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,266
Something about this one
just feels different

558
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:27,733
Are you okay?

559
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,033
I'm fine, you know me

560
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,300
Yeah

561
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,566
I do That's why I'm asking

562
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,533
I'm fine

563
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,100
I just...

564
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,766
want you to be safe up there
Do you have a gun?

565
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,233
I'm Sidney fucking Prescott
Of course I have a gun

566
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:46,733
Good That's good

567
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,833
Does Gale know?

568
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,633
No, she's my next call

569
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,800
But, Sid, promise me:

570
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,200
No matter what you hear or what you see
on the news, don't come here

571
00:36:57,266 --> 00:37:00,400
No offense, Dewey I have no intention
of ever setting foot in that town again

572
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,133
Good

573
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,533
Dewey...

574
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,266
whoever this killer's after,
I'm glad they have you to protect them

575
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,666
You be safe, okay?

576
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,766
Will do

577
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:17,933
It's good to hear your voice

578
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,100
You, too, Sid

579
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,266
Come on Get it together, Dewey

580
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,966
Probably shouldn't have sent
the smiley face

581
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,000
Holy shit He came

582
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,000
I've decided to temporarily assist you
in your investigation

583
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,300
Thank you

584
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:49,066
Look, just because that guy showered
doesn't mean he should have a gun

585
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
How do you know so much about Stab?

586
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,700
Runs in her family

587
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,700
Randy was our uncle

588
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,000
RIP

589
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,200
You said to bring everybody

590
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,000
Woo, suspects!

591
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:16,000
My brother would be so proud

592
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,200
Hey, Martha

593
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,100
Dewey! Hi!

594
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,566
You look...

595
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:26,566
Yeah

596
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,266
- How's the wife?
- Okay, Mom, we're good Thank you

597
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:31,800
All right, kids, have fun

598
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:37,733
I asked Mindy to call everybody here,
because...

599
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,966
there's something I have to tell you

600
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:44,600
So let me get this straight

601
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,300
You're saying that you're
the daughter of Billy Loomis,

602
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
and, what, that one of us is the killer?

603
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,100
The killer told me he knew my secret

604
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:54,966
He attacked Tara to lure me back here

605
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:59,566
But then why immediately go and murder
some douche-nozzle that was stalking Liv?

606
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,366
And why does it have to be one of us?

607
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,266
What about Deputy Dewey here?
Maybe he's the killer

608
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
No offense

609
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,266
None taken, but what's my motive?

610
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,466
You got stabbed a billion times,

611
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,466
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle

612
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,733
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list

613
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,466
Well, maybe you're the killer

614
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,300
Because that cut deep

615
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,866
That douche-nozzle is connected

616
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,800
I googled him His mom is Leslie Macher

617
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,933
-Stu Macher's sister
-Who's Stu Macher?

618
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,200
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice

619
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,866
A real loony tune

620
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,300
Okay Okay

621
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:39,300
So the first three attacks are all
on people related to the original killers

622
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Oh, my God He's making a requel!

623
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
A what?

624
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,466
Or a legacyquel
Fans are torn on the terminology

625
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,133
God Please speak English

626
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,009
Remember the Stab movie
that came out last year?

627
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,666
Oh, yeah! The one
the Knives Out guy directed, right?

628
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,433
I actually really liked that one

629
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,133
Of course you did
You have terrible taste

630
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,433
I hate you

631
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,433
The point is,
the hard-core Stab fans hated it

632
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,833
You go on 4chan and Dreadit,

633
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,500
all they're talking about is
how Stab 8 pissed on their childhoods

634
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,800
How they crammed in social commentary
just to elevate it

635
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,633
How the main character's a Mary Sue

636
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,740
- What's a Mary Sue?
- You really don't want to know

637
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,333
What's wrong with elevated horror?

638
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,800
I mean, Jordan Peele fucking rules

639
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:16,166
Obviously, but that's not Stab

640
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,866
Real Stab movies are
meta slasher whodunits, full stop

641
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:23,533
-Come on, it's just a movie
-No, it's not

642
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,800
To some people, the original
is their favorite thing in the world

643
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:29,366
The movie that made them love horror

644
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:32,800
That Mom or Dad showed them when
they were ten that bonded them together

645
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,066
And God help anyone who
slightly fucks with that special memory

646
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,846
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it

647
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,700
It sounds like our killer is writing
his own version of Stab 8,

648
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,700
but doing it as a requel

649
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:46,366
Which is?

650
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,166
See, you can't just reboot a franchise
from scratch anymore

651
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,566
The fans won't stand for it

652
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:54,266
Black Christmas, Child's Play, Flatliners...

653
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:55,733
that shit doesn't work

654
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:58,500
But you can't just do
a straight sequel, either

655
00:41:58,566 --> 00:41:59,966
You got to build something new

656
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:02,833
But not too new,
or the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts

657
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,100
It has to be part
of an ongoing story line,

658
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,100
even if the story shouldn't have been
ongoing in the first place

659
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,933
New main characters, yes,

660
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:13,600
but supported by
and related to legacy characters

661
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,833
Not quite a reboot, not quite a sequel

662
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
Like the new Halloween, Saw,
Terminator, Jurassic Park, Ghostbusters...

663
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:20,900
fuck, even Star Wars!

664
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:25,066
It always,
always goes back to the original!

665
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:29,433
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan-fucking-fiction?

666
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,100
Not just in the middle, Sam

667
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,200
You're the star

668
00:42:37,466 --> 00:42:40,600
So, not to put too fine a point on it,

669
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:44,100
but, according to requel rules...

670
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
who's next?

671
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:48,866
Going by the pattern,

672
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,600
whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before

673
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,466
I'm starting to regret coming here

674
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,242
Jesus, my mom was
a character in one of them

675
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:04,800
No one cares about the shitty
inferior sequels, Wes You're safe

676
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,433
With Randy as our uncle, though,
you and I are probably screwed

677
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,700
Wait What?

678
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Or you're the killer,

679
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,266
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks

680
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,833
I think it's pretty clear
who the killer is at this point

681
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:17,933
Who?

682
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,166
You

683
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,433
It makes perfect requel sense

684
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
-That actually does make a lot of sense
-Yeah

685
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,600
Fuck this

686
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,733
-Meet you back at the motel
-Sam, wait

687
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:36,933
Sam, wait

688
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,500
The first fucking rule of these movies
is don't split up!

689
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,333
The nerve of that girl, right?

690
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,833
I'm really not in the mood right now

691
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,133
Sam, Sam, Sam

692
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,333
There is a killer on the loose

693
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,500
He's threatening you
He's threatening your sister

694
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,133
Are you gonna run away
from who you are like you always do,

695
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,700
or are you gonna use it?

696
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,100
I'm not like you

697
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,366
Really?

698
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,033
And how else are you gonna survive?

699
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,500
I say accept who you are,

700
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:10,900
let's get out there,
find out who's doing this,

701
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
and cut some fucking throats!

702
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,866
No!

703
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,833
And extra edamame Please

704
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,400
Thank you I'll be there in ten minutes

705
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,033
Bye

706
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:39,866
That you, tiger?

707
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,633
Jesus!

708
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,800
Are you being safe out there, honey?

709
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:28,033
To the point
that all my friends mock me, yes

710
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,133
Good boy

711
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:32,766
- What's for dinner?
- Sushi I was just leaving to pick it up

712
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,766
Why don't you just Postmates it?

713
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:37,800
It gets all smooshy
by the time it's here

714
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,166
I know you hate that

715
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:41,800
Go take a shower I'll be back soon

716
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,933
- Can you put this away for me?
- Yes

717
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,066
-Love you
-Love you

718
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:50,633
-Lock the door
-I will

719
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,333
-Sheriff Hicks
-Hello, Sheriff Judy

720
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:35,566
- Who is this?
- I think you know

721
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:39,433
I'm a fan of scary movies And knives

722
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,300
What's your favorite scary movie?

723
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,200
I prefer animated films and musicals

724
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,300
Why are you doing this?

725
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:51,233
I'll tell you all about it
I'm calling to turn myself in

726
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,200
I think that's a great idea

727
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:57,833
We'll sit down at the station, and I'll
tell you about the two people I've killed

728
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,533
You've only killed one person

729
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:04,600
By the time I see you,
I'll have gutted your baby boy

730
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,600
Fuck you!

731
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,800
Pick up, Wes!

732
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:31,566
This is Sheriff Hicks
I need units to converge on my house ASAP

733
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:32,900
Copy that We're on it

734
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:37,033
Can't get him on the phone, can you?

735
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,733
He must be busy

736
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,900
How do I know you're anywhere near him?

737
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:43,166
Ever seen the movie Psycho?

738
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Please...

739
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,000
don't hurt my boy

740
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,400
Why not?

741
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,433
-He's a good kid
-Is he, now?

742
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:04,866
He never hurt anyone

743
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,133
That's not enough

744
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:09,633
Please! I'll do anything!

745
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,966
You're not gonna make it in time,
Sheriff Judy

746
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:32,566
Wes!

747
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:34,166
I'm coming!

748
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:36,366
Wes!

749
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,633
Help!

750
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,300
Help!

751
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:20,866
Okay

752
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:21,733
Mom?

753
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,633
Mom?

754
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,666
Fuck... you!

755
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:23,400
Miss, you can't be here
You can't be here

756
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,966
No, I'm sorry I know her son

757
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:27,300
-Her son, Wes Is he...
-I'm sorry

758
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm sorry

759
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,200
Excuse me

760
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,333
Oh, my God

761
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:54,966
You're...

762
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,633
Well, you're you

763
00:53:57,733 --> 00:53:59,233
Last time I checked

764
00:54:00,466 --> 00:54:03,266
Are you okay? You seem like
you're having a bit of a moment

765
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,566
Did you know the sheriff?

766
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,666
Sort of

767
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,333
She didn't like me very much

768
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:11,366
She didn't like me either

769
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,933
I'm Samantha Sam Carpenter

770
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,933
My sister and I were attacked

771
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,633
Sorry to hear that

772
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:21,266
I'm Gale...

773
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:27,466
Riley

774
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:30,433
Weathers I'm Gale Weathers Excuse me

775
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:35,033
- Gale?
- A text?

776
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,466
You tell me the killer is back in a text?

777
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:39,500
-Ow, that hurts
-Good!

778
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,000
-You were on the air
-How do you know?

779
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,333
A hunch

780
00:54:44,966 --> 00:54:47,200
You look good Are you still writing?

781
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:49,633
No time

782
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:52,166
You were always happiest
when you were writing

783
00:54:52,266 --> 00:54:54,266
Well, sir, it's okay
We're here with Gale

784
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,733
I'd give you a hand,
but I can't release anybody right now

785
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:59,200
Couldn't resist a good story, could you?

786
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,533
Don't be an idiot, Dewey
I'm here because I was worried about you

787
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,200
Okay, yes My producers wanted me
to cover this, for obvious reasons,

788
00:55:07,866 --> 00:55:09,600
but 90% is because of you

789
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,633
Well, I feel 90% better

790
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,333
Don't be so sensitive

791
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,733
Since when did you care about my feelings?
Especially not in the last couple years

792
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:20,833
All right, listen Let's not pretend
I'm the one who ended things

793
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,666
No one's pretending, Gale
I remember what happened

794
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,300
Why aren't you in uniform?

795
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:30,766
I retired

796
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:32,300
Since when?

797
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:34,966
Since they asked me to

798
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Dewey

799
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,166
I don't need your pity, Gale

800
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,066
I made my choices So did you

801
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:45,533
It was my turn
It was a great opportunity

802
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,900
-You said you'd try
-And I did

803
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,200
For two whole months!

804
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:53,133
Listen, if you want to make me feel worse
than I already do, good luck

805
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:55,866
The mornings aren't so bad,
because I get to see you

806
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,800
Pretend I'm still back there in New York

807
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,233
But then I remember...

808
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,400
that I couldn't hack it
I left in the middle of the night...

809
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,733
like a coward

810
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,433
Why wouldn't you tell me that then?

811
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,600
It would have mattered

812
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,566
You are a lot of things, Dewey...

813
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:21,366
but you are not a coward

814
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,100
You just...

815
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,300
You just were meant to be in Woodsboro

816
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
And you weren't?

817
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,600
Promise me you'll leave
as soon as you can

818
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,233
You know I can't promise that

819
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,633
I'm sorry about Judy

820
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:42,900
Yeah, me too

821
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:47,166
But she'll make a great chapter
in your next book

822
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,466
And don't even get me started
on Ghostface's signature new weapon

823
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,066
That shit is lit

824
00:56:56,133 --> 00:57:00,166
And can we talk about the title? Stab?
What, just like the original?

825
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:04,333
Just call it Stab 8 It's fucking Stab 8
You're not fooling anyone

826
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:05,733
It's such bullshit

827
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,533
- Where have you been? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine

828
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,766
You know, that Mindy girl wasn't kidding
Stab 8 is not like the others

829
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:15,466
I mean, no connection to the other movies
No legacy characters at all

830
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,733
This franchise goes off the rails
with number five

831
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:24,200
Richie, listen to me He killed
two more people Wes and his mother

832
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,966
He killed the sheriff? You can do that?

833
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:29,300
I mean, are you okay? Where are you?

834
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:31,833
-I'll call you right back
-No, Sam...

835
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,366
We should be out looking for him

836
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:34,833
Who's at the hospital?

837
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,100
Who's watching my sister?

838
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:40,033
I just heard about the sheriff

839
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,000
They needed me here!

840
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,866
- Where are you going?
- My sister's in trouble!

841
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,966
...where Judy Hicks
has just been brutally murdered

842
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,800
What are you waiting for?

843
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,200
Drive!

844
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,266
Come on Let's go!

845
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:12,866
Hello?

846
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:20,133
Hello?

847
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,066
Fuck this

848
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,700
Fuck!

849
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,466
Goddamn it!

850
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,900
Should you be making
a phone call right now?

851
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,666
Please, please

852
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:08,300
Stop!

853
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:11,600
You know we have to live
through this to help her, right?

854
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,666
Just hold on

855
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,300
Holy shit

856
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,000
Goddamn it!

857
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:18,100
Richie?

858
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,466
What are you doing here?

859
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,700
Sam called She said that...

860
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:23,366
you were in trouble

861
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,433
- Did you hit me with the phone?
- Look out!

862
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,100
Richie!

863
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:10,733
- Are you at the hospital?
- Hello, Samantha

864
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,800
No

865
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Richie can't come to the phone right now

866
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:16,800
He's finding out what happens to people

867
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,133
who stick their noses in business
that doesn't concern them

868
01:02:20,233 --> 01:02:23,166
-Please don't hurt him
-I'll tell you what You can choose

869
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:25,066
I'll only kill one

870
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:27,500
What? Tara!

871
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,500
Who do you want to hear die?

872
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,500
No, please I'm begging you
Please don't hurt them

873
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,433
Really? You can't save your own sister?

874
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,866
All you have to do is say, "Kill Richie"

875
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:37,966
No! No!

876
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,866
No! Tara! Don't touch her

877
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,133
Please, please, please, I'm begging you

878
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,866
Or say, "Kill Tara,"

879
01:02:44,966 --> 01:02:48,333
and I'll make sure to hit
all the organs I missed last time

880
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
Fuck you!

881
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,933
I'm begging you Please don't hurt her

882
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,933
Last chance to save one

883
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,133
Choose

884
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:58,533
Why are you doing this?

885
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:00,300
You want to know why, Sam?

886
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:02,333
Maybe it's because you're a selfish bitch

887
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:06,300
who can't even make a decision
to save the life of someone you love

888
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:10,000
Maybe you're too weak for this franchise

889
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:12,800
Maybe you're right

890
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:17,166
Or maybe I'm just stalling for time,
fuckhead

891
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:23,533
I'll get Richie

892
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,633
Tara!

893
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,300
Come on, Richie

894
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:32,800
It's okay I got you

895
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,233
It's gonna be all right

896
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:39,533
Get the elevator!

897
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,800
Not today

898
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:19,533
Richie

899
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:21,566
Let's get out of here

900
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:29,600
Come on, hurry up

901
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,500
-The head
-What?

902
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:37,033
You have to shoot 'em in the head,
or they always come back

903
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,133
Dewey! Who gives a fuck?

904
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:42,233
-I do
-No! Dewey!

905
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,500
Yes, today

906
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:47,133
It's an honor

907
01:06:32,966 --> 01:06:34,000
No!

908
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,700
No!

909
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:16,866
I'm sorry

910
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,666
I didn't know him well, but...

911
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:24,233
he helped me

912
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,300
That's what he did

913
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:29,766
He helped people

914
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:32,833
I should've stopped him

915
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:36,600
If you had, my sister would be dead

916
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,300
Samantha, your sister's awake

917
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,166
Gale

918
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Sidney

919
01:08:06,066 --> 01:08:07,333
I came as soon as I heard

920
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,933
I'm so sorry

921
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:24,166
You shouldn't be here

922
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,733
You shouldn't be here either

923
01:08:27,966 --> 01:08:30,266
- Mark and the kids are okay?
- Yeah, they're safe for now

924
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:32,966
I'm here to make sure of that

925
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,100
Come here

926
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
How you feeling?

927
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:54,433
Every time I get attacked,
they give me better painkillers

928
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,966
So there's that

929
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:00,833
I'm sorry

930
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,800
For what? You saved my life

931
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,233
For not telling you sooner

932
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,733
For being the reason Dad left

933
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,800
You're not the reason Dad left

934
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:17,533
You didn't choose where you came from
Or who you came from

935
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,000
I don't blame you for that

936
01:09:21,066 --> 01:09:23,000
I blame you for leaving me too

937
01:09:23,566 --> 01:09:25,466
That's never gonna happen again

938
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:28,366
I know

939
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,466
But why didn't you come to me back then?

940
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,033
I could've helped

941
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:35,666
Because...

942
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,533
I was scared

943
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,600
Of what?

944
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,166
I was scared
that I would turn out just like him

945
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,100
So I ran

946
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:51,700
To protect you

947
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:55,566
-From me
-Sam...

948
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,733
you could never be like him

949
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:08,100
-You're so high right now
-I'm so high right now

950
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,100
I'm not even gonna lie

951
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,933
I love you

952
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:18,600
I love you too

953
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:23,666
So what do we do now?

954
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:27,800
What nobody ever does in these situations

955
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:32,000
We're gonna get the fuck out of Woodsboro

956
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:40,333
- That's her?
- Yeah

957
01:10:44,066 --> 01:10:45,233
Samantha?

958
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,600
It's Sam

959
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,233
- I'm...
- I know who you are

960
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:53,700
I hope you're okay

961
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,166
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- You're Billy's daughter

962
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,833
We'll bring the car around

963
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,633
Yeah I'm his daughter

964
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:09,100
I'm sorry if that's weird for you

965
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,800
No, no, it's...

966
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,100
I've been through this A lot

967
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,300
You want to talk?

968
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,700
I appreciate it

969
01:11:20,866 --> 01:11:22,000
And I'm...

970
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,633
I'm really sorry about Dewey

971
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:27,533
But I'm taking my sister away
from all this

972
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,466
I tried running too
It doesn't work, it always follows

973
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,633
All due respect,
that's your life, not mine

974
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,133
-I'm not so sure about that
-What do you want from me, lady?

975
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,633
Hey! Watch your tone, new girl

976
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,533
You know how they always say
it goes back to the original?

977
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,066
Here's the original

978
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:47,666
I want your help

979
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:49,376
Because you're wrong,
this is your life now

980
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,000
Which means whoever this is
will keep coming for you

981
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:54,400
- So?
- So I want you to help us kill him

982
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:59,633
You want me to help you and the host
of a morning show commit murder?

983
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,766
-Correct
-Yeah

984
01:12:00,866 --> 01:12:02,866
And I'm what in this scenario?

985
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:06,100
The bait? The helpless victim?

986
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,533
-If the shoe fits...
-You're not helpless, Sam

987
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:11,000
He killed your friend, he killed ours

988
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:14,066
And I have kids, which means
I won't sleep until he's in the ground

989
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:18,766
Look, I'm sorry about
what this has done to your lives

990
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:22,200
But no matter what you
or the killer or anyone says,

991
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,000
this isn't my story

992
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,066
All right!
Let's get the fuck out of town, huh?

993
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,100
Sorry That's my boyfriend, Richie

994
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,900
Nice to meet... We met

995
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,733
Sam, please get in the car so we never
have to see these people again

996
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,266
- Sam...
- No We're leaving

997
01:12:38,133 --> 01:12:40,100
That's the only way I can protect Tara

998
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,466
Okay, good luck

999
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,733
You too

1000
01:12:52,766 --> 01:12:54,266
Well, that went fucking horribly

1001
01:12:54,366 --> 01:12:56,933
Don't worry, I have a plan
She seems really tough

1002
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:59,033
Honestly, Sid, who gives a shit?

1003
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,460
You said it yourself,
he's gonna go after her

1004
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,900
I put a tracker on her car

1005
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:03,966
You did what?

1006
01:13:04,066 --> 01:13:06,166
It seemed like something
Gale Weathers would do

1007
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,600
Take that as a compliment

1008
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,033
I left a message for Mom
I told her where we're going

1009
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:15,766
You good back there?

1010
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:18,400
Fuck, where is it?

1011
01:13:18,466 --> 01:13:19,466
Where's what?

1012
01:13:19,966 --> 01:13:22,066
My inhaler I usually keep an extra one

1013
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,166
Should we go back?

1014
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:27,800
Whoa Okay I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital

1015
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,233
- You want to stop at a pharmacy?
- I'd need a prescription

1016
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,133
But I left an extra one at Amber's
Her house is on the way

1017
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,533
No... no

1018
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:37,000
I'd be in and out

1019
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,433
Could you hold out till Modesto?

1020
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,866
-I don't think so
-Okay, what's the address?

1021
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:42,633
123 No Fucking Way Lane

1022
01:13:42,733 --> 01:13:44,633
Richie, she needs it

1023
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:47,933
And I need to keep all the blood
inside my body So do you

1024
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Richie, please

1025
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,166
It's okay

1026
01:13:53,133 --> 01:13:56,100
Okay, yeah Fuck
What's the goddamn address?

1027
01:14:01,933 --> 01:14:03,466
Hey, thanks for coming

1028
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:18,133
Keep pouring, Wheeler Thank you

1029
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,766
Hey

1030
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,500
To Wes!

1031
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,666
Beautiful son of a bitch

1032
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:25,800
We love you, buddy!

1033
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:28,633
Shots, really?
This is supposed to be a memorial

1034
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,366
Well, this is how I mourn

1035
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:34,633
and distract myself
from the looming specter of Death

1036
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,000
Hey, we're low on beer

1037
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,700
There's more in the basement
I'll go get some

1038
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:21,366
What the fuck, Mindy? Jesus!

1039
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,533
That was a test And you failed

1040
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,933
Never go off on your own
with a masked killer around

1041
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:28,033
You're the one that said
we needed more beer

1042
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,033
And you should have asked me
to come with you

1043
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,433
You know what else you shouldn't do
when there's a masked killer around?

1044
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:36,533
What?

1045
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,533
Follow someone into a dark,
creepy basement alone

1046
01:15:43,233 --> 01:15:44,233
I mean...

1047
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:47,633
how do you know I'm not the killer?

1048
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,566
Because I am

1049
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:57,966
I'm not, actually

1050
01:15:58,066 --> 01:16:02,000
But let that be a lesson
Don't trust anyone

1051
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:06,000
Then how can I trust you
when you say you're not the killer?

1052
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,233
Exactly

1053
01:16:08,433 --> 01:16:09,433
You're learning

1054
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,433
Now let's go back upstairs

1055
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You first

1056
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Very good

1057
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,666
I think I'm ready

1058
01:16:38,133 --> 01:16:39,433
I mean, I think we should

1059
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:42,766
Like now You want to go upstairs?

1060
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,000
Like... Like upstairs?

1061
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,600
Uh-huh Right now

1062
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:56,366
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think I have to pass on that

1063
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,533
What?

1064
01:17:00,133 --> 01:17:01,466
Why?

1065
01:17:03,033 --> 01:17:08,800
You know, I'm not like
entirely sure that you're not the...

1066
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:11,333
killer

1067
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,300
"Don't take this the wrong way"?

1068
01:17:13,366 --> 01:17:18,033
No, no, look I'm almost 100% certain
that you are not, but...

1069
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:21,466
the safest option is to be down here

1070
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:22,633
with all the people...

1071
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,166
Fuck you

1072
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:25,666
...and the potential witnesses

1073
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,166
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have

1074
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:30,866
-That too
-Fucking asshole

1075
01:17:32,633 --> 01:17:33,633
Good job

1076
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,533
Fuck you, Mindy

1077
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:40,566
If I hadn't have written that book
about your mother,

1078
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,866
-none of this would've happened
-Gale

1079
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:45,766
-I started all of this
-No, you didn't

1080
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:48,966
Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it

1081
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:54,300
After tonight, no more books,
no more movies, no more fucking Ghostface

1082
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:57,500
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

1083
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:07,366
There are specific rules
to successfully survive a horror movie

1084
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,766
For instance, Number One:
You can never have sex

1085
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,100
-Don't do it Don't go outside after her
-She's not texting me back

1086
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,366
Because she's probably dead

1087
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:18,333
Jesus, Mindy
That's my girlfriend, and I love her

1088
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,933
Was your girlfriend

1089
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:22,873
You're just gonna sit and watch a movie
about our uncle getting stabbed?

1090
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,933
It calms me down, okay?

1091
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,600
I'm also gonna smoke some weed
and possibly hook up with Frances

1092
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,133
Have fun

1093
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:32,966
Oh, my God,
at least take some sort of weapon

1094
01:18:33,633 --> 01:18:34,733
Here you go

1095
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,833
All right

1096
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,400
What?

1097
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,533
Liv?

1098
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,133
Liv?

1099
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:53,366
All right Okay, yeah, no

1100
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,700
Shit!

1101
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:08,766
Fuck!

1102
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:33,566
Please, please, please

1103
01:21:07,366 --> 01:21:09,200
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

1104
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:25,066
Perfect She's having a party

1105
01:21:25,866 --> 01:21:28,866
Who has a party in the middle
of a killing spree? I'm aborting the plan

1106
01:21:28,933 --> 01:21:32,666
No, we're already here I'll go in quickly
and get it I'll be back in five

1107
01:21:32,766 --> 01:21:33,666
I'm coming too

1108
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:36,333
If you think I'm waiting out here
just to get murdered,

1109
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,900
you're out of your mind

1110
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,466
Tara!

1111
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:54,566
What are you doing out of the hospital?
Should you even be up and around?

1112
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:57,033
-I need my spare inhaler
-Why? Where are you going?

1113
01:22:00,633 --> 01:22:03,266
It's fine, don't tell me
I get it Just be safe, okay?

1114
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,466
I think it's in my room

1115
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,333
All right, everyone!
Thanks for coming, but the party's over!

1116
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,500
- Time to go!
- No!

1117
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,833
But it's so early!

1118
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:18,100
Let's go

1119
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:23,566
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
Can we cut the music, please?

1120
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:28,366
Hi... Gen Z How are you?

1121
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:32,466
Both Sam and Tara here have been attacked
by the killer twice

1122
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:36,200
Now they're here, which makes this place
a huge murder target, so...

1123
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,300
if I were you, I would probably leave

1124
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:41,266
Okay, I tried to be nice
Get the fuck out!

1125
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,133
Please get the fuck out

1126
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,466
-Sincerely, get the fuck out
-Buzzkill!

1127
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:50,333
Thank you Thank you all
I'm saving your life I promise

1128
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,266
Thanks, teens

1129
01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:55,933
Thank you so much

1130
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:58,866
Great, thank you for leaving the cup
Thank you

1131
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:01,200
Saving your life

1132
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,333
I'm saving your life

1133
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,366
Saving your life, thank you

1134
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,500
And Number Three:

1135
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:11,900
Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances,

1136
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,866
say, "I'll be right back"

1137
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:15,233
'Cause you won't be back

1138
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:18,700
Somebody's goofy-ass dad's kicking us out

1139
01:23:18,766 --> 01:23:20,233
Goddamn it

1140
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,433
Thank you

1141
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:23,100
Thanks, guys, have a good night

1142
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,900
-You have my number Bye
-Bye

1143
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:38,433
Hi

1144
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,533
Is there any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen

1145
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,233
Yes, Richie, there's beer in the basement

1146
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,033
Right behind you Basement

1147
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,766
Yeah

1148
01:23:48,866 --> 01:23:50,866
Do you want to come with me?

1149
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,800
No But you were right to ask

1150
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,933
Yeah

1151
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,766
Okay, I'll be right back

1152
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,433
Yeah Yeah

1153
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,066
Well, he's dead

1154
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,433
The goddamn fucking Uber canceled on me!

1155
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:13,766
Great Now I can't have sex
and I can't get a ride home

1156
01:24:14,266 --> 01:24:16,833
Could this night get any shittier?

1157
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:18,966
Liv, where's my brother?

1158
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:22,933
What? I don't know, Mindy Probably off
accusing everyone of being the killer!

1159
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:26,066
He actually went looking for you

1160
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:29,600
I didn't see him Okay?

1161
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

1162
01:24:33,733 --> 01:24:36,366
Just revising my suspect list

1163
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,333
Fuck this!

1164
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,333
Are you afraid of me, Mindy?

1165
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:54,866
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

1166
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:58,300
You think I'm gonna... cut you up?

1167
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,333
A little bit now... yeah

1168
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,766
I thought you said
I was too boring to be the killer

1169
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:09,166
Maybe that's the twist

1170
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:13,833
What do you think, huh? You're the expert

1171
01:25:15,433 --> 01:25:19,466
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

1172
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:21,500
What?

1173
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:29,533
Enjoy your stupid movie

1174
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:35,133
Fucking psycho

1175
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,666
They stopped

1176
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:38,866
- Gas station?
- No

1177
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:40,966
-Oh, shit
-What?

1178
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:46,366
Oh, shit How far are we?

1179
01:25:46,466 --> 01:25:47,466
Too far

1180
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:49,533
Damn it

1181
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,500
Tara, we're leaving!

1182
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:58,366
Hello

1183
01:25:58,466 --> 01:26:00,366
You need to get out
of that house right now

1184
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:01,546
How do you know where I am?

1185
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,733
You're in Stu Macher's house,
where your dad and Stu killed everyone

1186
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:07,866
Someone planned to get you there
You need to get the fuck out, Sam!

1187
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,266
No, Jamie Watch out

1188
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:20,366
Watch out, Jamie

1189
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,533
You know he's around

1190
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,866
- What?
- There he is

1191
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:29,433
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

1192
01:26:29,533 --> 01:26:33,033
I told you I told you,
he's around the corner Jamie

1193
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,700
-Look behind you
-No, Randy, look behind you

1194
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:38,700
Come on, man, turn around!

1195
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:42,033
Dude, what are you doing? You can do it!

1196
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,533
These are your rules! Own that shit

1197
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,200
Behind you! Turn around

1198
01:26:47,266 --> 01:26:49,266
Look behind...

1199
01:26:50,933 --> 01:26:52,400
Oh, shit!

1200
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:13,533
That's a lot of blood, Sam

1201
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,600
No, Mindy, stay with me

1202
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:19,133
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing

1203
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:20,800
No, I didn't do anything

1204
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,966
- The killer, he...
- Is she okay?

1205
01:27:23,566 --> 01:27:24,566
What the fuck?

1206
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,100
Richie, where the fuck were you?

1207
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:27,666
I went into the basement to get beer

1208
01:27:27,766 --> 01:27:29,006
You went to the basement alone?

1209
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:31,166
I asked her to come with me! She said no!

1210
01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:32,333
Fuck!

1211
01:27:32,433 --> 01:27:33,666
Stay the fuck back

1212
01:27:33,766 --> 01:27:35,000
Jesus Christ!

1213
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,600
I was with Tara, but the rest of you
were wandering around

1214
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:39,566
One of you is the fucking killer!

1215
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:42,000
Fuck you, Amber Fuck you!

1216
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,833
- Why is there blood on your hands?
- What?

1217
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:50,100
- I found Chad I found Chad and he's...
- Chad?

1218
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:52,566
-You're fucking lying
-No

1219
01:27:52,633 --> 01:27:54,500
-You're the killer
-No, I'm not

1220
01:27:54,633 --> 01:27:55,833
Liv, stop

1221
01:27:55,933 --> 01:27:58,100
- Fuck you!
- Liv, just stop!

1222
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:01,700
Fuck you, Amber
I'm not the fucking killer!

1223
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,933
I know

1224
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,600
Welcome to Act Three

1225
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:08,800
Run!

1226
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:12,300
Holy shit!

1227
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:13,800
Sam, come on!

1228
01:28:13,866 --> 01:28:16,333
Run! Go, go, go! Go!

1229
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,800
- Oh, my God... Tara!
- Wait, no, Sam

1230
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:22,866
She has a gun

1231
01:28:22,966 --> 01:28:25,066
There are always two killers

1232
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,333
Sam, please put the knife down

1233
01:28:37,866 --> 01:28:39,166
Look, I think...

1234
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,166
-I think the other killer might be Tara
-What?

1235
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:45,700
She's the one that brought us here
and you two have been estranged for years

1236
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,400
I mean...

1237
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,866
how well do you really know her?

1238
01:28:51,433 --> 01:28:52,900
Better than I know you

1239
01:28:56,066 --> 01:28:57,833
Sam, wait Sam!

1240
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:15,733
Sounds about right

1241
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:17,666
You ready?

1242
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:19,533
For this? Never

1243
01:29:20,466 --> 01:29:21,566
Here we go

1244
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,400
Help me, help me! He stabbed me!

1245
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,233
- What do you think?
- Trap

1246
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:34,733
Fuck it

1247
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,933
Ow!

1248
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:40,633
Gale! Gale!

1249
01:29:40,733 --> 01:29:42,100
Wait Let me see

1250
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,833
-You got to go to the hospital
-No

1251
01:29:45,366 --> 01:29:48,100
You said we were gonna finish this
Go finish it, Sidney

1252
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,133
Gale

1253
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,233
For Dewey

1254
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,766
Anyone hiding, killer or not,
you have five seconds to show yourself!

1255
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,800
Tara

1256
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:12,966
Oh, my God

1257
01:31:21,866 --> 01:31:22,866
Sam

1258
01:31:23,533 --> 01:31:24,900
Sam, please

1259
01:31:34,466 --> 01:31:37,266
Hello, Sidney!

1260
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,866
Hello there Where'd you go?

1261
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:43,066
This isn't Amber I'm the other one

1262
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,800
There's two of you Again

1263
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,033
I've seen this movie before

1264
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:51,033
Not this movie, Sidney

1265
01:31:51,133 --> 01:31:53,166
You really need some new material

1266
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,266
I got you here, didn't I?

1267
01:31:57,066 --> 01:31:59,300
You might actually be
the most derivative one of all

1268
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,033
I mean, Christ, the same house?

1269
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:05,400
Maybe so But you forgot the first rule
of surviving a Stab movie

1270
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,166
- Never answer the...
- I'm bored

1271
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:08,366
Wait!

1272
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,266
Put your hands up! Show me your hands!
What are you doing in there?

1273
01:32:16,066 --> 01:32:17,233
Hiding from murderers

1274
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,300
I told you to come out!

1275
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,766
I'm not gonna come out!
You're shooting everything!

1276
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,833
Holy shit, it's Ghostface!

1277
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,800
Richie! Gun Get the gun

1278
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,266
Kind of hard since you shot me in the leg

1279
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,766
- Yes! Yes!
- Shoot him!

1280
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:01,000
Thank God you're okay

1281
01:33:04,933 --> 01:33:06,266
'Cause I really,

1282
01:33:06,966 --> 01:33:08,633
really wanted to be the one to kill you

1283
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,133
Sit the fuck down, Prescott!

1284
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,166
I can't believe this worked

1285
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:47,066
I know It's a bummer it's me

1286
01:33:51,033 --> 01:33:53,600
But it really was
the best choice for the movie

1287
01:33:55,966 --> 01:33:58,166
This isn't a fucking movie!

1288
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,133
No But it will be

1289
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:05,400
- That's the point, right, Amber?
- Right, hon!

1290
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,200
Third Act bloodbath, check
Killers revealed, check

1291
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,033
Time for the big finale!

1292
01:34:13,966 --> 01:34:15,000
Richie...

1293
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,833
Okay Okay

1294
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,733
Let's get 'em into the kitchen

1295
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:24,066
Let's go, bitch!

1296
01:34:24,166 --> 01:34:26,500
Someone has to save the franchise

1297
01:34:26,566 --> 01:34:31,166
You see, no one has made
a great Stab movie since the first one

1298
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:32,900
Not really

1299
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,166
Hey, baby, you want to go get
the very ex-Mrs Riley?

1300
01:34:36,233 --> 01:34:37,366
Yeah, I do

1301
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:39,866
Hey, hey!

1302
01:34:39,933 --> 01:34:42,333
Whoa... whoa

1303
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:44,866
Sidney Prescott

1304
01:34:44,933 --> 01:34:46,400
You know...

1305
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:49,233
I'm a really big fan

1306
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:50,366
Go fuck yourself

1307
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:54,100
- You see the last Stab movie?
- Not really a fan of scary movies

1308
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,566
That checks out Anyway, it sucked balls

1309
01:34:56,666 --> 01:35:00,066
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously Not really

1310
01:35:01,033 --> 01:35:03,033
They just laugh at us, and why?

1311
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,200
Because we love something?

1312
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:07,400
We're just a fucking joke to them?

1313
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,200
How can fandom be toxic?

1314
01:35:12,266 --> 01:35:14,033
It's about love!

1315
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,800
They don't fucking understand
that these movies are important to people

1316
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,400
-Richie...
-But we're gonna help them!

1317
01:35:20,233 --> 01:35:22,966
Hollywood's totally
fucking out of ideas,

1318
01:35:23,066 --> 01:35:26,233
so we decided we'd give them
some new source material to follow

1319
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,133
Bring it back to basics

1320
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:30,266
Because that's how you make
a great Stab movie, Sam

1321
01:35:31,633 --> 01:35:33,400
"Based on actual events"

1322
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,233
-Gale
-Sit the fuck down!

1323
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,500
Back up

1324
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:49,066
You did all this just to make me
the hero of your fucked-up movie?

1325
01:35:49,133 --> 01:35:52,000
Sweetie, you're not the hero

1326
01:35:54,266 --> 01:35:55,466
You're the villain

1327
01:35:56,433 --> 01:36:00,133
The daughter of Billy Loomis who sees
fucked-up visions of her dead dad

1328
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,100
Sidney Prescott killed your father

1329
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:03,766
You...

1330
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:07,300
did all this just to get her
back to Woodsboro

1331
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:11,966
You know what the biggest problem
with the Stab movies is?

1332
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,666
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees

1333
01:36:15,766 --> 01:36:18,066
No bad guy to keep coming back

1334
01:36:18,633 --> 01:36:21,300
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

1335
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:24,533
Now that's a fucking villain

1336
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:27,300
- How did you know?
- About your father?

1337
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:31,866
It's a small town and your mom's a drunk!

1338
01:36:32,566 --> 01:36:34,533
I met Richie on the Stab subreddit

1339
01:36:35,366 --> 01:36:38,800
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house

1340
01:36:39,566 --> 01:36:42,166
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas

1341
01:36:42,233 --> 01:36:44,800
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto

1342
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,866
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you, either

1343
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:49,542
But I guess
being a sexually available woman

1344
01:36:49,566 --> 01:36:51,133
is supposed to be empowering these days

1345
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,200
Fuck you!

1346
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:54,833
Well, now you're just
quoting the original

1347
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:57,900
But it wouldn't work with just you, Sam

1348
01:36:58,566 --> 01:37:01,933
See, we had to bring the legacy characters
back to make it matter

1349
01:37:03,033 --> 01:37:05,866
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

1350
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:06,933
Nope!

1351
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:08,533
Dewey had to die to make it real

1352
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,000
To show that this
wasn't just some bullshit,

1353
01:37:11,066 --> 01:37:14,133
cash-in, run-of-the-mill sequel

1354
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:18,233
Because our movie has fucking stakes!

1355
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:21,500
'Cause anyone can die in a requel

1356
01:37:23,466 --> 01:37:24,666
No!

1357
01:37:26,066 --> 01:37:28,166
Goddamn it Whoa, whoa!

1358
01:37:28,233 --> 01:37:30,500
No, hey! Sit the fuck down

1359
01:37:34,033 --> 01:37:36,066
I'm so sorry, Sid

1360
01:37:36,633 --> 01:37:39,966
We can't let you live, either
I mean, surviving this many times...

1361
01:37:40,733 --> 01:37:42,166
that would just be ridiculous

1362
01:37:42,633 --> 01:37:45,700
This time the fans are gonna be
the ones who win

1363
01:37:48,433 --> 01:37:51,066
- That about cover it?
- Nailed it, baby

1364
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,833
Get Tara out of the closet
We got to start staging the bodies!

1365
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,233
Stay with me, Sid Stay with me

1366
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,466
You really should've listened to Dewey

1367
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:06,300
He nailed it in one!
Dude, look at the love interest!

1368
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,800
Are you fucking stupid?

1369
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,933
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister

1370
01:38:12,566 --> 01:38:14,266
She's not here

1371
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:19,400
What the fuck do you mean, she's not here?

1372
01:38:19,466 --> 01:38:20,900
She's not here!

1373
01:38:20,966 --> 01:38:22,400
I untied her

1374
01:38:24,133 --> 01:38:26,433
Guess you're not
as persuasive as you thought

1375
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:33,600
That's for you

1376
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:38,000
Yeah, like your gimpy little sister's
gonna make a difference

1377
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,300
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point

1378
01:38:40,366 --> 01:38:43,366
Amber! Fan out
She couldn't have gotten far

1379
01:38:43,466 --> 01:38:44,466
I can't find her!

1380
01:38:51,566 --> 01:38:52,933
Amber?

1381
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,833
Sam! Where you going?
Your big scene's coming up!

1382
01:39:27,466 --> 01:39:28,700
Fucking kill you!

1383
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:33,466
The fucking hand sanitizer?

1384
01:39:39,733 --> 01:39:42,500
No, no, no, it's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

1385
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:44,400
Let me guess, the movies made you do it?

1386
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,033
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized

1387
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,300
- By movie fans?
- Yes, they're so mad!

1388
01:39:49,366 --> 01:39:51,042
Please, it's not my fault
I'm just a dumb kid

1389
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:52,566
I wanted to be a part of something

1390
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:55,833
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

1391
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,966
Yeah, and he died like a pussy

1392
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,300
That's the thing about slashers, Sam

1393
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,466
So many blood trails

1394
01:40:17,566 --> 01:40:18,933
This one yours?

1395
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,700
Only one way to find out!

1396
01:40:28,366 --> 01:40:31,200
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too

1397
01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:33,366
I can't believe I get to do you both

1398
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,100
No last-minute saves this time
Your story's over!

1399
01:40:43,766 --> 01:40:45,533
Time to pass the torch

1400
01:40:46,266 --> 01:40:47,766
It's all yours, bitch!

1401
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,300
- You want to do the honors?
- This one's yours

1402
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,100
No, stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry about Dewey

1403
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:03,366
Fuck you

1404
01:41:17,566 --> 01:41:19,066
Enjoy that torch

1405
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:37,800
Stop...

1406
01:41:37,866 --> 01:41:39,133
fucking up...

1407
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,966
my ending!

1408
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:48,266
Sam?

1409
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:51,300
Sam!

1410
01:42:00,433 --> 01:42:01,633
Okay

1411
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,633
What are you gonna do now, huh?

1412
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,333
Make a scary phone call to me?

1413
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:16,200
Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

1414
01:42:16,966 --> 01:42:17,966
No

1415
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,500
Because you're the villain!

1416
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,466
And the villain dies at the end

1417
01:42:24,533 --> 01:42:26,166
Those are the rules

1418
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,000
I'm introducing a new rule

1419
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,366
And what would that be? Huh?

1420
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,833
Well?

1421
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,200
Never fuck
with the daughter of a serial killer

1422
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:10,933
What about... my ending?

1423
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,700
Here it comes

1424
01:43:55,066 --> 01:43:56,966
Careful, they always come back

1425
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,333
Okay, then

1426
01:44:18,233 --> 01:44:20,033
I still prefer The Babadook

1427
01:44:33,966 --> 01:44:35,033
Are you okay?

1428
01:44:35,133 --> 01:44:36,333
Are you good?

1429
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,600
I'm so sorry

1430
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Excuse me

1431
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:51,700
Excuse me, sir

1432
01:44:54,266 --> 01:44:56,500
-Hey
-Hey

1433
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,833
She's gonna be okay

1434
01:45:10,466 --> 01:45:12,866
Can you take us
to a different hospital this time?

1435
01:45:12,966 --> 01:45:14,000
Of course

1436
01:45:17,066 --> 01:45:18,200
You ready to go?

1437
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:25,100
I'll be right back, yeah?

1438
01:45:31,866 --> 01:45:33,066
Your vitals look good

1439
01:45:34,166 --> 01:45:36,166
You sit tight for a draft, okay?

1440
01:45:36,233 --> 01:45:38,333
Sidney Gale

1441
01:45:41,233 --> 01:45:42,400
Thank you both

1442
01:45:43,433 --> 01:45:44,433
For everything

1443
01:45:46,366 --> 01:45:47,766
Are you gonna be all right?

1444
01:45:48,933 --> 01:45:51,400
I'll survive I always do

1445
01:45:52,266 --> 01:45:53,333
You were right...

1446
01:45:54,033 --> 01:45:55,533
about not running

1447
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:57,566
Sorry about that

1448
01:45:59,666 --> 01:46:00,666
How are you doing?

1449
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:04,066
Ask me in a few days

1450
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,100
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about

1451
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,666
What's that?

1452
01:46:10,733 --> 01:46:11,733
Not this

1453
01:46:12,266 --> 01:46:14,133
Those fuckers can die in anonymity

1454
01:46:15,266 --> 01:46:18,800
But maybe something about a good man
who used to be the sheriff here once

1455
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,066
I'd like to read that story

1456
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,433
Can I ask you a weird question?

1457
01:46:26,266 --> 01:46:27,500
Yeah

1458
01:46:29,033 --> 01:46:30,400
Am I gonna be okay?

1459
01:46:32,933 --> 01:46:33,933
Eventually

1460
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,433
Hey

1461
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,066
Wait Sam, Sam!

1462
01:47:02,066 --> 01:47:03,066
Thank you

1463
01:47:05,966 --> 01:47:07,866
Well, you're not going anywhere
without me

1464
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:10,500
Don't worry

1465
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,000
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there

1466
01:47:17,066 --> 01:47:19,100
I can take care of her and her sister

1467
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:20,766
She's all ready for transportation

1468
01:47:30,566 --> 01:47:34,966
25 years ago, almost to the day,
in this very house

1469
01:47:35,033 --> 01:47:36,800
a tragic story ended

1470
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:40,133
Tonight, a new chapter came to a close

1471
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,466
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

1472
01:47:42,533 --> 01:47:44,200
as they are still collecting evidence

1473
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:47,466
As you can see,
this is a very active crime scene

1474
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:50,033
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

1475
01:47:50,133 --> 01:47:53,633
some people being taken off
by ambulance right now as we speak

1476
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,200
This is a developing story...

1476
01:47:56,305 --> 01:48:56,882
