00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:31,374
<i>In a five-year period, 19,000
bank robberies were reported to the FBI.</i>

4
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>So, that means there were
19,000 bank robbers</i>

5
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:38,841
<i>who didn't do
their job correctly.</i>

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>Who wants the FBI on their ass?</i>

7
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:48,675
<i>Nah, man. I say, if you gonna rob a
bank, make sure it ain't reported.</i>

8
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,407
<i>Funny thing about
safe deposit boxes...</i>

9
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,107
<i>ain't nothing safe about them.</i>

10
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,508
<i>None of the shit
in the boxes is insured.</i>

11
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,508
<i>Try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government,</i>

12
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,408
<i>you'll get the middle finger
in fine print.</i>

13
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:29,140
<i>So who would use
a safe deposit box?</i>

14
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,040
<i>Stupid people.</i>

15
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:33,741
<i>And criminals.</i>

16
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,542
<i>Now, I ain't got no problem
with stupid people,</i>

17
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,608
<i>as long as their stupidity
don't hurt nobody.</i>

18
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,542
<i>The owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad</i>

19
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,774
<i>who hides his income so he
doesn't have to pay child support.</i>

20
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,874
<i>How you gonna do that
to your own kid?</i>

21
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:55,807
<i>Let me be clear. I never steal
from people who don't deserve it.</i>

22
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:01,274
<i>And what I steal, always goes
back to those who've been harmed.</i>

23
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,641
<i>That handsome black man?
Yeah, that's me. Ringo.</i>

24
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:09,508
<i>Yeah, Ringo, like the Beatle.</i>

25
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:12,475
<i>And don't start with that
John, Paul, George shit,</i>

26
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,607
<i>'cause I ain't got time
to get into it.</i>

27
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:18,207
<i>What you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise.</i>

28
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,707
<i>I'm a black chameleon, baby.</i>

29
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,741
<i>And I'm empty-handed.</i>

30
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,707
<i>'Cause when those a-holes
discover their boxes are empty,</i>

31
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,441
<i>they'll get pissed.</i>

32
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:39,441
<i>They'll yell
at the bank manager,</i>

33
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:42,607
<i>the bank manager might even let
him see the security footage,</i>

34
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:49,475
<i>but he will also explain what I already
told you... That shit ain't insured.</i>

35
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:54,040
<i>One thing they will not do
is report it to the FBI,</i>

36
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,741
<i>'cause roaches hide
from the light.</i>

37
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:08,040
<i>And in about six months, I'll empty
my safe deposit box and close my account.</i>

38
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:15,542
<i>And I will write
a few wrongs, anonymously.</i>

39
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,707
Oh my God, David,
pack your things!

40
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:24,441
<i>Turns out I'm not the only
one who feels good about doing good.</i>

41
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,408
<i>That little dude,
his name is Wick.</i>

42
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,207
<i>As a kid he heard
some Chinese story</i>

43
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,774
<i>about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits.</i>

44
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:40,240
<i>There's two things you need
to know about Wick.</i>

45
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,173
<i>First off...</i>

46
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,173
<i>He don't give up.</i>

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,508
<i>And eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up.</i>

48
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,040
<i>Dude made a mint in Vegas when
they decided to remodel the whole city.</i>

49
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:00,475
<i>Second, he's still the same
kid I first told you about.</i>

50
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:06,341
<i>He's still goofy as hell, still has the
same haircut, still looks like he's 12...</i>

51
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:10,507
<i>and he still believes firecrackers
can chase away evil spirits.</i>

52
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,908
<i>This was a drug
manufacturing plant.</i>

53
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,874
<i>Wick made sure no drugs would
ever come out of here again.</i>

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,574
<i>Now I wasn't there,</i>

55
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,341
<i>but I think it went a little
something like this.</i>

56
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,874
<i>That there is Violet.</i>

57
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:56,275
<i>Right now she in a church in
some shitty Eastern Euro country.</i>

58
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:02,308
<i>She just recently freed a bunch of
young girls from a sex trafficking ring.</i>

59
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,073
<i>And those are some
shitty Eastern Euro thugs</i>

60
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,674
<i>who are about to join a long list of men
who underestimated Violet's girl power.</i>

61
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,275
<i>Yo, it was like some
Matrix-style shit.</i>

62
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:41,341
<i>Now I ain't saying she
defied gravity or anything,</i>

63
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:44,375
<i>'cause I wasn't there.</i>

64
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,607
<i>But I do know only one person
walked out of there that day.</i>

65
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,174
<i>About a year ago,
we didn't know each other.</i>

66
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,141
<i>That all changed with a bouquet
of flowers. Three bouquets.</i>

67
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:06,040
<i>Seemed our good deeds landed on
the radar of some philanthropist.</i>

68
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,941
<i>It was an offer
to step up our game.</i>

69
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:14,275
<i>Why take down a street hustler when you
can go after international corruption.</i>

70
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,541
<i>We became a team. We tried
to come up with a cool name.</i>

71
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:20,040
<i>The Robin Hoods.</i>

72
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,374
<i>Nah, I ain't going for any
name calling us no damn hoods.</i>

73
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:28,841
<i>Wick even suggested the Motley
Crew, with a straight face.</i>

74
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,541
<i>Hell nah. But I like
the Misfits.</i>

75
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:36,174
<i>Not everyone agreed
on the name, but eff that.</i>

76
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:40,108
<i>I'm telling the story,
So the Misfits it is.</i>

77
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:48,941
<i>Anyway, the next chapter in our
story started a little while ago</i>

78
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,073
<i>in a prison in Los Angeles.</i>

79
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:01,641
<i>The FBI is here to extradite
inmate 272523 to Mr. Schultz's prison.</i>

80
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,407
- Where?
- England.

81
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,008
Mr. Schultz runs
a privatized prison there,

82
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:08,308
this particular inmate,
Richard Pace, broke out.

83
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:11,440
And you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape?

84
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,374
Wife issues.

85
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,275
<i>Wife issues is Latin
for this prisoner</i>

86
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,440
<i>was laying pipe
to Schultz's wife.</i>

87
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,474
<i>And for Schultz...
that caused some issues.</i>

88
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,440
Wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation.

89
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,741
Mr. Schultz isn't a warden.

90
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,774
No, he's a senior partner
in a multinational company

91
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:34,507
which happens to own, among other
things, prisons all over the planet.

92
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:38,340
Coming up on the right here.
440, open 312.

93
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,208
<i>Copy 21, opening now.</i>

94
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,908
<i>Name's Richard Pace...
you should know.</i>

95
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,275
Come back 440?

96
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,841
<i>Well, we just got
paperwork for his immediate release.</i>

97
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,108
<i>The judge apparently
threw out the charges.</i>

98
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,340
That's not Richard Pace.

99
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,041
He is good, though.

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,340
This is Pace this morning from the
prison exercise yard. Look at this.

101
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,941
There. Right there.

102
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,974
Look. I'm just spitballing here,
but I think that was a drone.

103
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,340
All right, if that's the drone,
what's the payload?

104
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,507
Could have been key-cards, it could've
been a birthday cake with a hacksaw in it.

105
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,641
All we know is that we've searched
this installation from top to bottom.

106
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:26,240
Richard Pace isn't here.

107
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:29,474
I don't get it. If he was going
to be released in 24 hours,

108
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,407
why break out?

109
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,807
Probably because there was
something he needed to do today...

110
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,541
not tomorrow.

111
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,707
You are...

112
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,174
- Hanni.
- Hanni.

113
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:45,707
Hanni Abu Assad.

114
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:47,407
Right.

115
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,240
So...

116
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,108
where's Pace?

117
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,141
How would I know?

118
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,374
Well, you bunked with him
for three months.

119
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,741
It seems that he did
that intentionally

120
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:05,674
because you had something
to tell him, something...

121
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,374
valuable to tell him.

122
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,641
I don't know.

123
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,607
Right.

124
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,374
Well, maybe...

125
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:31,641
you will feel better...
talking to me in... private.

126
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,407
- Power went down.
- Damn it.

127
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:46,009
Now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon.

128
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,173
What's going on?

129
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,574
Look at that.

130
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,307
I know where Pace is.

131
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:02,674
Excuse me.

132
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,874
<i>Hell yeah,
he know where Pace was.</i>

133
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,374
<i>He just beat the info out of poor
Hanni with a damn cell phone.</i>

134
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:21,240
<i>Turns out,
Hanni used to be the valet</i>

135
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:23,407
<i>of Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani.</i>

136
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,240
<i>Pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit</i>

137
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,741
<i>like travel into Los Angeles
once a year</i>

138
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,407
<i>for a single day of shopping.</i>

139
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:40,307
- My usual.
- Next round on the house.

140
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:44,507
<i>He also never traveled without
his high-value collection of timepieces.</i>

141
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,173
<i>That's expensive-ass watches.</i>

142
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,374
Girard-Joseph Grand Ellava.

143
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:58,707
Gold, platinum, 23 carats,
D color, flawless diamonds.

144
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,807
One of only two ever made.

145
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,274
Whoo.

146
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,307
Richard Pace.

147
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:14,073
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

148
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:19,107
You're Kuwaiti, huh?

149
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:23,574
I have a daughter who works
in the Middle East, UNICEF.

150
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:30,741
Charitable work, children, refugees and...
something like that.

151
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,474
So, uh...

152
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,173
...how much does a watch
like that go for?

153
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:43,975
Four, five mill...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

154
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,507
- I do apolo... I'm so sorry.
- Really.

155
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:48,842
Please, please, please.
Just let me, there you go.

156
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,975
- It's fine.
- You got some right there.

157
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,474
Oops, I do apologize.

158
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,009
- If you don't mind.
- Yes, okay.

159
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,440
My fault, I've had
too much to drink

160
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:02,274
it's just one of those days.
Okay. Time to go.

161
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:14,607
Hello.

162
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,340
Hello.

163
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:18,775
What you got there?

164
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,374
Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani?

165
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,240
It's an old picture.

166
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,140
Do you want to go
and talk about this?

167
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:32,474
Hmm, no, not really.

168
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,909
Yeah, he wants to go
and talk about it.

169
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,140
Jesus.

170
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,107
It's an honest living.

171
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,407
- Penthouse.
- Hold up.

172
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,274
You don't have any
jurisdiction or authority here.

173
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:10,541
You let the FBI
handle this.

174
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,407
You heard him.
Knock yourself out.

175
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,073
Here you go.

176
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,173
- Go to the bedroom.
- Copy that.

177
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm going to go wash up.

178
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,775
You go through the first door.
I'll go through the second.

179
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,541
My watches are gone!

180
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,574
How are we doing?

181
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,207
We had some company.

182
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,541
Almost there.

183
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,374
How we doing?

184
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,274
We are almost there. Yeah.

185
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,642
Clear.

186
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,107
- Hey!
- Hey!

187
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:21,708
- Gentlemen, I had a lovely stay.
- Your car is waiting for you.

188
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,775
Surprise!

189
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,474
Ah, thank you.

190
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:38,974
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you too, uh,

191
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:42,474
- Prince Al Zahrani?
- No, I made that up.

192
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:47,874
<i>This is the Prince. Not Prince
Al Zahrani. He made that shit up.</i>

193
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,240
<i>He claims to be a prince from some
country nobody's ever heard of.</i>

194
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,040
<i>But that don't matter.
What matters is...</i>

195
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:58,040
<i>remember the philanthropist who
sent the flowers? This is that dude.</i>

196
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,107
- Shall we?
- Let's roll. Like right now.

197
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,841
All right, bring the cars
around, let's go. Let's go.

198
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,307
Shit.

199
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:33,240
Thank you. These are mine.

200
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:37,675
So this is a con?

201
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,474
<i>Con seems pretty inadequate
to describe what we did.</i>

202
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:44,908
<i>We even hired the dude to
play Hanni as Pace's cellmate.</i>

203
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,240
<i>Yeah, we probably gon' have to
give that dude some worker's comp.</i>

204
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,941
Color me minorly
impressed, but why?

205
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:56,440
Simple. We need you, you don't need us.
For that, we needed leverage.

206
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:09,274
You know what they call a serious
crime captured on multiple hotel cameras?

207
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:15,140
Leverage. Now,
you need us. Simple.

208
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,707
- Who exactly is us?
- Me and my friends.

209
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,642
You don't have to come with us.

210
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:53,040
Up to you.

211
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,441
What are we waiting for?

212
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:23,307
What the hell did Pace do to
Schultz's wife that was so bad?

213
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:28,408
Let's just say Mrs. Schultz
isn't the one upset by it.

214
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,641
Oh. Oh...

215
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,807
Here's to my kidnapping. Whoo!

216
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:56,340
Kidnapping requires a element
of force, no force here.

217
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:58,107
You're free to go
whenever you want.

218
00:19:58,307 --> 00:19:59,874
There's an exit sign
right behind you.

219
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,508
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll
just pass on that one.

220
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,240
My man.

221
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,475
The name's Ringo.

222
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,841
That's Violet. That's my man
Wick over there.

223
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:14,073
You already had a chance to meet the
con artist formerly known as Prince.

224
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:19,107
- Is this some kind of criminal organization?
- Nah, not criminal at all.

225
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:20,741
Just a few people trying
to do what's right.

226
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:27,274
Well, you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what I do.

227
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,341
Oh, we know.
You got quite the reputation.

228
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:33,073
Yeah, the only thing that
you better at

229
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,375
than stealing
people's shit is getting caught.

230
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,908
And escaping.
You're a damn legend.

231
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,274
How many of Schultz's
prisons did he escape?

232
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,741
By my count, four, give or take.

233
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,774
Four prisons?
Built by the same guy?

234
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:51,508
I love it, man, we all love it.
But you know who don't love it?

235
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:52,841
- Schultz.
- Mm-mm.

236
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,308
He don't love it at all.

237
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:57,508
And that don't have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife.

238
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,008
Schultz didn't come to extradite
you back to his prison.

239
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,807
Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

240
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,375
Judging by your contributions to society thus
far, I can't say it was the wrong choice.

241
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,707
But we're giving you
a chance to turn things around.

242
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,574
Oh great, lucky me.

243
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:20,475
Look, all you have to know is we got
the same piece of shit on our shoes,

244
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:21,807
Werner Schultz.

245
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,941
<i>Shit doesn't even
start to explain.</i>

246
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,040
<i>He even owns prisons
in the Middle East.</i>

247
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,974
<i>Schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand,</i>

248
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,008
<i>so he partnered
with the Muslim Brotherhood.</i>

249
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:36,073
<i>The local terrorist organization
in some country called Jazeristan.</i>

250
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,574
Well, you know Schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones.

251
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:45,107
But terrorism? Well,
that's a bit of a stretch.

252
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:47,408
Yeah, you'd think
until Schultz realized

253
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,807
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

254
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,375
Yeah. A hard-partying Arab
by the name of Jason Quick.

255
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,173
<i>They got him
for everything.</i>

256
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:59,341
<i>Drugs, possession,
weapon solicitation you name it.</i>

257
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,107
I am back, bitches!

258
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,173
<i>Schultz just up
and let him go.</i>

259
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:12,173
Turns out that Jason Quick is actually
Jasim bin something or something.

260
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,408
One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood's son.

261
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:18,008
And when Schultz released him,
it granted him favor with this man.

262
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:23,073
Abu Hirawa.
Real name is Am-jam...

263
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:27,008
What he had to say.

264
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:30,441
For all intents and purposes,
Bin Laden's successor.

265
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:35,707
So... ...Schultz
is in bed with this guy.

266
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:40,841
In bed, under the covers with some KY
Jelly doing all kinds of freaky shit.

267
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,140
- Why are you telling me?
- 'Cause you're a thief.

268
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,641
Let me stop you right there.
Yes, I'm a thief...

269
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:53,173
but I only steal from upstanding
citizens who pay insurance.

270
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:55,974
Nobody gets hurt.
Particularly me.

271
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,341
Besides... I only work alone.

272
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:05,607
And if that changes, and it won't...
none of you will make the cut.

273
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,507
There's millions of dollars worth
of gold in one of those locations.

274
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,440
I like gold.

275
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,941
Terrorism generates
a lot of cash, kidnappings,

276
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:28,008
drugs, oil, theft,
but it's all dirty.

277
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,874
It's traceable. In order
to launder the money...

278
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:33,607
- Gold.
- Oh yeah. Gold.

279
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:37,440
Hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in,

280
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,208
unless they're forced to.

281
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:48,275
A prison?

282
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,107
Oh, not just any old prison.
Your boy Schultz's prison.

283
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:54,107
We're goin' in.
You want to join us?

284
00:23:56,607 --> 00:24:00,308
You want me to go
into a Middle Eastern country,

285
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,141
one that you've been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time,

286
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:07,141
that is filled with terrorists,
to steal their gold.

287
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,841
- Yeah.
- That's exactly what we want you to do.

288
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:13,474
In other words, something good,
for once.

289
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,941
Oh, that's rich. That's rich.

290
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:28,308
Let me see...
...how do I put this, I got it.

291
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:29,941
Nope.

292
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:31,974
And if it makes
you feel any better,

293
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,241
I'm pretty sure every
one of you is insane.

294
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,440
Especially this dude
sitting over here.

295
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:41,707
Excuse me. We on descent.
Please fasten your seatbelts. Thanks.

296
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,275
You know, I guess I should
have asked this sooner,

297
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,208
descent to where?

298
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:52,074
To Abu Dhabi.

299
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,507
Abu Dhabi.

300
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:00,874
Hey man, Schultz's new besties,

301
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:05,108
the dudes in the grey suits,
Muslim Brotherhood.

302
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:07,807
They'll try to kill
you again, you know.

303
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,340
You change your mind,
there's a card in your left breast pocket.

304
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:16,208
- Call us.
- Arrivederci.

305
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,274
My, my, would you look at this?

306
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,641
Taxi?

307
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:36,641
Whoa.

308
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,407
Let's roll.

309
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:56,941
Why don't you take me to the best
five star hotel in... Abu Dhabi?

310
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:01,274
- I know just the place.
- Good man.

311
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:05,174
- First time here?
- Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is.

312
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:06,541
- You know what?
- What?

313
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:09,574
- I think I'm gonna like it here.
- Yeah, you will.

314
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:24,173
Hey there. Give us your best
single malt whiskey. Two ice cubes.

315
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,141
It's a good-looking watch.

316
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:34,407
Leon LaFleur Magnifique. 769
working parts,

317
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:39,641
each one created by a single craftsman
at an atelier in Switzerland.

318
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:43,909
I believe, only four of them
ever made in the world.

319
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,741
Huh. Impressive.

320
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,607
Wonder how this
wallet got down here?

321
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:54,009
Sorry.
Huh. Your wallet.

322
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,574
No, it's not.

323
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,407
And I rather drink alone.
I actually insist on it.

324
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:02,440
Okay, fair play.

325
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:08,707
All right. <i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
Good luck to yourself.

326
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,274
Sorry.

327
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,507
Hi, gin and tonic, please.

328
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,240
I don't believe it.

329
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:39,942
Oh, excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

330
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:43,942
Oh, thank you so much.
What a pleasure meeting you.

331
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,240
- Yes, you too.
- Where are you from?

332
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,507
- I'm from the states. Um, I travel...
- Ma'am.

333
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,307
I believe you
dropped your pocketbook.

334
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:53,674
Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

335
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:56,240
- I literally just picked that up in the gift shop.
- I bet you did.

336
00:28:56,374 --> 00:29:00,875
But you know, you must be more careful the
world is rife with thieves and cutpurses.

337
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,073
Don't I know it. Which is why I
bought the cheapest one I could...

338
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:07,741
and keep my real one...
close to me heart.

339
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,474
Is there anything else you
keep close to your heart?

340
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:15,340
Let me see, um...
the trials of the poor,

341
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,107
the downtrodden, tribulations
of the world's oppressed.

342
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:21,942
Otherwise, no, not a thing.

343
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,707
Sounds like a lonely existence.

344
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,674
No, actually,
it's quite fulfilling and lacks little.

345
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,140
Sometimes...

346
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:33,040
things are missing in our lives
and we don't even know it.

347
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,009
Things tend to stay missing if
you don't actually look for them.

348
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:41,040
If you don't mind,
the lady and I were having a conversation.

349
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:42,474
Really now, that's very funny

350
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,842
because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

351
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,474
In fact, if I recall,
you insisted.

352
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:52,541
Go. Find your own.
This one is mine.

353
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,107
- Huh! What did you say?
- She's my new friend.

354
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:58,875
Really?

355
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:03,541
That's very interesting because actually...
she's my daughter.

356
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:07,040
And I don't know you, friend.

357
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:15,875
The gentleman, he had
to run away there,

358
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:19,607
but he said for his drinks,
our drinks on his room. Thank you so much.

359
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:24,875
That was a very
swift move back there.

360
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:27,474
Yeah. Well, I had
quite the teacher.

361
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:33,374
It's good to see you, Hope.
It really is.

362
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,107
You too, Dad.

363
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:38,574
So, how'd you end up
in Abu Dhabi?

364
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,173
Same way I ended up in prison.
Against my will.

365
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:44,607
And you?

366
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,574
I'm... I'm here to meet
some philanthropist.

367
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:51,140
We're talking through new,
innovative ways to help the refugee crisis.

368
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,742
- That's good. Impressive.
- Yeah, it is.

369
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:57,073
And when I was in the hotel lobby,
I saw another crisis developing.

370
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,407
- Well, old habits.
- Yeah.

371
00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:04,374
Hey, listen.

372
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:10,073
- Let's go for a walk, shall we? It's been a while.
- Yeah, okay.

373
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,607
Maybe on second thoughts...

374
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,842
- Very nice.
- Pay the bill here...

375
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,708
Here you go.
Keep the change.

376
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:29,307
Have you seen your mother?

377
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,073
She's my mom, so, yeah.

378
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:36,307
- How is she?
- Yeah, she's fine.

379
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,675
- Re-married.
- Hmm.

380
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,140
- Took her a long time, but she got over it.
- That's good.

381
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Yeah.

382
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,875
That's really good.

383
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,675
How about you, how're you doing?
You... married yet?

384
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:53,607
No, I'm not married.
I, uh...

385
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,607
I have trouble trusting men.

386
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,574
Daddy issues.

387
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:04,574
Look, Hope, I know this
sounds like a cliche,

388
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:07,974
but I did it for you and it was
the right thing to do at the time.

389
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:10,374
Why? Because you're
just so wrong?

390
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:15,240
Yeah.

391
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:16,541
It was.

392
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,207
You know what the sad thing, I mean the
real tragedy of this whole thing is?

393
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,675
You actually believe that.

394
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,240
But I know deep down,
under all that

395
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:29,541
urbane panache and capricious
thievery, you're good.

396
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,608
Just gotta find that person.

397
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,173
Yeah, well that's
easier said than done.

398
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,440
Perhaps, I could steal him.

399
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:56,575
I have to go. I'm sorry.
I have to go prepare for this meeting.

400
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,642
Okay.

401
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:02,173
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad.

402
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:04,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

403
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:35,874
Okay. I'm in.

404
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,841
But if I do this,
and this comes off,

405
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,841
it's because of what
I bring to the table.

406
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,608
I'm in charge.
What I say goes, no exceptions.

407
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,674
- We can live with that.
- It's why we picked you.

408
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:56,140
And the split? Tch. Not even,
not five ways. 50/50 boom, boom.

409
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,542
- Split of what?
- The money. The gold.

410
00:36:01,908 --> 00:36:04,741
- There won't be any.
- What do you mean there won't be any,

411
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:07,575
I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

412
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:11,441
It is. But that doesn't mean
they'll be any gold to split.

413
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,107
- Well, why the hell not?
- Because it's not about us.

414
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:16,575
It's about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism.

415
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:21,441
Right, I get that. Steal
their gold, stop the terrorists.

416
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,040
To the victor goes the spoils.

417
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
There are no victors, Pace.

418
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,807
We're never going to be able
to stop the Muslim Brotherhood,

419
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,641
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off.

420
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:35,173
We do what we do to help
others, never ourselves.

421
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,475
Oh my God,
here we go again.

422
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:45,707
If this weren't so amusing...
it would be sad.

423
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:49,140
Ciao.

424
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:54,542
Pace.

425
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:59,408
Pace. Pace!

426
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:03,240
Look, I'm not sure how you
got hold of your information

427
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:07,841
or who told you I might even have any
interest in this act of compassion,

428
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,741
- but they were wrong.
- I did.

429
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,841
I told them.

430
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:19,307
I told you had a meeting about the
refugee crisis. This is that meaning.

431
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,741
Oh, for God's sake.

432
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:25,508
- Don't tell me they brought you in, too.
- No, I pulled them.

433
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:27,908
This is my idea.

434
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,974
Hope, listen to me,
if any of this is true,

435
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:33,741
contact the embassy,
talk to a congressman.

436
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:34,908
We tried.

437
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,173
Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

438
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,641
U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

439
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:44,008
in the Middle East. America doesn't
need to ask too many questions,

440
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:47,140
and Jazeristan doesn't
need to find any answers.

441
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:51,073
Do they know about this?

442
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,674
They know, but they
don't know, you know?

443
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:01,408
Come on, darling,
what am I gonna do here?

444
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,574
This. I want you to do this.

445
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:11,107
Look, Dad,
we need you.

446
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:14,574
I need you.

447
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:20,207
Just this once, I'm asking
you not to walk out the door.

448
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,974
I must need my head examined.

449
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,974
Yeah, I feel like I should mention
something about Abu Hirawa.

450
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,707
I mean it's kind of his gold
we're after.

451
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:38,375
In Arabic,
Hirawa means cane.

452
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,375
And that was this gardener.

453
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,073
Oh well.
That's good to know.

454
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:10,874
Prison. Hard to get into,
even harder to get out of.

455
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,741
Especially with
a truckload of gold.

456
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,908
First question.
Where's the gold?

457
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:19,140
We got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land,

458
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,574
but we still don't know
where the vault is.

459
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,674
Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

460
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:24,607
Yeah, we have. Come, I show you.

461
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:28,774
Facility is state-of-the-art,
one of the most modern prisons on Earth.

462
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:31,941
And it's completely self-contained...
food, water, everything.

463
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,574
Wait. Go back.

464
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:38,341
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

465
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,641
If the prison's self-sustained,

466
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,275
I would expect there's a fully
functioning laundry on the inside.

467
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,774
Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

468
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:49,741
That's the steam in the photo.

469
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,474
Mm. Right, but it doesn't,
does it, really?

470
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,574
Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty,

471
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:58,140
I'm pretty sure...
that's a laundry truck.

472
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,974
Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

473
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,674
an actual industrial laundry.

474
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,707
Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

475
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:08,607
And built a vault instead.

476
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,208
Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

477
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,407
- Right under the shitter.
- Let's go to prison, shall we?

478
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:19,807
Oh, and by the way,
I only fly first class.

479
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:22,375
- Me too!
- Oh-ho, congratulations.

480
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,208
Next time we'll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

481
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,707
Mm-hm. What do you
mean, next time?

482
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,941
This entire region
is on high alert.

483
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:32,874
A group like this, landing at the
airport will attract attention.

484
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
point remains the same.

485
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:37,275
Trains, planes, automobiles.

486
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:41,107
I'm flexible...
as long as it's first class.

487
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:47,641
Hmm?

488
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,275
Why isn't anyone
saying anything?

489
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,275
Please, tell me you're joking!

490
00:40:57,407 --> 00:41:01,008
We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

491
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:03,141
Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

492
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,108
- Which one is Muhammad?
- All of them.

493
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,040
- Oh.
- My Muhammad.

494
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,707
There's about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of Jazeristan.

495
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:12,874
Well..

496
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,141
this prison isn't going
to rob itself. Let's go.

497
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,541
- By the way, you look great.
- Thank you. Don't be cheeky.

498
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:22,741
Which camel's mine. Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

499
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:38,374
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

500
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,774
Believe me, I'm not so nice.

501
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:44,108
They didn't ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition.

502
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:46,507
So it's not because
you couldn't find a date.

503
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:51,474
No, I'm very good
at finding dates.

504
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,607
Even better at losing them.

505
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:56,974
You might want to change
your line of work.

506
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,275
- Could increase your odds.
- Says the thief.

507
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:05,541
No, I decided a long time ago

508
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,340
that if I can't be good
to someone,

509
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,074
I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

510
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:13,174
Good philosophy.

511
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:36,674
You know...

512
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,574
They say that people
on their deathbeds...

513
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:44,641
never regret
the things they did,

514
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:48,374
just... the things
they didn't do.

515
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:52,407
This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

516
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,741
We're going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

517
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,074
If there's some
kind of connection, well...

518
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,807
It would be a shame
if we die

519
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,141
without
really saying our feelings.

520
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:10,240
Did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die?

521
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:14,340
Nope. Never crossed my mind.

522
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,108
It's not you, Pace,

523
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,707
from an empirical point of view,

524
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:22,741
you are a very attractive man.

525
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:27,607
You see I don't... date men.

526
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,108
I kill them.

527
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,340
One can only try.

528
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:16,541
- Hey.
- Hey.

529
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,507
You okay?

530
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:26,507
Yeah, I'm fine.

531
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,607
- Just a little scared.
- Yeah.

532
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,707
Well, it certainly
will have its risks.

533
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:39,574
Uh, I don't mean the prison.

534
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:43,207
Dad, you're doing this
for the right reasons, right?

535
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:48,607
I mean... you're not going to do
like you always do and...

536
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:50,641
disappear in the final frame?

537
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:54,741
Do you mean...

538
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,641
- The gold?
- No.

539
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:05,041
I mean... disappear without me.

540
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,674
Oh, Hope...

541
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:16,240
I really would like to promise
you that, I really would.

542
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:23,407
There's a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

543
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:28,340
"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

544
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,240
Same goes for you.

545
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:36,307
Hold steady.

546
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,474
Hold steady.

547
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:59,040
Get some rest.
It's a big day tomorrow.

548
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,975
- We'll be fine here.
- Why can't I stay with my dad?

549
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:33,641
It's too risky. We don't want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone.

550
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:37,808
- That's comforting.
- Really?

551
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,307
No. It was a joke.

552
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,909
Hm.

553
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,107
Well, we usually don't
like to work with people

554
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,842
who have families
and loved ones.

555
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:50,107
Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

556
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:56,909
What are you doing?

557
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:59,207
You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.

558
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:09,173
All right.

559
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:12,407
What do you want to do?

560
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:15,507
Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

561
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,875
I don't drink or take drugs.

562
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,875
Really? Maybe you should start.

563
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,909
Just a little something
to take the edge off.

564
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:23,974
If you want,
I could go score some.

565
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,140
Absolutely not,
that's dangerous.

566
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:27,574
I was joking.

567
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:30,775
God, you really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

568
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:32,207
Don't really have time for it.

569
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,607
Not much about what I do
is very funny.

570
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:39,708
Me neither.

571
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:49,607
You know what? Let's focus on
what we love about our work.

572
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,274
Okay. I like to beat people up.

573
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:56,541
Okay, cool. Yeah.

574
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:02,842
Well, let's say I am a guy
and I'm coming at you.

575
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,607
- A dumb guy.
- Right. Okay.

576
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,708
But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So,

577
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,507
you gotta take me down in one move.
What's your go-to?

578
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:11,140
- One shot?
- Yeah, that's it.

579
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:13,008
Easy. Punch to the throat.

580
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:14,440
- Not the jewels?
- No.

581
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,407
Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

582
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:20,307
What may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure,

583
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,474
but a solid punch
the Adam's apple.

584
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,541
Down in a oner.

585
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:26,808
- Cool.
- Hmm!

586
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,675
You must have one badass dad.

587
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,274
Never knew him.

588
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:35,607
I'm sorry.

589
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,374
Yeah, well, me too.

590
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:44,541
Well, I for one,
would like to thank him.

591
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:47,541
If he hadn't abandoned you
and made you hate men so much,

592
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:49,274
you wouldn't taken up my fight.

593
00:48:52,008 --> 00:48:53,474
That's one way to look at it.

594
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,340
You're lucky to have
a dad like yours.

595
00:48:56,742 --> 00:48:58,073
He loves you a lot.

596
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,340
Yeah, I guess so.

597
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,207
Still an asshole though.

598
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,574
Yeah, he is.

599
00:49:09,675 --> 00:49:10,742
Here.

600
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,541
- I thought you didn't drink.
- I don't.

601
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:19,374
Let's cheers to dads.
The good... and the bad.

602
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:30,941
All right, ladies
and gentlemen pucker up.

603
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,574
Time to move, Ringo,
don't lose interest.

604
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:37,874
Up you get. Gather round,
ladies and gentlemen.

605
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,742
Okay, take a seat.

606
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:44,008
The problem with gold is,
well, it's heavy.

607
00:49:44,173 --> 00:49:45,340
So we're gonna need a vehicle

608
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,008
that can handle
that kind of weight.

609
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:48,073
On it.

610
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:49,742
And to get it out
of the country,

611
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:51,642
camels aren't gonna cut it.

612
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,742
So, we're going to need
some kind of transport.

613
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:55,841
- I can.
- You can what?

614
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,340
Some kind of transport,
my country can provide it.

615
00:49:58,507 --> 00:50:00,742
Princey-poo claims
that he's royalty

616
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,207
in a "country" in the Gulf.

617
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,708
I thought you said
you weren't a prince.

618
00:50:03,908 --> 00:50:07,874
I said I wasn't that prince
but I'm a prince in my country.

619
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:10,941
What country?
You ain't got no country.

620
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,107
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Ringo.

621
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:16,173
By the way,
just off the topic here.

622
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,575
Is that your given name?

623
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:22,073
Yeah, given by me. In honor
of the greatest Beatle.

624
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,107
- Here we go again.
- What you mean here we go again?

625
00:50:24,173 --> 00:50:25,675
What, a black man
can't like the Beatles?

626
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,307
See, he's a true visionary
with his instrument.

627
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:31,340
You guys don't understand.
He was the first rock and roll drummer...

628
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:33,340
influenced every
rock drummer after him.

629
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,340
- Even the way that he held his sticks.
- Seriously?

630
00:50:37,274 --> 00:50:38,708
I don't joke about Ringo.

631
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:42,642
It's better just to accept it
and don't karaoke with him.

632
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,608
You suck, you suck!

633
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,542
<i>How you gonna say "Yellow
Submarine" ain't a real Beatles song?</i>

634
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:55,874
I'm just saying
he's an unappreciated singer.

635
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:58,908
I'm so glad I asked.
Ringo, we're gonna need a list

636
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:01,608
of all the outside
prison contractors.

637
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:02,508
No doubt.

638
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:05,173
And you certainly can't
be drilling or tumbling.

639
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:06,874
We're going to have
to blow the vault.

640
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:08,307
Hope, you've had experience

641
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,642
with phone boxes in
the Peace Corps, is that right?

642
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:12,307
- Yeah?
- I need that skill set.

643
00:51:12,575 --> 00:51:15,340
And anything else I taught you
at a very inappropriate age.

644
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,708
Violet, we need to find
out where Schultz is

645
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,874
when he isn't at the prison.
We need surveillance.

646
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:23,040
Already on it. And it looks like
you guys better grab your robes.

647
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:26,173
Schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes.

648
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:27,974
All right handsome, let's go.

649
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,807
That's what I'm talking about!

650
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,707
Welcome, sir.

651
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:50,642
There it is.
Watch that case.

652
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:57,073
- You see how heavy that was?
- Like a fat lady.

653
00:51:58,173 --> 00:52:00,107
Looks like Schultz
is making a withdrawal

654
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,475
for our friend Abu Hirawa.

655
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,774
<i>We have to stop him.</i>

656
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:07,707
I'm sorry, Hope,
you can't win them all.

657
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:11,974
We don't know who this guy is and by
now, he's just in the wind.

658
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:13,374
Jason Quick.

659
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,240
Jason Quick? He looks good.

660
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:20,741
He got the drugs out of his system
and he put the jihad back in.

661
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:22,207
That other guy in the photo,

662
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,542
it's the Vice President
of the Bank of Jazeristan.

663
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,107
He's trading
the gold for cash.

664
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:27,974
Yeah, and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

665
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:31,240
After that, Jason boards
an afternoon flight...

666
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,040
at which point
he will be "in the wind."

667
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:38,774
What you got there?
What are you reading?

668
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:43,173
- I picked these up at the souk.
- Okay.

669
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:46,575
- What?
- Nothing.

670
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,274
I gave your man gold,
it's not my fault he's a thief.

671
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:43,274
- Was.
- I'm sorry?

672
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:45,475
<i>Was a thief. Except that...</i>

673
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:48,841
- He wasn't.
- I'm sorry, I'm not following.

674
00:53:49,107 --> 00:53:52,841
On the journey from is to
was, all men tell the truth.

675
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:56,807
<i>A man's eyes cannot lie.
Not to me.</i>

676
00:53:57,173 --> 00:53:59,408
Especially when
I hold them in my hand.

677
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:01,040
If I thought it was you,

678
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:03,107
we would not be having
this conversation.

679
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,574
Ah, right, well...
that's that then.

680
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:09,508
If there's nothing else,
I've got a bit of company at the moment.

681
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:13,008
There is a very large
operation taking place in the near future,

682
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,874
<i>but you may leave
your briefcase at home.</i>

683
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:18,375
<i>You need something much
larger for this transaction.</i>

684
00:54:18,574 --> 00:54:21,607
Ah, right,
who's my contact this time?

685
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:24,107
- <i>Me.</i>
- You? Lovely.

686
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,674
- Three days.
- <i>All right, thanks.</i>

687
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,674
Oh shit.

688
00:54:32,908 --> 00:54:34,073
Agreed.

689
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,941
Hirawa's coming
here to get his gold.

690
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:42,275
That's the bad news. The piss
in our punch bowl bad news...

691
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,008
is this guy.

692
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:46,408
Khairat Reda is
a London-based banker.

693
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:49,541
Top brass of the Brotherhood and
he arrives here in three days.

694
00:54:49,774 --> 00:54:52,507
Hirawa is the finger puppet.
And this man is the hand.

695
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:54,941
So we accelerate the schedule.
Hit the prison before they get there.

696
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,308
Uh-uh. We can't go into this thing
half-cocked. We're not ready.

697
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:02,441
I'm ready. Are you ready?

698
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:06,207
Huh! We are fully cock.

699
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:10,741
- Cocked, not cock.
- Yes, cock.

700
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,707
Yes, cock for you,
no cock for me.

701
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:15,741
I need a drink.

702
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:20,607
Okay, here we go.

703
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:24,107
The only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly

704
00:55:24,207 --> 00:55:27,241
is if the prison
isn't running smoothly.

705
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,674
Fortunately, we got a few guys
on the inside.

706
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,308
<i>And working in the place
where we have direct control</i>

707
00:55:33,607 --> 00:55:35,974
over the prisoners'
physical well-being.

708
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:38,474
Any health issue that
needs more than ten beds...

709
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:41,741
<i>Well...</i>

710
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:44,073
We gotta get them out, now!

711
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,408
Let's just say they're going
to need more than that.

712
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:58,140
- And we walk out the front door.
- Well, maybe not.

713
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,607
Let's play that one by ear,
shall we?

714
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,974
Abdullah, are you aware of how many
violations you have going on here?

715
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:09,008
No, we just passed
inspection a few months ago.

716
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:14,208
Now, I'm asking, where are you buying
all of your refrigeration equipment from?

717
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:16,908
- Pacific Industries. Yes.
- They're still in business?

718
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,674
Well, you need to get them
on the phone right away.

719
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:21,774
We can get some new steamers
down here, get you up to code.

720
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:25,474
You're with the ministry
of Public Health, Mr., uh...

721
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:29,008
- <i>Lionel L. Zagred?</i>
- <i>I am.</i>

722
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:32,140
I have a friend there. Maybe I should
call him so I can sort this out.

723
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:34,174
Are you aware of the GSO?

724
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:37,674
<i>The Gulf Standard Organization.</i>

725
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:40,941
They're responsible for all
of the food development

726
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,107
and standards going on
here in the Gulf region.

727
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:47,574
So you could only imagine how it'd
probably look if such a prized institution

728
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,107
were to fail an inspection.

729
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:53,073
Now, if you ask me personally,
Jazeristan shouldn't care

730
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:54,974
about the opinions
of other countries, right?

731
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,707
So if you want... you want
to call your friend,

732
00:56:56,807 --> 00:57:00,308
- you get him on the horn, call them, right away!
- They're not friends.

733
00:57:00,474 --> 00:57:02,941
It won't be me that will be
upsetting the royal family.

734
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,474
<i>It's my friend's cousin,
and I don't even know him.</i>

735
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:08,974
<i>Pacific Industrial?</i>

736
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,741
Would you happen to
have any of the...

737
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:13,774
Vanguard K2350.

738
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,474
Vanguard K2350 in stock, please?

739
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,674
You do? Great. I want two sent
as quickly as possible.

740
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:23,774
To the Dola Penal
Corrections Institute.

741
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,707
What do you mean you
don't have any at hand?

742
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:32,874
You just literally two seconds
ago told me you had five.

743
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,941
This is not good.

744
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:36,807
You do that!

745
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,474
- What did they say?
- It seems they don't have any, at hand.

746
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,108
But they can rush order them to
us and have them to us in a week.

747
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,275
Mm-Hmm!

748
00:57:47,974 --> 00:57:49,275
Answer that phone, Abdullah.

749
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:53,340
- Answer that.
- What if it's the royal family?

750
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:54,574
Answer the phone.

751
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:04,407
Hello, sir. This is Pacific
Industrial here.

752
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:08,374
I'd like to apologize for the
mix-up we had over here on our end.

753
00:58:08,674 --> 00:58:13,040
<i>We do in fact have
the 2350 in stock.</i>

754
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:15,941
<i>We had an unexpected
delivery cancellation.</i>

755
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:19,674
In fact, one of our men
is in the field as we speak.

756
00:58:20,374 --> 00:58:22,574
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay for you?

757
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,541
That would be fantastic.
I can't thank you enough for this.

758
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:31,275
That's very kind of you, sir,
much appreciated, good day now.

759
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:34,741
Cup of coffee?

760
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:18,574
All right. We go in
after lunch tomorrow.

761
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:21,974
Hey, Violet, couldn't have
found a small worker?

762
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,908
No, it just so happened that the biggest
lush at the company was also very large.

763
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,474
- Is this blood on here?
- Good luck.

764
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:30,807
Violet!

765
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:39,274
But I do need you to fill out a little
bit more information right here.

766
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,141
- But they haven't been cleared!
- Abdullah, focus!

767
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,674
- For your family.
- Oh yes, I'll get them cleared.

768
00:59:44,741 --> 00:59:47,274
- Sign. Sign. Right away.
- Please, yes, yes. Watch your step.

769
01:00:15,174 --> 01:00:16,774
Whoa, whoa.

770
01:00:17,009 --> 01:00:20,074
Dude, you have anger issues.

771
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,440
Started from childhood.
Come on.

772
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,541
That ought to do it, let's go
check on their progress.

773
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:31,841
No, they will handle it.
They will let us know.

774
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:34,240
I'm a soon-to-be captain,
you cannot keep treating me like this!

775
01:00:34,374 --> 01:00:35,507
Let's go check
on their progress.

776
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,173
Okay, Abdullah, you're
so angry, let's go.

777
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:48,474
Age before beauty.

778
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:52,340
All these new steamers,
this has worked out famously!

779
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,173
Abdullah, K2350.

780
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,841
They look the same.

781
01:01:00,374 --> 01:01:02,909
But how closely
have you examined?

782
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:05,041
- Not so much.
- Exactly.

783
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:10,407
See, same chassis?
Internal component entirely different.

784
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,274
No.

785
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:24,340
What are you doing?
You have to break-in first.

786
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,074
Right?

787
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:30,607
I mean... They are your steamers,
if you want to turn on,

788
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:33,009
you break, you buy,
you own the steamers!

789
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,140
No, no, I don't,
the royal family does.

790
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:38,607
- When can we use them?
- Eh... an hour or two.

791
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,707
Give the internal
component time to break in.

792
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:44,307
I love that you
listen to me now.

793
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,173
This is like we
build a relationship.

794
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:49,107
I feel like I must hug. I hug.

795
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,340
I'm... I'm sorry.

796
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,541
Part of my culture.
I'm... I'm European.

797
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:56,374
- You're European.
- Yes.

798
01:01:57,307 --> 01:02:00,474
- Finnish. From... from Finland.
- Oh.

799
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:04,641
We big on hugs. We are,
big hug. I love to hug.

800
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:08,975
Oh yes, yes, yes...

801
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,107
Oh yes, now I have one more
thing for you to do.

802
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:14,340
For you to sign and then
I'm out of your hair, I finish!

803
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:22,674
Okay.

804
01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:34,340
Wow.

805
01:02:42,274 --> 01:02:44,274
Seemed like a good idea
a few days ago.

806
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:46,774
This is going to take
a bloody miracle.

807
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,073
Indeed.

808
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:53,040
Let's go. We've got
a busy morning ahead.

809
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:09,607
Bon Appetit.

810
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:11,707
Born up a tree.

811
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:53,040
It's amazing the bacteria you can
find at a local university, huh?

812
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,340
They really should protect it
better, you know that.

813
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,674
I hope there's
no harmful side effects.

814
01:03:58,307 --> 01:03:59,775
Sure, there shouldn't be those.

815
01:04:09,942 --> 01:04:12,008
Get these people
to the infirmary immediately!

816
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,040
And for God sakes,
have someone clean this up. Now!

817
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,607
- Well?
- We're not sure, sir.

818
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:33,541
But a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing

819
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:37,675
some sign of poisoning,
acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

820
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,742
It could be
some sort of overdose.

821
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,274
So...

822
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:46,474
All this is just a little
bit of bad weed?

823
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,574
Should we, maybe,
call in the National Police?

824
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:52,842
Are you high?

825
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:57,374
Yes, sir... I mean no, sir.
That would be bad idea.

826
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:07,274
Check every flight, hotel,
and taxi company. Find Pace.

827
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:19,274
<i>Sick or ill prisoners</i>

828
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:22,073
<i>please report to the infirmary
immediately,</i>

829
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,207
<i>I repeat all sick
or ill prisoners.</i>

830
01:05:25,274 --> 01:05:28,207
<i>Please report to
the infirmary immediately.</i>

831
01:05:40,908 --> 01:05:42,140
Okay.

832
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,040
- Steady, hold it.
- What?

833
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:51,474
Oh come on, man,
it's not an autopsy.

834
01:06:10,173 --> 01:06:11,541
Let's go.

835
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,407
- My calculation... due south.
- By my calculation...

836
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:31,474
Yep.

837
01:06:49,575 --> 01:06:54,340
Hammed Al-Zagreb, Office
of Poison and Noxious Gases.

838
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:56,708
Mm.

839
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,742
Who said anything
about noxious gases?

840
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,008
Nobody, yet.

841
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:07,774
See I have to test every patient
and the source of contamination.

842
01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:11,774
Could be something
with simple explanation,

843
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,107
or something much,
much more serious.

844
01:07:15,474 --> 01:07:18,307
As I said, will not be
able to determine that

845
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:20,407
until I properly
assess the situation.

846
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:24,908
We're going to need
a Hazmat cleanup immediately.

847
01:07:25,073 --> 01:07:29,508
- I... I don't...
- Then, uh...

848
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:33,374
...you do not want it
to become international crisis.

849
01:07:33,774 --> 01:07:37,575
No, no, no, no, no we don't.
W... what did you say you need?

850
01:07:37,874 --> 01:07:41,040
- Hazmat.
- Hazmat, in Arabic, who died?

851
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,941
Not Arabic "hazmat."
Hazmat! Hazmat!

852
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,508
Ah, Hazmat. Okay, okay.

853
01:07:47,642 --> 01:07:50,407
I understand, yes, okay.
How many you want?

854
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:53,508
- You know what? I will handle.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

855
01:08:23,608 --> 01:08:24,642
You serious?

856
01:08:25,008 --> 01:08:27,608
With explosives?
I'm always serious.

857
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,240
How are we doing on time?

858
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,240
Running out of it.

859
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,340
How in the hell are we going to
get explosives down that tiny hole?

860
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:39,575
We're not.
We're building the Hindenburg.

861
01:08:46,374 --> 01:08:51,008
Hi. I have been looking for you.
I need to show you something

862
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:53,008
this way, it's extremely
important and dangerous.

863
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,475
<i>So, where to?</i>

864
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,707
The El Amadi hospital,
emergency protocol, sir.

865
01:08:58,608 --> 01:09:03,140
Right, so...
half of the prison population

866
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,908
are being taken
outside the prison?

867
01:09:06,107 --> 01:09:11,040
At least half, yes, but the hospital
has cleared open a wing for us.

868
01:09:11,475 --> 01:09:14,140
They'll be under 24-hour guard.
It's all under control, sir.

869
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,374
All right. Sounds like Pace.

870
01:09:22,073 --> 01:09:26,340
Come on Wick. <i>Allez, allez.</i>
Talk to me.

871
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,140
All right, that
should be enough.

872
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:32,741
- Good.
- Lighter.

873
01:09:35,974 --> 01:09:37,207
Time?

874
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:39,340
Five seconds.

875
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:41,542
- Four.
- In that case...

876
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,240
- Three, two, one. Come on.
- ...make Daddy proud.

877
01:09:44,641 --> 01:09:45,741
Whoa.

878
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:04,240
Are you crazy?

879
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:08,941
Yeah, according to authorities,
and all standardized tests.

880
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:12,774
- There was a car bomb, sir!
- Car bomb, my ass.

881
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:19,240
Whoop! Damn!

882
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:21,607
Wow!

883
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:28,140
- Pace.
- What?

884
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:30,707
Okay. Do your thing.

885
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:34,341
I got you.
I just get excited.

886
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,341
- Okay, take a picture.
- Looking great.

887
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:43,375
Come on.

888
01:10:43,441 --> 01:10:45,441
- Beautiful.
- Takes my breath away.

889
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:50,607
Smile.

890
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:53,107
That's a beautiful picture.

891
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,475
- Not ready?
- Hold on.

892
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,607
Come on, tick-tock, tick-tock.

893
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:08,707
- Show me the vault.
- One moment, sir.

894
01:11:13,475 --> 01:11:17,173
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Got it!

895
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:19,073
There, sir.

896
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:26,508
- Looks all right to me.
- It looks good, sir.

897
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,375
All right.

898
01:11:30,674 --> 01:11:31,807
Right.

899
01:11:34,275 --> 01:11:36,574
- Hang on a second, zoom in.
- Let me see.

900
01:11:41,974 --> 01:11:43,607
It seems frozen, sir.

901
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,375
All right.

902
01:11:54,874 --> 01:11:56,241
Oh, bollocks.

903
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,107
Total lockdown.

904
01:12:00,475 --> 01:12:02,507
Sir, we can't,
we possibly can't.

905
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:04,941
<i>The prison is now
under lockdown.</i>

906
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:08,040
<i>I repeat, the prison
is now under lockdown...</i>

907
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:27,040
It's in the gurneys.

908
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:33,707
<i>Allez, allez.</i> Oop!

909
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,908
- You have to stop those ambulances.
- You have to step back.

910
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,107
Good news or bad news?

911
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:02,341
Is Pace's daughter
good enough for you, Schultz?

912
01:13:02,807 --> 01:13:04,040
Oh.

913
01:13:04,908 --> 01:13:07,308
Lovely.
Keep her alive for an hour.

914
01:13:08,308 --> 01:13:09,407
Thanks.

915
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:20,807
Go, go, go!

916
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:23,741
Check everything
in the ambulance. Find the gold.

917
01:13:24,507 --> 01:13:25,641
Follow me.

918
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:29,241
Clear.

919
01:13:34,974 --> 01:13:36,375
Nothing in here.

920
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:39,341
Please don't shoot!

921
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:48,674
<i>We didn't find
anything, sir.</i>

922
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:02,107
Oi.

923
01:14:03,374 --> 01:14:04,208
And you are?

924
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,941
- Hazardous waste cleanup.
- What hazardous waste?

925
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:10,040
Look man, we're just
trying to do our job.

926
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:11,941
If you have any issues
talk to our boss.

927
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:13,341
Eh, where's your boss?

928
01:14:13,674 --> 01:14:16,241
Yeah, that's a crazy thing.
We have all this work to do

929
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:19,807
and they're stacking up crates?
Pretty heavy, too.

930
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:25,008
There they go.

931
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:37,074
Sir, we just got word,
Abu Hirawa has arrived for his gold.

932
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:40,340
Oh, don't worry about this. We won't
lose them. We've got men on every road.

933
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,674
Thanks for the thought of that,
but what have we got off road?

934
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:44,074
Sir?

935
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,074
You know what?

936
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:51,074
I like see what
you 'bout to do.

937
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:53,574
Mm-hm. Safety first.

938
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,374
Be driving this thing,
Prince, aight?

939
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:04,541
Ay, look, okay, I get it.
You drive, you control the music.

940
01:15:04,707 --> 01:15:06,641
I'm with that,
but we gotta do something

941
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:09,241
about the two double
Darth Haters back there.

942
01:15:09,474 --> 01:15:11,774
Just...
I can't take it.

943
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:15,241
Jus'
I need music, come on.

944
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,174
Yeah.

945
01:15:22,807 --> 01:15:24,174
That's your shit, right?

946
01:15:25,074 --> 01:15:26,307
Yeah!

947
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:31,774
Do that shit! Yeah!
Let's go baby!

948
01:15:36,474 --> 01:15:38,174
Yeah, baby.

949
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,707
Whoa! Shit!

950
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,541
Go, go, go, go!

951
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:55,574
Woo!

952
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,607
This ain't the road.
I'm wit' it though.

953
01:15:58,874 --> 01:16:01,208
Oh shit, let's do it!

954
01:16:03,974 --> 01:16:05,374
Ah, our reinforcements.

955
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:09,440
Hello, friends!

956
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:30,041
Now it's a party,
turn that shit up! Whoo!

957
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:32,774
Woo-hoo

958
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,374
You like that wild shit.
Let's go!

959
01:16:46,474 --> 01:16:48,474
I'm not scared.
I ain't scared at all.

960
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,340
Brakes!

961
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:56,707
Whoa!

962
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:58,741
Oh, shi...

963
01:16:59,374 --> 01:17:01,407
Oh!

964
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:05,041
Y'all all right back there?

965
01:17:06,108 --> 01:17:07,707
We good. We good?

966
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:20,374
Woo. Let's go. Come on,
we the Misfits, baby.

967
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:23,009
Gonna mis-fit my foot
in your ass, yeah!

968
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:36,140
- Now!
- Now? Yeah!

969
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:38,607
Oh shit!

970
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:49,240
Whoa!
Shit!

971
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:52,975
Golden showers, baby!

972
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:57,440
You don't even know what that means.
You're nasty, man. Golden showers.

973
01:17:59,009 --> 01:18:01,307
Go, go!

974
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,507
Hello.

975
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,107
<i>So here's where we're at.
None of us were armed.</i>

976
01:18:21,374 --> 01:18:23,440
<i>We wanted Schultz to think
he had the upper hand.</i>

977
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:25,641
<i>Plus we ain't want
to get shot at.</i>

978
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,240
Hello.

979
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:41,541
<i>It's about now that Schultz
realized he didn't really catch us.</i>

980
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:43,440
Fabulous.

981
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:50,009
<i>Hold up, pay attention
to those white cars.</i>

982
01:18:50,307 --> 01:18:52,307
<i>How would anyone know
where we were gonna be</i>

983
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,440
<i>before the chase even began?</i>

984
01:18:54,774 --> 01:18:56,707
<i>It's called an anonymous tip.</i>

985
01:18:56,909 --> 01:19:01,274
<i>We wanted to get caught
because we had a story to tell.</i>

986
01:19:41,474 --> 01:19:42,875
So, it's still in the prison,
then?

987
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,407
Not exactly.

988
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,140
Stop. What are you moving?

989
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,541
We got a, uh, we got
a repair order right here.

990
01:20:00,574 --> 01:20:01,607
Here you go.

991
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,741
Right there.

992
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,641
Still going to have
to take a look at it.

993
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:17,107
You betcha. Here you go.

994
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:20,240
Look at that.

995
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:22,073
See?

996
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,274
Dingdong.

997
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:27,641
I heard some
inmate damaged it.

998
01:20:27,842 --> 01:20:29,607
- Oh, yeah.
- Crazy bastard.

999
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:32,474
- Crazy...
- The bullocks, huh?

1000
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:35,574
- Mutt's nuts. Okay, have a good day.
- Yeah, yeah.

1001
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:48,875
Put the gun down!

1002
01:20:49,274 --> 01:20:50,407
<i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1003
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:53,008
<i>Who the hell are these dudes
and where did they come from?</i>

1004
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,674
<i>Check it, Prince told us
he'd have his soldiers</i>

1005
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,641
<i>just hiding and waiting for
Schultz to brandish a weapon.</i>

1006
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,340
<i>And then these guys rolled up
dressed like extras</i>

1007
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,909
<i>in a bad
Salvadorian action movie.</i>

1008
01:21:03,974 --> 01:21:06,574
<i>No way in hell
these are real soldiers.</i>

1009
01:21:06,808 --> 01:21:07,808
<i>But I played along.</i>

1010
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,140
You can't be brandishing a weapon
around a foreign military aircraft,

1011
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:15,040
especially from
a sovereign nation of, uh...

1012
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:16,875
- Salwa.
- Salwa.

1013
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,775
- Your country.
- My country.

1014
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:22,307
Just... just... just a sec,
just a sec.

1015
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:25,173
Get it done, yes.

1016
01:21:28,808 --> 01:21:32,541
Looks like your daddy dearest didn't
come through for you today, ho'.

1017
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:39,207
Finish her off.

1018
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,574
Reservation's
under Hope Pace.

1019
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:47,407
I've been waiting
for that call.

1020
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,775
Fucking men.

1021
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,107
Well, that's that then.

1022
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:40,608
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Hope.

1023
01:22:41,307 --> 01:22:44,775
<i>That punch was the least painful
thing that happened to Schultz that day.</i>

1024
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:47,708
<i>Inside of one of those
white cars I pointed out?</i>

1025
01:22:48,474 --> 01:22:49,742
<i>Was Abu Hirawa.</i>

1026
01:22:50,874 --> 01:22:55,374
Not my fault.

1027
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,808
It's okay. I believe you.

1028
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:03,207
But there are those who are
not interested in the truth...

1029
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,340
Only in justice.
It won't come swiftly.

1030
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,941
<i>The next day, some
talking head reported</i>

1031
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,675
<i>the food poisoning
at the prison.</i>

1032
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,708
<i>There was no mention
of any gold.</i>

1033
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:20,173
<i>Like I said,</i>

1034
01:23:20,407 --> 01:23:23,775
<i>you're gonna rob a bank
make sure it ain't reported.</i>

1035
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,774
Leave any of them alive?

1036
01:23:51,841 --> 01:23:53,642
- Of course not.
- Good.

1037
01:23:59,173 --> 01:24:03,440
- Where's my dad?
- Sh... I don't know, he had to drive the truck here.

1038
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,642
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no what? We got it. This is good news.

1039
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:12,742
- No.
- He's around here somewhere.

1040
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:13,742
No.

1041
01:24:15,374 --> 01:24:17,173
I have a terrible
feeling he's not.

1042
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:26,440
Oh, my God.

1043
01:24:27,908 --> 01:24:29,274
It's the original.

1044
01:24:31,407 --> 01:24:33,542
- Where's the gold?
- He took it.

1045
01:24:34,974 --> 01:24:36,008
And he's not coming back.

1046
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,708
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, this can't be.

1047
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:41,941
No, it can be,
it can so easily be.

1048
01:24:42,508 --> 01:24:45,107
Shit, I am so, so sorry.
I'm the one who vouched for him.

1049
01:24:45,173 --> 01:24:46,374
I brought him into
this whole thing.

1050
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:49,040
After a lifetime of disappointment,
I should have known better...

1051
01:24:50,974 --> 01:24:52,274
Far better.

1052
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,475
Dad?

1053
01:25:16,008 --> 01:25:17,274
Yes.

1054
01:25:19,274 --> 01:25:20,707
You stole the gold.

1055
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:25,040
I did.

1056
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:27,374
From us?

1057
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,107
Yep.

1058
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:32,340
Then what the hell
you still doing here?

1059
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:36,475
Hopefully... fixing things.

1060
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,807
I cleaned it up a little.

1061
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:45,475
Oh.

1062
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,441
Thank you.

1063
01:25:48,874 --> 01:25:51,073
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1064
01:25:55,008 --> 01:25:56,274
Uh, guys...

1065
01:25:56,674 --> 01:25:57,941
Shh...

1066
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,107
What are you shushing me,
we got stuff to do.

1067
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,441
You know what, this is
cute moment and everything

1068
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,941
but we got a whole Sal,
big Sal... Sal-wa?

1069
01:26:07,073 --> 01:26:08,073
Salwan.

1070
01:26:08,274 --> 01:26:11,173
Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

1071
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,475
Well, let's get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

1072
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,608
- My man.
- Yes.

1073
01:26:22,274 --> 01:26:24,508
<i>So, we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge</i>

1074
01:26:24,608 --> 01:26:26,408
<i>on Prince's country's
cargo plane.</i>

1075
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,607
<i>Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe</i>

1076
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:31,340
<i>he was actually a prince.</i>

1077
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:34,307
<i>I said almost.</i>

1078
01:26:35,508 --> 01:26:37,340
- Yo Ringo! Got your drink.
- Hey!

1079
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:39,408
- Prince, for you.
- Thank you.

1080
01:26:39,874 --> 01:26:43,073
Hey, you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

1081
01:26:43,307 --> 01:26:45,040
I want an umbrella,
what type of shit is this?

1082
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:49,274
This is the life. I mean,
this is always my life.

1083
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:52,073
Man, I can't believe
you're actually a prince.

1084
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,274
I mean, in the animal world,

1085
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,408
your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

1086
01:26:55,508 --> 01:26:58,575
Mm. A little training,
some skintight leather,

1087
01:26:58,874 --> 01:27:00,607
I could see myself
being a Misfit.

1088
01:27:01,974 --> 01:27:03,607
Don't even think about it.

1089
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,240
I'd like to start by
getting to know you again...

1090
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:08,974
in my retirement.

1091
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,674
Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

1092
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:16,774
Yeah, Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

1093
01:27:22,008 --> 01:27:23,707
No, actually, I think...

1094
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,707
I think I fit in just fine.

1095
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:31,375
Here's to us, guys.

1096
01:27:31,974 --> 01:27:33,441
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1097
01:27:33,508 --> 01:27:36,475
- Cheers guys. Bottoms up.
- Cheers.
