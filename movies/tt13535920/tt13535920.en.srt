2
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,233
What's that, my shirt?

3
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:23,821
It looks good on you.

4
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,499
Yes, Mom, it's me.

5
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,002
Yeah, it was great.

6
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,755
- Give her a kiss.
- Sara sends her love.

7
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:46,051
We relaxed, it was nice,
we took it easy.

8
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,097
How about you? Not too tired?

9
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,600
Marcus?

10
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,522
Yes or no?

11
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:00,774
Don't push so hard.

12
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:05,237
<i>I'm not pushing, Mom,
I just want to know where he's heading.</i>

13
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:07,573
<i>Anyway, we'll talk later.</i>

14
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,408
Call you back, love you.

15
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,535
You can come visit soon?

16
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,454
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

17
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:14,997
Love you.

18
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:17,666
What do you want for lunch?

19
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,209
I'm not hungry.

20
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:25,299
You're gorging on junk.
You're not serious, Marcus.

21
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,136
I'm in a rush, Grandma.

22
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,220
A rush?

23
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:33,348
I'll make some vegetables,
you'll have some,

24
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,394
and we'll have lunch together.
You need to eat healthy food.

25
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,481
No, Grandma, I have to go, sorry.

26
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:41,482
Thanks.

27
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,942
Marcus...

28
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:45,694
There's no time, but thanks.

29
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,446
Don't forget your mask.

30
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:57,081
Don't come back too late, Marcus!

31
00:07:58,582 --> 00:07:59,917
It's raining.

32
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,211
Don't take the metro, I'll drive you.

33
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,716
Thanks.

34
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,427
See you later.

35
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,882
François...

36
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,092
François...

37
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:17,805
Hello, Hind Darwish,
you're in Lebanon, in Beirut.

38
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,474
You're a journalist, a publisher,

39
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,393
an activist.

40
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,604
Tell us about the crisis
you're enduring.

41
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,816
<i>It's a serious economic crisis.</i>

42
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:32,444
<i>The crisis is also social, political,</i>

43
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,446
<i>cultural, moral.</i>

44
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:37,991
<i>Corruption gnaws away
at every level of the country,</i>

45
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,368
<i>down to the bone.</i>

46
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,995
<i>Especially after that catastrophe,</i>

47
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,165
<i>the catastrophe of August 4,
the big explosion,</i>

48
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:48,919
<i>the Lebanese are living a nightmare,
pure hell.</i>

49
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:52,256
Many Lebanese are leaving the country.

50
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:56,385
Do you think Lebanon
is losing its lifeblood?

51
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:57,261
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

52
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:01,306
<i>We're witnessing, yes,
a very frightening exodus.</i>

53
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:05,185
<i>We've experienced emigration
after the war.</i>

54
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:08,605
<i>But those emigrants
tried to return to Lebanon.</i>

55
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,858
<i>They kept ties to the country.</i>

56
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,986
<i>But now we're getting a sense</i>

57
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:17,197
<i>of despair, of disgust,</i>

58
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,492
<i>of repugnance
about what's happening in Lebanon.</i>

59
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:23,203
<i>And we're really afraid
that these people,</i>

60
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:27,666
<i>who are middle class, who are young,
won't come back.</i>

61
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,116
<i>Thank you, Hind Darwish,
for your testimony.</i>

62
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,702
<i>Now, Yasmine...</i>

63
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,448
- How much?
- 55.

64
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,242
Here.

65
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:32,249
I saw François today.

66
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,296
Okay.

67
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,762
And what did you do?

68
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,388
I went shopping.

69
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,015
You went to Vitry?

70
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:49,349
Yes, Vitry.

71
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,018
See Nelly?

72
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,062
No time to visit my mother.

73
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,688
I just went shopping.

74
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:00,819
Did you see Marcus?
Any news?

75
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,530
Yes.

76
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,201
- Yes?
- Yes, I said.

77
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,498
Your son exists for me too.

78
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,000
Marcus.

79
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,752
He's my business too.

80
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,592
I'll tell you something
I never said before.

81
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:28,055
The first time I saw you,

82
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,684
or the second, whatever...

83
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:35,604
I was living with François,
I barely knew you.

84
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,565
We went to a party, the three of us.

85
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,109
At friends of mine.

86
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,236
Remember?

87
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:46,824
Okay.

88
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,203
You watched a match before,
that's why you were together.

89
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,832
All three of us went.

90
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:59,044
And at one point during the party,
you put on music.

91
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,091
François and I danced.

92
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:08,053
You were behind the computer,
looking at us.

93
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,307
And you had...

94
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,018
a smile.

95
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:18,522
A smile, I swear...

96
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,482
What a smile!

97
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,193
That's...

98
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,612
that's the first thing.

99
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,782
Then we took a taxi back,
all three of us.

100
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,660
Back then, you lived near me,
rue d'Amsterdam.

101
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,829
You were still with your wife.

102
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,043
We got to my street and you said...

103
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:44,256
"I'll go by foot. She's waiting for me."

104
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:50,554
I thought that
François would stay with me.

105
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,432
You'd go to your wife
and he'd stay with me.

106
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,560
Hey, can you picture it?

107
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:00,272
Vaguely, yeah.

108
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:02,149
I remember, François said

109
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:03,859
he was going home.

110
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,320
I said that...

111
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,578
I wanted him to stay with me
after the party.

112
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:20,501
You were shocked he was leaving.
You said: "François!

113
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,002
You, you...

114
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,547
you have to stay!"

115
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:28,926
He said:
"I don't have to do anything."

116
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:31,637
And I...

117
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,473
as I walked home, I thought:

118
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,019
"Why am I with the one who leaves?

119
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,523
Why aren't I with the one who...

120
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:45,943
goes to sleep with his wife
on rue d'Amsterdam?"

121
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:49,738
I envied your wife.

122
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,617
You still envy her?

123
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:58,872
Because you're my rue d'Amsterdam wife.

124
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,615
Yes, Mom.

125
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:40,205
I can't this morning,
I have stuff to do.

126
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,915
I'll call you back.

127
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,917
Goodbye.

128
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,419
What do you have to do?

129
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,754
Stuff.

130
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,424
I'm off.

131
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:04,563
Sara?

132
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,190
Can I take your credit card?

133
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,235
You don't prefer a transfer?

134
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:11,612
No wire transfers.

135
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:14,198
You always do the shopping,
so it's easier.

136
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,824
Forget it, I'll manage.

137
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,494
- Don't get upset, here.
- Forget it.

138
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,829
- Take it!
- Forget it, I said.

139
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:23,916
See you later.

140
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:39,765
François!

141
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,392
You're back.

142
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,561
Mind calling me later?

143
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,271
Okay, bye.

144
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:43,454
Here.

145
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,710
So...

146
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,506
Birth certificate, good.

147
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,759
This...

148
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,594
your police record?

149
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:00,888
That's right.

150
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,014
All right.

151
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,975
Here's the tax stamp.

152
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:07,895
Here.

153
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:12,107
A document's missing.
Company registration number?

154
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:15,152
- It must be there.
- I don't see it.

155
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,196
Then I forgot it.

156
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,489
I'm sorry.

157
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,574
Do I really need it today?

158
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,534
Yes, sir.

159
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,079
You'll come back.

160
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,081
No big deal, I'll come back.

161
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,832
Take your documents.

162
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,002
And make another appointment.

163
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,755
Goodbye, sir. Have a nice day.

164
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,010
Hello.

165
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:44,723
Yes, Mom.

166
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:48,685
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm working.

167
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,775
Hear me better now?

168
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,112
Tell Marcus I'll come by Friday.

169
00:20:58,153 --> 00:21:00,280
That way we can talk.

170
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:04,368
I had no time to call his teacher.
I will.

171
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,452
All right.

172
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,579
Bye, Mom.

173
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,183
That was François.

174
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:13,145
He's starting an agency,
wants me to go in.

175
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,149
That's good.

176
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:19,818
Isn't it?

177
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:24,656
What do you think?

178
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,159
I don't know.

179
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,660
No idea.

180
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:32,873
Dunno.

181
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,786
You happy?

182
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:14,790
That François wants you
to work with him?

183
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,876
I said I don't know.

184
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:19,378
No idea.

185
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,338
Why?

186
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,716
Think there'll be problems?

187
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:27,803
No, why?
I never had problems with François.

188
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,139
We've always had
each other's numbers.

189
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:33,100
So why are you hesitating?

190
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:35,602
Are you scared of something?

191
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:37,438
No, I'm scared of nothing.

192
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,941
So what's bothering you?

193
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:42,985
Nothing's bothering me.

194
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:45,237
You?

195
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,406
What's bothering you?

196
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,408
- Me?
- Yes, you.

197
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,660
On the contrary.

198
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:52,953
No, it...

199
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,039
it makes me happy.

200
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:59,752
Happy to know you're meeting up
and working together.

201
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:03,172
Happy for you, for him, for you both.

202
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,135
You know how much I cared for François.

203
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:12,514
It might be strange seeing him again,
because...

204
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:16,769
when you love someone
it never really goes away.

205
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,857
I do feel something special for him.

206
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,194
But he and I are over with.

207
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,031
I live with you, Jean.

208
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,658
No need to worry.

209
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:34,119
Why are you telling me this?

210
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:36,789
I'm not worried.

211
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,124
Then everything's fine.

212
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,086
Did he ask if we were still together?

213
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,213
No.

214
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,340
I don't discuss my private life.

215
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:49,885
Well, you had to discuss it
at some point.

216
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,846
At some point, but that's it.

217
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,974
It pulled you apart, it separated you.

218
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,477
No, it didn't pull us apart.

219
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,231
It's been years.
If that didn't pull you apart, what did?

220
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:04,525
Prison? You in prison?

221
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,111
The fact that he disappeared?

222
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:11,198
He had his business, I had mine.

223
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:14,159
He asked no questions?

224
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:18,747
Nothing about your prison sentence?

225
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,376
At one point, but that's all.

226
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:28,215
We didn't mention you
if you're asking.

227
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:33,679
Why don't we ever talk?

228
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:37,891
Why can't we talk about
what François represents,

229
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,810
about how we met?

230
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,520
It's not insignificant.

231
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,149
I'm gonna wash up.

232
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:50,446
All right.

233
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,323
You went to prison, not him.

234
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:06,754
Am I bothering you?

235
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:11,216
No.

236
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,054
All ears.

237
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:22,561
What do you think about this thing?

238
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,314
Tell me.

239
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:28,942
What do you think?

240
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:30,861
I think it's good, but you?

241
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:32,863
You into it?

242
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,075
Seeing François again?

243
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,160
Yes, I think so.

244
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,579
Actually, I am.

245
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,123
Yes.

246
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,003
So no point hesitating.

247
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,213
No.

248
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,351
Except it stresses me out.

249
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,197
- You're cold.
- A little.

250
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,784
Don't worry, my love.

251
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,328
People change, you know.

252
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,290
François must have changed.
He must have matured.

253
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:32,005
He must have gone through a lot.

254
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:34,550
Ten years... imagine!

255
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:40,264
I have to go.

256
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,894
- You're going out now?
- Yes.

257
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:57,948
What'll you do with François?

258
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,658
Same as before.

259
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:03,912
Meaning?

260
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,914
You'll give him a hand?

261
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,918
I said he started an agency.
I can't explain now...

262
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,170
I have to go.

263
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:14,631
He's coming.
We're meeting on the corner.

264
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,552
On the corner?

265
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:21,180
Well, on the corner, downstairs.

266
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,890
On the corner.

267
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,401
So you kept her.

268
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,236
Yeah, I like her a lot.

269
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,158
She sat in Sara's garage,
waiting for me.

270
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:06,952
And...

271
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:09,455
life without me
wasn't too hard?

272
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,208
Look at me.

273
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,044
Look at me.

274
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,009
Jean?

275
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,137
Pick up, please.

276
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,402
Marcus, call from your phone,
maybe he'll answer.

277
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:44,239
What does it matter?
I'm being expelled anyway.

278
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:46,241
Who cares? There's no use.

279
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:49,912
Good thinking, I can let myself die too.

280
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:53,999
Who cares?

281
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:57,628
You exhaust me.

282
00:30:58,212 --> 00:30:59,630
Don't say that.

283
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,882
Not eating your toast?

284
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:04,218
No, I'm not too hungry.

285
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:05,219
Fine.

286
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:09,932
I'm too old to be a real grandmother.
I can't anymore.

287
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:12,059
Understand me?

288
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:14,937
Okay, see you later.

289
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:16,605
See you later.

290
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,196
I got my bank statement.

291
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:26,532
And look.

292
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,131
Yes, you're overdrawn.

293
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,385
There were several recent withdrawals.

294
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:50,514
What could have happened?
I don't know.

295
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,224
I know how you live.

296
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:54,017
So yeah, it's unusual.

297
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,770
Did anyone borrow your card,
Mrs. Charles?

298
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:00,023
Do you have it on you?

299
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:01,900
Yes.

300
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:06,113
Here.

301
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,823
You see?

302
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,161
Did you give the PIN to anyone?

303
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:14,997
No.

304
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:22,171
Dad, are you there?

305
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,339
Call me back.

306
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:55,371
You've had Marcus so long, Nelly.

307
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,373
Forever.

308
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,042
Don't go blaming yourself.

309
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:05,172
Jean was in prison,
he couldn't raise his son.

310
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:08,634
It's not your fault.

311
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:12,888
He did something stupid
and it backfired.

312
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,307
But he survived it.

313
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,852
Now his son is screwing up a little,

314
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,188
but it's no big deal.

315
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,441
I can't manage with Marcus anymore.

316
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:28,987
Doesn't he need someone strong,

317
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,614
someone to admire?

318
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:32,783
You don't admire your grandmother.

319
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,619
He loves you, mentions you every time.

320
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:40,541
Kids in his grade who slack off
go to trade school.

321
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,544
Does his mother ever call?

322
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,712
Almost never.

323
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:48,799
But Marcus needs...

324
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:53,178
to go to Martinique, to see his mother.
It's important.

325
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,680
She has a new life.

326
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:56,515
A new family.

327
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,735
<i>Just tell me when.</i>

328
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,153
<i>Just say when!</i>

329
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:10,446
<i>Okay.</i>

330
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,576
I'll finish what I'm doing
and I'll go.

331
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,202
Okay, no problem.

332
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:18,912
Okay, bye.

333
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:22,750
<i>Marcus - missed call</i>

334
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,627
Going out?

335
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:26,669
Yep.

336
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:30,466
I don't know when I'll be back.
Don't wait up.

337
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:32,259
Where are you going?

338
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:36,305
To see François' offices,
to check out the space.

339
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:39,390
Know where rue des Bleuets is?

340
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:43,145
Around here.

341
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:44,980
What new offices?

342
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,274
I said he was starting an agency.

343
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:48,859
What kind of agency?

344
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:51,278
For recruiting players.
You know this.

345
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,323
We go to small clubs

346
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:57,993
to scout junior players
to recruit them.

347
00:34:59,703 --> 00:35:01,038
But you know this.

348
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,247
I'm going.

349
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,417
See you later.

350
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:14,593
You had that idea
after your injury.

351
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:18,263
Yes, I know.

352
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,983
Jean?

353
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:03,118
I can't sleep.

354
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:07,247
You will.

355
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:10,250
Did it go well?

356
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,543
Yes.

357
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:15,589
Coming to bed?

358
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,928
In a little while.

359
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:22,679
So do I get a kiss?

360
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,765
Yeah.

361
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:37,111
Jean.

362
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,446
Do you love me?

363
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:41,698
Yes, I love you.

364
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:44,326
Do you love me?

365
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:45,369
Yes.

366
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,664
You'll tell me what you did?

367
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,874
There's nothing to tell.

368
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,793
We're just working.

369
00:37:54,378 --> 00:37:55,379
Go to sleep.

370
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:58,465
Is it going well?

371
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:00,718
Yes, it is.

372
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:03,762
Sleep.

373
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,143
Jean?

374
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:10,853
Yes?

375
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,107
Did you talk about money yet?

376
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,568
Don't worry.

377
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,524
Yes, François.

378
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,278
I understand but...

379
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:04,907
my thing with Marcus is then.

380
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:12,790
Marcus is counting on me.

381
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:17,294
You can't make it
because of your trip with François?

382
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:21,423
If I'm in Bayonne with François,
I can't be in Vitry with Marcus.

383
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,925
You can push it off.

384
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:26,136
I can push it off, but...

385
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,556
You can always push it off, but...

386
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:33,394
there's a risk, because
it's a great opportunity.

387
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:36,063
And if things work out with François...

388
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:39,817
it opens new horizons for me, see?

389
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,197
What will you do with François
in Bayonne?

390
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:48,659
Like before. Like we always have.

391
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,830
I'll be middleman
between him and the prospects.

392
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,998
He can't be on the front lines.

393
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:56,625
So...

394
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,002
he needs someone credible.

395
00:39:59,044 --> 00:40:01,130
That's how we've always worked.

396
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:03,257
You'll have a contract?
Get paid?

397
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:06,093
- It'll be fine.
- Did you bring it up?

398
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:09,722
Come on, obviously if...

399
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:12,099
if I work, I'll get paid.

400
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,603
There are guys to recruit
and that's on me.

401
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:21,066
I'm the only one who can spot them.

402
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:26,655
It means a lot
to get back into sports.

403
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:28,615
With the players...

404
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,452
What about your project?

405
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,666
You're giving up on it?
It's a good project.

406
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:42,379
I believe in it.
How do you see things?

407
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:46,592
I believe in it too.
It's my initiative.

408
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,302
It's my idea.

409
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:52,139
I believe in it,
but I can do it whenever I want.

410
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,102
Now I have a chance
to get back into sports.

411
00:40:57,728 --> 00:41:00,481
It's now, it's the moment.

412
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:02,357
And...

413
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:07,571
before, I rode the wave
of my past as a player.

414
00:41:08,072 --> 00:41:09,907
Whereas now...

415
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,535
I'm an ex-con.

416
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,622
But you know that.

417
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:45,025
I don't fucking believe it.

418
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,032
I'm stuck in traffic, Mom.
Sorry, I'm doing my best.

419
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,492
I'm coming...

420
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,244
No, I'm coming!

421
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,253
Hi, Mom.

422
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:06,463
I won't kiss you, I forgot my mask.

423
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:10,592
Can I come in?

424
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:13,178
Jean, I'm sorry, but...

425
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,222
he doesn't want to see you.

426
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:20,978
I cancelled a meeting
and it took 3 hours to get to Vitry.

427
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:25,524
How can we see his teacher
if Marcus won't see me?

428
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:34,408
If I can't go inside, I can't come back.

429
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,493
This was my only free day.

430
00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:43,542
Just tell me.

431
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,503
How is he? That's all that matters.
Is he okay?

432
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:48,839
It depends.

433
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:50,966
It depends on what?

434
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:55,137
On the people he hangs around with.

435
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:57,848
There's a lot of coming and going.

436
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,310
So, like where is he now?

437
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,771
He went out.

438
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,023
You don't know where?

439
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:07,191
No.

440
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,277
Really don't know?

441
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:12,988
I could say he's doing homework,

442
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,158
but I wouldn't say
that's the problem now.

443
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:18,702
What's the problem now?

444
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:22,539
I find him absent.

445
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,586
I spent three hours in traffic,

446
00:43:27,628 --> 00:43:30,881
if I can't go inside,
I'm leaving, sorry.

447
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:34,676
Shut up! Pain-in-the-ass dog!

448
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:35,719
Shut up!

449
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:38,430
What's your problem with the dog?

450
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:41,767
- He's a pain!
- He's nice, just a guard dog.

451
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,937
Your dog's not nice!
He makes too much noise.

452
00:43:46,105 --> 00:43:47,314
Come, Easton.

453
00:43:48,816 --> 00:43:51,360
Mom, sorry, I have to go.

454
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:54,988
No, it's good, son. On the contrary.

455
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,367
I'm glad you're working
and that things are good.

456
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:14,842
Marcus, open the window, please.

457
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,178
I want to tell you something.

458
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:20,806
Marcus, please.

459
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,392
Marcus!

460
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,249
Don't cry.

461
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:49,585
My love, you're my love.

462
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,131
Don't cry.

463
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:18,507
Today we are with Lilian Thuram.

464
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:23,846
Hello, Lilian Thuram.

465
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:28,183
This "white thinking"
that you discuss in your book,

466
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:30,394
you say it is in us white people.

467
00:46:30,436 --> 00:46:33,814
How was it inculcated
and integrated in us?

468
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,108
<i>White thinking is</i>

469
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:41,113
<i>the ideology that constructed
the idea that "white is better."</i>

470
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:45,576
<i>But me, being West Indian,
when I used to talk to my mom,</i>

471
00:46:46,285 --> 00:46:50,247
<i>about racism,
she said that when she was young,</i>

472
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:54,460
<i>she was told it was better to marry
someone fairer</i>

473
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:57,171
<i>to have children with "scaped" skin,</i>

474
00:46:57,212 --> 00:47:00,215
<i>skin that "escaped" blackness,
less black skin.</i>

475
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:04,720
In your book, Lilian Thuram,
you cite Frantz Fanon.

476
00:47:06,638 --> 00:47:11,435
<i>Frantz Fanon is, for me, the intellectual
who understood racism best.</i>

477
00:47:12,436 --> 00:47:16,106
<i>I think that...
because he was a psychiatrist.</i>

478
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:18,067
<i>And I think that indeed,</i>

479
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,445
<i>racism is a psychiatric problem.</i>

480
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:25,199
<i>Because we've been locked
into identities.</i>

481
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:29,203
<i>Identities based on our skin color.</i>

482
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,038
<i>But we don't know it.</i>

483
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>Of course,
if you're locked into white identity,</i>

484
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:37,669
<i>it's more acceptable.</i>

485
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:42,174
<i>Because you're unwittingly positioned</i>

486
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:43,717
<i>as the norm.</i>

487
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:48,722
<i>What's so disturbing
about this locking-in,</i>

488
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:53,143
<i>for people discriminated against
for their skin color,</i>

489
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:57,147
<i>is the existential violence it wreaks.</i>

490
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:58,857
<i>People don't realize.</i>

491
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:05,072
- Thanks, Alice, see you tomorrow.
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>

492
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:15,624
<i>We're in Bayonne.
They redid the whole pitch.</i>

493
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,001
<i>Look how pretty it is.</i>

494
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:19,795
<i>And who's there?</i>

495
00:48:19,837 --> 00:48:21,630
<i>Hold on, walk a little...</i>

496
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:25,008
<i>There... now the two of us.</i>

497
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:37,354
<i>What's the problem with Sara?</i>

498
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:38,897
<i>Tell me.</i>

499
00:48:38,939 --> 00:48:41,358
<i>Don't bullshit me, what's the problem?</i>

500
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,778
<i>Fine. I'm hanging up.</i>

501
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:48,157
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

502
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:50,117
You seem upset.

503
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,161
I'm not upset, everything's fine.

504
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:54,496
Why were you shouting?

505
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:57,416
I don't know, I wasn't really shouting.

506
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:01,170
Your call sounded pretty intense.
Who was it with?

507
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:03,464
François.

508
00:49:05,382 --> 00:49:08,302
I thought I heard my name.
Am I wrong?

509
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:11,972
Is there a problem?

510
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:14,308
No, no problem, it's all settled.

511
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:18,812
Can I know why I came up?
What's settled?

512
00:49:18,854 --> 00:49:20,314
- Want to know?
- Yes!

513
00:49:20,355 --> 00:49:23,901
When I got to the airport,
they were talking about you.

514
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:26,195
When I got close, they clammed up.

515
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:29,907
Anything unpleasant?

516
00:49:29,948 --> 00:49:34,536
How can I know?
I got closer and they clammed up.

517
00:49:36,497 --> 00:49:38,040
What did François want?

518
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:41,418
Did he call or did you?

519
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:43,379
It was me.

520
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:47,091
He wanted to know
if I was still with you.

521
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:50,094
You never told him?

522
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:52,221
Well, now he knows.

523
00:49:53,305 --> 00:49:56,683
I said if I ever heard
anyone badmouthing you,

524
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,477
I wouldn't see them again.

525
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,480
I don't work with people
who clam up.

526
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:02,773
No way!

527
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:06,485
Was he surprised we're still together?

528
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,863
He can't have imagined
we would still be.

529
00:50:10,614 --> 00:50:13,492
I don't give a fuck
what François thinks.

530
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:16,870
He must have found it weird.

531
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,331
Why weird?

532
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:24,044
It's not weird.

533
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,145
My love.

534
00:50:42,354 --> 00:50:44,565
My love, my love...

535
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,013
Jean?

536
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:09,316
Can I come to the opening of the agency?

537
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:12,361
Sure.

538
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,862
But...

539
00:52:14,738 --> 00:52:16,990
there'll be the prospects,

540
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:19,159
their families.

541
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,162
François probably invited friends.

542
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,206
I'm not involved with that, but...

543
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:27,042
I think you can.

544
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:31,255
I'll make some coffee.

545
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:45,621
You worked all night.

546
00:53:46,038 --> 00:53:47,039
Yeah.

547
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,543
All is well? You're okay?

548
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:54,046
I guess so.

549
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:05,474
Will I see you tonight?

550
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:06,892
Yes.

551
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:11,021
You know, I'll be with the juniors,
their families.

552
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:13,273
You'll see me, but I'll be busy.

553
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:18,695
I know you'll be busy.

554
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,365
I know I won't be your priority.

555
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:26,870
Think it's better I don't come?

556
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:33,001
We're just tired and spent all night
getting this thing ready.

557
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,462
It may not be the best time.

558
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:37,798
Didn't he invite friends?

559
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:45,514
Want to see the agency or François?

560
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:46,765
The agency.

561
00:54:46,807 --> 00:54:49,601
You work with François,
so I'll see François.

562
00:54:55,232 --> 00:54:56,400
Obviously.

563
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:58,235
It's better, you're right.

564
00:54:58,277 --> 00:54:59,737
I was wavering anyway.

565
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:01,947
After so long,

566
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:04,867
I'd rather not see him
with people around.

567
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:09,496
You know François won't wait
on the corner forever.

568
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:12,124
I'll ask him to dinner one day.

569
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:13,834
So you can see him.

570
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:15,836
Yes, we'll see.

571
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:22,426
I don't know when I'll get home.

572
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:26,305
I'm not worried. You'll tell me.

573
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,983
You can come if you want.

574
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:42,529
I love you.

575
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:46,200
I love you too.

576
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:05,636
The suit looks good on you.

577
00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:09,515
Thanks.

578
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:12,309
Got your keys, taking your car.

579
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:19,983
You're beautiful.

580
00:56:20,984 --> 00:56:22,903
Crazy how pretty you are.

581
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,413
Are you okay?

582
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:15,998
Marcus is here.

583
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:24,923
Come.

584
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:29,053
Be right back.

585
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:47,071
Sara? What are you up to?

586
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:49,114
It's great to see you!

587
00:57:49,156 --> 00:57:50,199
Seen François?

588
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:53,911
No.

589
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:57,081
Come, he must be in an office somewhere.

590
00:57:57,956 --> 00:57:59,416
The space is nice.

591
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:03,462
We're not fully settled in yet.

592
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:06,215
Come, he'll be thrilled.

593
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,801
I don't want to bother him.

594
00:58:08,842 --> 00:58:11,970
I'm just looking...
how you're set up here.

595
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:15,641
I'll leave you my number.

596
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,976
If you reconsider.

597
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:19,478
- Okay.
- Don't hesitate.

598
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,897
You're as pretty as ever.

599
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:19,496
<i>You okay?</i>

600
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:22,666
I was asked
to come see you all in an office.

601
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,127
<i>Yeah, come on in.</i>

602
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,547
No, because I'm outside.

603
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,593
<i>Sara, do as you please.
There's no problem.</i>

604
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,769
I...

605
00:59:46,523 --> 00:59:47,900
Do you mind...

606
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:49,443
You mind if I come?

607
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:52,279
<i>It's not about what I mind.</i>

608
00:59:52,321 --> 00:59:54,740
<i>I said I'm busy,
but come if you want to.</i>

609
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,469
- Yes?
<i>- Hold on...</i>

610
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:22,518
François?

611
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:27,731
<i>Yes?</i>

612
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:29,900
Yes? François?

613
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,486
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

614
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:35,489
It's me.

615
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:37,616
It's me.

616
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,536
<i>It's you?</i>

617
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:46,542
Your offices are nice.
You did a good job.

618
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,294
<i>Where are you?</i>

619
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:52,506
Jean didn't tell you?

620
01:00:53,257 --> 01:00:54,383
<i>No, what?</i>

621
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,051
I'm...

622
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,346
It's...

623
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:04,226
it's moving to hear your voice.

624
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:06,854
<i>Me too.</i>

625
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:10,065
<i>Where are you?</i>

626
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:13,193
Outside.

627
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,696
<i>So come up!</i>

628
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:19,616
Really? I won't bother you all?

629
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:21,535
<i>Come on up, I said.</i>

630
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:33,630
He's upstairs.

631
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:56,755
Your eyes.

632
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:04,263
Where were you all this time?

633
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:09,309
Not far.

634
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:14,898
I missed you.

635
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,365
I asked Jean for your number.

636
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:07,701
I'll write you tonight.

637
01:04:08,202 --> 01:04:10,829
A text.
You have to answer, okay?

638
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:11,955
Okay.

639
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:13,957
Promise?

640
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,043
I promise you.

641
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:24,760
My love.

642
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,435
See you later, my love.

643
01:04:33,852 --> 01:04:34,978
See you later.

644
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:44,530
Always happy to see you, Marcus.

645
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:45,739
Me too.

646
01:04:48,909 --> 01:04:50,703
We'll drop off Marcus.

647
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:52,246
Sure.

648
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:27,508
Here we go again,

649
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,220
love, fear...

650
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:37,976
sleepless nights...

651
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:42,189
the phone at my bedside...

652
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:45,984
getting wet.

653
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:59,081
It's sad.

654
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,999
No, why?

655
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,545
Yes, it's sad, François.

656
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:08,507
We're here, happy together.

657
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:10,926
We've found each other.

658
01:07:10,968 --> 01:07:12,261
That's not sad.

659
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:17,141
It's sad
because we're not together anymore.

660
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,730
We won't escape each other again.
We know it.

661
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:25,023
What do we know?

662
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:27,943
Running away serves no purpose.

663
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:30,779
Why do you say that?

664
01:07:33,657 --> 01:07:35,325
We're already together.

665
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:37,244
Yeah, well...

666
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,997
whatever you say.

667
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,000
You don't feel it?

668
01:07:53,886 --> 01:07:55,179
Do you feel it?

669
01:07:57,556 --> 01:07:59,308
Yes, I feel it.

670
01:08:03,854 --> 01:08:06,106
So we'll stay together, that's all.

671
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:09,610
Stop.

672
01:08:12,446 --> 01:08:13,864
I love you.

673
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:15,991
I love you.

674
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,626
I love you too.

675
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:27,961
Me too.

676
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,436
In your opinion, Marcus,

677
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:48,648
what people
have the hardest time in life?

678
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,608
Who has the greatest

679
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:53,028
professional difficulties?

680
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:58,992
It's the worst for Blacks and Arabs.

681
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:01,704
Blacks and Arabs.

682
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:06,916
Marcus,

683
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,711
you're my son.

684
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:10,838
Your mom is Black.

685
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:16,802
And when I hear you talking
about Blacks and Arabs,

686
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:18,595
it's like...

687
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:21,014
they're no one.

688
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:23,349
You make it sound like...

689
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:26,519
Blacks and Arabs are unable

690
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,857
to think independently
of their skin color.

691
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:34,193
They can't think independently

692
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,362
of their origins.

693
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,324
It's as if I can't be anything other

694
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:43,912
than the son
of Nelly Charles, born in Vitry?

695
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:44,830
Is that it?

696
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:51,253
You're in 10th grade?

697
01:09:51,836 --> 01:09:53,755
What'll you do next year?

698
01:09:56,008 --> 01:09:59,635
What direction do you think you'll go?

699
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:02,723
Will you get a high school diploma

700
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:05,059
or go to trade school?

701
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,562
Diploma or vocational school?

702
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,194
I'm gonna go to trade school in retail.

703
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:17,821
Trade school in retail?

704
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:22,826
Marcus, you're my son.

705
01:10:23,702 --> 01:10:25,287
And I...

706
01:10:25,746 --> 01:10:30,167
I'm not just a rugby player who got hurt,
not just an ex-con.

707
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,127
Not just a guy who fucked up.

708
01:10:32,544 --> 01:10:34,963
I'm my own person.
I'm me, I'm Jean.

709
01:10:35,005 --> 01:10:37,674
You're your own person, you're Marcus.

710
01:10:40,219 --> 01:10:41,595
Understand?

711
01:10:42,429 --> 01:10:46,100
When I hear you talking
about Blacks and Arabs,

712
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:50,813
it's like you're repeating
what French society wants.

713
01:10:52,022 --> 01:10:54,983
You got sucked into their discourse,

714
01:10:55,025 --> 01:10:59,071
a prevailing discourse,
there's a prevailing one for whites,

715
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:04,118
a prevailing discourse for Blacks,
for the poor, for the rich.

716
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,370
"I'm Black, therefore..."

717
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,958
"I'm poor, therefore this."

718
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:13,293
"I'm Black, therefore that."

719
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,296
"I'm white, therefore..."
"I'm whatever, therefore..."

720
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,466
Who's "therefore"? I don't know.
Are you "therefore"?

721
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,593
Am I "therefore"? Are we?

722
01:11:21,635 --> 01:11:24,596
No, you're Marcus, I'm Jean. Okay?

723
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:26,432
We're our own people.

724
01:11:28,308 --> 01:11:29,017
Jean?

725
01:11:29,476 --> 01:11:32,771
Sorry, Mom,
I'm in the middle of talking to Marcus.

726
01:11:32,813 --> 01:11:34,523
I'm trying to get him...

727
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:37,401
to maybe understand...

728
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:40,154
the path he's going to take.

729
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:43,866
He thinks he'll be doing retail, sales,

730
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:48,287
it used to be called trade school,
now it's vocational school.

731
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:49,788
It's the same.

732
01:11:50,622 --> 01:11:52,708
So I say no. It's no.

733
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,630
First, finish 10th grade.

734
01:11:58,672 --> 01:12:00,049
Then 11th.

735
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,800
Then your senior year.

736
01:12:01,842 --> 01:12:04,178
Keep your options open.

737
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,763
Take time to think, grow.

738
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:09,433
And then make your decision.

739
01:12:10,142 --> 01:12:12,144
Do you understand me, Marcus?

740
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:13,937
Yes.

741
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:19,359
So did you make up your mind?

742
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:20,986
Yes.

743
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,947
And... what did you decide?

744
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,243
Trade school in retail,

745
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:31,455
mixing school and internships.

746
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:33,874
So in fact,

747
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,627
nothing I said even mattered.

748
01:12:36,877 --> 01:12:39,129
Coming here serves no purpose.

749
01:12:40,547 --> 01:12:44,635
How will you manage?
Thugging around like I did?

750
01:12:44,676 --> 01:12:46,220
Tell me, I'm interested.

751
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:49,223
How will you manage?
What'll you do?

752
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,977
This is what you'll do.

753
01:12:54,395 --> 01:12:58,232
If you go to trade school in retail...

754
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,859
you won't like this, I'm warning you!

755
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,990
You'll be cleaning people's toilets.

756
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,035
You'll be with people in higher posts.

757
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:15,040
They'll have diplomas.
They'll have gone to business school.

758
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:19,461
They'll be doing business,
real business, high-level business.

759
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:23,132
And what'll you be doing?
Cleaning their toilets.

760
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:25,551
You'll do that for them.

761
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,636
Is that what you want?

762
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,471
No.

763
01:13:29,513 --> 01:13:31,473
How old are you, Marcus?

764
01:13:31,515 --> 01:13:32,683
I'm 15.

765
01:13:32,725 --> 01:13:34,309
Yeah, you're 15.

766
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,979
Still in the world of childhood.

767
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,150
You're not formed yet,
in a state of becoming.

768
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:43,861
You can still choose, still decide.

769
01:13:46,947 --> 01:13:49,742
Being smart is
when you have two paths,

770
01:13:49,783 --> 01:13:53,620
and you choose one,
the right one, the one best for you.

771
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,957
It's your choice.

772
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,709
And...

773
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:02,504
besides the money I give you,
your allowance,

774
01:14:04,882 --> 01:14:07,051
if you need anything, ask.

775
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:11,013
Instead of taking Grandma's credit card.

776
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:12,931
Here.

777
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,838
So, just to recapitulate,

778
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,258
the right address is Vitry or Paris?

779
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,136
- Paris, my wife's place.
- Paris, okay.

780
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,639
Are you still divorced?

781
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:57,768
And you still have a child to support.

782
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,188
- The grandmother still has custody?
- Yes.

783
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,066
We have everything.

784
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:06,777
For me, your file is complete.
It's all good.

785
01:15:07,945 --> 01:15:09,071
Here.

786
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:14,410
And... good luck.

787
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:15,703
Thank you.

788
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,414
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

789
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:29,842
Remind me why you go to Vitry

790
01:15:29,883 --> 01:15:31,051
for groceries.

791
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,469
Tell me again.

792
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:33,887
I like Vitry.

793
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:38,225
Because... I love my car,
I love driving it.

794
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:42,771
And because there's a huge parking lot
in front of the mall.

795
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,065
It makes shopping easy.

796
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:46,942
It's less expensive.

797
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:50,154
Yeah, but what's there? What?

798
01:15:51,363 --> 01:15:52,489
Everything.

799
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:56,035
It's simple, there's everything.
If you want...

800
01:15:56,076 --> 01:15:59,788
gardening supplies,
hardware and lumber,

801
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:03,125
glasses and plates
that don't cost a thing.

802
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,460
Everything.

803
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:06,003
Ask me for anything,

804
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,338
anything, and I'll find it.

805
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:11,633
And gas is cheaper there.

806
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,014
Yes?

807
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,266
When do you get back?

808
01:16:20,851 --> 01:16:22,936
Okay, me too.

809
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,021
Bye.

810
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,607
Who was that?

811
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:27,649
François.

812
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,527
- He's not in Paris?
- He is, but...

813
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:35,115
he's off to Romania,
but he'll be here for the press thing.

814
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:38,410
I gotta go to the junior rugby match.

815
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:40,871
- Where's the press thing?
- Paris.

816
01:16:40,913 --> 01:16:42,414
Where in Paris?

817
01:16:42,456 --> 01:16:43,749
At the agency.

818
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,918
You're incredible.

819
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:47,461
Yeah, at the agency.

820
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:25,541
<i>I can't see you.</i>

821
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:26,917
I'm here.

822
01:17:28,502 --> 01:17:30,129
<i>I'm on my way to Paris.</i>

823
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:32,423
- What?
<i>- I'm in Bucharest.</i>

824
01:17:33,173 --> 01:17:34,383
<i>I'm getting on the plane.</i>

825
01:17:36,343 --> 01:17:37,594
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

826
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,472
What do you mean "tomorrow"?

827
01:17:40,514 --> 01:17:41,682
Want me to come?

828
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,350
You have to.

829
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,459
Can we talk?

830
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:52,044
Go on.

831
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:55,506
What I endured last night,

832
01:18:55,839 --> 01:18:57,883
never again, you hear me?

833
01:18:58,842 --> 01:19:00,094
Meaning?

834
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:03,347
I don't like seeing
François kiss you on the mouth.

835
01:19:03,389 --> 01:19:05,140
You may, but I don't.

836
01:19:05,182 --> 01:19:08,894
He didn't kiss me on the mouth.
What is this about?

837
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:10,604
Think I'm an idiot?

838
01:19:11,605 --> 01:19:13,524
I don't think you're an idiot,

839
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:16,235
but he didn't kiss me on the mouth.

840
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:18,153
I saw you.

841
01:19:19,905 --> 01:19:20,948
Really?

842
01:19:21,532 --> 01:19:23,242
I'm glad you saw me.

843
01:19:24,618 --> 01:19:28,247
If you saw me, you saw I pulled away.
Did you see that?

844
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:31,792
If you see everything,
you saw that.

845
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,544
You say you saw,

846
01:19:33,585 --> 01:19:37,172
so if you saw,
you saw François, tipsy...

847
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:38,257
He doesn't drink.

848
01:19:38,298 --> 01:19:39,758
Don't interrupt, I'm talking.

849
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,261
If you have something to say,
say it!

850
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:43,971
You always cut me off!

851
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,223
I can't talk with you, it's hell.

852
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:48,434
Okay, I have to start all over.

853
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:51,395
Will you let me speak?

854
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:54,857
Don't you know
each sentence is a breath?

855
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,735
Every time you cut me off, I start over

856
01:19:57,776 --> 01:20:00,487
from the beginning,
to get my breath back!

857
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:03,866
The breath of my sentence,
there's a breath to sentences.

858
01:20:03,907 --> 01:20:06,201
Okay, I'm starting over. May I?

859
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:09,288
- Go on.
- Can I finish what I was saying?

860
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:11,915
Catch your breath...

861
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,376
if you have something to say.

862
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,337
Catch your breath.

863
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,548
Yes, I do have something to say.

864
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:21,008
All right.

865
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:25,220
You say you saw.

866
01:20:25,262 --> 01:20:26,472
So if you saw,

867
01:20:26,513 --> 01:20:30,225
you saw me pull away
and that he didn't kiss me.

868
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,270
He didn't kiss me on the mouth.

869
01:20:40,778 --> 01:20:42,237
So I'm a liar.

870
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:46,742
Yeah.

871
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:48,535
No, you're not a liar.

872
01:20:48,827 --> 01:20:51,288
You think
you saw something you didn't.

873
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:53,749
And you didn't
because it didn't happen.

874
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,876
You saw a fragment of a movement.

875
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:56,960
Probably.

876
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:02,549
You were controlling so much
you obviously found something.

877
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,470
You're unbearable, Jean, unbearable!

878
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:13,268
I'm sick of this.

879
01:21:14,895 --> 01:21:16,021
Sometimes.

880
01:21:16,814 --> 01:21:17,940
Too.

881
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,193
Being under surveillance.

882
01:21:21,235 --> 01:21:24,279
I have no life,
you have to control everything.

883
01:21:24,321 --> 01:21:25,739
I control everything?

884
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,575
Now I'm a controller?

885
01:21:30,703 --> 01:21:33,247
Who are you talking to? Not me.

886
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:35,374
I'm not that man.

887
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:39,712
If you're not that man,
stop controlling me.

888
01:21:40,796 --> 01:21:42,172
I'll stop all right.

889
01:21:51,265 --> 01:21:52,266
Jean...

890
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:12,119
So I should stop seeing François?

891
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:13,996
That's it?

892
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:19,293
No problem if that's it,
but say it, clearly.

893
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:21,837
Want me to say it clearly?

894
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:23,964
Did you say “clearly”?

895
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,091
I told you clearly.

896
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:28,510
I'm not that man.

897
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:32,264
I won't tell you to be with him
or not.

898
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:33,766
I said it clearly.

899
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:51,366
François is someone I really loved.

900
01:22:52,117 --> 01:22:54,953
So seeing him again isn't easy.

901
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,379
I'm sorry.

902
01:23:04,254 --> 01:23:05,839
I'm sorry...

903
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,966
if I hurt you out of...

904
01:23:09,009 --> 01:23:12,721
out of lack of self-confidence,
out of fear...

905
01:23:12,763 --> 01:23:14,348
You mustn't be afraid.

906
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:17,976
Don't be afraid. I'm with you.

907
01:23:18,018 --> 01:23:21,146
I'm with you too, Jean.
I'm not your enemy.

908
01:23:24,858 --> 01:23:26,735
It's not easy, you know.

909
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,157
But it'll be fine.

910
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:36,328
It's the past coming back,
it's weird, just a phase.

911
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:39,873
If the past is coming back...

912
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,751
I'm out of here.

913
01:23:43,627 --> 01:23:46,130
I don't give a fuck
about the past coming back.

914
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:49,425
If it's coming back, I'm out.

915
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,301
The past coming back.

916
01:23:52,678 --> 01:23:53,721
Damn...

917
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,723
The past coming back.

918
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,099
Holy shit.

919
01:23:58,809 --> 01:24:00,602
The past is coming back...

920
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:04,523
- Calm down.
- I'm calm, not angry.

921
01:24:04,565 --> 01:24:07,151
- You're not calm.
- I'm calm, I'm not angry.

922
01:24:07,192 --> 01:24:09,903
Getting angry won't get us anywhere.

923
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:11,447
I'm not angry.

924
01:24:11,488 --> 01:24:15,159
Look how you're walking, talking.
Don't say you're calm.

925
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,122
I didn't like your behavior last night.

926
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:22,916
Can't you understand that?

927
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,460
What behavior?

928
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:26,712
What behavior?

929
01:24:27,755 --> 01:24:29,590
I did nothing.

930
01:24:30,049 --> 01:24:32,134
I pulled away, I told you.

931
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,971
- He didn't kiss me!
- Sometimes you hurt people.

932
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:39,016
He didn't kiss me, I took a step back.

933
01:24:39,058 --> 01:24:40,726
I'm not talking about that!

934
01:24:41,226 --> 01:24:42,144
What?

935
01:24:42,186 --> 01:24:45,314
- What then?
- About things you do, people you hurt.

936
01:24:45,355 --> 01:24:46,732
What do I do?

937
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:52,279
You got there last night...

938
01:24:55,157 --> 01:24:56,533
You saw François.

939
01:24:57,201 --> 01:24:59,411
You saw only him, nothing else.

940
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:05,626
You don't want us to sit down?

941
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:07,544
I'm sorry, Jean.

942
01:25:11,048 --> 01:25:12,466
I saw you after.

943
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:16,428
- With people I didn't know.
- That's my point.

944
01:25:16,762 --> 01:25:18,389
You saw me after.

945
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:21,517
It's normal. You didn't look at me once.

946
01:25:22,017 --> 01:25:23,519
Not once the whole night.

947
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,146
We live together, so yes, you're right.

948
01:25:26,188 --> 01:25:30,317
When we go out, I look at other people.
That's not unusual.

949
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,778
I look at people when we go out.

950
01:25:34,071 --> 01:25:36,698
But my hand was just in yours.

951
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,283
We live together.

952
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:41,995
I've seen you every day for 9 years,
I chose you.

953
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:45,207
- Must I look at you when we go out?
- I look at you.

954
01:25:45,249 --> 01:25:49,503
This is too much, Jean.
I can't look at you and no one else.

955
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:51,255
I look at other people too.

956
01:25:51,296 --> 01:25:53,424
Don't pretend you don't get it!

957
01:25:53,465 --> 01:25:55,467
I look at people too!

958
01:25:55,509 --> 01:25:57,803
I didn't "look look" at you.

959
01:25:57,845 --> 01:26:01,348
I didn't look at you nonstop,
but I knew where you were!

960
01:26:02,182 --> 01:26:04,059
You hurt me, that's all.

961
01:26:06,645 --> 01:26:09,773
How many times do I have to say sorry?

962
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:12,943
Some wounds never heal.

963
01:26:12,985 --> 01:26:15,487
So be careful, okay Sara?

964
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:17,364
This is no life for me.

965
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,199
What do you mean?

966
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:20,325
You understand.

967
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:21,535
Go see François,

968
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:23,829
if he wants you, and you want him,

969
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:25,789
there's nothing simpler.

970
01:26:25,831 --> 01:26:27,166
I'll go back home.

971
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:30,669
Think I want to go back to François?

972
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:34,757
I've done that, thanks.
No desire to do it again!

973
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:36,300
Maybe the desire is his.

974
01:26:36,341 --> 01:26:37,634
He was drunk!

975
01:26:37,676 --> 01:26:39,845
He doesn't drink, so stop!

976
01:26:39,887 --> 01:26:41,305
François doesn't drink.

977
01:26:41,972 --> 01:26:45,851
So you go see him, or I will.
Want me to?

978
01:26:45,893 --> 01:26:48,312
Settle your scores
between yourselves.

979
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:51,231
Man to man, as if it didn't concern me.

980
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:55,110
I pulled my head away, I said!

981
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:58,405
Is my word worthless?
Why am I even talking?

982
01:26:59,865 --> 01:27:01,033
Fuck all this.

983
01:27:01,408 --> 01:27:05,371
Fuck all this,
fuck the balcony, fuck the kitchen!

984
01:27:05,412 --> 01:27:09,708
- I'll go back home, fuck this!
- Go on, go back to Vitry!

985
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:28,977
Thanks, Alice, see you.

986
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:31,897
See you tomorrow, Sara.

987
01:27:44,868 --> 01:27:45,911
Yes?

988
01:27:45,953 --> 01:27:47,037
<i>Sara...</i>

989
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:49,331
<i>Now we know.</i>

990
01:28:03,887 --> 01:28:06,306
Didn't you know I loved you back then?

991
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:09,768
<i>I thought you'd leave me.</i>

992
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:12,688
<i>I wanted to be the first to go.</i>

993
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,085
None of that matters.

994
01:28:35,919 --> 01:28:38,380
Life's not over,
look how good we are.

995
01:28:38,422 --> 01:28:39,923
It does matter.

996
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:44,011
I couldn't live with you,
even though I loved you.

997
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:48,307
It's sad...

998
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:53,854
not being able to live
with the man you love, isn't it?

999
01:28:56,732 --> 01:28:58,317
Yes, very sad.

1000
01:28:58,942 --> 01:29:01,820
Now it's impossible. Jean's in pain.

1001
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:05,991
We're so good together.

1002
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:08,827
I have to go home.

1003
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:11,121
I don't want to go home.

1004
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:16,293
We'll meet up again.

1005
01:29:17,294 --> 01:29:19,505
- You sure?
- Positive.

1006
01:29:24,551 --> 01:29:28,138
How long since we've both been alone
in a room?

1007
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:58,335
Turn around.

1008
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,256
No, I'd rather see you.

1009
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:09,221
Turn around so I can stroke your butt.

1010
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:14,309
No, François...

1011
01:30:14,351 --> 01:30:17,312
Be nice, just to make me happy.

1012
01:30:17,938 --> 01:30:19,314
Turn around.

1013
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,366
Don't move.

1014
01:30:33,704 --> 01:30:35,122
- No.
- Wait.

1015
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:36,790
Don't move.

1016
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:37,875
François.

1017
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:41,670
Wait, don't worry.

1018
01:30:41,712 --> 01:30:44,465
Actually I am worrying, François.

1019
01:30:44,757 --> 01:30:45,841
Stop.

1020
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:51,472
I said no.

1021
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:56,685
I want to be ready and I'm not,
that's all.

1022
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:58,145
You're mean.

1023
01:30:58,437 --> 01:31:00,105
I'm leaving now, for good.

1024
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:03,358
Not this. Not this, François.

1025
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,526
Not this.

1026
01:31:05,903 --> 01:31:07,362
I love you! Come!

1027
01:31:07,404 --> 01:31:09,698
I love you too, but you hurt me.

1028
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,616
Come!

1029
01:31:10,866 --> 01:31:12,785
Come, please, come to bed.

1030
01:31:12,826 --> 01:31:13,869
Come!

1031
01:31:16,955 --> 01:31:19,416
I won't go to bed with you,
but okay, I'll stay.

1032
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:27,758
What are you doing?

1033
01:31:30,344 --> 01:31:31,845
You'll just sit there?

1034
01:31:34,848 --> 01:31:35,891
Yes.

1035
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:39,395
I feel like reading.

1036
01:31:46,944 --> 01:31:48,112
Okay...

1037
01:31:48,529 --> 01:31:50,030
I'll stay in bed.

1038
01:31:50,072 --> 01:31:51,824
Go on, stay in bed.

1039
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,515
I won't leave again.

1040
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:23,439
You neither. You won't leave.

1041
01:32:31,321 --> 01:32:32,823
Maybe after...

1042
01:32:35,325 --> 01:32:37,119
I'll buy you a ring.

1043
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:46,879
Going out?

1044
01:32:48,589 --> 01:32:50,424
Marcus never got home.

1045
01:32:50,466 --> 01:32:51,675
Really?

1046
01:32:57,556 --> 01:32:58,932
I'll call you.

1047
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,988
Anyone here see Marcus?

1048
01:33:56,156 --> 01:33:58,367
I'm his father. Have you seen him?

1049
01:33:58,826 --> 01:34:00,452
I saw you with him.

1050
01:34:01,286 --> 01:34:02,830
Know who my son is?

1051
01:34:04,832 --> 01:34:06,125
No one's seen him?

1052
01:34:25,853 --> 01:34:27,062
Mr. Kemas?

1053
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:30,524
- Seen Marcus?
- Nope.

1054
01:34:31,108 --> 01:34:32,860
No one's seen him?

1055
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:34,903
No, I haven't seen him.

1056
01:34:39,867 --> 01:34:43,579
I organize everything by myself
in my brain.

1057
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,456
So maybe...

1058
01:34:45,497 --> 01:34:48,667
how many years have I been alone?

1059
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:50,044
So I made mistakes.

1060
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,921
No, that's not it, it's just...
I don't know.

1061
01:34:53,672 --> 01:34:56,258
Jean, he needs more than me.

1062
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,511
When he was a child,
I'd take him here and there.

1063
01:35:01,013 --> 01:35:03,807
- He doesn't need me anymore.
- Not true.

1064
01:35:03,849 --> 01:35:08,062
You were his first parent
when there was no one, don't say that.

1065
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:10,522
So what do we do?

1066
01:35:10,564 --> 01:35:12,524
Don't know anymore.

1067
01:35:12,566 --> 01:35:15,235
I'll go looking, what else can I do?

1068
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:17,279
- Where?
- I'll walk around.

1069
01:35:17,321 --> 01:35:18,864
I'll end up finding him.

1070
01:36:04,326 --> 01:36:06,370
Know everyone's looking for you?

1071
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,956
Grandmother, father, everyone.

1072
01:36:09,873 --> 01:36:11,208
What are you doing?

1073
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:13,627
Nothing.

1074
01:36:19,091 --> 01:36:21,885
What's wrong, Marcus?
What's going on?

1075
01:36:26,682 --> 01:36:28,559
- Look at me.
- I am.

1076
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,019
No, you're not, you're looking away.

1077
01:36:31,562 --> 01:36:33,063
You're looking elsewhere.

1078
01:36:33,564 --> 01:36:34,732
I see you.

1079
01:36:35,315 --> 01:36:36,567
I see you.

1080
01:36:43,824 --> 01:36:45,909
I prefer looking elsewhere too.

1081
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,286
Sometimes.

1082
01:36:48,287 --> 01:36:51,165
Do what you have to do here
and go.

1083
01:36:54,543 --> 01:36:55,377
Let's go home.

1084
01:37:20,402 --> 01:37:21,445
Yes?

1085
01:37:21,904 --> 01:37:23,989
<i>You'll never guess where I am.</i>

1086
01:37:25,115 --> 01:37:26,283
I don't know.

1087
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:29,536
<i>At your office?</i>

1088
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:30,788
No.

1089
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:33,207
<i>On the street?</i>

1090
01:37:35,501 --> 01:37:38,212
No, I'm not exactly on the street.

1091
01:37:40,422 --> 01:37:41,882
<i>In a park?</i>

1092
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:45,052
No, it looks like a park, but...

1093
01:37:46,178 --> 01:37:48,972
<i>- You sound outside.
</i>- Yes, I'm outside.

1094
01:37:50,849 --> 01:37:54,603
<i>I don't know, you're not on the street,
not in a park.</i>

1095
01:37:54,645 --> 01:37:56,021
On your balcony.

1096
01:37:57,648 --> 01:37:59,066
What do you mean?

1097
01:37:59,108 --> 01:38:00,526
Waiting for Jean.

1098
01:38:21,714 --> 01:38:24,633
- How did it go in Vitry?
- Well.

1099
01:38:24,675 --> 01:38:26,635
- Your son's okay?
- Fine.

1100
01:38:27,136 --> 01:38:28,595
I brought wine.

1101
01:38:31,598 --> 01:38:33,142
I need to talk to you.

1102
01:38:44,778 --> 01:38:46,196
Bastard.

1103
01:39:35,788 --> 01:39:38,040
I'm going to stop working
with François.

1104
01:39:38,874 --> 01:39:40,959
Why? You were so happy.

1105
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,880
I was happy, now I'm not.

1106
01:39:45,339 --> 01:39:46,548
Is there a reason?

1107
01:39:47,925 --> 01:39:49,343
Yes, probably.

1108
01:39:49,968 --> 01:39:51,720
What kind of reason?

1109
01:39:54,765 --> 01:39:57,726
- He says things I don't like.
- What things?

1110
01:39:58,477 --> 01:39:59,478
Things.

1111
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,947
Can I help?

1112
01:40:09,988 --> 01:40:11,407
You want to help me?

1113
01:40:11,448 --> 01:40:12,574
You?

1114
01:40:14,326 --> 01:40:16,120
What did François tell you?

1115
01:40:19,331 --> 01:40:20,999
That I should leave you.

1116
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:23,252
That's what he said.

1117
01:40:23,293 --> 01:40:25,629
He gets to decide?
Leave me why?

1118
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:28,048
Come on, please. Don't insist.

1119
01:40:29,133 --> 01:40:30,509
Scared to hurt me?

1120
01:40:34,179 --> 01:40:36,140
He said you're a bad person.

1121
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:40,477
That you're fake, not sincere,
that's what he said.

1122
01:40:40,519 --> 01:40:42,312
- I'm not sincere?
- Yeah.

1123
01:40:42,896 --> 01:40:44,440
I'm fake?

1124
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,027
- That's a good one! Me?
- Yes, you.

1125
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:50,279
Not bad!

1126
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,613
Really not bad!

1127
01:40:51,655 --> 01:40:53,031
Not bad, right?

1128
01:40:53,866 --> 01:40:55,534
Yeah, it's not bad.

1129
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:59,288
He says you play both sides,
that I should be wary.

1130
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:04,001
Shouldn't you be wary of him, maybe?
What nerve!

1131
01:41:04,043 --> 01:41:06,920
Why does he say I'm fake?
Any examples?

1132
01:41:06,962 --> 01:41:10,132
To prove I'm a bad person,
as you say?

1133
01:41:10,174 --> 01:41:12,885
He says I stop you
from being with him.

1134
01:41:13,802 --> 01:41:14,511
Excuse me?

1135
01:41:14,845 --> 01:41:18,557
He says you want to be with him
and I stop you, get it?

1136
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:23,020
That you lie to me, that you love him
and want to be with him.

1137
01:41:23,062 --> 01:41:24,354
Oh yeah?

1138
01:41:24,396 --> 01:41:27,733
That's not true, Jean.
That's just him talking.

1139
01:41:27,775 --> 01:41:30,110
Why does he say it, in your opinion?

1140
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,571
Simply because it's true.

1141
01:41:32,613 --> 01:41:35,115
Why do you believe him and not me?

1142
01:41:35,491 --> 01:41:36,784
Are you in his grip?

1143
01:41:38,369 --> 01:41:40,245
No, I'm not in his grip.

1144
01:41:40,913 --> 01:41:42,247
No, it's just...

1145
01:41:42,623 --> 01:41:44,917
he showed me your texts.

1146
01:41:53,884 --> 01:41:55,677
I don't want to see you anymore.

1147
01:42:03,811 --> 01:42:05,854
Leave, please, leave.

1148
01:42:05,896 --> 01:42:07,231
What texts?

1149
01:42:08,774 --> 01:42:11,527
I never sent a text
that would bother you.

1150
01:42:11,819 --> 01:42:14,238
- Leave.
- I'm not afraid.

1151
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:15,447
Glad to hear it.

1152
01:42:15,948 --> 01:42:17,449
Now get out.

1153
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:19,410
What texts? There are none.

1154
01:42:19,952 --> 01:42:22,162
Stop repeating "What texts",

1155
01:42:22,204 --> 01:42:23,747
I saw them!

1156
01:42:23,789 --> 01:42:25,457
- It's not true.
- Get out.

1157
01:42:25,499 --> 01:42:27,167
It's not true.

1158
01:42:27,209 --> 01:42:29,962
There's no use lying, really.
Get out.

1159
01:42:30,921 --> 01:42:33,382
What texts? What did they say?

1160
01:42:33,424 --> 01:42:34,675
They said...

1161
01:42:35,175 --> 01:42:36,677
want to know what they said?

1162
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,846
They said: "Love."

1163
01:42:40,597 --> 01:42:41,932
"I love you."

1164
01:42:43,434 --> 01:42:46,937
"I think about you,"
"I love... your smile."

1165
01:42:47,271 --> 01:42:48,772
"I love your scent."

1166
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,025
"No one can tear us apart."

1167
01:42:52,067 --> 01:42:54,987
He said nothing? It's all on me?

1168
01:42:55,028 --> 01:42:57,030
I don't give a fuck about him!

1169
01:42:57,072 --> 01:42:58,741
Move or I'll move you.

1170
01:42:58,782 --> 01:43:00,534
Move or I'll move you.

1171
01:43:03,495 --> 01:43:04,830
Fuck!

1172
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:08,917
I can't stand it anymore.

1173
01:43:08,959 --> 01:43:10,502
I can't stand it anymore.

1174
01:43:11,128 --> 01:43:14,590
What did I do wrong?
What did I do to deserve this?

1175
01:43:14,631 --> 01:43:17,718
- Why is this happening to me?
- I can't stand it!

1176
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:20,512
Want to drive me crazy?

1177
01:43:20,554 --> 01:43:21,680
You won't!

1178
01:43:21,722 --> 01:43:23,682
You won't be able to!

1179
01:43:23,724 --> 01:43:26,852
You know why?
Because it's over!

1180
01:43:26,894 --> 01:43:28,771
It's over, I don't care!

1181
01:43:28,812 --> 01:43:31,982
- Stop this game! Stop it!
- What game?

1182
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,819
You think I was ever free in my life?

1183
01:43:35,861 --> 01:43:37,946
No idea! I don't give a fuck!

1184
01:43:37,988 --> 01:43:39,364
Listen to me!

1185
01:43:39,406 --> 01:43:42,409
Do I have to go to prison
for you to listen?

1186
01:43:42,451 --> 01:43:45,746
I was never free, never!

1187
01:43:45,788 --> 01:43:49,333
My whole life, I toe the line.
Obey, obey, obey!

1188
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:52,044
I don't give a fuck! Figure it out!

1189
01:43:52,086 --> 01:43:53,504
I can't live this, hear?

1190
01:43:53,837 --> 01:43:55,339
I can't live this anymore!

1191
01:43:55,381 --> 01:43:57,424
I'm going home to Vitry, hear?

1192
01:43:57,466 --> 01:43:59,593
I'm going. I'm leaving now.

1193
01:43:59,635 --> 01:44:00,969
Let me explain.

1194
01:44:01,553 --> 01:44:04,681
- Let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain!

1195
01:44:05,307 --> 01:44:06,850
You don't understand.

1196
01:44:06,892 --> 01:44:08,644
Go on, call him!

1197
01:44:08,685 --> 01:44:12,272
Stop going on about him!
I don't give a fuck about him!

1198
01:44:12,314 --> 01:44:14,358
He doesn't give a fuck either!

1199
01:44:14,942 --> 01:44:17,569
He says you hurt and betray,
that's what!

1200
01:44:17,611 --> 01:44:20,531
Stop saying horrible things about me.

1201
01:44:21,365 --> 01:44:24,535
It's not true, you know it's not true.

1202
01:44:27,746 --> 01:44:30,040
Stop bobbing like that, stop!

1203
01:44:30,082 --> 01:44:31,417
Stop bobbing!

1204
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:33,752
Calm down, stop screaming.

1205
01:44:33,794 --> 01:44:36,088
Let's stop... let's stop.

1206
01:44:37,297 --> 01:44:38,799
Stop screaming.

1207
01:44:39,717 --> 01:44:41,260
I'm not screaming.

1208
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:42,761
No, I'm calm.

1209
01:44:44,638 --> 01:44:46,014
Forgive me.

1210
01:44:48,267 --> 01:44:50,269
- Forgive you?
- Sorry.

1211
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:52,187
You're asking for forgiveness?

1212
01:44:52,646 --> 01:44:55,274
- I thought you did nothing wrong.
- I did.

1213
01:44:55,816 --> 01:44:57,359
I did something wrong.

1214
01:44:57,401 --> 01:45:00,195
Of course, I did something wrong.

1215
01:45:00,237 --> 01:45:02,281
But I was unsettled, lost.

1216
01:45:02,322 --> 01:45:05,159
It's over now.
I didn't know where I was.

1217
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,953
But... I didn't betray you.

1218
01:45:07,995 --> 01:45:12,624
I didn't betray you, I betrayed myself.

1219
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:15,711
Now I know, now I'm sure.

1220
01:45:15,753 --> 01:45:18,005
- Let me show you.
- Stay away.

1221
01:45:18,047 --> 01:45:20,090
- Can I come closer?
- Stay away.

1222
01:45:20,132 --> 01:45:22,801
- Please.
- I don't want you touching me!

1223
01:45:22,843 --> 01:45:23,844
Do you hear me?

1224
01:45:23,886 --> 01:45:25,471
Can I put my hand...

1225
01:45:25,512 --> 01:45:27,014
- On my forehead?
- Yes.

1226
01:45:27,056 --> 01:45:28,515
Why, to soothe me?

1227
01:45:28,557 --> 01:45:30,434
Want to soothe me? Right!

1228
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:33,562
Know what?
You make me want to vomit.

1229
01:45:34,313 --> 01:45:35,773
I want to vomit.

1230
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:38,233
You may not have a life,
but I do!

1231
01:45:38,275 --> 01:45:41,570
I may not have a credit card,
but I have a life.

1232
01:45:41,612 --> 01:45:44,156
- And it'll always be mine.
- Of course.

1233
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:45,449
Listen!

1234
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,659
Stop saying "of course."

1235
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:50,829
I have a life and I'm going home, okay?

1236
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,043
You had the angel.

1237
01:45:57,086 --> 01:45:58,837
Now you'll have the devil.

1238
01:46:00,047 --> 01:46:01,507
Too bad for you.

1239
01:46:02,549 --> 01:46:04,301
I'll destroy everything!

1240
01:46:04,343 --> 01:46:05,969
- I'll wreck it all.
- Stop!

1241
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,013
I'll wreck it all.

1242
01:46:10,557 --> 01:46:13,477
There's a gun here, it's loaded too.

1243
01:46:16,188 --> 01:46:18,774
Think I'll go back to prison
to make you happy?

1244
01:46:23,237 --> 01:46:25,239
Want to know what I think of you?

1245
01:46:28,367 --> 01:46:30,285
You're a bitch, a slut.

1246
01:46:36,291 --> 01:46:37,334
Fuck.

1247
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,418
Sara, call me.

1248
01:47:21,128 --> 01:47:22,588
Call me back.

1249
01:47:54,036 --> 01:47:55,537
I'd like to talk to you.

1250
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:00,667
Yes.

1251
01:48:06,924 --> 01:48:08,926
I need to catch my breath too.

1252
01:48:12,679 --> 01:48:15,349
The other day,
when you said you loved François,

1253
01:48:16,975 --> 01:48:18,352
it hurt.

1254
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:21,772
Physically.

1255
01:48:23,524 --> 01:48:24,775
Like...

1256
01:48:25,943 --> 01:48:28,153
my ribs tore through my chest.

1257
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:31,615
My heart tore through my chest.

1258
01:48:33,367 --> 01:48:34,410
But...

1259
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,912
now it's over...

1260
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:38,956
I've thought it over.

1261
01:48:40,165 --> 01:48:42,292
It's like I've been set free.

1262
01:48:44,503 --> 01:48:46,422
And I also wanted to tell you

1263
01:48:46,797 --> 01:48:48,173
something else.

1264
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,593
If you agree,

1265
01:48:52,594 --> 01:48:53,887
I'd like...

1266
01:48:54,888 --> 01:48:57,349
to stay with you forever.

1267
01:49:00,602 --> 01:49:01,687
But,

1268
01:49:02,438 --> 01:49:04,231
if you love François,

1269
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:06,817
and if he loves you,

1270
01:49:07,234 --> 01:49:09,194
go and live.

1271
01:49:09,486 --> 01:49:11,280
I'll let you live.

1272
01:49:14,241 --> 01:49:15,826
I'll go back to Vitry.

1273
01:49:18,078 --> 01:49:20,122
Because you met François

1274
01:49:20,748 --> 01:49:21,582
before me.

1275
01:49:24,543 --> 01:49:26,086
And also...

1276
01:49:27,546 --> 01:49:29,423
I want you to know...

1277
01:49:30,382 --> 01:49:31,800
that today I'm capable of...

1278
01:49:32,718 --> 01:49:34,762
living without the person I love.

1279
01:49:36,764 --> 01:49:38,474
And if you're happy,

1280
01:49:41,894 --> 01:49:43,604
I think I'll be happy.

1281
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:54,490
Not interested
by what I have to say?

1282
01:50:21,642 --> 01:50:23,227
It's fried.

1283
01:50:30,984 --> 01:50:32,528
Everything's erased?

1284
01:50:32,778 --> 01:50:34,947
Yes, there's nothing left.

1285
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:46,250
No nothing, no numbers?

1286
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:47,751
Nothing.

1287
01:50:49,336 --> 01:50:50,796
Nothing?

1288
01:50:54,591 --> 01:50:55,801
Thank you.

1289
01:51:40,471 --> 01:51:44,475
