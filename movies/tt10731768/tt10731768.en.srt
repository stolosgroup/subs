Clear the area!
Get out of my way!

Just come with me, okay?

21
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,208
I'm here to help.

22
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,625
It's over.

23
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,583
Just…

24
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,166
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,041
No, no, no, no!

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,333
<i>The past is like a dream.</i>

27
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,541
{\an8}<i>There are memories that shape us,</i>

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,208
{\an8}<i>molding us into what we've become.</i>

29
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,541
{\an8}<i>A mosaic of images and feelings</i>

30
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,666
{\an8}<i>that offers some truth
about how we got here,</i>

31
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,625
{\an8}<i>even if details have blurred with time.</i>

32
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,958
{\an8}Sit down.

33
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,750
{\an8}You know this is all yours?

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,500
{\an8}Mm.

35
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,583
{\an8}What ya lookin' at, man?

36
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,875
{\an8}I'm lookin' at you, woman.

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,833
{\an8}- I love you.
- Love you too.

38
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,833
{\an8}<i>As the years pass, we realize</i>

39
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,458
{\an8}<i>we are nothing more
than the experiences that made us.</i>

40
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,791
{\an8}- Hi, Amanda.
- Hi.

41
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,235
{\an8}- Doc.
- Mr. Cooper.

42
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,291
{\an8}Is it back?

43
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,208
{\an8}Yes. We'll go over the options,

44
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,791
{\an8}but Infirmam is still the most effective
way to cure this type of cancer.

45
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,708
{\an8}We've already leveraged everything.

46
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,208
{\an8}<i>The pain has brought us closer together.</i>

47
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,333
{\an8}<i>And watching her grow…
has been to find myself again.</i>

48
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,166
Surprise!

49
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
Here, mama. This is for you.

50
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,625
I mean, it's not much,
but it's all they had at the gift shop.

51
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,208
- Oh.
- Her name is Paloma.

52
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,791
No, it's perfect. Thank you, Mom.

53
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,666
<i>But sometimes I wonder,</i>

54
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,666
<i>"Are these </i>my <i>memories,</i>

55
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,291
<i>or are they hers?"</i>

56
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,708
Put your hips into it. Again.

57
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,250
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that was clean.

58
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,833
- Lock that wrist so it don't get weak.
- It won't!

59
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,041
There are no rules in a fight,
people do not...

60
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,583
- Whoa!
- Fight fair!

61
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,125
How do you win an unfair fight?

62
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
Ah!

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,041
- You always fight harder.
- That's right.

64
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,416
Let me train her, Coop.
She's got what it takes.

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,333
That's my sweet girl.

66
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,458
- Done.
- Done?

67
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,625
Thank you, baby.

68
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,708
Go on.

69
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,291
{\an8}<i>Parents and their children.</i>

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,708
{\an8}<i>Where do we stop and they begin?</i>

71
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,625
Mr. Cooper. Ray.

72
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,708
- Doc.
- I have good news.

73
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,875
We just got word

74
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,916
a very effective generic version
of Infirmam, called Spero,

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
is in the final stages of FDA approval.

76
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,875
This is great news, Ray.

77
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,708
Did you do this?

78
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,103
- You did, didn't you?
- What?

79
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,666
This was your birthday wish,
wasn't it?

80
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,333
I love you. Let's go tell Mom.

81
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,500
We were supposed to start
a new medication.

82
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,458
You know when that's supposed to happen?

83
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,583
I… You'll have to talk with Dr. Wu.

84
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,500
Dad, what's happening?

85
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,041
Dr. Wu?

86
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,750
Dr. Wu!

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,250
- Hi, Ray.
- What's goin' on?

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,000
You said Amanda was
gonna start Spero soon.

89
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,208
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,166
Amanda's on my list of patients to see.

91
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,833
The company that makes the generic drug

92
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,208
pulled it off the market.

93
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,458
What are you talkin' about?

94
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,958
BioPrime, the makers of Infirmam,

95
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,666
paid the manufacturer
to delay Spero's release.

96
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,583
- Delay?
- For how long?

97
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Indefinitely.

98
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,875
Ray.

99
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,958
You told me
that my wife was gonna be okay.

100
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,291
I am delivering the same news
to three other patients today…

101
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,958
…two of them kids.

102
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,291
I am so sorry.

103
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,541
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,541
<i>Welcome back.</i>

105
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,291
For those just joining, I'm here
with BioPrime CEO, Simon Keeley,

106
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,958
and Congresswoman
Diana Morgan of Pennsylvania.

107
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,208
Congresswoman Morgan,
why are you here today?

108
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,500
<i>Well, I've always taken a hard line
against pharmaceutical lobbies</i>

109
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,708
<i>and mass corporations, like BioPrime.</i>

110
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,416
With all due respect, Congresswoman,

111
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,791
BioPrime is unlike any other
pharmaceutical company in the world.

112
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,375
<i>Our scientists have created</i>

113
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,333
<i>the most effective treatments
in the fight against cancer.</i>

114
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,333
<i>Specifically with Infirmam,
a drug that has increased life expectancy</i>

115
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,083
<i>in 86% of patients treated.</i>

116
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,833
<i>Mr. Keeley, it is not the efficacy
that's in question.</i>

117
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,750
<i>It's the business practices.
It's the company's business practices.</i>

118
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,666
<i>I believe that we all
have a basic human right</i>

119
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,458
{\an8}<i>to safe, affordable medication.</i>

120
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:59,333
{\an8}<i>Yeah. Um, this talking point
of health care as a human right.</i>

121
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,916
<i>Our medicines,
they are a matter of research and science.</i>

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,125
{\an8}<i>The investment is not only risky,
it is extremely expensive.</i>

123
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,041
<i>All right. We have</i>
<i>eager callers that wanna weigh in.</i>

124
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,750
<i>Can you please explain?</i>
<i>Because I just don't understand.</i>

125
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,750
<i>It's crazy that a pill can cost that much.</i>

126
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,291
Yeah, this is, uh, a tricky issue.

127
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,416
Uh, and don't get fooled
by the talking points

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,333
of… of politicians from Washington.

129
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,541
<i>Mr. Keeley,
according to your own internal documents,</i>

130
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,666
<i>the cost of an entire course
of treatment is only four dollars.</i>

131
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,125
You're absolutely right.
A… A course of treatment <i>is </i>four dollars.

132
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,875
But it's funny how you failed to mention
the billions of dollars spent on…

133
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,500
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Ray Cooper.

134
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,833
…rebates, discounts,
insurance companies, wholesalers. Look,

135
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,333
{\an8}<i>I'm here because BioPrime</i>

136
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,583
{\an8}<i>is committed to healing the world.</i>

137
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,750
{\an8}<i>And if you look at the numbers,
that is exactly what we're doing.</i>

138
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,166
{\an8}- <i>That is </i>not <i>what you are doing.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

139
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,458
{\an8}<i>Just to interject,
our next caller is from Pittsburgh.</i>

140
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,791
<i>Ray, do you have something
to say to Mr. Keeley?</i>

141
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,458
My wife is dying in a hospital
because you pulled Spero off the market.

142
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,875
<i>Paying competitors
to shelve generic brands of drugs?</i>

143
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,500
<i>That is immoral, Mr. Keeley.</i>

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,458
Well…

145
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,625
…Ray…

146
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,875
Is it... Should... Can I?

147
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,875
Uh, I just wanna talk to Ray directly.

148
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,000
<i>Listen.</i>

149
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,208
{\an8}<i>Uh, first of all,
I'd just like to say I'm so sorry</i>

150
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,833
{\an8}<i>to hear about your wife.</i>

151
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>Uh, believe it or not,</i>

152
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,250
{\an8}<i>BioPrime is dedicated to </i>saving <i>lives.</i>

153
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,458
Saving lives?
You're geared towards makin' a profit.

154
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,083
We've already refinanced our house.

155
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,000
I've taken every double shift I can get.

156
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,041
You've already taken everything from me!

157
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,041
<i>Ray,</i>
<i>the sad reality is that cancer</i>

158
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,916
is still very often a death sentence.

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>Uh…</i>

160
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>In the short term, what would we give?</i>

161
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,750
<i>What is the cost</i>

162
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,291
<i>of spending just a little bit
more time with a loved one?</i>

163
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,000
A year, a… a month, a day?

164
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,083
Mmm, it's impossible to put a price on.

165
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,333
If my wife dies,

166
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,791
<i>it's </i>your <i>death sentence.</i>

167
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,041
I will hunt you down
and kill you with my bare hands.

168
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,125
Dad?

169
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,750
What ya lookin' at, man?

170
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,666
I'm lookin' at you, woman.

171
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,375
Oh God!

172
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,750
Oh my God!

173
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh, Amanda!

174
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,583
Oh God!

175
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,083
Oh God!

176
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,583
No!

177
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,208
Fuck, no!

178
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,708
Amanda, no!

179
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,458
No!

180
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,833
Bye.

181
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,375
- Ah, God damn it.
- What? Hospital bill?

182
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,625
Just… put it at the bottom of the pile.

183
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,708
- We can't ignore it.
- Sure you can.

184
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,666
We voted for universal health care. Just…

185
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,750
Tell 'em we're taking a political stance.

186
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,125
Hmm.

187
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,083
No, we are not eating that
three nights in a row.

188
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,684
- C'mon. You know you love this too.
- It's not happening.

189
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,041
We're gonna order
something with vegetables.

190
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,333
Fries do not count.

191
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,375
- Hey!
- No. Stop.

192
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,833
Ah! Stop ticklin' me.

193
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,041
Stop it.

194
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,875
- Hello?
<i>- Ray Cooper?</i>

195
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,250
<i>My name is Martin Bennett.</i>
<i>I'm a journalist for </i>VICE.

196
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,291
<i>I'm doing a story on BioPrime, and
I saw your call with Simon Keeley on TV.</i>

197
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,250
What do you want?

198
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,166
<i>I can help you get justice
for what happened to your wife.</i>

199
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,708
No, you can't. I've been down that road.

200
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,541
<i>I have proof
that crimes have been committed.</i>

201
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,958
<i>Crimes that can land
some very powerful people in jail.</i>

202
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,458
- Keeley?
- Who's that?

203
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,375
<i>Especially Keeley.
We need to talk in person.</i>

204
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,583
- You can talk now. Now you have me.
- <i>Not over the phone.</i>

205
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:24,000
<i>Meet me at Gateway Station in 20 minutes.
I won't waste your time.</i>

206
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,833
Who was that?

207
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,208
I'll be right back.

208
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,916
What do you want? Chinese or Subway?

209
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,083
No, it's cool. I'll come with you,
and we can pick it up on the way.

210
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,541
Not gonna happen, Rae.
Sit there and finish that homework.

211
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,375
That's not fair.

212
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,958
Life's not fair.

213
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,250
Chinese?

214
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,125
Lock the door behind me.

215
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,708
- I love you.
- Love you.

216
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,916
Excuse me.

217
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,083
Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?

218
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,458
- <i>Get on the incoming train.</i>
- You were supposed to meet me here.

219
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,458
<i>Trust me, Ray. Just get on the train.</i>

220
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,083
<i>Are you on the train?</i>

221
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,500
- Yeah. Now what?
- <i>Don't hang up. Just stay on the line.</i>

222
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>Just sit tight.</i>

223
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
<i>Get off at this station.</i>

224
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay, where now?

225
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,875
<i>There's a woman in a striped coat
and a hipster guy with a scarf.</i>

226
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,500
<i>- You see where they're headed?</i>
- Yeah. To street level.

227
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,750
<i>All right. There's a guy in a denim jacket
going up the stairs.</i>

228
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,375
<i>I want you to follow that guy.
Hang back, but don't lose him.</i>

229
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>Stand by.</i>

230
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>Head to the south platform</i>

231
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,916
and take the Red Line
towards Allegheny Station. Okay?

232
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,791
<i>Stay on the line.</i>

233
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,541
- Bennett?
- Yeah. Martin.

234
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,500
Look, sorry about all this train hopping,
but it's just a precaution.

235
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,875
Okay, honestly,

236
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,083
I'm a little afraid of
how deep this thing might go.

237
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,250
What does that mean?

238
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,083
I got a source who told me
about BioPrime's payouts

239
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,541
to multiple offshore shell corporations.

240
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,875
Bribery, cover-ups, who knows what else.
All this leads to Simon Keeley.

241
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,041
There are other players
at both the state and federal level.

242
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,291
But recently, communication went silent.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,291
You told me you had proof.

244
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,541
Enough to tie Keeley to bribes
that pulled Spero off the market.

245
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,505
But without my source,
I can't connect the dots.

246
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,833
You're wastin' my time.

247
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,541
I have enough
to bring public concern against BioPrime,

248
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,000
but I do not have enough
to take them down.

249
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,500
That's why I need you, your story.

250
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,416
- I just...
- Look, just think about it.

251
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,083
Look, "Local family gets ravaged
by Big Pharma's greed."

252
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,250
You gotta help me, Ray.

253
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,208
Family, human interest.
That's what grabs headlines.

254
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,916
We can blow this thing wide open.

255
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,500
We can take down BioPrime.
We can bring Simon Keeley to his knees.

256
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,625
Hey!

257
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,250
Dad!

258
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,458
Run!

259
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,375
Hey!

260
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,916
Rachel.

261
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,208
Rachel, baby, are you okay? Look at me.

262
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,166
Just like your dad.

263
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,750
Not about strength.

264
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,583
Okay, top. Top. Up, up, up!

265
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,083
Hands up. Hands up. Move.

266
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,666
Again. Hit him again.
Control him. Let's go.

267
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,708
Come on. You can take anyone.

268
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,583
Beautiful. There it is.

269
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,708
Nice. Top, top, top, top!
Watch the scramble.

270
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,791
All right.

271
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,791
Hooks in. Get it. Get him in. Here.

272
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,291
Pick your shots.

273
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,458
That's it. Open him up.

274
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,916
You got it. Lock it in.

275
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,791
Beautiful.

276
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,458
Just hold. Hold, hold.

277
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,875
He's tapping, Rachel.

278
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,458
Rachel, he's tapping.

279
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,375
He's tapping, Rachel. Rachel!

280
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:37,833
Rachel!

281
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,750
Rachel!

282
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,125
Today, I am thrilled
to announce a bipartisan bill

283
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,458
that will make true progress
in the war to find a cure for cancer.

284
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,166
In collaboration with the CDC and the NIH,

285
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,583
we are creating a strategic partnership

286
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,750
with BioPrime Pharmaceuticals.

287
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:17,166
Thanks to the effort
of BioPrime CEO, Simon Keeley,

288
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,000
and chairman, Vinod Shah,

289
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,041
this bill will effectively cap
the cost of treatment.

290
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,166
{\an8}<i>Finally, many of BioPrime's
breakthrough treatments</i>

291
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,333
<i>that used to cost
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars</i>

292
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,375
<i>will now be available
to the public at affordable prices.</i>

293
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,208
<i>I told the American people</i>

294
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,291
<i>that I would hold companies
like BioPrime accountable,</i>

295
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,666
<i>and I have delivered on that promise.</i>

296
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,791
<i>We are cleaning out the rot.</i>

297
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,916
<i>Yes?</i>

298
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,916
<i>Are you planning on running...</i>

299
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,375
Again?

300
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,000
I wasn't watching it. You were.

301
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,750
I had a dream last night

302
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,583
about that trip we took
with Mom in the woods.

303
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,041
My memory's kind of fading of her.

304
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:15,416
I don't know. It's like I'm losing these
tiny pieces of her every day, and I just…

305
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know.
I miss her. I miss our family.

306
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,583
Me too.

307
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,750
I miss her too.

308
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,583
What are you planning to do?

309
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,250
I just need to make sense of this.

310
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:51,208
- I need to know.
- Just… Just leave it alone, okay?

311
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,750
They already investigated,
and they didn't find anything.

312
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,000
Or the guy who tried to kill you.

313
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,333
It just was a dead-end conspiracy.

314
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,375
I don't believe that.

315
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,083
<i>You </i>don't believe that.

316
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,958
I need to try.

317
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,041
Keep it close, Mike.

318
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,291
- I don't know how long I'll be.
- Yes, sir.

319
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,750
- Mr. Keeley.
- Ah.

320
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,208
Appreciate it.

321
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,958
Don't let me go dry tonight, will you?

322
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,833
<i>Good evening.</i>

323
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,208
<i>I'm proud to kick off
this first annual event</i>

324
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,166
by introducing you to the CEO of BioPrime,

325
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,166
Mr. Simon Keeley.

326
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,625
Nice to see you, Simon.

327
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,666
Thank you.

328
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,250
Thank you very much. Hello, everyone.

329
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,333
T. S. Eliot said,

330
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,666
"We shall not cease in exploration."

331
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:58,625
We've joined forces
with Goa Capital Partners

332
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:02,166
in hopes of raising ten million dollars…

333
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,875
For... That's right. I know you got it.

334
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,250
Excuse me.

335
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,666
<i>For medicine and assistance…</i>

336
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,625
For children in Africa.

337
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,833
India. Sorry.

338
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:25,333
Either way,
both places need a lot of help.

339
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,583
Thanks again for coming.

340
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,916
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Simon Keeley.

341
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,166
Simon, Simon, Simon.

342
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,208
India, Africa? Africa, India?

343
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,250
Hmm?

344
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,291
You know what?
I am so sick of doing your job for ya.

345
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm doing my job, Simon.
Everyone's here because of me.

346
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,041
There's some important people here.

347
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,458
Might want to mingle
with more than your cocktails.

348
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,375
Sure, all right. Good to see ya.

349
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,166
What the fuck?

350
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:45,958
Who would…?

351
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:52,083
- Sir?
- You kidding? Give me a napkin.

352
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,666
…why I agree to participate
in this bullshit in the first place.

353
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,916
- <i>Let's start the auction.</i>
- Fucking balls are wet.

354
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,625
- It's out of order.
- No shit. How'd you figure that out?

355
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,083
Sir. Sir, there's another bathroom
down the stairs.

356
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,083
Well, let's go to it, then. All right?

357
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,416
Wait here. Keep a lookout.

358
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,291
Hey, hey, hey!

359
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,625
- Hmm?
- What the… fuck?

360
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,083
You were warned.

361
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,416
If anything happened to her,
I would hunt you down.

362
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,958
All made her suffer,
but she died because of you.

363
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,041
I didn't kill anyone, you psycho fuck.
Cancer did.

364
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,125
You paid someone to kill Martin Bennett.

365
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,125
- What? Martin?
- He was investigating your bribes.

366
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:51,500
What the… What are you talking about?
I don't know any Martin Bennett.

367
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,250
- You're the goddamn CEO of BioPrime.
- All right.

368
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:58,125
I authorize a bribe now and again,
but it's not like I read the fine print.

369
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,875
Okay, now, stop! Stop!

370
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,416
Fuck!

371
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,916
All right. Uh…

372
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,750
It must have been Vinod Shah. Okay?

373
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:12,041
Nothing happens without his sign-off.
He's the one that brought me on, okay?

374
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,833
You have no idea what you're getting into.

375
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,791
Get him.

376
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,250
Hey!

377
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,500
Here. Handle it. Do it!

378
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:35,083
Fuck!

379
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,208
No!

380
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,416
Oh shit!

381
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,541
Come here, you little bitch!

382
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
<i>Sold! 50,000 dollars.</i>

383
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,041
Rae?

384
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:09,666
Rachel.

385
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Rachel.

386
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:17,833
Dad? You're hurt.

387
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,291
I'm fine. I need you to pack up.
Only what we need.

388
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,666
- When are we coming back?
- We're not.

389
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,250
Is that his blood?

390
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,375
I… I had no choice. He had a gun.

391
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,583
I told you not to do this.

392
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,833
People are gonna come after us,
aren't they?

393
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,541
I don't know.

394
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,625
But we need to go.
Please go pack our stuff.

395
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,625
Go pack!

396
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:28,333
Mr. Asbury,
I'm Special Agent Sarah Meeker.

397
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,791
I already gave a statement.

398
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,916
Your partner,
he took a bullet to the head tonight.

399
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,333
Did you hear any gunshots?

400
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,541
No.

401
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,958
Did you hear anything at all
before losing consciousness?

402
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,583
Somethin' about a woman.

403
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,750
Said, uh…

404
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,375
"All of them made her suffer."

405
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:59,333
- Or… "All made her suffer." I don't know.
- What do you mean? All what? All who?

406
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,916
- I don't know.
- Okay.

407
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,166
- Do you remember anything else?
- No.

408
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,416
Thank you.

409
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,958
Come on.

410
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,458
But wait.

411
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,500
Whoever it was said they warned him.

412
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,666
They said they'd come for Mr. Keeley
if anything happened to the woman.

413
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,666
All right. Thank you.

414
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,375
Let's do a check on all death threats
Keeley may have gotten in the past.

415
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,333
You got it.

416
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,666
It's a long drive to Toronto
on these back roads.

417
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,750
Especially if we're not talking.

418
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,666
Talk to Paloma.

419
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,916
We ran all the Keeley death threats,
and we got a match.

420
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,250
Her name is Amanda Cooper.

421
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,500
Died at Carnegie Medical a few years back.

422
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,541
Her husband's Oldsmobile
was at the auction.

423
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,000
And we found this too.

424
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,125
<i>It's impossible to put a price on.</i>

425
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:47,458
<i>If my wife dies,</i>
<i>it's </i>your <i>death sentence.</i>

426
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,208
<i>I will hunt you down
and kill you with my bare hands.</i>

427
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,142
- <i>We're gonna take...</i>
- "All made her suffer"?

428
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,041
Right.

429
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,791
Let's put an APB out on Cooper's vehicle.

430
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,166
Here you are.

431
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,416
Got the ID on the driver.

432
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,166
Yeah.

433
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,875
How do you wanna handle this?

434
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,083
Evening.

435
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,833
I'll be right up.

436
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,833
This is Meeker.

437
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:45,541
<i>You're the agent assigned</i>
<i>to what happened at the UNICEF fundraiser.</i>

438
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,833
If you have any information,
please call the tip line.

439
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,958
- An agent will get back to you.
<i>- Yeah, I called the tip line.</i>

440
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,791
<i>- I told them I'm only talkin' to you.</i>
- And who am I speaking to?

441
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,958
<i>Simon Keeley's death was an accident.</i>

442
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:03,083
<i>- It was self-defense.</i>
- How do you know that? Who is this?

443
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,875
I'm gonna tell you
everything that happened.

444
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,500
If you want a crime, look at…

445
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,583
look at what Keeley did.

446
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,916
How many cancer patients died
because of him? Thousands? More?

447
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,666
Where are you, Rachel?

448
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,333
- Goodbye.
- <i>Wait, I can help you.</i>

449
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:26,875
Um…

450
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,708
My dad doesn't know I'm doing this.

451
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:32,625
He's a good man. He…

452
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,458
<i>He just needs help.</i>

453
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,583
Do <i>you </i>need help?

454
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,458
I'm fine.

455
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,541
But I know you think he's guilty.

456
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,333
You've all made up your minds.

457
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,125
<i>But you're wrong.</i>

458
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,250
<i>He's a good, honest man.</i>

459
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,500
<i>And I… need him.</i>

460
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,291
He's all I got.

461
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:05,541
Do you have cash?

462
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,458
<i>Why?</i>

463
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:13,291
When you can, get to a…
a gas station or a Walmart.

464
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,666
<i>They have disposable phones, a burner.</i>

465
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,375
Okay? You get one, and you call me back.

466
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,958
My number is 412-046-4378.

467
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,416
Okay? No one will be able to trace it.
Okay? It's safe.

468
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:30,791
<i>Now say it back to me. It's 412-046-4...</i>

469
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,166
Fuck.

470
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,583
Where'd you get that?

471
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,125
Did you steal that?

472
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,958
I'm just looking at it.

473
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,875
It's fine.

474
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,041
What? It's not like
business is booming down there.

475
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,458
Twenty dollars? Seriously?

476
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,791
We're not done.

477
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:50,333
Look, I know you've always taught me
to do the right thing, okay?

478
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,208
But we're here because of you.

479
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,666
Hmm?

480
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,083
Rachel, look at me.
Look at me. We gotta go.

481
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,166
Come on.

482
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,000
FBI!

483
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,833
We have permission to gain entry.

484
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,625
FBI!

485
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,125
Meeker.

486
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,833
Whoa. We definitely got our suspect.

487
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,666
It's Torres.

488
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,083
You got something?

489
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,250
What?

490
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,625
Where'd this happen?

491
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,166
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

492
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:45,291
So, that APB we put out
on Ray Cooper's vehicle?

493
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,916
It was spotted fleeing the scene

494
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,791
of a double homicide
70 miles north of here.

495
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,750
Rae, I don't think
I can make it to Toronto.

496
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,166
You know those men were sent to kill us.

497
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:06,000
I had no choice.

498
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,916
I just hate this.

499
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,458
It runs, if you're askin'.

500
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,916
Like an odds-on favorite
at the Kentucky Derby.

501
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,958
You take cash?

502
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:41,708
We need to stay off the road
until I figure out what's goin' on.

503
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,208
I'm gonna look around.

504
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,833
You wanna come with me?

505
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,125
Huh?

506
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,458
Okay.

507
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,583
I'll be right back.

508
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,083
If they found us at the motel,
they'll find us anywhere.

509
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,333
It's gonna be okay, Rae.
I'm gonna keep you safe.

510
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,083
They're coming to hurt you.

511
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,958
That's why I need to stop this.
It needs to finish.

512
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:31,875
I have to go after Shah.

513
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,500
You plan on using that?

514
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,333
No, but I need to be ready.

515
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:13,166
Do you know how to shoot it?
It's not a hunting rifle.

516
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,166
You know I do, Rae.

517
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,916
So, what is your plan?

518
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,208
It's better to have it and not need it
than need it and not have it.

519
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,541
We need protection.

520
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:30,291
Okay, so all the values
you taught me growing up

521
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,958
are out the window?

522
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,208
As long as we're on the same page, dope.

523
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:56,833
Shit.

524
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,083
This is Meeker.

525
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,250
<i>There are people</i>
<i>that are coming after us.</i>

526
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,166
Rachel?

527
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,750
I don't know who.
I don't know what he's gonna do, but…

528
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,041
<i>Who, your dad?</i>

529
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,833
Look, I've been tryin' to stop him,
but I can't.

530
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,041
The only person
he would ever listen to is my mom.

531
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:37,916
- Can you tell me about her?
<i>- She…</i>

532
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:40,625
She was a dancer.

533
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,958
She had, uh…

534
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:46,458
Tendinitis and stress fractures.

535
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:53,125
My dad, I mean, he sparred
with guys who could take a punch.

536
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:58,500
But you could tell that they were in pain.
You saw it. You know?

537
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,625
But when my mom danced,

538
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:04,916
she'd just smile.

539
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,541
<i>She always smiled.</i>

540
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:10,416
She's tough.<i> </i>Like you.

541
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,458
You don't know me.

542
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,333
<i>Debate,</i>

543
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,750
gymnastics, judo junior Olympian,

544
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,583
a 3.5 GPA.

545
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:22,833
You've been checking up on me?

546
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,458
<i>Well, I'm an FBI agent.</i>

547
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,916
I do have one question.

548
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,166
Who is… Paloma?

549
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,541
<i>How do you know about Paloma?</i>

550
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,666
I'm looking at a photo
that says "Rachel and Paloma."

551
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,375
I… wanted a pet.

552
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:48,833
But we couldn't get one
because of my mom's treatments, so…

553
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,333
So she got me a stuffed bunny.

554
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,708
Paloma.

555
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:03,791
<i>You…</i>

556
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:08,166
<i>She was always, uh, looking out for me.</i>

557
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,125
Even when she couldn't.

558
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,500
You'd make her proud.

559
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,541
And your dad.

560
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:21,916
I don't know what he's gonna do.

561
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,416
Hey. Listen to me.

562
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,625
<i>You </i>are in control.

563
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:30,291
Um, but I'm… I'm not. I'm really not.

564
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,958
<i>- You </i>are <i>in control.</i>
- Stop saying that.

565
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,625
You are in control. You are Rachel Cooper.

566
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,166
Say your name.

567
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,583
- Rachel Cooper.
<i>- Say it again.</i>

568
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,291
Rachel Cooper.

569
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,375
That's it.

570
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,333
Turn the ignition on.

571
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,041
Tur...

572
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,666
What are you doin'?

573
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,875
I'm coming with you.

574
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:17,958
No, you're not.

575
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,708
- I'm not leaving you.
- This isn't a debate.

576
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:28,000
- You can't do this without me.
- I am not putting you in danger, Rae.

577
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,083
This conversation's over.
Get outta the car.

578
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,541
What about the motel?

579
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,666
That was unplanned. Pump the gas.

580
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,666
Promise you'll be back. Promise.

581
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,750
I'll be back.

582
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,000
Pinky swear.

583
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,250
I said, I promise.

584
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,583
Get outta the car.

585
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,375
Rae.

586
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:10,416
You always say
I have to fight harder, so…

587
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:12,541
What?

588
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,041
I need you to get outta the car.

589
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,416
Get outta the car.

590
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,791
As long as we're together,
we're still a family.

591
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,000
Okay? So if you can't promise me
that we'll be together,

592
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,541
then I'm coming with you.

593
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:35,791
Not this time.

594
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,333
Put your seat belt on.

595
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,166
Nice house.

596
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,583
How you gonna get in there?

597
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,666
I'm not.

598
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,166
Dad.

599
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,583
What's this guy doin'?

600
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,416
Look.

601
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:51,041
Okay. Keep an eye on your sister.
See you at the airport.

602
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:58,958
Hold on.

603
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,041
This is Victor One. We've got a flat tire.

604
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:54,875
Stay behind.

605
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,333
What is this?

606
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,333
Something's wrong. Get us out of here.

607
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,541
Forward! Go! Go! Move, move!

608
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,083
Just break through it! Drive!

609
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,875
Come on! Let's go!

610
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:48,958
Fuck.

611
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,541
Get me out of here.

612
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,291
- Finish him.
- Go!

613
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,916
Shit!

614
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:25,333
Rachel, someone else is here.
Stay in the car.

615
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,875
You're gonna tell me
why Martin Bennett was killed.

616
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:48,083
There's nowhere to go.
We can get to anyone.

617
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,833
You killed a reporter to cover up bribes.
Who were they paid out to?

618
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:58,500
Soon, some powerful people
are gonna be looking for a little girl

619
01:03:58,583 --> 01:03:59,958
who lost both her parents.

620
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,583
Daddy!

621
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,083
- I know there's others. Who are they?
- You don't have what it takes.

622
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,916
Whoa!

623
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,291
Go!

624
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:12,916
Dad?

625
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,375
Why can't you just listen?

626
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,333
You should've stayed in the car.

627
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,833
You shouldn't have followed me
to the subway.

628
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,666
That was the man from the subway.

629
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:36,666
We have to go.

630
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:22,416
Let's go.

631
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,958
Look.

632
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,375
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

633
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,666
Sit down.

634
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,916
If anything goes wrong,
you tell them everything.

635
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,416
Your business with me is done.

636
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,583
Shah's dead.

637
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,291
Hmm. Shah didn't hire me.

638
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:07,791
My contract is to take out anyone
who can implicate my employer.

639
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:11,666
Who else are you hunting?

640
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,583
Only the one sitting next to me.

641
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,125
Something for you, darling?

642
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:24,875
No.

643
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:36,875
I know your struggle.

644
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,250
I do.

645
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,041
The village I grew up in,

646
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,000
we were farmers.

647
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:48,458
I worked in the fields with my father.

648
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,625
And one day, a group of rebels came.

649
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:57,125
They slaughtered my entire village.
Everyone. Whole family, friends.

650
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:00,583
I was able to hide in the weeds.

651
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,916
Now, you gotta understand,
I was just a kid, know that?

652
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:08,125
In such pain, with such… rage

653
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:11,125
that for years, I hunted them one by one.

654
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:14,500
- Then you understand.
- I do.

655
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,333
You see, what I've learned in that process

656
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:21,958
is that there will always be
an opposing force.

657
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:24,875
No amount of revenge can change that.

658
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:30,375
So you see, in this case,

659
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,625
you are my village,

660
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,583
and I am the opposing force.

661
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:55,541
Well, there's three ways this goes down.

662
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,291
One, I tell those cops who we are

663
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,833
and this gets real ugly for both of us.

664
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,458
Two,

665
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,000
I walk out the front door,

666
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:13,041
spend the rest of my life hiding
in the four corners of this earth,

667
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,250
and neither of us get what we want.

668
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:18,958
Or three,

669
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,125
you tell me who hired you.

670
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:25,250
We both know I'm gonna go after them.

671
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,500
And when I do,

672
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:30,666
you can try to take another shot at me.

673
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,333
This way,

674
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:35,875
at least one of us gets what we want.

675
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:44,458
Nah.

676
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,875
No, you've killed a few men, but…

677
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:51,250
Their deaths are still fresh in your eyes.

678
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,291
You're a dilettante in my world.

679
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,458
I never set out to kill anyone.

680
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:00,750
Not like you.

681
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,500
You are not innocent.

682
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:08,208
You knew going after powerful people
was a dangerous business.

683
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,625
You jumped.

684
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,416
I'm just the pavement closing in.

685
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:20,875
Diana Morgan.

686
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,500
The person you're looking for.

687
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,458
The senator.

688
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,375
See you in Pittsburgh.

689
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:46,791
Rachel.

690
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,416
I'll see ya soon.

691
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,791
Rothman, you have kids.

692
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,041
Does the idea of Rachel Cooper

693
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:34,166
being dragged through all of this
bother you at all?

694
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,500
Every case we work has me worried
about my kids one way or another.

695
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,041
I keep thinking about her.

696
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,875
I mean, how's…

697
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,750
How's a kid supposed to get past
all that she's seen?

698
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,458
I feel like…

699
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,958
I feel like I need to protect her somehow.

700
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,000
- Just do the work...
- Memo came through.

701
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,166
- Search crew found Cooper's vehicle.
- Where?

702
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,958
In the woods,
20 miles outside Shah's compound.

703
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,958
Looks like local PD got a call
this morning

704
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,666
that a tow truck was stolen
at a nearby location.

705
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,791
We need eyes
on all street cameras on Route 8.

706
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,375
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

707
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:33,375
Okay. Fort Pitt Tunnel.
Only 12 minutes away.

708
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,583
War room.

709
01:13:49,416 --> 01:13:52,458
Hey, guys. We got a hit on that tow truck.
It's headed back to the city.

710
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:58,208
<i>Suspect is</i>
<i>in a red tow truck. 10-80.</i>

711
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,958
<i>License plate Romeo Tango One Seven</i>

712
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,750
<i>Uniform Alpha Sierra.</i>

713
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:06,625
<i>We may have something here.</i>
<i>Westbound on Liberty passing 16th.</i>

714
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,583
The chopper! It's on us.

715
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:15,541
<i>We've got eyes on the suspect.</i>
<i>Making a right turn on 9th.</i>

716
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:20,083
<i>North on 9th. Picking up speed.
Making a run for it.</i>

717
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:21,458
All right. Hold on, baby.

718
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,375
Oh shit!

719
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,791
<i>Police! Stop the vehicle now!</i>

720
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,666
Whoa!

721
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,000
- Where's the chopper?
- It's on your right. On your right.

722
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:41,333
<i>Pull over.</i>

723
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:47,583
- Whoo!
- No!

724
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,583
Get outta the way!

725
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,625
Oh shit!

726
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,916
God damn it! Hold on. Hang on!

727
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:15,791
<i>All units,</i>
<i>suspect is armed and dangerous.</i>

728
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,041
<i>I repeat, armed and dangerous.</i>

729
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,916
The game's letting out.

730
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,333
Oh shit!

731
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:38,791
- <i>Got eyes on the suspect.</i>
- On the move!

732
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:59,041
<i>Suspect on foot.</i>
<i>I repeat, suspect on foot.</i>

733
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:10,125
<i>Suspect is entering PNC Park.</i>

734
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:16,041
Hey!

735
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,500
What?

736
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,600
- Everybody clear. FBI!
- Move! Out of the way!

737
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:34,631
If he's down here,
we squeeze him out.

738
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,208
I'll take the upper level.

739
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,083
PPD, cover this level.
The rest, go upstairs.

740
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,666
Suspect spotted.

741
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,916
Suspect spotted on the upper level.

742
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,625
Get me agents to the roof, now!

743
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,250
Move!

744
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:38,791
- I got eyes on.
- Copy.

745
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Wait!

746
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,541
Wait.

747
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,625
Okay.

748
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:07,458
It wasn't right what happened to you.
I understand that.

749
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:11,041
Look, no one is gonna hurt you.

750
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,708
It's me. I'm here to help.

751
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:14,958
Okay?

752
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,791
I don't know you.

753
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,083
Yes, you do. We've…

754
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,625
We've been talking.

755
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,625
No. Paloma.

756
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,791
You told me
your stuffed bunny's name was Paloma.

757
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,166
Remember?

758
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,791
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

759
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:50,250
Your father was a good man.

760
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,541
<i>You are not him.</i>

761
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,333
<i>Say your name.</i>

762
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,083
<i>You are in control.</i>

763
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:33,125
Fuck.

764
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,458
You're nothing but a scared little...

765
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:43,958
Rachel.

766
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,291
I'll see ya soon.

767
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,041
Say your name.

768
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,916
<i>Rachel.</i>

769
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,250
We're gonna be okay.

770
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:01,083
He shouldn't have been killed.

771
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,541
Come on, just… say… your name.

772
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,791
Just say your name!

773
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:28,000
Rachel Cooper.

774
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:32,916
Yeah.

775
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,517
<i>We have</i>
<i>a positive identification of the suspect.</i>

776
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:36,958
<i>Her name is Rachel Cooper.</i>

777
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:47,041
No. No, no, no, Rachel!

778
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:22,416
<i>Her name is Rachel Cooper.</i>

779
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,541
<i>Eighteen years of age.</i>

780
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:28,041
<i>Any family to contact?</i>

781
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,333
<i>Both parents deceased.</i>

782
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,458
Okay, calm down!

783
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,875
Fuck!

784
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:29,458
No!

785
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,125
Rachel, stop!

786
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,166
There you are.

787
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,666
I'm scared.

788
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:19,791
I feel like the whole world's gone crazy.

789
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,583
Or maybe it's just me.

790
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,208
I'm tired.

791
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:41,000
Nobody cares about stopping them.

792
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,708
Besides me.

793
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:59,291
Will I ever get to see you and Mom again?

794
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:02,875
We're with you now.

795
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:40,916
The fight begins here.

796
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,833
Big business and corporate interests

797
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:48,833
have corroded our politics.

798
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,250
And I believe that our country
is on the verge of imploding.

799
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,208
Of rotting.

800
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,416
Rotting from the inside out.

801
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,041
We need someone who will clean…

802
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,000
…out the rot!

803
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,416
Clean out the rot!

804
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:13,708
Today, I am announcing my bid

805
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,333
to be your next senator

806
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,791
from the great state of Pennsylvania.

807
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,791
That's right.

808
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,791
And to big business politics,

809
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:29,541
we have one thing to say.

810
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:31,916
This is our state,

811
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,833
and it is not for sale!

812
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,250
Well done.

813
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:05,750
Entering the race is just the beginning.

814
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,541
Let's focus on what we wanna do
when we win.

815
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:08,750
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

816
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,916
It's Mom's.

817
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,875
Actually, it's mine.

818
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:19,000
<i>I took your mom to a Steelers game
shortly after we met,</i>

819
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:21,541
and it was freezing,
and I gave her my jacket.

820
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,083
And she never gave it back.

821
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,916
Well, now it's my turn
to steal it from her.

822
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Hmm.

823
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:33,125
<i>It's my turn to steal it from her.</i>

824
01:34:58,333 --> 01:34:59,583
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

825
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,500
<i>Get up.</i>

826
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,916
<i>Get up, sweet girl.</i>

827
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,416
Calling the FBI.

828
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,958
And when they get here,

829
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:14,625
you're gonna tell them
everything you did with BioPrime.

830
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:18,250
Go ahead. Or better yet, let me.

831
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:21,416
I think the FBI is looking for <i>you,</i>

832
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,500
Rachel.

833
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,750
You know me?

834
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,375
You're all over the news.

835
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,000
I've seen what you did.

836
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,125
You bring the FBI here, and…

837
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:37,041
Who do you think they're gonna arrest?

838
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,666
- The crazy girl who killed five men?
- No.

839
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,833
- Or me?
- No. We never meant to hurt anyone.

840
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:46,375
I understand, and I can help you.

841
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,208
I think I'm the only one who can.

842
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:51,416
- I can make this nightmare end.
- Shut up!

843
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:56,083
- You're the one behind BioPrime.
- I wrestled them into submission.

844
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:59,708
I got them to lower their prices.
Affordable treatment.

845
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:01,291
And you cleaned out the rot.

846
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:03,291
I'm fighting for <i>you,</i> sweetheart.

847
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:14,000
When I saw you on CNN
when my mom was in the hospital,

848
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:18,291
I thought you could actually save her.

849
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,833
I believed in you.

850
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,791
- You still can.
- How?

851
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:28,583
I know people at the DOJ.

852
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:32,041
They can make the charges
against you go away.

853
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:34,291
And you can have a life.

854
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:40,333
What you've been through,
what happened to you, was wrong, Rachel.

855
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,416
The trauma you suffered.

856
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:47,833
Don't you think they'd want me
to help you, sweetheart?

857
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:50,375
Stop calling me that.

858
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,625
You're a liar.

859
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:54,083
You were with BioPrime even then.

860
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,791
You helped them take away

861
01:37:56,875 --> 01:38:00,083
a cheap and lifesaving
medication for my mom.

862
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:02,541
I fought against them!

863
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:06,416
You took their bribe,
and you gave them exclusive contracts.

864
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,333
<i>You're </i>responsible
for ordering the hit on Martin Bennett.

865
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,750
You killed my dad.

866
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,458
Now tell the truth.

867
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:16,916
Tell me the truth.

868
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:22,583
Yeah.

869
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:26,500
I took the bribe.

870
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:31,958
I ordered the hit.

871
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:38,583
You don't understand anything.
You're so young.

872
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,833
The candidate with the most money wins.

873
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:47,000
That's how it works.

874
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:53,916
Was it worth it?

875
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:57,708
Was it worth it?

876
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:28,166
Security?

877
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:33,291
Security!

878
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:18,125
She kills Keeley and runs.
Tries to escape, but something or someone

879
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:20,500
drove her back here,
despite knowing she might be caught.

880
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:23,208
Yeah, but she got
her revenge. Why come back?

881
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:24,916
- Just came in.
- Thank you, sir.

882
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,125
You're welcome.

883
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:30,125
- Holy shit.
- What?

884
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:35,166
<i>Rachel Cooper was spotted</i>

885
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,000
<i>at Diana Morgan's campaign rally
yesterday afternoon.</i>

886
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:41,250
<i>What was she doing there?</i>

887
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:47,458
<i>The fugitive</i>
<i>from last night's assassination attempt</i>…

888
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:48,416
Thanks.

<i>…on Diana Morgan is still on the loose.</i>

890

<i>Pittsburgh police are asking
anyone with information</i>

891
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,291
<i>to please come forward.</i>

892
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:57,125
<i>First Keeley,</i>
<i>then Shah, now a congresswoman?</i>

893
01:40:58,333 --> 01:41:00,000
<i>It just seems so bizarre.</i>

894
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,750
<i>Rachel clearly knows something.</i>

895
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:07,125
<i>Let's go through Diana Morgan's
campaign donations.</i>

896
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,750
Look at this.
Rachel Cooper just sent us something.

897
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:22,708
<i>I took the bribe. I ordered the hit.</i>

898
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:27,166
<i>The candidate with the most money wins.</i>

899
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,583
<i>That's how it works.</i>

900
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,666
<i>…developments</i>
<i>in the assassination attempt.</i>

901
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:36,083
<i>According to sources,
the FBI has arrested the congresswoman</i>

902
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:37,333
<i>regarding her connection</i>

904

<i>Simon Keeley and Vinod Shah</i>

905
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:45,916
<i>and the two-year-old unsolved murders
of Martin Bennett and Ray Cooper.</i>

906
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,416
<i>Neither BioPrime or the FBI would
comment on this ongoing investigation.</i>

907
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:55,875
<i>…Pennsylvania is allegedly connected

<i>The past is like a dream.</i>

910

913

<i>Where do we stop…</i>

915
