1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:25,646
Portland's number
one station for classic rock. 107.1.

3
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,014
The Way Back.

4
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,219
Oh, shit.

5
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,799
This was my mom's jam.

6
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,112
Were you sleeping?

7
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,049
Sorry.

8
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,918
Sorry.

9
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,998
Hey! No, no, no, no. What are
you doing? You're gonna kill us both.

10
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,434
Oh!

11
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,147
Yo.
Thanks, babe.

12
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,184
I asked for something
vegetarian,

13
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,355
but she just kind of threw a
bunch of sides in the box, so...

14
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,856
Hmm.

15
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,492
Better have that thing memorized
by the time we get to the trail head.

16
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,927
Do you have it memorized?

17
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,128
You bet your ass I do.

18
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,032
Really? Okay. What's,
uh, this one right here?

19
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,868
That one? It's so easy.

20
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,270
Uh-huh.
Piccadilly sweet rose.

21
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,074
Not even close. It's...

22
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,709
Look, if I had it memorized,

23
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,545
I wouldn't have to lug that
thing around, would I? Mm-hmm.

24
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,084
Hmm, looks like we have company.

25
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,153
Hey, man.

26
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,290
I could take your trash.

27
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,693
Uh...

28
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,396
Thanks, that's, uh...
Yeah, we just started.

29
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,598
So, maybe you give us,
like, ten minutes?

30
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,801
Jimmy. Can I
get a hand in here, please?

31
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,943
Did you see
the red star come down?

32
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,412
Okay, come on.

33
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,755
What the fuck was that?

34
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,520
Here we go.

35
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,159
Ready?

36
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,795
Mm-hmm.

37
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,930
Yeah. It's...

38
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,800
We can totally chill in the
car if you need more time.

39
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,868
I'm telling you though,

40
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,235
once we get going,

41
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,604
I don't think you're gonna
be nervous anymore, okay?

42
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,806
This is the fourth time
I've done this trail.

43
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,743
I promise, nothing scary
about it.

44
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,312
Okay?

45
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,316
It's riskier for you
to drive your car to work.

46
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,752
Or surfing. Surfing's
way more dangerous.

47
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,087
You could break your neck,

48
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,822
get eaten by a shark.
You can...

49
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,891
I know that it's different.

50
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,358
I'm comfortable in the ocean.

51
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,494
I've been doing it
my whole life.

52
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,728
I... No, I know,
but you'll be

53
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,731
comfortable backpacking
after this.

54
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,702
Right? Plus, when we're
like 80 years old

55
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,804
and we're looking back on all
these adventures we had together,

56
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,339
you know, Yellowstone or

57
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,175
Kilimanjaro or Machu Picchu
or something like that,

58
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,645
you're gonna laugh
about how nervous you were.

59
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,517
Yeah. Okay.

60
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,884
Yes!

61
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,153
Thank you. Great. Here we go.

62
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,722
You're not going to regret this.

63
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,724
You might.

64
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,791
Love you.

65
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,549
I was, like, 13.

66
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,751
What was her name?

67
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,885
Belinda.

68
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,854
Oh, my God. It
was not Belinda. What?

69
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,288
No, I swear it was.

70
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:13,026
Belinda Caldwell. Yeah, on
a trampoline in her backyard.

71
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,127
Whoa!
Yeah.

72
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,263
So, who kissed who first?

73
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,198
I'd say it was like
half-and-half, you know?

74
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:23,637
We talked about it for 20 minutes
and it was all very scientific, you know?

75
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,573
How was it?

76
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,808
Oh! Not good.

77
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,211
Just not good, you know? Pressed
our mouths together and kind of

78
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,913
moved them around a bunch.

79
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,281
I do remember thinking,

80
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,084
"Why are there so many teeth
involved in this?"

81
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:43,190
Like, "Is she gonna try to
bite my fucking tonsils out?"

82
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,225
Like the inside of my mouth...

83
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,896
Shouldn't have...

84
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,832
Hey, yo! Let's go.
We're burning daylight.

85
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,819
Hey, uh...

86
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,688
How's it coming back there?

87
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,224
It's bad. I mean, it's bad.

88
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,792
Do you wanna help me, maybe?

89
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,729
Hon, we're trying to attack
this thing as a team, you know?

90
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,297
I'm doing food,
you're doing lodging.

91
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,735
With our powers combined, we
might make it through the night.

92
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,170
Just come over here
and try this, all right?

93
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,805
We can deal with the tent later.

94
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,878
Mm, that's money.

95
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,046
Here.

96
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,448
Just try it.

97
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,850
Huh. Interesting.

98
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,120
Is this the first of an eight
or nine-course meal or...

99
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,522
Let me explain a little something
about the human body, okay?

100
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,058
Hmm.

101
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,894
It works most efficiently when
you give it just enough fuel, right?

102
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,665
'Cause if you have too much, then
you get sluggish and you can cramp.

103
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,333
You wanna keep that needle
right above empty. You know?

104
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,470
Oh. Got it. Okay, so I'll
just kinda eat like this, like...

105
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,173
Yeah, you got it.

106
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,080
What?
What?

107
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,683
You're looking at me like
a weirdo. What is going on?

108
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,819
I'm looking at you
super regular. Hmm.

109
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,821
How do you want me
to look at you?

110
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,190
Hey, if you wanna kiss me,
just kiss me.

111
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,658
All right.

112
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,526
Love you.

113
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,297
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

114
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,366
It's me, Belinda. I still
love you.

115
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,568
You know what?
Belinda's a good woman.

116
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,038
And while that is exactly
what the kiss was like...

117
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,141
...she does not deserve
this ridicule.

118
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,377
And here I think I'm gonna get
some tooth-free kiss of passion.

119
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,882
Listen, you set up
the tent, we can talk.

120
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,084
Yeah?

121
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,855
Hold this bowl.

122
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,692
One minute. Time me.
For the tent, not the sex.

123
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,961
I'm telling you, this is
gonna be, like, 30 seconds.

124
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,706
Ruth?

125
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,042
Oh, my God. You scared
the crap out of me.

126
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,077
Sorry, I just... I woke up in
the tent and you weren't there.

127
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,212
I didn't know where you were.

128
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,681
Yeah, I was peeing
and then I saw something.

129
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:29,883
Yeah? What?

130
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,185
I think it was a deer.

131
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,923
Oh, fuck. I thought
you meant, like, something scary.

132
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:39,359
It was scary. It was
staring right at me.

133
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,162
I mean, that's kinda what
they do. They just stare on.

134
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,134
Are you done peeing?
Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,019
Almost there.

136
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,056
Watch your step.

137
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,961
Here we go.

138
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,729
This better be good.

139
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,271
Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

140
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,443
Here we go.

141
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,078
Hmm?

142
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,379
Um...

143
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,649
Uh...

144
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:15,188
You know, six years ago, I just
didn't know what I wanted in life.

145
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,494
And I swear to God,
I met you, and...

146
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,265
well, it just felt like
all that changed.

147
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,439
'Cause now I feel like
I'm going somewhere, you know?

148
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,643
And I don't even know where, but I
just know I wanna go there with you.

149
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:43,616
You're smart and you're funny.

150
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,252
You're curious and, uh...

151
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,422
I love you.

152
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,194
I love you.

153
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:03,270
So, um, I just
wanted to ask if, uh...

154
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,281
Will you marry me?

155
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,997
Ruth?

156
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,803
Ruth?

157
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,241
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Just stop. Stop.

158
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,054
Harry, I'm... I'm sorry.

159
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,792
Yeah, that's okay.

160
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,796
That's okay.

161
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,773
Harry, you know that it has
nothing to do with you.

162
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:51,078
It's not about you or, like... I know,
I know. That's okay. No, I know.

163
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,812
No. You don't
have to say any more.

164
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,722
I just feel like
a fucking idiot.

165
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,670
That's still
a pretty damn good view.

166
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,622
Shit.

167
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,750
Harry.

168
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,154
Look, we don't have to do this.

169
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:12,058
I'm sorry, okay?
Just leave it at that.

170
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,630
It's just...

171
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,201
Why did you do it?

172
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,273
You knew.

173
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,808
You knew how I felt about it.
You said that you agreed.

174
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,210
You said marriage
wasn't a big deal.

175
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,345
What do you want me to say?
I wanted to scare you off?

176
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,783
Isn't this good?

177
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,452
I thought this was good.
It is good.

178
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,789
I want to be with you.
You wanna be with me.

179
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,957
That's all that matters.

180
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,895
All that marriage does is lock you in
and you can lose control of your life.

181
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,063
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.
We're not your parents.

182
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,636
What do my parents
have to do with this?

183
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,307
Are you kidding?

184
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,377
Okay, fine. Um...

185
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,213
I think your parents splitting

186
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,448
fucked you up more than
you'd like to admit.

187
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,820
Wow. Nice.

188
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,591
I'm not doing this.
You're not my therapist.

189
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,227
Yeah, right.
Like you tell her anything.

190
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,694
Excuse me?

191
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,763
You tell her what she wants to
hear, so you get your medicine.

192
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,632
Are you kidding me?
You've admitted that.

193
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,501
Look, maybe if you were honest with
her or you, I don't know, fucking tried,

194
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,303
then you wouldn't be so
stressed out around this shit.

195
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,938
Around what shit?

196
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,607
Oh, my God. Ruth, I just proposed
to you and you had a panic attack.

197
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,444
You're stressed out about commitment.
You're stressed out by travel.

198
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,678
That is not how it works.
You're...

199
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,548
I'm not stressed out.

200
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,815
You don't know what
you're talking about,

201
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,151
so just shut the fuck up!

202
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,662
Harry, I'm...

203
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,763
Dr. Ledlow's
office. How can I help you?

204
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,501
Hello?

205
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,504
Hello?

206
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,818
What the...

207
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,449
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

208
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:06,218
It's just me. Whoa. Hey. Hey,
it's okay. It's just me.

209
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,855
What's going on?

210
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,490
Why did you leave...

211
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,692
Oh. Holy shit.

212
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:17,129
I was just walking
and I found it like that.

213
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,100
My God.

214
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,669
What could've done that?

215
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,641
I don't know. Jesus Christ.

216
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,584
What's all that stuff on it?

217
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,886
Looks like
some kind of fungus, maybe?

218
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,490
Is that the deer
from the other night?

219
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,159
No. No, no way.

220
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,328
Do you know how many deer
are in these woods?

221
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,701
Jesus, you're shivering.

222
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,703
Hey. Hey,
hey, hey.

223
00:23:58,638 --> 00:23:59,739
It's okay. We'll go back to camp

224
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,941
and I'll just make you
some lunch. We'll relax.

225
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,576
Yeah.
All right.

226
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:05,878
Jesus.

227
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:37,343
Here we go. "Deer warts or cutaneous
fibromas are caused by a papillomavirus.

228
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,878
"They are usually temporary

229
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,715
"and can vary from half an
inch to several inches across."

230
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,456
I guess that could be it.

231
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,628
But whatever killed it
is still out there.

232
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,463
Yeah, but it's not
gonna bother us.

233
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,066
We're too loud, we wield fire.

234
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,001
It's not gonna come
anywhere close.

235
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:07,907
Look...

236
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,778
I don't know
what we are right now.

237
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,581
But I swear, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

238
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,749
Okay?

239
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,688
Sorry.

240
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,595
Harry, you're allowed
to touch me.

241
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:34,934
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
Just for everything, you know?

242
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,706
Honestly, I never even thought
about what would happen if you said no.

243
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,642
Just how awful
that would be for you

244
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,010
to have to walk around
in the woods with me and...

245
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,613
Harry, I'd walk around
in the woods with you any day.

246
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:50,983
I love you.

247
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,622
Yeah? Yeah, of
course I do, you idiot.

248
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:57,957
But...

249
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,760
People change,

250
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,030
and someday you're gonna change

251
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,068
and maybe that new version of
you will love me, and maybe it won't.

252
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,205
But you shouldn't
force anything.

253
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,943
What we have is good.

254
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,411
It's really good.

255
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,114
That's why I don't want to get
married. I don't want to mess it up.

256
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,652
I've seen what can happen,
you know that.

257
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,290
I'm with you because I love you.

258
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,061
Isn't that enough?

259
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,569
Yeah.

260
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,673
Yeah, it is.

261
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,855
I was thinking of maybe
just going for a little stroll.

262
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:36,989
Yeah? You want me
to come with you?

263
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,192
No, you, uh, keep cooking.

264
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,962
You sure? I can finish
this up. I'll come with you.

265
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,097
I'm going to the bathroom, okay?

266
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,365
Oh.

267
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,502
You're a disgusting monster.

268
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,387
No way.

269
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,974
Piccadilly sweet rose.

270
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,260
Whoa.

271
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,156
What the hell?

272
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,999
Ruth!

273
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,735
Ruth!

274
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,804
Ruth!

275
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,139
Jesus Christ.

276
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,107
Hey!

277
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,618
Ruth. Hey. Hey.

278
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:53,752
Hi.

279
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,688
Hi?

280
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,157
You've been gone
for like half an hour.

281
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:02,328
I know. I was distracted.
Thinking about stuff.

282
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,164
Okay.

283
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,733
I mean, you know, that's cool
and everything. I just...

284
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,435
You gotta consider the context.

285
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,503
You did, like, disappear
into the woods yesterday, so...

286
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,806
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

287
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,843
It's okay.
I'm not trying to...

288
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,246
It's okay.

289
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,182
Are you all right?

290
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:24,750
Mm-hmm.

291
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,323
Okay. Cool.

292
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:34,460
Let's head back, huh? Before
the birds eat our breakfast.

293
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,662
Come on.

294
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,938
Ruth?

295
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,747
Ruth?

296
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,655
Ruth?

297
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,931
Ruth?

298
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,916
Ruth?

299
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,287
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

300
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,358
Are you trying to give me a heart
attack? What are you doing out here?

301
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,262
Is that my knife?

302
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,234
I thought I heard an animal.

303
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:33,038
I mean, that thing's
not gonna do much.

304
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:04,370
Good night.

305
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,194
You get some sleep?

306
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,197
Mm-hmm.

307
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,064
You know, Stevenson said he's
gonna retire at the end of the year.

308
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,734
So, I finish
my master's in time,

309
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,370
then I'll be on the short
list for vice-principal.

310
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,448
You know, there'll be
other candidates, too, so...

311
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:25,351
Don't get too excited.

312
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,958
Should not be a problem for you.

313
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,068
I'm sorry.
What's that?

314
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,006
I'm sorry that I was
being weird last night.

315
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,009
It's just...

316
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,146
I haven't been
feeling like myself.

317
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,419
That's okay.

318
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,931
You don't have to apologize.

319
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:18,003
I know the trip
got a little weird.

320
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,007
Not what I intended, obviously.

321
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,414
I've actually
been thinking about that.

322
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,385
I know this is probably
gonna come out of nowhere.

323
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,424
But I think I was wrong.

324
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,362
About?

325
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,597
About us getting married.

326
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,339
Are you serious?

327
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:55,941
Yeah.

328
00:37:56,942 --> 00:38:01,780
It's just... You were right.
We're not my parents.

329
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,918
Whatever their problems were,
that's their story.

330
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,021
But we should have
a chance at our own.

331
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,694
So, I don't know, I think...

332
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,165
I think we should do this.

333
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,139
Are you sure?

334
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,410
'Cause I just don't want
to do it if you're not totally...

335
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,678
Yes, I'm sure.

336
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,382
But there's one condition.

337
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,683
Okay. Yeah.

338
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,521
I want you to ask me again.

339
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,394
But I want us to pretend
like it's the first time.

340
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,733
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay.

341
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,404
Um...

342
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,573
Uh, yeah.

343
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,042
No. Not here.

344
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,612
What do you mean?

345
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,431
It's so beautiful.

346
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:28,567
Yep.

347
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,736
Here we are again.

348
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,975
Glad I didn't toss this.

349
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,450
You ready?

350
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,621
We're really doing this, huh?

351
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:07,405
Ruth Miller, will you spend
the rest of your life with me?

352
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,678
Yes, I will.

353
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,326
Damn, that looks good on you.

354
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,471
That is the most incredible
thing I have ever felt.

355
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,814
I love you, Harry.

356
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,218
I love you.

357
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,155
No. No, no! No.

358
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,227
Oh, my God.

359
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,665
Oh, my God.

360
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,136
Oh.

361
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:28,106
Viv?

362
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,941
Vivian!

363
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,146
Oh, my God.

364
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,686
Are you okay?

365
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:43,689
She's dehydrated.

366
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,261
It's okay.
Just take a sip.

367
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,164
Mm?

368
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,277
Now, what happened to you?

369
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,882
I don't remember.

370
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:14,886
I'll call 911.

371
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,227
Shit. No service.

372
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,633
You know what?
We're about to set up camp.

373
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:31,136
Why don't you come with us, huh?

374
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,439
We'll get some food in
you. Would you like that?

375
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:40,078
Ray?

376
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,313
Yeah.

377
00:44:57,763 --> 00:44:58,864
Still nothing.

378
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,066
I know. Quiet as a mouse.

379
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,269
I'm gonna give it another shot.

380
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,077
Hey there, hon.

381
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,417
You feeling better?

382
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,491
We're gonna head back first
thing in the morning, I promise.

383
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:32,430
But you, um, ready to tell us
what happened to you?

384
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,334
I said I don't remember.

385
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:42,507
Maybe you have
a campsite close by?

386
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,278
What about your gear?

387
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:51,382
You didn't have anything with
you. I mean, were you alone?

388
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:57,956
You didn't come all the way
out here by yourself, did you?

389
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:07,833
You know what?
Forget about it then.

390
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,667
You'll remember
when you remember.

391
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,704
Let's talk about
something else, huh?

392
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:15,573
Um...

393
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:20,245
What do you like to do,
Ruth? You got any hobbies?

394
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,049
I...

395
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,855
...like to surf.

396
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,457
Oh! That's great. Us, too.

397
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:36,761
You know, we used to
lug our short boards

398
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:37,863
out to the beach here,

399
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,065
but the last few times we did,

400
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:43,101
there were way too many sharks.

401
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:46,972
Global warming pushes
them all inland. So...

402
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,716
Honey, are you all right?

403
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:13,664
You know, I'm gonna go
walk out a little further,

404
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:18,603
and see if I can find some
service. Get a call out.

405
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,917
I think
something's really wrong with her.

406
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:34,419
Honey, I don't think
we can wait until morning.

407
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,553
Okay.

408
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,158
Sweetheart...

409
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,263
What are you doing with that?

410
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,486
Come on, kid.
Put that thing down.

411
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:12,257
No.

412
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,326
Hey. There you are.

413
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,795
Who is that guy?

414
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,165
Oh!

415
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,466
It's him.

416
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:25,703
Hey, Ruth.

417
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,638
What the fuck?

418
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,975
No. No.

419
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:31,977
No.

420
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,844
Hey.
That's close enough.

421
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,347
Who are your friends?

422
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,582
No, no.
We're right here, honey.

423
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:38,984
No, we have to run.
No, it's okay.

424
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,485
Where are you going?

425
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,054
Come back!

426
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,591
Last time I'm gonna tell you, buddy.
Just stay the fuck where you are!

427
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:48,326
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're being
a little aggressive, dude.

428
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,494
All right.
You had your warning.

429
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,862
Hey. Relax, man.
I come in peace.

430
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,551
Hey. Thanks for finding her.

431
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:17,888
Ruth?

432
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:20,758
Oh, God.

433
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,365
What are you doing?

434
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,899
We have to hide.
Okay.

435
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,106
Who is that guy?

436
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:36,841
Is he your boyfriend?

437
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,879
That is not Harry.

438
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:50,455
Hello! Viv!

439
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,457
No, no, no. Please.
Please, no. Stay.

440
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:55,626
Sweetheart, it's okay. It's
just Ray. It's my husband.

441
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,263
Over here.

442
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,035
Thank God.

443
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,671
Are you okay?

444
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,905
I'm okay.

445
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,608
Well...

446
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,379
Well, what about that guy?

447
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:17,082
Well, where's he?

448
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,156
Right behind me.

449
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,078
Come on out, Ruth.

450
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,883
I'm gonna kill her if you don't.

451
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,166
Hey. There's our girl.

452
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,204
What did you do to her?

453
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,006
Her?

454
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:21,146
Oh, don't worry.
I can fix that. Watch.

455
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:28,919
No!

456
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:32,957
How did you know?

457
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,663
How?
I don't wanna die.

458
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,031
I saw where you took him.

459
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:45,836
I found the cave.

460
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,180
What the hell?

461
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,695
Oh, my God.

462
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,498
Harry.

463
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,322
Oh, God. Oh, God.

464
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,346
Ruth!

465
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,814
Ruth!

466
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,950
Ruth! Jesus Christ.

467
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:08,319
Hey!

468
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:10,821
I saw him.

469
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:13,891
Fuck. The cave.

470
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,494
I knew it was too close.

471
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,935
What are you?

472
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,538
I'm pissed off
is what I am, Ruth.

473
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,313
I'm a scout.

474
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,748
I get to the planet first, then
I report back to the others.

475
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,650
What am I fucking doing?

476
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,118
What am I doing
telling you this?

477
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:45,490
Goodbye, Ruth.

478
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,992
No, no, no. No. Please.

479
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,093
Please.

480
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:54,164
What am I doing?
Just do it. Just do it.

481
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:00,204
Goodbye, Ruth.

482
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:04,642
No, no. No. I don't...
Please. Please.

483
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,311
What the fuck is wrong with me?

484
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,847
All the creatures I could
stumble upon, I gotta be this guy.

485
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,949
Okay.

486
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:18,155
I was better off as the deer.
Just do it! Just do it.

487
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:20,858
No, please. I
won't tell anyone. I promise.

488
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,761
I promise I won't tell.
I won't.

489
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,946
No. Wait, what...

490
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,949
Do I love you?

491
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,419
Like, do I love you?
Is that...

492
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,590
Is that even possible?

493
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:58,463
How the...

494
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,371
I love your hands.

495
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:09,374
What the...

496
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,443
I love your smile.

497
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,380
I love your laugh.

498
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:18,683
Fuck!

499
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,652
I love you.

500
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:24,755
I love you, Ruth.

501
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,090
No! Wait!

502
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,700
Ruth! You don't
have to worry.

503
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,569
I'm not gonna hurt you.

504
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,271
I love you!

505
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,676
Oh, it feels incredible!

506
00:55:54,419 --> 00:55:56,421
Ruth, let me explain.

507
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,556
Okay.

508
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,625
I see that you're angry.

509
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,228
Get away from me.

510
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,496
Hey. Why don't we just calm
down and talk about this?

511
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:10,968
This is so us.

512
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,771
Look, I understand why
you're angry. I killed Harry.

513
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,874
But, silver lining, I am Harry.

514
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,443
No, you're not.

515
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,478
No. I literally am. I'm an exact
biological replication of him.

516
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:23,113
All of his thoughts, his fears,
his memories are my thoughts,

517
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,482
my fears, my memories.

518
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,183
Our first date was
at the Sherwood Fair.

519
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,785
I kissed you on the Thunder
Bolt. What? Stop. Stop!

520
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,687
Hey, Ruth. Hear me out.

521
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:31,922
I've been
so many different things.

522
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,758
I thought I felt everything
there was to feel, right?

523
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:36,594
It turns out, I realized now, I
wasn't actually feeling those things.

524
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,763
It was just whatever I was
that was feeling them.

525
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:41,866
But for some reason, as soon
as I felt love, all of a sudden

526
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,934
I was feeling those feelings.

527
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,904
And not just feeling the feeling of
something else feeling those feelings.

528
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,305
Do you know what I mean?

529
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,711
What do you want from me?

530
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,347
I...

531
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,524
I wanna show you something.

532
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:35,686
You know, the craziest thing is,

533
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,556
love doesn't even exist
anywhere else.

534
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:41,258
It's a singularly human emotion.

535
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,194
Like, of all the different
things that I've been,

536
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,597
none of 'em feel it.
Isn't that nuts?

537
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:51,401
Just tell me where we're going.

538
00:57:52,737 --> 00:57:54,905
What part of "it's a
surprise" don't you get?

539
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,944
All right, you know what?

540
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,547
You've been patient.

541
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:04,615
You ready?

542
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,051
For what?

543
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,928
It's a pretty sweet ride, right?

544
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,567
Oh, my God.

545
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,576
All right.

546
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:35,946
Look, I know you love Earth.

547
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,184
I just think a change of scenery
could be really good for you.

548
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:42,286
You know, just mentally.

549
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,788
Obviously, here you've got
a lot of triggers,

550
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,857
a lot of stressors,
but if we go someplace else,

551
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,192
some quiet little planet,

552
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:52,129
somewhere no one will ever
find us, we got a fresh start.

553
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,635
Bigger thing is,

554
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,705
I really care about you,

555
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,874
and I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

556
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,778
There are a lot more
like me coming.

557
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:11,415
They are gonna blend in
and take over,

558
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:15,052
and they are gonna turn this planet
into a place that you don't wanna be.

559
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,521
Trust me.

560
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,794
I can give you
an incredible life, Ruth.

561
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,031
I really can.

562
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,636
What do you say?

563
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,642
Okay.

564
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,646
Yeah?

565
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,648
Yeah, you're serious?
Yeah.

566
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,556
All right. All right.

567
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:54,124
That's what I'm talking about.

568
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,393
You're gonna flip when you
see the inside of this thing.

569
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,664
I mean, it looks tight, but once
you're inside, it's like a mansion.

570
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:01,131
It's kind of hard...

571
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:05,202
Oh, come on. Are we
really gonna do this again?

572
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,871
Just get in the ship, Ruth.

573
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:10,708
Oh, God.

574
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:14,712
You've gotta be kidding me.

575
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,252
Ruth!

576
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:24,889
Ruth!

577
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:30,828
Ruth!

578
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:45,910
Ruth!

579
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:50,314
You're gonna drown.

580
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,686
Come on!
You're being ridiculous.

581
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,860
Ruth, please!

582
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,763
Ruth, what is the
endgame here? Seriously.

583
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:08,866
Oh, do not look at me like that.

584
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:12,136
I'm just trying to help. Let's
just head back and talk...

585
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:41,986
Oh, my God.

586
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,323
Oh, no.

587
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,544
I don't understand, Ruth.

588
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,547
Why do you keep running?

589
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,885
I'm trying to save you.

590
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,789
Don't you wanna be saved?

591
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,728
You know, it didn't
have to be this way.

592
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,832
I just wanted us to love
each other, Ruth.

593
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,203
I was never gonna hurt you.

594
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,808
It could have been so easy.

595
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:35,885
But you didn't want that.

596
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,955
So I found another way.

597
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:46,830
An even purer form of love.

598
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:54,138
What do you think love is, Ruth?

599
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,242
It's desire.

600
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:02,045
Sure, but for what?

601
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:05,215
It can't be as simple as wanting
to spend time with someone...

602
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,185
Or have sex with them,

603
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,155
or share your darkest secrets...

604
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,892
Because you and Harry
did all those things,

605
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,663
and never once
did his love weaken.

606
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,603
But shouldn't it?

607
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,407
Hunger passes when we eat.

608
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:33,277
Exhaustion fades when we sleep.

609
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,246
But that's not true for love.

610
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,784
That's what makes it so unique.

611
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,687
The goal is unattainable.

612
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:50,294
It's two souls desperately
wanting to become one.

613
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:56,266
And that is a desire human
beings could never fulfill.

614
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:12,916
But I can.

615
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,276
I've been longing
to see inside of you.

616
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:45,415
All the colors,
the electricity, the passion.

617
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,053
The love.

618
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,991
You do love him.

619
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,267
But so much pain.

620
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:10,374
It makes so much sense now.

621
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,246
I feel like I finally
understand you.

622
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,052
Don't worry.

623
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,458
I won't let your pain
hold you back any longer.

624
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,963
I'm gonna live the life
you always should have.

625
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,968
I'm gonna make something
out of you.

626
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,139
Goodbye, Ruth.

627
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:48,177
No. That's not possible.

628
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,048
What's that?

629
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:55,118
You said you won't let my pain
hold you back.

630
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:02,526
But that's not possible
because you can't control it.

631
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,663
The pain is a part of you.

632
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:11,134
You can't separate it
from who you are.

633
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:16,906
If you try and ignore it, it'll
just squeeze you even harder.

634
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,544
You'll think about your future,

635
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,513
but all you'll see is your past.

636
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:28,618
You'll hear them screaming,
glass breaking,

637
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,855
everything falling apart
around you.

638
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:35,992
And you'll remember
that's where it all leads.

639
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:39,863
Mom never leaving
the house again.

640
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,065
Dad drinking himself to death.

641
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:44,233
Which one are you gonna be?

642
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:45,769
Huh? Huh?

643
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,537
Stop.

644
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,506
Can't breathe, can you?

645
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:52,576
Feel like you're gonna die?
Please stop. Stop!

646
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,243
Why?

647
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:57,180
I thought you loved being human.

648
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,716
You wanna feel everything
that we feel.

649
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,653
Don't you? Don't you?

650
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:26,776
There's none left.
Nothing's gonna save you.

651
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,416
You will always be broken.

652
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,718
You're worthless.

653
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,587
You'll never be happy.

654
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:40,089
What's the fucking point of you?

655
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,092
Stop, please. Please.
I can't breathe.

656
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,429
I can't. Please just stop.

657
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:47,330
Please. Please.

658
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,851
Please.

659
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:12,922
It's... It's okay.

660
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:17,594
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

661
01:13:18,662 --> 01:13:20,163
It helps to lie down.

662
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,209
There you go.

663
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,318
Just breathe.

664
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:49,258
There you go.

665
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:15,464
Jesus,
Ruth. I knew you had issues, but wow.

666
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:20,904
I didn't know you could be
so violent.

667
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:25,541
Do you really think
that you can run?

668
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:28,577
I know every last thing
about you.

669
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:30,780
You can't hide from me.

670
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,449
Or from what's coming.

670
01:17:34,305 --> 01:18:34,454
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
