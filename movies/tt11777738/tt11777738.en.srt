00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,981
IN THE NAME OF GOD

4
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,364
Rahim Soltani.

5
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,913
Hello.

6
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:51,375
A Hero

7
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,552
Rahim! What are you doing here?
I could have come down.

8
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:06,390
I wonder how 2,500 years ago,
they climbed up here to visit their dead.

9
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,642
They smoked less than you!

10
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,768
Hello.

11
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,937
-Great to see you.
-How are you?

12
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,231
-Why didn't you warn us?
-It wasn't planned.

13
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,651
-All good?
-Yes. Let's go down.

14
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,280
-More stairs?
-You're breathless!

15
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,658
How come you're still so plump
with all these stairs?

16
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,285
Your sister's fault.

17
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,745
How's Malih?

18
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,497
The usual, neck pain, arthritis.

19
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,832
Hi, Mehdi.

20
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,168
Hi, Rahim. Congratulations!

21
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,170
-Are you done?
-No, just some leave.

22
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,421
Enjoy.

23
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,341
-How long are you here for?
-Two days.

24
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,384
Is that all?

25
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,095
I had to beg them for it. Hello.

26
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,930
Is it you, Rahim?

27
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,724
You're very welcome.

28
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,852
-Is the sugar there?
-I had tea before coming.

29
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,353
Come on...

30
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,608
How dare you compare prison tea
to that served on the tomb of Xerxes?

31
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,695
You should save up your leave
and stay longer.

32
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm more looking for a way
not to go back there.

33
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,497
-What way?
-Let's go and talk to Bahram.

34
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,584
If talking had made a difference,
he wouldn't have sent you to jail.

35
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,169
What an idea!

36
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,131
-I can have 75 million tomans.
-How?

37
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,844
Someone will give it to me.

38
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,097
With interest?

39
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,599
No, it's not a loan.

40
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,770
Whenever you get it, we'll
go to him and he'll have to shut up.

41
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,730
If we make promises we can't keep...

42
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,232
I'll have it this afternoon.

43
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,733
-For sure?
-For sure.

44
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,736
Then call him.

45
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,072
He doesn't answer my calls.

46
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,117
Get the money, we'll go this afternoon.

47
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,701
Is your car here?

48
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,497
Look at her chador.

49
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,666
My darling!

50
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,253
-Hello, my love.
-Hello, darling.

51
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:46,466
Let's move from here, it's too busy.
What a beard!

52
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,469
-You like it?
-I love it! Keep it.

53
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,768
The wait since last night was almost
harder than for the last two months.

54
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,479
I've never seen you with a chador.

55
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,232
I had to hide the bag under it.

56
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,109
Let me see.

57
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,488
Put it back in.

58
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,994
I didn't expect to long for you so badly.

59
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,039
I missed you a lot too.

60
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,963
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen.

61
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,220
Seventeen times 4.3 million.

62
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,763
Has it gone down?

63
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,724
-When did you ask the price?
-Last week.

64
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,228
Gold rate changes every hour.

65
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,690
-Can it go up again tomorrow?
-Anything is possible.

66
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,901
Damn!

67
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,325
So? Are you selling them?

68
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,621
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

69
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,165
So why are you upset?

70
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,209
We should make sure first.

71
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,836
-About what?
-That he gives his consent.

72
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,755
Why wouldn't he?

73
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,050
He might want all his money back
to let me out.

74
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,390
Keep them, so I don't take them back home.

75
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,058
Put them in my bag.

76
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,689
Under my laundry.

77
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,357
Give it to me.

78
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,067
Leave it in the bag.

79
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,571
With two days' leave,
don't spend half the day washing.

80
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,365
I'll do it.

81
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,667
Who's there?

82
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,922
Hello, uncle!

83
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,425
Hello, my unwashed beauty!

84
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,261
Look at his beard!

85
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,932
-Who's at home?
-Mom.

86
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,685
-Mom! Uncle's here!
-Without warning!

87
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,687
You've got as heavy as your brother.

88
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,732
-Mom! Uncle's here!
-He's very welcome!

89
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,401
-Hello, Malih!
-Hello, my darling.

90
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,029
-How are you?
-I'm glad you're here.

91
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,406
-I knew it was you.
-How come?

92
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,533
Because of the way you ring.

93
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,163
-Everything okay? What are you doing?
-Come over.

94
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,915
Your mom's opening a tomato sauce shop.

95
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,502
Come here, the unexpected visitor!

96
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,379
So good to see you.

97
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,716
You've got a lot thinner.

98
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,801
You tell me that every time.

99
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,221
-How's Siavash?
-He's at school.

100
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,642
Can I have a towel to take a shower?

101
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,355
They called Mom from his school today.

102
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,028
-Why?
-For nothing.

103
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,156
-Want a razor?
-No. What has he done now?

104
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,658
He got into a fight yesterday.

105
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,370
Already telling tales?

106
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,790
But why don't they call his mother?

107
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,460
They probably did
and she said they should call you.

108
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,421
Go to the school tomorrow, if you can.

109
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,092
What's up? He was getting better.

110
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,101
-Uncle... Uncle...
-Yes?

111
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,936
His mother is remarrying.

112
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,274
-Who said that?
-Siavash did.

113
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,860
He said someone has proposed to her.

114
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,788
The towel is behind the door.

115
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,916
Call me if you want me to shave your neck.

116
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,352
-Hello.
-Hello.

117
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,355
Hello.

118
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,774
Isn't your dad here?

119
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,610
He was. He went out.

120
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,658
Here you are.

121
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,452
Thank you. How much is it?

122
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,786
52,000 tomans.

123
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,329
He told me he'd be here.

124
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,873
He's not here now.

125
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,833
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

126
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,751
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

127
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,254
Can you please call him
to see when he comes?

128
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,980
Hello? Hi, Dad. Where are you?

129
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:58,778
Hossein's here. He wants to see you.
Rahim's brother-in-law.

130
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,405
Okay then.

131
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,491
-Can I talk to him?
-Hold on.

132
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,494
Thank you.

133
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,414
Hi, Bahram. How are you?

134
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,709
Nothing serious, I hope.

135
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:20,425
I'd have preferred to see you to finally
sort this out after three years.

136
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,891
He's put together part of his debt.
Around 70 million tomans.

137
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,479
We've had many meetings.
I've heard many promises.

138
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,356
This jerk is lying.

139
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,859
I'm promising the 70 million tomans.

140
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,071
His friends have arranged it for him.

141
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,114
His friends and family

142
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,536
should give me checks to pay off his debt
and I'll withdraw the case.

143
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,623
If he gets out, he'll work hard
to pay off the rest bit by bit.

144
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,043
You, his relatives,
wouldn't write checks for him.

145
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,963
Why do you expect me to trust him?

146
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,840
I can hardly pay my own rent.

147
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,719
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let him
spend one night in jail.

148
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,473
You're saying he'll work if he gets out.
Give me a bond check...

149
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,725
Do him a favor and let him out.

150
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,979
He let down his family.
He deserves no favor.

151
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,647
Forget about what he deserves.

152
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,733
Don't you want your money?
Half of it is ready, cash.

153
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,112
-I don't trust him.
-It's not about trust.

154
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,992
I was fooled once
by his hangdog look, that's enough.

155
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:33,081
Listen, Bahram,
let's meet and talk about it.

156
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,002
Wait a minute, let me talk to him.
Just a moment.

157
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,837
Excuse me.

158
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,091
Rahim?

159
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,304
I wish I could pay him back
and not be so humiliated.

160
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,807
If I give him bond checks
for the rest of your debt,

161
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,311
could you manage to pay him
7.5 million tomans a month?

162
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,854
If I get out, I'll work.

163
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,939
-What work?
-Anything.

164
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,985
I'll take your word and commit to it.

165
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,279
I can't stand going back to prison.

166
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,163
Hello?

167
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,541
Come and eat before it gets cold.
Come on, Siavash.

168
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,335
Negar, turn off the tablet.

169
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,007
Thanks a lot. Where's Hossein?

170
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,720
In the bathroom. As soon as
we sit down to eat, he has to go.

171
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,722
Okay, kids, come on.

172
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,517
Siavash, turn off the tablet.
Come on, Negar.

173
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,102
Pass me the glasses.

174
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,897
Get up, son. Let's have dinner.

175
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,357
I'm not hungry.

176
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,984
Come on. You'll play later.

177
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,362
Negar, come on.

178
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,530
-Where shall I sit?
-Next to me.

179
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,408
The phone's ringing.
Hossein, aren't you coming?

180
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,579
Hossein, see who's been calling you.

181
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,584
Siavash, turn down the tablet.
It gives me a headache.

182
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,879
Mom's rice crust looks yummy.

183
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,884
Hello? Yes, please? Hello, how are you?

184
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,347
Thank you. Sorry, I was outside.

185
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,227
Yes, please. I'm listening.

186
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,439
-I'm not hungry.
-Your dad's come after two months.

187
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,901
Siavash, come on.
There'll be no rice crust left.

188
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
But I... don't want.

189
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,447
Too bad for you!

190
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,951
Uncle, put some for me in the dish.

191
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,579
-Can I stir it?
-Sure.

192
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,206
Where are you going, Nima?

193
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,792
Too bad for both of them!

194
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,794
Leave me alone!

195
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,838
-Stop it, Nima!
-Siavash!

196
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,881
-Nima!
-I don't want.

197
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,554
-Don't worry, he'll come.
-How rude!

198
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,475
Yum-yum! Thank you so much.

199
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,395
-Who's calling at dinner time?
-Bahram.

200
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,479
Mummy.

201
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,691
What did he say?

202
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,444
He wants the checks
and the money tomorrow.

203
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,487
Pass me the bread.

204
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,906
What did you tell him?

205
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,409
Let's have dinner first.

206
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,910
My turn, Mom.

207
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,833
Who's the friend giving you 70 million?

208
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,585
Have some rice crust, Uncle.

209
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,296
Someone you don't know.

210
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,882
Please don't go to a loan shark again.

211
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,804
Who mentioned loan sharks?

212
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,182
Then where is this money coming from?

213
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,601
I told you, a friend promised it.

214
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,311
Don't take me for an idiot.

215
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,606
It's not a loan.

216
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,403
Did you agree to meet?

217
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:57,118
I told him I only had two checks left.
I'll order a new checkbook tomorrow.

218
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,621
-How long will that take?
-What?

219
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,874
That. The new checkbook.

220
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,418
Wait for your friend
to give you the 70 million.

221
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,546
Between what people say
and what they do...

222
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,888
You shouldn't have promised then,
so as not to embarrass me.

223
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,098
I don't have enough checks.

224
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,227
Even if he had them
and gave him bond checks,

225
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,813
how will you pay him back every month?

226
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,274
Siavash, turn it down.

227
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:37,033
Hossein offered to write the checks,
Malih. I didn't force him.

228
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,369
I'm not saying you shouldn't give checks.

229
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,872
You should find a job first
and then give checks to him.

230
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:47,126
If ever one of the checks bounces,
it will be the same hassle.

231
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,296
His leave ends in two days.
How can he find a job?

232
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,550
I don't know. It's up to you.

233
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,836
Swear on Mom's soul
you're telling me the truth.

234
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,047
Whose handbag is it?

235
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,717
You rummaged in my bag?

236
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,969
I wanted to take your laundry.

237
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:42,682
Don't do anything that would disgrace
you and the family forever.

238
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,350
Like what?

239
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,477
Where did you get these coins?

240
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,646
A friend gave them to me.

241
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,568
The cigarettes, the lighter, the handbag
are also your friend's?

242
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,281
Go on, Malih. Call me a thief.

243
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,242
What's this handbag with a broken strap?

244
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,878
He... is... shouting.

245
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:17,550
That was a bit rough, wasn't it?
Let's make it smoother.

246
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:23,514
The boy... is... shouting.

247
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,809
-Good.
-Bye.

248
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:31,689
The girl... is washing... her... hands.

249
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,945
Shall we try a bit smoother?
How would that sound?

250
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,447
Was... sitting.

251
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,866
Good morning. Yes, please?

252
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,953
Is there anyone else
who can write the bond checks?

253
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,122
Who would take the risk?

254
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,500
What are you going to do?

255
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:55,505
I don't feel up to it.

256
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,423
What do you mean?

257
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,219
-My conscience won't allow it.
-You're saying that now?

258
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,471
Ever since you told me, I've had doubts.

259
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,936
I thought that all that praying to God

260
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,814
made Him have pity on us
and provide a miracle.

261
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,943
Then instead of 17 coins, He'd have
sent us everything to clear my debt

262
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,778
and got me out of this mess.

263
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,242
Why are you upset?

264
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,994
-I'm not upset.
-Yes, you are.

265
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,913
What's wrong?

266
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,751
Farkhondeh, tell me. My love.

267
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,296
-Nothing.
-I'm sorry, I can't cope with this.

268
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,133
Okay. Go and find the owner.

269
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,721
-We have to go together.
-Goodbye.

270
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:55,189
No. 55, please refer to Box 7.

271
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,068
-Excuse me...
-Take a number and wait your turn.

272
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,904
-It's not for a banking process.
-Go ahead.

273
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,323
-Hello.
-Hello.

274
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:08,077
I was wondering
if anybody came here for a lost bag.

275
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,412
No, why?

276
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,291
I've found some gold.

277
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,547
Guys, did anyone report something missing?

278
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,469
-How much is it?
-A lot.

279
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,388
-Just outside the bank?
-No, at the bus stop.

280
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,974
-When?
-Recently.

281
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,643
Nobody's come to ask.

282
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:36,105
If anybody does, I have the handbag.

283
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,316
Well done. Give us your number.

284
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,195
Can I have some paper to write it down?

285
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,032
Here you are.

286
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,658
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

287
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,536
No. 60, please refer to Box 7.

288
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,087
They can call this number and ask for me.

289
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,714
-What's this number?
-A prison.

290
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,216
You work there?

291
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,636
I'm an inmate, for a debt.
I'm out on leave.

292
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,599
If you like, write an ad with your number.

293
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,352
I'll copy it
and you can put it around here.

294
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,853
Thanks a lot.

295
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,494
We're rid of it.

296
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,417
What's the matter?

297
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,380
-Are you regretting it?
-No.

298
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,799
Please stop sulking.

299
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,220
If you're regretting it,
just cross the street,

300
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:53,266
take my number, call me,
and say it's your bag.

301
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:58,020
Describe it. If it's right,
we'll meet in some discreet place,

302
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,605
and I'll return it to you.

303
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,527
But if you're sulking when you call me,
I won't give it back to you.

304
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,571
You must be cheerful.

305
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,661
Just put yourself in the shoes
of this poor woman who's lost it.

306
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,623
-Can you?
-Okay.

307
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,002
Hello, madam.
Have you lost a bag? I've found it.

308
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,670
God bless you.

309
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,674
Is that it? I want a reward.

310
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,304
You have such a pure heart.

311
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,604
Tomorrow, I'll be back in jail
and longing for you.

312
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,355
This poor heart!

313
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,525
And you want me to quit smoking.

314
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,780
Let's go somewhere calmer.

315
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,869
-Is it for my reward?
-Get going.

316
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:01,751
I barely saw you these two days.
Let me at least say goodbye properly.

317
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,213
-What's this?
-Your clothes.

318
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,800
I got you a new shirt.

319
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,970
Thank you so much. It's very nice.

320
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,098
And there's a new toothbrush.

321
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,135
-Good job.
-Thank you.

322
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,974
-Mr. Soltani?
-Yes, Madam?

323
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,477
Did you give our number to anyone?

324
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm sorry, Ms. Marvasti. I had to.

325
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,400
I shouldn't have given you this number.

326
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,567
The thing is...

327
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:12,905
I found a bag and I gave the number
in case the owner is found,

328
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,824
so that she can get it back.

329
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,743
-Did anyone call you?
-She'll call again.

330
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,246
Don't give this number out to anyone.

331
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,789
I won't. I'm sorry.

332
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,213
I've just come back from leave,
I won't get another one any time soon.

333
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:33,009
Can someone at your place
give it to her? She's so anxious.

334
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,553
I'll call to see if my sister's there.

335
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,764
Excuse me.
Can you please describe the bag?

336
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:42,518
Then I can arrange for you
to get it back at my sister's.

337
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,104
You're very welcome.

338
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,734
Where did you lose it? How long ago?

339
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,487
What did it look like?

340
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,494
How many coins?

341
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,457
What brand of cigarettes?

342
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,962
-Who's there?
-Open the door, please.

343
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,509
-Is this Mr. Soltani's house?
-Yes.

344
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,927
Come in.

345
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,512
Excuse me.

346
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,184
-Hello.
-Hello. Was it you I just spoke to?

347
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,352
Yes, come in.

348
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:28,439
I still had my bag on my shoulder
at the bus stop.

349
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,359
I took out money for my ticket.

350
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,112
When the bus arrived, I hopped on.

351
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:38,199
I don't know if it fell off
as I was getting on

352
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,701
or if it got ripped off on the bus.

353
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,580
At the next stop,
I realized I didn't have it.

354
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,542
I shouted to the driver
I'd lost my bag and to stop.

355
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,419
The poor guy stopped.

356
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,799
He shut the bus doors
and searched all the passengers.

357
00:27:54,882 --> 00:28:00,513
He said it wasn't there,
that I probably dropped it somewhere.

358
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,391
Why did you put so many coins in it?

359
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,893
I was going to sell them.

360
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,731
Each time I left the house,
I was so afraid

361
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:14,819
my husband or his brother
would find the gold

362
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,279
and it'd go up in a puff of smoke.

363
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,493
I decided to sell them and put the money
in a bank account,

364
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,664
so that nobody around me
would know I had gold.

365
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:31,419
Siavash dear, go get the bag
your dad told us about.

366
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:40,553
This morning, I came across the ad
that said a bag was found.

367
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,930
As if God...

368
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,058
You are blessed.

369
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,605
God knows I earned these coins one by one,

370
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:55,359
weaving rugs, struggling,

371
00:28:56,193 --> 00:29:00,948
saving them secretly
in case I'm in need someday.

372
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,951
It was God's will
my brother had some leave

373
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,703
and found your bag on his way.

374
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,206
-Have some tea, please.
-Thank you so much.

375
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,836
I was so nervous I took a taxi,
he's waiting outside.

376
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:18,757
Siavash, did you find it?
I put it near the mirror.

377
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:23,179
May God arrange a way
for your brother to get out of jail.

378
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,015
Such a good man shouldn't be there.

379
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,439
-Here you are.
-Look...

380
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,734
The strap's broken.
It must have fallen off.

381
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,071
Check if you have everything in it.

382
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,616
Pass my best regards to your brother.

383
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,868
-Sorry I bothered you.
-Not at all.

384
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,453
-Take care.
-Thank you.

385
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,663
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

386
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,376
Hey, kid.

387
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,258
-Here, son. Take it, please.
-No...

388
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,135
Don't offer it, please. Thanks.

389
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,430
It comes from the bottom
of my heart. Take it.

390
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,516
Dad...

391
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,229
He says his father wouldn't like it.

392
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,814
It's yours. Don't tell your dad.

393
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,775
Go on, darling, no problem.

394
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,903
-Bye.
-That's very kind of you. Goodbye.

395
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,949
Let's go.

396
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,172
Write your sister's number down.
Mr. Taheri wants to talk to her.

397
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,050
-To my sister?
-Yes.

398
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,052
What for?

399
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,222
About the gold.
He wants to ask her a few questions.

400
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,122
Here you are.

401
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,010
-Hello.
-Hello. Well done.

402
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,478
-Would you like some tea?
-Yes, thanks.

403
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,063
He's in jail for a debt.

404
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,275
I've just talked to his sister.

405
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,116
Yes, he found it during his leave.

406
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:54,330
You come whenever you want. He's here.

407
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:58,626
You can also talk to him outside.
We can arrange it.

408
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,045
What you did is beautiful.

409
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,921
It's a noble gesture.

410
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,342
-Please take a seat.
-Please sit down.

411
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,052
Okay, let me know.

412
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,847
-He hasn't told anybody.
-That's what makes it beautiful.

413
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,892
-How's everything?
-Fine, thank you.

414
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,810
Okay. Goodbye.

415
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:20,731
-Well?
-They'll organize it and call back.

416
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,985
A TV crew is coming to interview you.

417
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:29,573
I did nothing special.
It was just a few coins...

418
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,367
The number doesn't matter.

419
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,621
You've taken your two days' leave
to find the owner, in your situation.

420
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:40,876
There's also a newspaper
that wants to arrange an interview.

421
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,588
-It's very kind of you.
-No, it's kind of you.

422
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,007
We have to learn from you.

423
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,134
Come on. It's getting late.

424
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,552
They'll be here soon.

425
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,804
Let him have his tea.

426
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,348
Make a congratulatory banner and hang it.

427
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,351
He's our calligrapher.
He can't congratulate himself.

428
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,812
We'll have them done outside.

429
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,231
-I did nothing special.
-Yes, you did.

430
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,733
A screw-up like that doesn't go unnoticed.

431
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,153
Letting loads of gold get away
is special! Get going.

432
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,073
-Stop pulling his leg.
-"Nothing special."

433
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,285
Soltani!

434
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,707
Come here.
Have you got something decent to wear?

435
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,167
-Shall I order it for you?
-Yes, I do.

436
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:26,755
Go and tidy yourself up,
and trim your beard. What's that?

437
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,931
-Hello.
-Hello.

438
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,478
Mr. Taheri?

439
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,314
Mr. Taheri.

440
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,028
-Yes?
-Excuse me, just one second.

441
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,908
It's just that... I didn't find the bag.

442
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,785
Who did then?

443
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,830
Well... My wife.

444
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,124
Who returned it to the owner?

445
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,918
I made the decision to return it.

446
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,380
So you gave it back.
Tell them exactly that.

447
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,758
Say, "My wife found it and I returned it."

448
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:15,345
No, in fact, nobody knows we're together.

449
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,556
I can't give her name.

450
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,185
-Isn't she your wife?
-Not yet.

451
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:25,063
So you're naughty too!

452
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,317
No... We're getting married
as soon as I get out.

453
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,111
-Anyway, you returned the gold, right?
-Yes.

454
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,240
There we go.
Forget about the rest and hurry up.

455
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,519
Rolling.

456
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:08,982
He is very conscientious, very earnest,

457
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,318
very reliable, and a very honest man.

458
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:16,573
In spite of his financial difficulties,
he has proven with this act

459
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:21,036
that one can always prioritize

460
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,789
good deeds over personal interest.

461
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,045
I have been sentenced to 10 years
while I have nothing to pay my debts.

462
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,590
I'm Rahim Soltani, Mostafa's son.

463
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:37,594
I was born
in Sangsiah neighborhood in Shiraz.

464
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,518
Rahim! You're on TV!

465
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,894
-Really?
-Yes!

466
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,776
I was a sign painter and calligrapher.

467
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,405
When printed banners came along,
I had to close my business.

468
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,865
Why are you in jail?

469
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:05,289
I got a loan to start a new business.

470
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:09,585
But my partner took my money,

471
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,088
so I wasn't able to pay back the loan.

472
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,174
My guarantor had to pay for me,

473
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:21,388
but then, he filed a complaint
against me and I went to jail.

474
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,766
At first, I thought it was a miracle.

475
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,269
God put this bag in my path

476
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,565
to free me from the harassment
and the insults of my creditor.

477
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,487
I even sent him a message to tell him
I could pay part of my debt back.

478
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:43,535
But then I thought to myself I couldn't.
It was probably a test.

479
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,581
I got off the bus here.
I went there to buy cakes,

480
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,375
so I wouldn't go home empty-handed.

481
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:54,087
I saw a handbag that had fallen here.
At this point.

482
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:59,092
Right here.
On the ground, with the strap broken.

483
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,929
I opened it, it was full of coins.

484
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,932
I looked around, there was nobody.

485
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:09,937
I thought it over all night.
I thought if I took another's belonging,

486
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,523
at some point,
I'll be punished for it a hundredfold.

487
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,692
Next morning, I came back here

488
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:19,363
and put ads everywhere
saying I'd found a bag.

489
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,073
First, I went to that bank.

490
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,952
I asked them if anybody
had been there for a lost bag.

491
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,370
They said no.

492
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:32,042
That's why I had to write the ad
with my phone number.

493
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,962
Here, in the prison,
we really appreciate him.

494
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,714
Since we've had him with us,

495
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:42,469
our spaces, the climate
have all become more colorful.

496
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:47,516
He has regularly taken part
in all the training courses

497
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,188
and cultural activities
organized for the inmates.

498
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,316
Thank God, it has borne fruit.

499
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,988
I wish to thank the warden, Mr. Salehpour,

500
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,533
and Mr. Taheri,
in charge of cultural activities,

501
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,245
for their efforts to improve
the inmates' wellbeing.

502
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,416
How did I look? Okay? Really?

503
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,168
Did everyone at home see it?

504
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,505
-Well done.
-Thanks.

505
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,676
Do you realize the whole country
saw the shirt you gave me?

506
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,680
You know how to fool people.

507
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,436
Farkhondeh, it's ringing.

508
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,732
I'll call you.

509
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,945
Take care of yourself. Me too, a lot.

510
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,031
Bye.

511
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:53,874
What did you say?

512
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,175
-I'm talking to you.
-What did I say?

513
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,801
Who fools people?

514
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:08,764
You got offended.
You paint camouflage, don't you?

515
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:15,145
-What do they give you in exchange?
-Who?

516
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:19,816
The ones you thanked for their concern
about the inmates' wellbeing.

517
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,985
Nobody will give me anything.

518
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:26,156
Nothing? You cover up their shit for free?

519
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,825
-Step back.
-Go ahead, slap me.

520
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,625
I wish you had the guts to slap me.
I really do.

521
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,963
Being a man is not about growing a beard.

522
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,800
You should have said that two weeks ago,

523
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,719
Shakuri killed himself
after six years in jail.

524
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,900
Hopefully, thanks to your intervention,
things will get sorted out

525
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,318
and he'll be released.

526
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,361
I hope so.

527
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,197
You told me on the phone a few days ago...

528
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,324
-That day...
-Let me speak.

529
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,743
You said he had 70 million, right?

530
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,412
No. In fact,

531
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,374
Mr. Taheri, the 70 million
was the value of the coins I found.

532
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,795
I thought I could sell them
and pay back some of my debt.

533
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,381
Then my conscience didn't allow me to.

534
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,802
How come his conscience
doesn't bother him with me?

535
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,306
Maybe he was wrong to be conscientious

536
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,559
and give a poor woman her money back?

537
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,187
Wouldn't you have felt bad
having her money?

538
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,606
Can I talk to you in private?

539
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,109
Please leave for a few minutes.

540
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,162
I'm listening to you.

541
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,374
How can you be sure
this story about the bag isn't made up?

542
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,001
How can you be sure it is?

543
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,337
He's my sister-in-law's ex. I know him.

544
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,174
That doesn't prove anything.
Anyhow, he made a human gesture.

545
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,593
How did he become so human overnight?

546
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,429
Why do you think his wife left him?

547
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,224
Do you have any clear proof he's lying?

548
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,184
-I do.
-Say, what is it?

549
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,355
He's been bullshitting people
all his life.

550
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,481
What bullshit?

551
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:09,486
He said on TV he got a loan
and wasn't able to pay for it.

552
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,655
-Well?
-Let me speak.

553
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:16,076
What bank would give him a loan?
Why didn't he say it was a loan shark?

554
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,328
-So what?
-Why does he lie?

555
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,289
Maybe he was embarrassed. That's no proof.

556
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,167
I don't want to slander him.

557
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:28,755
But I warn you, Mr. Taheri,
if he doesn't pay me, I'll denounce him.

558
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,173
Denounce what?

559
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:34,886
If the owner of the bag hadn't called,
no one would have known.

560
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,307
If he didn't want anyone to know,
why did he publicize the prison's number?

561
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:42,352
He should have left his cell phone number.

562
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,396
There are no cell phones in jail.

563
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,940
So how could he text me?

564
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:50,694
A text from jail?
Did he text you from jail?

565
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,491
Mr. Taheri,
you know what his story's all about?

566
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,993
Get to the point.

567
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:02,414
Ever since he learned that his ex,
my sister-in-law,

568
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,834
has been proposed to,
he's started to hassle me.

569
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:11,131
He keeps calling and texting me
to get my consent to get out of jail.

570
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,300
To stop her from getting married.

571
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,261
His private life is none of my business.

572
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:20,056
Listen to me.
You asked me to prove he's lying.

573
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,516
He feels humiliated.

574
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,353
He made up this story
to restore his reputation

575
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,231
and try to get his wife back.

576
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,984
No, you're wrong. I have some information.

577
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,402
That's all it's about.

578
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:37,240
He has a partner. He plans
to marry her when he gets out.

579
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,627
You know what?

580
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,797
I don't care whether
he found the bag or not.

581
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,800
I want what's due after three years.

582
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,136
Not in dribs and drabs.

583
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,765
You've waited for three years.
Give him a few more days.

584
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:05,185
I'll talk to him
and see how he can pay you back.

585
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,147
And if he can't?

586
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,107
It'll be up to you to decide.

587
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,782
He's been granted special leave.

588
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,867
-Hello, Hossein.
-Hello.

589
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:25,497
They'll get the creditor's consent
so he doesn't go back to jail.

590
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,957
God willing. Let's hope.

591
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,918
Yes, I'll pass him to you.

592
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,587
Rahim... Rahim!

593
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,839
Just a moment. He's coming.

594
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,472
Be careful of the cars.

595
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:48,061
-Hello.
-Hello, sweetheart, congratulations!

596
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,354
Here you are.

597
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,939
What are you celebrating?

598
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:57,320
My father was released.

599
00:44:57,404 --> 00:45:00,240
Wonderful. Wait,
I'll give you the bowl back.

600
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,367
I saw him on TV.

601
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,829
Who's so much trouble for?

602
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,914
It's the talk of the neighborhood.

603
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,167
At least ten people called
to say you make them proud.

604
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,837
Some cousins are coming tonight.

605
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,839
Do we have enough food?

606
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:19,467
I'll do some shopping.
We'll have loads of people these days.

607
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:23,054
-Try this to see if it fits.
-Thanks a lot.

608
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,027
-You might need this.
-I don't need it.

609
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,821
Don't make a fuss.

610
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,282
Thank you.

611
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,535
Don't smoke in front of people.
It's not worthy of you.

612
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,078
Okay.

613
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,582
-You distributed the soup?
-Yes.

614
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,459
-Malih?
-Yes?

615
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,961
-Get ready, we'll go somewhere.
-Where?

616
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,881
-You'll see.
-Where?

617
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,467
I'll tell you on the road.

618
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,388
How did you find her?

619
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,934
-She was my cellmate.
-No, seriously?

620
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,104
She works at the speech therapy center.

621
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,024
-Doesn't she mind your situation?
-No.

622
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,653
-Does Siavash know?
-Not yet.

623
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,473
-Aren't you alone?
-Maliheh wanted to see you.

624
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,767
-Ask her in.
-Next time.

625
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:54,312
-Is your brother home?
-Yes.

626
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,148
-Ask him to come. Hello.
-Please come in.

627
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,566
Thank you.

628
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,696
Call Morteza. He wants to talk to him.

629
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,370
Don't make us look bad. Grow up a bit!

630
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,122
He must have planned it with Farkhondeh.

631
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,083
I already said no.

632
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,293
If I go see him now, I'll say it again.

633
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:20,713
-Don't try to force me.
-He isn't a murderer.

634
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:24,676
Fine, he's a saint! He has a big kid.

635
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,429
He's been to jail, he's got no job.
I'll never agree!

636
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:31,432
Stop being so macho! Your sister's 37.

637
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:36,396
I don't care who she sees.
She can do what she likes.

638
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,191
But she shouldn't come back here in tears,

639
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,485
saying she wants to split up.

640
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:46,573
Read that, then go
and tell him what you want.

641
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,408
-What's that?
-Just read it.

642
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,327
-I'm cold, Mom.
-Go get dressed.

643
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,808
Pass my best regards. Thank you.

644
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,477
We have to go back soon. Thank you.

645
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:21,065
Yes, he brought it yesterday.
Thank God it's all right.

646
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,740
Beat it so that kids will dance.

647
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,408
We're going to talk.

648
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,787
-Beat it.
-Come on.

649
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,264
And to your generosity...

650
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,360
Good evening and thank you.

651
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,697
We are very grateful for your support
to our charity association.

652
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,742
First of all, Mr. Soltani...

653
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:20,041
-Mr. Soltani, please join us.
-Give him a round of applause.

654
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:26,589
-A round of applause for his noble deed.
-Yes!

655
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:31,135
Mr. Soltani, in his TV interview,

656
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,307
said that when he found the coins,
he thought it was a miracle.

657
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,267
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

658
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,063
Then he thought
God might have been testing him.

659
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:47,402
I'd like to say to Mr. Soltani
it really is a miracle. You know why?

660
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,822
I received a call earlier
from the local council.

661
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,950
As a sign of appreciation
for his selfless courage,

662
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:58,496
this gentleman will be offered a job
in their administration.

663
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:01,249
Great! Give him some applause.

664
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,629
Thank you!

665
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:12,552
We hope that, thanks to the efforts
of the prison management,

666
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,639
also thanks to the town's benefactors
and your generosity,

667
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:21,352
through your contribution tonight,
we can get his creditor's consent

668
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:26,274
and have him return to his family
and dear son as soon as possible.

669
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:30,027
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much!

670
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,781
A round of applause for his noble deed!

671
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,413
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

672
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,458
Mr. Soltani, please...

673
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,336
-Please grant us a few words.
-Sure.

674
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,881
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

675
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:55,636
I must confess, at first, I was tempted

676
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:59,974
to sell the coins and pay off my debt.

677
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,352
But there was a mishap at the gold dealer.

678
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,857
When he set out to calculate
the price of the coins,

679
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,609
his calculator broke down.

680
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:13,946
He took a pen, but it didn't work either.

681
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:20,787
I suddenly thought to myself
that these were signs.

682
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,582
Signs which indicated
that wasn't the right thing to do

683
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,834
and I should return it to the owner.

684
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,545
Bravo! Congratulations.

685
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,135
Thank you, Mr. Soltani. Congratulations!

686
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:40,640
If you agree, we'll exchange
a few words with this young man.

687
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,518
Anything you want to say
about your father?

688
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,478
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

689
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,813
I...

690
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:56,572
l like...

691
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:02,829
Enough money...

692
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,542
Debt...

693
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:14,507
collected...

694
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:18,970
Go... back...

695
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,892
Jail... My own money...

696
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:28,229
Good boy. How much do you want to give?

697
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:32,400
Fifty thousand...

698
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,697
tomans.

699
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,450
Let's cheer for him!

700
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,214
Bring the cakes from the kitchen.

701
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,054
Why here, Sir? Please go inside.

702
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:56,776
-Take this. 250,000 tomans.
-Yes.

703
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,529
-100,000 tomans.
-Yes.

704
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,490
Another 100,000 tomans.

705
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,950
-Hello.
-Hello.

706
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:07,578
-Yes.
-And finally 500,000 tomans.

707
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:10,206
32.750 million tomans.

708
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:15,461
Plus 1.4 million tomans
in cash and a gold bracelet.

709
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:21,050
That's a total of 34.150 million tomans.

710
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,928
We'll evaluate the price of the bracelet.

711
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,973
The prisoners chipped in
some 840,000 tomans.

712
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:30,142
-I'll pay it to the association.
-Thank you.

713
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:32,728
The warden and I will give 200,000 tomans.

714
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:33,771
Thank you.

715
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:37,400
-You've already done a lot.
-Our pleasure.

716
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:41,946
Hossein, while we're here,
go get your checkbook...

717
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,572
Wait a minute.

718
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:49,912
My debt is 150 million tomans.
150 million from three years ago.

719
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,832
What use is 34 or 35 million to me?

720
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:58,587
Bahram, come on. Where are you going?

721
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,340
The poor lady took off her bracelet,

722
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:05,136
even the prisoners donated to get him out.

723
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,554
Please cooperate too.

724
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,056
You're talking as if I was cheating him.

725
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:12,601
He did a good deed.
You should make an effort...

726
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:16,063
What good deed? What good deed?

727
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:20,526
Even if he found a bag
and returned it to its owner,

728
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,862
it's only normal, he did his duty.

729
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,572
Would you have returned it?

730
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,282
Of course. Why not?

731
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:31,245
You're not in jail for debt.
If you were and you had...

732
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,830
Please, madam...

733
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:38,335
Many people are in
far worse situations than him.

734
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:42,298
They could steal and they don't.
Are they celebrated?

735
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:48,512
I've never dishonored anybody.
Will I be given a certificate?

736
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,309
Where in the world are people celebrated
for not doing wrong?

737
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,604
Your problem is my merit certificate?

738
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,065
My problem is you being so ungrateful.

739
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,610
-Come here, Bahram.
-My problem is you being ungrateful.

740
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:07,364
This certificate is the least we could do
for such a noble deed.

741
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,910
What noble deed?
What noble deed did he do?

742
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,328
What good did he do?

743
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:17,208
I did good three years ago
because I considered him family.

744
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:21,462
I gave a bond check to a loan shark
so he could start a business.

745
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,423
I did good
when he didn't meet the payments.

746
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:29,303
I sold my wife's jewelry to pay off
his debt, the interest and the penalties.

747
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,387
God bless you.

748
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,847
Now he's a hero,

749
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,434
and me who did so much for him,
the bastard creditor?

750
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,436
Not at all. God forbid.

751
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,564
I had to sell my daughter's dowry for him.

752
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:48,823
He wanted to sell the gold and give me
70 million tomans, but I refused.

753
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,783
-Is that right?
-Yes, but...

754
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:55,579
If I'd accepted it as part of his debt,
he'd come out of jail.

755
00:56:55,663 --> 00:57:00,501
Then would he have made
all this fuss about finding gold?

756
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,755
It's because I refused
that he built up this story.

757
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:06,924
I won't reply out of respect.

758
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,552
Don't get on my nerves
or I'll grass you up.

759
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,304
Stop it. There's a child here.

760
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,769
-Bahram...
-Wait, Bahram. Wait!

761
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,107
Come here for a second.

762
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,991
We've arranged for him
to be interviewed on TV.

763
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:35,661
I'll have him call you during the show.

764
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:40,082
Say that as he did a good deed,
you consent to have him released.

765
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:45,254
So you teach a good lesson
to the audience and restore your image.

766
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,756
Will my image give my daughter a dowry?

767
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,510
Anyway, if he pays this amount
to the court as bail,

768
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:55,431
they'll stagger the rest of his debt,
and he'll be out.

769
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:01,687
It's much nicer if you give your consent.

770
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,945
If I agree, it's only for this poor kid.

771
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:11,614
God bless you. Thank you.

772
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:14,825
Write up the minutes and have it signed.

773
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:24,001
-Hello.
-Can I help you?

774
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,670
-I'm Rahim Soltani.
-Yes?

775
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:29,506
-Ms. Radmehr sent me.
-Who?

776
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,675
Mehrpooyan Charity Association.

777
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,762
I've come to meet
the head of Human Resources.

778
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,182
-You're the guy who was on TV.
-That's right.

779
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,518
-I have an appointment at 11:00.
-Yes.

780
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:47,566
Can I have your ID?

781
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,989
It's this way, first floor. Mr. Nadeali.

782
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:56,742
TRUSTWORTHY PRISONER RETURNS
A BAG FULL OF GOLD TO ITS OWNER

783
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:06,460
I can do all kinds of jobs,
calligraphy, painting...

784
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,795
Good for you.

785
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,547
-At your service.
-Have some tea.

786
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,715
Thank you.

787
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:17,638
Tell me, the gentleman
you gave the coins back to...

788
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,223
It was a lady.

789
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,059
Can I have her number to call her?

790
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,020
Her number... I don't have it.

791
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:27,356
Didn't it show up on your phone?

792
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,817
She called the prison.

793
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,027
Her address then?

794
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,364
I don't think I've got it. Why?

795
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,366
You've got no information about her?

796
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:40,244
I never met her.
My sister gave her the bag.

797
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,870
Is there any problem?

798
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:45,833
Do you have any proof
you found this bag and gave it back?

799
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,668
I have no proof.

800
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:53,173
Just a merit certificate
from the charity where it's written.

801
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,758
Any witnesses?

802
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,427
The prison managers.

803
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,012
Apart from them.

804
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,307
My sister and my son are witnesses.
What's wrong?

805
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:07,062
In order to approve your application,
I have to make sure of certain facts.

806
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:09,606
What facts?

807
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,985
-There are rumors going round.
-What rumors?

808
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:17,573
That maybe your story's made up.

809
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,330
Made up?

810
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,375
What's wrong with my checking the facts?

811
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:34,173
-Did my creditor contact you?
-No.

812
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,304
Any of the inmates?

813
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:45,517
No, on social media,
some rumors have spread.

814
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,562
Are you doubting me?

815
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:53,525
I'm not. But there's this rumor.

816
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,110
Why?

817
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:59,114
They say this story's made up
by the prison authorities,

818
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,493
to create a diversion
from the recent suicide.

819
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:06,997
-I swear on my son's life...
-Why are you swearing?

820
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,626
-Didn't you bring the bag?
-Yes, I did.

821
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,879
Ask the owner, your sister
and your son to come here,

822
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:17,966
so I can ask them a few questions
and they'll sign a statement.

823
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:23,389
If tomorrow some loony comes here,
I'll know how to shut his mouth.

824
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:26,100
-Is it hard to do?
-No.

825
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,665
Hello. How are you?

826
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,877
Sorry to disturb you. A few days ago,

827
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:58,882
a lady called me from this number.
If she's there, I'd like to talk to her.

828
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:03,679
She came to our place by taxi
and called me from this number.

829
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,974
Are you her husband?

830
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,105
I see... Hello. How are you?

831
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,232
I see.

832
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:18,193
Do you have her address?

833
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,113
Who is it?

834
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,453
No, nothing's wrong.

835
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,877
Thank you. Goodbye. Have a good day.

836
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,086
So?

837
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:41,258
It was the taxi driver who drove her here.
She called from his phone.

838
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,097
Why didn't you ask for her number?

839
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:50,017
She'd just called me,
the number showed up.

840
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:52,644
How could I know it wasn't hers?

841
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,983
Rahim, how come you didn't ask
for her address or number?

842
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:01,528
How was I to know we'd need any of this?

843
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:08,827
Didn't she give any information?
Where she lived, where she was going?

844
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,537
I said all I can remember.

845
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:13,665
-Remember anything else, kids?
-No.

846
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:19,046
Uncle, she said nobody knew she had gold.
She was too scared to tell anyone.

847
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:22,174
Take me to the council tomorrow.

848
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,427
I'll tell them I saw her
and I gave her the bag.

849
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,721
He insists on seeing her.

850
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:31,016
I... saw...

851
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,102
her.

852
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,063
"I saw her."

853
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,733
Malih, call the taxi driver again.

854
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:13,308
When she got in, she was very agitated.

855
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:15,978
I asked her what happened.
She said nothing.

856
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,648
She asked if she could use my phone.

857
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,026
-I think she called your sister, right?
-Yes.

858
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,903
Did she talk to you on the road?

859
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:27,990
No. But when she got back in
outside your place,

860
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:31,743
I saw in the rear-view mirror
she was counting coins.

861
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:36,873
She asked me to stop by a gold dealer.

862
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:41,295
I found one, stopped, and she went in.

863
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,714
What for?

864
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:48,552
How would I know? She just went in.

865
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,972
Was she dark-skinned?

866
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,182
I didn't meet her.

867
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,060
-About ten days ago?
-Yes.

868
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,938
And her coins were not rimmed.

869
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:04,234
She's the one who asked us to check
if the coins were real gold.

870
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,529
-Seventeen of them.
-Yes, she came here.

871
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:11,158
I checked them one by one
and told her they were gold.

872
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:16,788
She asked the value.
She wanted to sell one.

873
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:20,334
I found her a bit shifty
and said we weren't buying that day.

874
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,128
Why shifty?

875
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:28,467
If the coins were hers, she wouldn't
have asked if they were real gold.

876
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,512
Why? Were these coins yours?

877
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,067
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

878
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:48,028
Can I see the images from your cameras?

879
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:52,574
You need a warrant from the police.

880
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,289
Can I just take a picture of them
with my phone?

881
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,624
No, sorry.

882
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:13,428
Excuse me,
can you have a look at this certificate?

883
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,071
I guess she wanted to check

884
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,366
I hadn't replaced her coins
with fake ones.

885
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:38,912
Listen. I don't want to worry you,

886
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,291
but if there was nothing wrong
with this woman,

887
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:49,172
at least the day after,
she would have called to thank you.

888
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,677
Can we go to where she got out?

889
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:58,390
Buying your recyclable items.

890
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,933
She went that way.

891
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,529
Keep your money.

892
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,323
No, thank you. How much is it?

893
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:17,033
I won't charge a prisoner.

894
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,994
Please. It's not fair.

895
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,037
Nothing is fair in this world.

896
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,124
I also spent two years in jail unfairly.

897
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,543
You're too kind.

898
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:31,339
I hope you find her. But if you don't,

899
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:35,552
just go there with another lady
and say you gave the bag to her.

900
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,221
And if you need anything, call me.

901
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,835
Aren't you the man
I saw on TV in the regional news?

902
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:50,836
Yes.

903
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,255
I thought you looked familiar.

904
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,841
It's nice of you.

905
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,846
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

906
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,267
-How about this, Auntie?
-Let me see.

907
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:10,397
No, that's too tight.
Go get something nicer.

908
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,940
What's that?

909
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,651
Don't do that. Stop it.

910
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,529
-Rahim, hurry up.
-Coming.

911
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,741
-Is it working?
-No, it's not recording.

912
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:25,662
Nima, go and ask the neighbor
for their DVD player.

913
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:26,746
Okay.

914
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:35,797
-Say your uncle's on TV tonight!
-I will.

915
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:43,013
You should take the woman's picture
and show it during the evening.

916
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,514
Okay.

917
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,684
-Did you tell your mom to watch?
-Yes.

918
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,269
-Was she happy?
-A lot!

919
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,478
Rahim, your phone.

920
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:53,398
Come here, Rahim, I'll do your hair a bit.

921
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:56,484
-Did you find one, sweetheart?
-Not yet.

922
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,153
Hello?

923
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:04,576
Who's calling?
Yes, how are you? Everything fine?

924
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,954
"I'm very happy
and I'm proud of my father."

925
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:11,458
I'm getting ready with my son
and then off we go.

926
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,710
Happy...

927
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:19,215
I am proud... of him.

928
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:22,594
Try not to be stressed.
Put this on and let's try again.

929
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,763
I'm happy,

930
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:29,184
and I'm... proud...

931
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,685
Nobody told me anything.

932
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,521
Put on these pants my mom gave you.

933
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:34,981
What happened?

934
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:40,987
The thing is my son told his friends

935
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:43,323
he'd be on TV tonight.

936
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,161
Rahim, come to the yard.

937
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,045
Anything wrong?

938
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:00,966
-It's been canceled.
-What do you mean?

939
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,301
Why?

940
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,763
-Who called?
-The TV guy.

941
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,307
Dad... this...

942
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,355
Is it good?

943
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,110
Dad?

944
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,286
Dad?

945
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,920
-What day was it?
-Tuesday.

946
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,382
Tuesday before noon.
Probably around 10:00.

947
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:47,429
This is the headquarters' number.
It's one of these two.

948
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,848
Call her. I'll talk to her.

949
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,599
-Thank you.
-Come with me.

950
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,769
Who wrote this rubbish?

951
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:59,607
Impossible to find out. Someone writes
something and it goes viral.

952
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:05,530
I guess that's the reason why
the TV show was canceled.

953
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:08,158
Maybe your ex-wife wanted to set you up?

954
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:14,414
I don't think so.
She's living her own life.

955
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,460
Why was your creditor threatening
to call her and ask about you?

956
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:25,425
It's obvious. We split up,
so she won't praise me.

957
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:28,261
Why did you split up?

958
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,306
The truth is,

959
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,727
we struggled, we couldn't live together.

960
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,396
Well?

961
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,191
A juice shop.
She called from there both times.

962
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:43,777
What did the guy say? Did he know her?

963
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:49,074
No, he said she was a passerby
who asked if she could use the phone.

964
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,159
How strange.

965
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,913
She's been careful not to leave any trail.

966
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,294
Are you sure she was the owner of the bag?

967
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,797
She gave the right description.

968
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,382
Why did you give the jail's number?

969
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,219
Why not your sister's?

970
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:11,137
The truth is,

971
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:16,309
I wanted to be the one
to tell her her bag was found.

972
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,520
How come you had the number?

973
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,147
Well?

974
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,275
Ms. Marvasti gave it to me.

975
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:26,820
What for?

976
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,948
Once, when I went on leave,

977
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:33,493
she needed some painting work
done at her home.

978
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,538
So she gave me the number...

979
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:39,499
You can go now. We'll see what happens.

980
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:49,425
You talked to his sister,
did you suspect anything?

981
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:52,846
-Like what?
-Like they might've made it all up.

982
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,181
No.

983
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,769
Call Ms. Marvasti.

984
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,149
What if the taxi driver
was in cahoots with her?

985
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,861
No, the poor guy even offered to help.

986
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:11,239
There's something fishy about this woman.

987
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,700
The coins probably weren't hers.

988
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,744
-You should tell the council.
-Tell them she's a thief?

989
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:21,791
It's none of Rahim's business.
As long as he's returned the gold.

990
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,293
To a thief.

991
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:27,130
With what Bahram said,
they're already starting to have doubts.

992
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:32,510
All we need now is for them to find out
Rahim gave the gold to a dodgy person.

993
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,137
What do you mean, "dodgy"?

994
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,183
She must be laying low
so nobody knows she had gold.

995
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:41,769
It doesn't matter why,
but she's nowhere to be found.

996
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,274
I don't know. I'm lost now.

997
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,067
Thank you.

998
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,577
-Malih...
-Yes?

999
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,790
-There's one thing we can do.
-What?

1000
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,835
Ask Siavash to come.

1001
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,547
Siavash, come here.

1002
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:11,966
-Do you want anything else?
-No, thanks.

1003
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:21,726
Shut the door.

1004
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,838
Mr. Nadeali will leave at 1:00 p.m.

1005
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:54,801
The lady said she'd come at 12:30.
I'm sorry she's late.

1006
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,845
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day.

1007
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,722
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1008
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,975
-Goodbye.
-You're welcome.

1009
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:06,854
Hello.

1010
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:10,441
-Hello.
-Hello, come in please.

1011
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:12,235
Sorry, I'm late.

1012
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,487
We're sorry to bother you.

1013
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,072
-Not at all.
-Sit down.

1014
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,658
-No, please.
-Come on, sit down.

1015
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:23,329
-Please, sit here.
-No, don't worry.

1016
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,956
Please sit down.

1017
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:32,255
-Shall I let them in?
-Can you come in?

1018
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:35,091
Bring me the newspaper please.

1019
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,649
You stay here please.
He wants to see the lady alone.

1020
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,491
-Hello.
-Hello.

1021
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:04,537
Come in, please. Welcome. Take a seat.

1022
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:13,880
-How are you doing?
-Fine, thanks.

1023
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,759
You should have given him your number.

1024
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,804
-I was afraid.
-Why?

1025
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:24,223
I didn't tell my husband I lost my bag.

1026
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,727
Once it's found, why wouldn't he know?

1027
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,438
I don't want him to know we've got gold.

1028
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,815
He'd spend it right away.

1029
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:36,944
I've been struggling weaving carpets
to earn them one by one.

1030
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,907
-What does your husband do?
-He doesn't work.

1031
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:45,119
Someone who works so hard to earn
a living should be more careful.

1032
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:52,001
I wanted to sell them
and put the money in the bank.

1033
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,923
Every time I went out, I was worried

1034
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:59,133
he'd find it and squander them.

1035
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:01,552
I thought it was better to sell them...

1036
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,555
-With the driver sitting outside?
-Yes.

1037
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,391
-You went to their place?
-Yes.

1038
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:10,853
Yes, he took me there. He waited for me.
Then, with the lady...

1039
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:15,441
The lady, his sister, gave me the bag.

1040
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:18,736
And the driver took me home.

1041
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,864
You took a taxi for such a long trip?

1042
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,953
I was so stressed.

1043
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,539
I wanted to go and take the bag quickly.

1044
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,040
Okay, madam...

1045
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:33,584
-You'll have to write...
-Okay.

1046
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,796
And explain all that. Then sign it.

1047
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,925
-Shall I sit outside?
-No, here.

1048
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:00,736
Let them in.

1049
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:10,663
-Here. Is it okay?
-Thank you very much.

1050
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:15,084
Please read the lady's statement
and sign it.

1051
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,754
And you sign as a witness.

1052
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,298
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1053
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,721
-Thank you.
-Here you are.

1054
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:29,640
-Thanks so much.
-You're welcome.

1055
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,767
We caused you trouble.

1056
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,605
-We're very grateful.
-You are welcome.

1057
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,692
Are we done?

1058
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,153
You can go, you'll be kept informed.

1059
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,907
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

1060
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:48,367
Thank you, madam, for your time.

1061
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,745
It's very kind of you.

1062
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,413
-You're welcome.
-Goodbye.

1063
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:53,998
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1064
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,087
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1065
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:03,966
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1066
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:10,556
Excuse me, when do you think
I'll start the job?

1067
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,559
First, the statement must be verified.

1068
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,063
-What needs to be verified?
-Everything.

1069
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,983
But he's giving checks to his creditor
relying on this job.

1070
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:23,152
For now, don't count on the job.

1071
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:26,280
Let's see if he meets the requirements.

1072
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:30,284
You said you just wanted
to question this lady.

1073
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:32,745
I went to a lot of trouble to find her.

1074
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,914
This gentleman is my witness.

1075
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,542
Ask them as many questions as you want.

1076
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,503
I'm at your service
if you have any questions.

1077
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,757
Do you want him to tell you
about the day he drove her?

1078
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,343
I picked up the lady on the street.

1079
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:51,514
She called this lady with my phone
and described her bag.

1080
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:53,057
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1081
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,017
I gave the bag to this lady.

1082
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:57,019
My nephew is my witness.

1083
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:00,189
Tell the gentleman.

1084
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:04,485
Sir... this...

1085
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,531
Lady...

1086
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,497
He can't speak well.

1087
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:19,542
The lady gave him 50,000 tomans
as a reward.

1088
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,585
Yes.

1089
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,340
Could you please wait outside?

1090
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,637
Shut the door please.

1091
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:38,603
-When did you find this bag?
-The day of my leave.

1092
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:43,316
You wanted to sell the coins
and give 70 million to your creditor?

1093
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:47,778
Yes, I talked to him the same day
and he agreed.

1094
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:51,282
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1095
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:56,120
But a week before finding it,
you had already offered him 75 million.

1096
01:21:57,872 --> 01:22:01,417
Me? No, I didn't. Who said that?

1097
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:11,218
"Hello, Bahram. I've got 75 million.

1098
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:15,264
"I'll give you checks
for the rest if I get out.

1099
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:16,390
"Rahim."

1100
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,935
I sent it the day I found the bag.

1101
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:21,729
It's dated a week before.

1102
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:25,691
My brother was in jail a week before.
How could he find a bag?

1103
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,401
That's my question.

1104
01:22:27,485 --> 01:22:30,696
One week before
supposedly finding the coins,

1105
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,157
how could you promise him 75 million?

1106
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,910
-I didn't.
-Come on, it's your text.

1107
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:37,870
I got it yesterday.

1108
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:42,208
How can I prove
I returned them to their owner?

1109
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:45,211
-To her?
-Yes.

1110
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,047
-Now you have the coins?
-Yes, I have them.

1111
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,466
Then you go now with the driver,

1112
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:54,053
and bring the bag and the 17 coins.
And you stay here.

1113
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,473
My husband is at home.

1114
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:04,563
I sneaked out for this poor man.
I can't go home and leave again.

1115
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,273
-Call your husband.
-What for?

1116
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:11,529
I'll explain the whole story to him
so he doesn't bother you.

1117
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:12,947
My husband...

1118
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,741
Didn't I tell you?

1119
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:19,954
Didn't I tell you my husband
has no idea about the coins?

1120
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:21,205
I'm sorry.

1121
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:24,417
Excuse me, but you're behaving very badly

1122
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,213
with a prisoner who's gone
to so much trouble to do a good deed.

1123
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:33,175
If it's proven tomorrow this was a fraud,
will you answer for it?

1124
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:34,343
What fraud?

1125
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:36,095
We received a call here...

1126
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:39,598
I know who called you.
My creditor sent you the text.

1127
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,599
It's not him.

1128
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,603
This man is sick. He ruined my life
and my wife left me.

1129
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:47,356
-None of my business.
-What is your business?

1130
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,359
I wish I could confirm that you did that.

1131
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:54,864
At my age, would I give
false evidence to someone I don't know?

1132
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,408
This is our procedure.

1133
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,118
Who's your boss here?

1134
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:04,832
Who are you to get so worked up about him?

1135
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,418
I'm nobody, young man.

1136
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,920
You who are somebody,

1137
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:13,799
why are you accusing
this poor innocent guy?

1138
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:17,595
Get out, sir. Mr. Saghafi! Get them out!

1139
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,390
-Please leave.
-Go away.

1140
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:22,808
Please leave.

1141
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:25,686
I pity this country
for being in the hands of you guys.

1142
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,690
The only thing that matters is my honor.

1143
01:24:29,774 --> 01:24:32,234
I don't want this job or the salary.

1144
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:37,740
I swear I'll spread the word
that you didn't keep your promise.

1145
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,241
I'll denounce you all.

1146
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:41,660
Do whatever you want, but be quiet.

1147
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,293
Come out when you're done.

1148
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,296
You can speak here.

1149
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:42,137
-Why did you do that?
-Do what?

1150
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:46,684
-Forward the text to that guy.
-What guy?

1151
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:49,728
-The council intelligence.
-Intelligence?

1152
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:52,439
What are you talking about?

1153
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:54,859
-Why are you doing this?
-What am I doing?

1154
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:57,903
Why do you threaten to denounce me?

1155
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:59,363
I did nothing wrong.

1156
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:01,866
-Why did you call them?
-I called nobody.

1157
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,910
Look, I've brought you these checks.

1158
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,999
With what you've done,
how can I find a job and pay you back?

1159
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,792
Now they're doubting me.

1160
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,254
They're not.
They've seen your true colors.

1161
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,755
Don't interfere.

1162
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,138
Why was I fooled by you again?

1163
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:37,443
How dare you come here?

1164
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,112
Don't you see how changed he is?

1165
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,157
You've worn him out.

1166
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,868
-What have I done?
-You did everything.

1167
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,495
I was plagued by bad luck, Nazanin.

1168
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,457
I went bankrupt.

1169
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:56,295
After all he did for you, how can you go
and slander him on TV?

1170
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,424
If you had a little pride,
you wouldn't show up here.

1171
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,906
Didn't we agree at the charity?

1172
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,951
That instead of paying me,
you'd insult me?

1173
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:31,789
-Bahram, are you jealous?
-Jealous of what?

1174
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,707
What would I envy you for?

1175
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:36,543
That people have esteem for me.

1176
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:39,171
Poor people who consider you their hero.

1177
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:43,050
Poor you who can't stand
seeing people show me respect.

1178
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:46,428
You think you're somebody
because you were on TV?

1179
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:47,888
Watch your mouth.

1180
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,975
They build you up
to say the country is a paradise.

1181
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,059
Be polite.

1182
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,894
"People show me respect..."

1183
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,188
People show you respect?

1184
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,607
People feel sorry for you.

1185
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,112
They feel sorry
for your poor kid's stutter and for you,

1186
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:06,031
who drags him in front of people
to cry and beg.

1187
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,325
"People show me respect."

1188
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:12,579
"The pen didn't work,
the calculator either..."

1189
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:17,960
Come here a second.

1190
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:21,880
-Leave, please.
-Just a second, Nazanin.

1191
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:26,301
Just a second. I want to see him.

1192
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:30,222
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1193
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,891
Bastard!

1194
01:28:34,143 --> 01:28:35,436
Stop!

1195
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,314
Bastard!

1196
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,484
Stop, Dad!

1197
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,372
Ali! Sattar, come quick!

1198
01:29:00,044 --> 01:29:02,171
Take him away.

1199
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:06,800
Don't let him go away.

1200
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:12,806
Hello, police?

1201
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:16,393
Where are you taking me?

1202
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,982
Why are you doing this?

1203
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,735
Call the police.

1204
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,278
Let me out.

1205
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,302
Get back to your tasks please. It's over.

1206
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,680
Who was that?

1207
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:05,317
Rahim! What happened to you?

1208
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:16,578
Open this door! Why is he locked in?

1209
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:18,622
We're waiting for the police.

1210
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:22,167
-Did he hit you?
-I'm okay.

1211
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,408
Get out!

1212
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,910
Let him out.

1213
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:58,954
Open the door for him.

1214
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:05,502
Madam!

1215
01:31:05,586 --> 01:31:06,837
His shoe...

1216
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,972
Open the door. Open it, please.

1217
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,150
Put on your shoe.

1218
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:46,543
Hello.

1219
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:48,420
-Hello, is your dad home?
-Yes.

1220
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,547
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

1221
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:53,091
-Tell him to come quick.
-Okay.

1222
01:31:58,222 --> 01:31:59,973
Ms. Radmehr...

1223
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,267
I'll call you later.

1224
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:03,602
Ms. Radmehr...

1225
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,772
-Hello.
-Hello.

1226
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,690
Hello.

1227
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,944
Mr. Soltani, what got into you?

1228
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:13,695
What do you mean?

1229
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,490
Sheyda! Bring my phone and show him.

1230
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:25,999
This is what happened today
in my father's shop.

1231
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:29,294
The man you see attacking him

1232
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:33,257
is the one who was presented on TV

1233
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,842
a few days ago and praised

1234
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,972
as a very conscientious
and trustworthy prisoner who returned

1235
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:42,266
a bag full of gold to its owner.

1236
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:46,270
Since the beginning,
my father told jail management

1237
01:32:46,353 --> 01:32:52,109
and the charity who raised funds
for such a man

1238
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,861
that this story was fake.

1239
01:32:55,028 --> 01:33:00,033
But for dubious reasons,
they didn't pay attention to him.

1240
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:03,954
The woman who came to the shop
seems to be his girlfriend.

1241
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:06,290
Did he share that?

1242
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,500
His daughter sent it to Ms. Radmehr

1243
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:12,254
saying she'll share it
if they're not paid by tomorrow.

1244
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,131
He started insulting me.

1245
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:18,260
The video speaks for itself.
You attacked him by surprise.

1246
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:22,514
Now that you're known as a role model
that people follow,

1247
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,975
you can't behave like that.

1248
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:29,354
Every year, we provide dowers
for needy brides.

1249
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:33,567
We pay recompenses
for convicts to avoid the death penalty.

1250
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,611
If this is shared,
nobody will trust us anymore.

1251
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:38,113
Nobody will support us.

1252
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:40,866
-That's not my fault.
-Not your fault?

1253
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:45,037
Your creditor's daughter
also sent the video to the council.

1254
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,497
They called me today and said

1255
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:51,293
the lady in the video,
who's apparently related to you,

1256
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:55,881
went to the council and claimed
she was the one who lost her bag

1257
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:58,467
and got it back from you, is that right?

1258
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,971
I had no choice.

1259
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,766
I couldn't find the owner.

1260
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,147
If the video gets out,

1261
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:15,567
will people's trust in us
ever be restored?

1262
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,278
Who would want to help us?

1263
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:24,576
You've harmed all the people
this charity could help.

1264
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,287
-At least, let me explain.
-Go ahead.

1265
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,331
Let him explain.

1266
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,084
The truth is,

1267
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:35,712
this bag was found by a lady.

1268
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,130
What lady?

1269
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,966
The lady in the video.

1270
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,344
Why did you say you found it?

1271
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:47,015
I told the prison authorities
a lady found it and gave it to me.

1272
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:50,560
They said it didn't matter,
I could say it was me.

1273
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:55,607
-So you didn't find it.
-You played with our reputation.

1274
01:34:56,483 --> 01:35:02,447
We've been struggling for 25 years
to try and help destitute people.

1275
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:04,449
You ruined it all overnight.

1276
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:08,245
I'll ask this lady
to come and explain everything.

1277
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,413
The lady!

1278
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:13,166
Everywhere you said you found it,
you made it all up.

1279
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,627
What is it all about? Tell me the truth.

1280
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,212
I've told the truth.

1281
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,673
-It's the truth.
-Give me a break.

1282
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:25,387
I'll call your creditor.
Apologize so he doesn't share it.

1283
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:28,348
Come on, they're waiting for you.
They want to leave.

1284
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,809
Just let me make a phone call.

1285
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:34,938
If a scandal breaks out and we have to
justify ourselves and apologize,

1286
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,440
it'll be hellish.

1287
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:40,068
They're trying to talk the creditor
out of sharing the video.

1288
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:44,739
We have to make a statement anyway.
They trusted us.

1289
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:47,492
-Let's do it today.
-And say what?

1290
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,455
That we checked afterwards

1291
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:54,833
and realized the story
wasn't crystal clear.

1292
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:58,420
Therefore, the money collected
will stay in the charity.

1293
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,506
Let's use it
for this poor guy's recompense.

1294
01:36:01,882 --> 01:36:04,342
-I agree.
-Excuse me.

1295
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,511
My father...

1296
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,097
didn't...

1297
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:10,974
lie.

1298
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:12,976
Sweetheart...

1299
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:16,897
We're not saying he lied.

1300
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,775
The problem is
we don't understand what he says.

1301
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:26,072
If you transfer the money tonight,

1302
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:30,327
Rahim will give him checks for the rest
and he won't share the video.

1303
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,705
We can't give him the money
after what's happened.

1304
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,915
Why not?

1305
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,583
Morally, every donor

1306
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:40,420
must be informed and decide
if they want their money back

1307
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:42,714
or accept to give it to another person.

1308
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,633
The money was collected for him.

1309
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:48,803
No, it was thanks
to our dependable reputation.

1310
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,514
It's us they trusted.

1311
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,390
I'm not denying it.

1312
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:56,853
Would it be fair to give the money
that was entrusted to us by prisoners,

1313
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:01,358
in spite of their difficulties,
to somebody who's lied to us?

1314
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:02,859
Let me explain to you.

1315
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:05,111
-Explain what?
-What you're saying...

1316
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:09,157
You took a lady to the council
saying you gave her the gold

1317
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:11,618
and now we find out she's your friend.

1318
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,119
What's left to explain?

1319
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:16,206
Listen, in any case,

1320
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:19,501
if the video is shared,
it'd be a disaster for you.

1321
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:20,835
Now we're to blame.

1322
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:23,838
It's not about blaming. I just mean

1323
01:37:24,506 --> 01:37:27,175
it'd harm everyone,
especially the charity.

1324
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:36,101
Mr. Taghian, call and ask him
not to share it until we find a solution.

1325
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:37,227
I'm off.

1326
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,187
His daughter won't let it go.

1327
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:40,939
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1328
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:45,026
I returned the bag. Please, madam!

1329
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,070
You paid us back very badly.

1330
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:48,154
Hello.

1331
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:49,698
Hello, please go in.

1332
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,032
Goodbye.

1333
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:16,516
Dad?

1334
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,021
Yes, son?

1335
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:34,826
Why did...

1336
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:39,706
Ms. Zareh give you...

1337
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:43,460
the coins?

1338
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,171
To get me out of prison.

1339
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:52,093
Are you going to get...

1340
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:54,346
remarried too?

1341
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:04,898
I won't, if you don't want me to.

1342
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:21,915
Siavash, darling.

1343
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,004
Look at me.

1344
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:30,632
Siavash. Come here, son.

1345
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:36,971
Come on.

1346
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,072
I told Mr. Taheri.

1347
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:56,116
You said your wife found it.

1348
01:39:56,199 --> 01:40:00,328
I didn't say my wife.
I said the lady I was going to marry.

1349
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:03,873
And what did I tell you?
To repeat the same thing.

1350
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,751
No, you said it was no use
saying all that.

1351
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:08,169
You're lying to my face?

1352
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:10,505
You told me that in the other room.

1353
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:12,632
Ms. Marvasti was there. I can call her.

1354
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:15,385
Come here. I told you to repeat the same.

1355
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:19,222
You said you couldn't name her
out of discretion.

1356
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:20,432
I wanted...

1357
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,392
Did I ask you to say it was a loan?

1358
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:26,521
The TV people did.
They asked me not to mention usury.

1359
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:30,400
And going in front of the camera
on the sidewalk,

1360
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:34,028
and claiming you found it exactly there
was also their idea?

1361
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:39,117
You told the TV people
to come and film me.

1362
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:44,289
I never thought anyone
should find out about this story.

1363
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:50,211
If you didn't want anyone to know,
you'd have given your sister's number.

1364
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:53,840
Or your own number.
Not the prison's, so that we'd find out.

1365
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:01,431
I swear on my child's life
that I never calculated any of that.

1366
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,059
What do you expect from us now?

1367
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:08,354
Mr. Taheri should come to the charity

1368
01:41:09,773 --> 01:41:15,028
and tell them I'd already said
that someone else gave me the bag.

1369
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,614
-Why not tell them yourself?
-I did.

1370
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:19,699
They don't believe me.

1371
01:41:19,783 --> 01:41:22,452
There's already this rumor

1372
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:25,121
that the prison authorities
made up your story.

1373
01:41:25,205 --> 01:41:28,374
All we need now
is for me to tell the charity

1374
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:30,335
that someone else found it.

1375
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:32,128
When does your leave end?

1376
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,714
It's my last day.

1377
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:36,800
Go give the checks to your creditor.

1378
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:40,637
Ask him to forgive you,
on your knees, if necessary.

1379
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,389
Stay there until he deletes the video.

1380
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:47,477
Tomorrow, come back to prison
and lie low until it's forgotten.

1381
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:49,270
Why should it be forgotten?

1382
01:41:49,938 --> 01:41:51,731
I gave the gold back.

1383
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:55,860
You said you didn't
expect people to find out.

1384
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:58,696
Imagine you did it and no one found out.

1385
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:02,033
That's different.
They're saying I lied. I didn't.

1386
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:03,701
But you didn't tell the truth.

1387
01:42:04,244 --> 01:42:06,996
You're either very smart or very simple.

1388
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,416
If I was smart, why would I be in jail?

1389
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:14,254
Now, go. Go and don't do anything.

1390
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:15,588
No.

1391
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:20,051
I'll convince my creditor
not to share the video.

1392
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:24,347
But first, you go to the charity
and the council and tell them

1393
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,808
I told you I didn't find the bag.

1394
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,102
You're imposing conditions on us?

1395
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:33,022
If he shares it, you'll be in trouble too.

1396
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:38,570
Call the newspaper
and retract the whole story from our side.

1397
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,197
Say he tricked us too.

1398
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:52,458
Call him back.

1399
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:00,967
Come here.

1400
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,267
What's this slamming the door?

1401
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:19,652
Sorry.

1402
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:56,165
-Hello.
-Hello.

1403
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:58,001
-Is Ms. Radmehr here?
-Yes.

1404
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:00,545
Sit down please,
I'll let her know you're here.

1405
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,506
Sit there.

1406
01:45:19,105 --> 01:45:22,525
-Yes?
-Ms. Radmehr, Mr. Soltani's here.

1407
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:27,697
-You can go, I'll let you know.
-Thank you very much.

1408
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:30,199
-Very kind of you.
-My pleasure.

1409
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:31,993
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1410
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,498
Please sit down. I'll call you.

1411
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:38,916
Come in, please.

1412
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,639
-Mom, let's go.
-Wait a minute.

1413
01:45:53,723 --> 01:45:56,726
I did text my creditor a couple of times

1414
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:59,896
from my cellmates' phones,
but he didn't reply.

1415
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,857
The text he forwarded to the council...

1416
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,776
He didn't.

1417
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:07,528
-I only sent it to him.
-Anyway...

1418
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,614
-Then I told him...
-Wait.

1419
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:13,993
One of the inmates did?

1420
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:15,828
What difference does it make?

1421
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:21,584
I didn't agree with giving it back.
He really insisted on doing it.

1422
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:25,421
I'm telling you the whole truth.

1423
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:29,884
I swear it on the life of this man
who's my only joy in life.

1424
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:36,182
You have no way of finding that lady?

1425
01:46:36,265 --> 01:46:42,063
I went to her neighborhood
yesterday with her picture

1426
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:45,483
and showed it to all the shopkeepers.

1427
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:46,984
Nobody knows her.

1428
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:48,736
I don't know what to do.

1429
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:52,073
I have you on one side
and that young lady on the other.

1430
01:46:53,116 --> 01:46:56,577
Ever since she heard your story,
she's come every day.

1431
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:58,496
She's as needy as you are.

1432
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:02,416
If we don't pay the recompense,
her husband will be hanged.

1433
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:08,631
Put yourself in my shoes.
What should I do?

1434
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:19,308
You can organize an evening
and raise funds for her husband.

1435
01:47:19,392 --> 01:47:22,937
We did and raised some money,

1436
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:25,898
but not much,
as there's a murder involved.

1437
01:47:27,275 --> 01:47:31,988
If I give you the money,
and the kid's father gets hanged,

1438
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:37,493
won't I be blamed for helping someone
in such an unclear situation?

1439
01:47:37,577 --> 01:47:40,580
Won't I be held responsible for his death?

1440
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:43,166
You collected this money for him.

1441
01:47:43,249 --> 01:47:48,004
But the donors are calling to say
they don't want you to have the money.

1442
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:50,506
If the video's shared, it'll be worse.

1443
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,012
I don't care about this money.

1444
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:00,933
I care about my honor.

1445
01:48:03,352 --> 01:48:07,315
Agree for us to give her the money
and save her husband.

1446
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:12,820
I'll go to your creditor today,
and beg him not to share the video.

1447
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:13,779
I promise.

1448
01:48:16,782 --> 01:48:18,284
Go in, Ms. Fathi.

1449
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:51,776
-Go to the car, I'll come in a second.
-What?

1450
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:55,738
-I won't be long.
-Where are you going?

1451
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:06,290
Wait here.

1452
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,001
-Raheleh...
-Come on.

1453
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,253
Come on.

1454
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:12,505
You saved my life.

1455
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:14,257
Don't say that.

1456
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,509
My child and I owe you our lives.

1457
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:20,179
-I don't know how to thank you.
-No need. It's my duty.

1458
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:22,473
Come on.

1459
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:26,269
Thank you so much. You did so much for us.

1460
01:49:31,107 --> 01:49:33,526
Call your husband to share the good news.

1461
01:49:45,663 --> 01:49:51,043
If word spreads that you gave his money
to someone else,

1462
01:49:51,127 --> 01:49:53,296
it'll bring more shame on him.

1463
01:49:53,379 --> 01:49:56,507
We can't give him the money in any case.

1464
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,550
Okay, fine.

1465
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:02,138
I just wanted to beg you
to spread the word

1466
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:05,182
that it was his idea

1467
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:08,144
to give the money that was raised for him

1468
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:11,564
to a needy convict
to save him from execution.

1469
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:13,024
Can you do that?

1470
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:18,612
Now that you're giving the money
to someone else,

1471
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:22,491
at least let him take the credit
and not be disgraced further.

1472
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:24,910
Please.

1473
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:28,539
Okay.

1474
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:34,045
I'll ask for the news to be put out
on social media today.

1475
01:50:52,063 --> 01:50:54,482
What's happened? What's wrong?

1476
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,360
The video was shared.

1477
01:50:58,194 --> 01:51:01,572
-No! When?
-Right now.

1478
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:06,535
-Who told you?
-Hossein called.

1479
01:51:15,628 --> 01:51:17,630
What are you going to do now?

1480
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:41,821
-Hi, Auntie.
-Hi, darling.

1481
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:46,575
Hello.

1482
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:48,411
-Hello.
-Hello.

1483
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,061
What got into him?

1484
01:52:14,854 --> 01:52:16,021
-Who?
-Rahim.

1485
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:17,773
Haven't you seen the video?

1486
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:22,236
-Stop seeing this guy immediately.
-What guy?

1487
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:25,489
The charlatan with whom
you started this swindle!

1488
01:52:25,573 --> 01:52:27,575
Why are you shouting?

1489
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,535
Because it falls on deaf ears!

1490
01:52:29,618 --> 01:52:31,162
Providing me with a roof

1491
01:52:31,245 --> 01:52:33,998
doesn't allow you
to speak to me however you like.

1492
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:38,377
Didn't I ask you to leave this jerk?
Did it have to end like this?

1493
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:41,005
-Like what?
-"Like what"?

1494
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:45,050
Aren't you two ashamed?
How can one be such a rogue?

1495
01:52:48,846 --> 01:52:54,018
Who's this scumbag you disgrace
yourself and your family for?

1496
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,479
This scumbag means everything to me.

1497
01:52:57,605 --> 01:52:59,273
I'd die for him.

1498
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:03,944
Don't you talk to me like that again!

1499
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:21,378
In the Name of God. Hello, dear listeners!

1500
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:36,435
Hello, Rahim.

1501
01:53:38,896 --> 01:53:40,397
Can you get in the car?

1502
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:45,778
How are you?

1503
01:53:49,114 --> 01:53:50,783
Salehpour is very angry with you.

1504
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:53,994
When he heard the news, he calmed down.

1505
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,330
What news?

1506
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,791
That you offered the money to a convict.

1507
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:02,002
-Who said that?
-The charity announced it.

1508
01:54:02,461 --> 01:54:04,421
That's a nice gesture, well done.

1509
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,969
-I have a favor to ask you.
-What?

1510
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:13,889
Let me make a video of you
and share it today.

1511
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,561
-Saying what?
-What you did.

1512
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,939
That you decided to hand the money over.

1513
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,650
No, I didn't.

1514
01:54:25,568 --> 01:54:28,904
Between the video that was shared
and the rumors,

1515
01:54:28,988 --> 01:54:31,782
we have to find a way
to avoid this disgrace.

1516
01:54:32,533 --> 01:54:33,659
What way?

1517
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,829
Can I pop inside?

1518
01:54:45,296 --> 01:54:46,505
A few...

1519
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:48,674
A few coins...

1520
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:54,013
Coins were found...

1521
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:58,309
The own... No.

1522
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:02,271
That was found...

1523
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,983
Gave back to the owner.

1524
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,986
"He gave them to the owner.

1525
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:14,450
"But he couldn't find her again
and they didn't believe him.

1526
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:17,620
"They said my father was lying."

1527
01:55:17,703 --> 01:55:20,706
Okay? Can you try again?

1528
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:23,000
Go ahead.

1529
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,961
Hello...

1530
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,714
I'm...

1531
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:31,383
Soltani.

1532
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:39,600
The son...

1533
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:44,813
of Rahim...

1534
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:49,360
Sol...

1535
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:54,281
...tani...

1536
01:55:54,365 --> 01:55:57,076
It didn't work, son. Once more.

1537
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,036
It was fine.

1538
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:03,916
No. Have some tea
and we'll rehearse a bit.

1539
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:06,001
Not at all. It's better like this.

1540
01:56:06,085 --> 01:56:08,420
When he's stressed, he can't speak.

1541
01:56:08,504 --> 01:56:11,632
-Come on, son.
-No, sit down.

1542
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:16,428
The way he's speaking is more convincing.

1543
01:56:16,804 --> 01:56:18,514
Speak the same way.

1544
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:22,309
Go ahead.

1545
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:26,855
-Hello...
-Wait.

1546
01:56:27,648 --> 01:56:29,733
If you see your dad going to jail,

1547
01:56:29,817 --> 01:56:32,027
you should look sadder. Don't you think?

1548
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:34,571
Don't you love your dad?

1549
01:56:35,489 --> 01:56:37,491
So, why aren't you sad?

1550
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:40,452
You look like you're happy to let him go.

1551
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:43,122
Start again.

1552
01:56:43,747 --> 01:56:45,916
Hello. I'm...

1553
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:51,547
Siavash Soltan...

1554
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:53,841
Tani...

1555
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:57,511
The son...

1556
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,598
Of...

1557
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:12,234
What's up?

1558
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:16,989
I don't want this to be shared.

1559
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:21,827
Believe me, when he was speaking,
I nearly cried.

1560
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:24,163
Whoever sees it will be overwhelmed.

1561
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:28,333
I don't want my son to be seen like that.

1562
01:57:28,417 --> 01:57:33,630
It's to your advantage and his.
People will be on your side.

1563
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:36,550
Even that woman may see it and call you.

1564
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:39,720
-No, delete it.
-Think for a bit.

1565
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:43,223
-The kid said nothing bad.
-I don't want...

1566
01:57:43,307 --> 01:57:45,976
You think it's only about what you want?

1567
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,937
All our reputation is at stake.

1568
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:51,732
You want it back through my son's stutter?

1569
01:58:01,742 --> 01:58:03,911
Please stay with us, Mr. Taheri.

1570
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:06,079
It's very kind of you.

1571
01:58:08,749 --> 01:58:09,917
Rahim!

1572
