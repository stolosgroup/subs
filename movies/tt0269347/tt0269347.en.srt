00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:21,890

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,881
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

4
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:38,397
Abe says, "Man,
you must be putting me on."

5
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:39,898
God say, "No."

6
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,400
Abe say, "What?"

7
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,768
God say, "You can do
what you want, Abe,

8
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,937
but the next time you see me
coming, you better run."

9
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:55,178
Abe says, "Where do you want
this killing done?"

10
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:59,211
and God says,
"Out on Highway 61."

11
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:35,355
The Serbs have taken over
this... Albanian village.

12
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:37,366
They're killing everyone
in sight.

13
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:40,336
It's not a war,
it's a slaughter.

14
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:42,395
The Serbian commander is
in that mosque.

15
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:46,843
This is the third village
in a week he's destroyed.

16
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:49,642
We are to identify
and neutralize him.

17
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:51,182
We will proceed under cover

18
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,708
of NATO air strike,
commencing...

19
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:59,185
right... about... now!

20
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,282
Move!

21
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,627
I'm in the nest.

22
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:54,686
Copy that.

23
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,960
Raven is in the nest.

24
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:01,999
Cover fire, on my mark.

25
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,065
Three...

26
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:05,610
Two...

27
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,236
One!

28
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,754
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.

29
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,956
Yes, sir.

30
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,695
It is my privilege to present
to you the Silver Star,

31
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,295
one of our nation's
highest awards for valor.

32
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,341
Your bravery, sound judgment,

33
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,138
and outstanding resolve
are an example to all soldiers.

34
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,442
Your courageous actions
are the bedrock

35
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:01,142
upon which peace
and democracy

36
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,774
have always been built.

37
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,487
Congratulations, Hallam.

38
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:26,584
Hey.

39
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:28,679
What happened to you?

40
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:37,027
You stepped on a snare,
didn't you?

41
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,759
Easy.

42
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,664
Take it easy.

43
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,433
Be still.

44
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,063
Be still.

45
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,607
All right,
let me have that.

46
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,874
Nasty thing.

47
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,279
All right.

48
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,978
Next time you see one of these,

49
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,646
you go the other way.

50
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:34,221
Okay...

51
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,596
Here we go.

52
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,996
You're good, you're good.

53
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,232
All right...

54
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:41,796
Okay.

55
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:44,542
Now get out of here.

56
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,391
Anybody here
With the initials J.W.?

57
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,129
Yeah.

58
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,227
This yours?

59
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,293
Yeah, it is.

60
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:10,873
What the...?!

61
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,739
No more snares
on wolves, guys.

62
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:55,322
I got him.

63
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,074
He was down there.

64
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,074
What?

65
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,077
I saw him.

66
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:01,265
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?

67
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:08,309
That's how we make sure
they're dead.

68
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,314
You guys don't look
like deer hunters.

69
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:19,157
When you kill with
your own hands,

70
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,817
there is a reverence.

71
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:25,764
Is that right?

72
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,268
There is no reverence
in what you do.

73
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:33,406
Where's your weapon?

74
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,678
Holy sh...

75
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,691
You're not here for
the deer, are you?

76
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,525
What's that?

77
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:25,092
You think you can hunt
me with those rifles?

78
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,934
Your rifles
against my knife.

79
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:31,237
What, are you nuts?

80
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,210
What do you think?

81
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,747
Yeah, well,
don't push it, asshole.

82
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,986
Where the fuck are you?

83
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,957
Come on, baby.

84
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,824
Oh, God!

85
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,574
You want a little
antifreeze with that?

86
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,514
It's not that cold out.

87
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,108
Maybe not to you.

88
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:34,082
Thought you were on the wagon.

89
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,886
Wheels fell off.

90
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,761
You running a fever?

91
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,697
No. I'm tired
of the goddamn cold.

92
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,598
Not too crazy
about the thaw, neither.

93
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,297
Well, get a
hot water bottle.

94
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,270
Keep you company at night.

95
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,637
I don't want
a hot water bottle.

96
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,734
I want to go down to California
for a few weeks,

97
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:53,403
catch some thoroughbreds
at Del Mar,

98
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,742
do a little fishing.

99
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:55,940
They say the yellowtail jump

100
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:57,575
right into the boat
this time of year.

101
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,314
Sam, the yellowtail's not
running this time of year.

102
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:02,982
Hello, Ted.

103
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,618
L.T.

104
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,888
How'd you know it was me?

105
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,760
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.

106
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,391
What are you doing
this far north?

107
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:15,529
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something...

108
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,403
personally.

109
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:23,441
It's been a few years.

110
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:25,278
Okachobi, 1996.

111
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,649
Yeah, your agents got so scared
of alligators down there.

112
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,278
Remember that one guy
shit in his pants?

113
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,289
Mike Haney.
Yeah, that was funny.

114
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:32,881
You sort of disappeared
after that.

115
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,688
Yeah, I worked a few more,
and then I quit.

116
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,490
Been in Portland
for three years now.

117
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,589
We've reached out
for you a few times.

118
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:41,830
L.T., let me
ask you something.

119
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:43,064
Yeah.

120
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,504
What the hell are
you doing out here?

121
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,508
Working for
the wildlife Fund.

122
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,143
You went to a lot of trouble
to get yourself up here.

123
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,743
You know, you're
a hard man to find.

124
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,015
No, I'm not.

125
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,718
How hard am I to find
if you found me?

126
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,589
Van Zandt
thinks it's important.

127
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,424
He thinks
everything's important.

128
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,727
This one's different.

129
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:11,969
I don't do that kind
of work anymore.

130
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,008
Why don't you
have a look?

131
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,339
I really don't want
to go back there.

132
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:21,472
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, L.T.

133
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:22,116
Hey, Tom, can we get
prints off that paper?

134
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:23,212
Yeah, we sure can.

135
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,586
Please do, and
the door handles.

136
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,352
Harry, I understand that,
but I'm concerned

137
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,893
about the number
of SWAT agents.

138
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,792
I want to take
these guys alive.

139
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,558
Reed, we need to deploy
some of your men

140
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,996
on the other side
of the canyon.

141
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,625
I want to contain this area

142
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:36,033
and establish a perimeter.

143
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:38,401
That's your call, Abby.
We're here to help.

144
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,232
Bonham, are you all right?

145
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,400
No!

146
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:12,468
I hate those things.
I'm afraid of heights.

147
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,572
I'm Abby Durrell.
I'm the ASAC here.

148
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:17,618
I'm not sure how much
Harry told you, but...

149
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,915
Tell me what he told you
to tell me.

150
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,820
We'll take it
from there, okay?

151
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:23,825
Okay.

152
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:28,360
The two men were found
half a mile from here.

153
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:29,829
They were killed
with a hatchet,

154
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,802
then gutted in what looks like
a ritualistic fashion.

155
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,168
Every vital organ was cut.

156
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,707
I got a deputy talking
to the local Paiute chief.

157
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:41,371
There's no Paiute ritual
for gutting a human body.

158
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:43,378
The dead men were both
dressed and quartered

159
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,076
the way you'd quarter a deer.

160
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:46,516
Paiute are upset about...

161
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,053
Paiute wouldn't dress
and quarter

162
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:49,680
a couple of deer hunters
unless...

163
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:50,917
What?

164
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:52,788
He was going to eat 'em.

165
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:57,828
There were two men
killed the same way

166
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,958
last week in Washington State.

167
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,560
They were Forest
Service Rangers,

168
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:04,401
Which was how
we got jurisdiction.

169
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:05,735
Where are the bodies?

170
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:08,039
We sent them to the lab
yesterday.

171
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,204
You need to see them?

172
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,269
No.

173
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,465
You've got too many men
and horses in here.

174
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:31,369
All these tracks,
this is, uh... chaos.

175
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:35,034
Do they have a deer stand
or any coolers for packing meat?

176
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,372
Not within a five-mile radius.

177
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:37,377
Nothing.

178
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:38,378
You have a campsite?

179
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:39,914
Still looking.

180
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:44,385
What do you know
about the victims?

181
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:48,391
As far as we know, just a couple
of businessmen from Medford.

182
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,601
What else can we do for you?

183
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,264
Nothing.

184
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,830
Ask everybody to fall back.

185
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,707
Bobby, let's get everybody
out of here.

186
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,270
You guys, everybody, let's go,
let's fall back. Come on.

187
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,316
Let's go!

188
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,186
Yeah, everyone!

189
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:37,387
This is him.

190
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:38,388
Who?

191
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:39,583
The guy that did it.

192
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,149
At this point, we're not sure

193
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:42,718
how many killers there were.

194
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:43,728
Just one.

195
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:44,729
How do you know that?

196
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:45,730
He left a signature

197
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,788
right there in that tree.

198
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:49,302
Mr. Bonham, the deceased
were two able-bodied men.

199
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,302
-Mm-hmm.
-They had rifles

200
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,565
With sophisticated
scopes on them.

201
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,163
One of them had
a nine millimeter handgun

202
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,173
stuck inside his jacket.

203
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:55,175
Yeah.

204
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:56,506
Now, it seems
unlikely that one man

205
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:57,773
With a hatchet could possibly...

206
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:58,779
He didn't use a hatchet.

207
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,817
He used a knife
With a serrated edge on one side

208
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,146
and a filet blade on the other.

209
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,686
You're saying
that one guy with a knife

210
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:05,984
threw it at this tree and then
killed those two hunters?

211
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,787
Yeah. He wore a size ten shoe
with no tread,

212
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,327
almost like a slipper--

213
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:11,691
kind of like this one.

214
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:16,359
He's out there.

215
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,370
Oh, you're not going
out there alone.

216
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:19,370
That's the way I work.

217
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,497
Take this.

218
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:21,699
I don't need that.

219
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:22,706
Humor me.

220
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,141
The battery's fully charged,

221
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,042
so please make sure
you leave it on.

222
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,239
Okay.

223
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,372
You don't have a gun?

224
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,815
I don't like guns.

225
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,477
Well, how much time
do we give you?

226
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:32,884
If I'm not back in two days,

227
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,615
it'll mean I'm dead.

228
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:32,092
L.T.

229
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:37,258
Remember me?

230
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,494
No.

231
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,838
You taught me.

232
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,896
I taught a lot of people.

233
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:53,917
How come you didn't
answer my letters?

234
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:02,762
How come you're chopping up
all these people?

235
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,922
Did you see

236
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:06,091
the scopes they were using?

237
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,227
They weren't hunters, L.T.

238
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:10,100
They were sweepers.

239
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:12,072
You're going to have
to come in, son.

240
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:24,790
Move up.

241
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:32,471
-He's down.
-Down. He's down!

242
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:34,096
Stay back.
Don't touch him.

243
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:35,539
I found a weapon.

244
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:37,868
We see you!

245
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:39,173
D2, move in.

246
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:41,579
Call it in!

247
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,378
Move in!

248
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:45,113
30 yards on your right!

249
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:47,280
Bring him in.

250
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:48,948
Clear it out!

251
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:37,609
L.T.

252
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,808
Harry.

253
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,145
You did a hell of a job.

254
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:41,275
Thanks.

255
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,820
He's one of yours, isn't he?

256
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,617
-Yeah.
-That's what I thought.

257
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,884
-He's our man?
-Yeah.

258
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,946
Any idea why?

259
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,957
No.

260
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,221
That'd be your job.

261
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,126
Would you like some coffee?

262
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,635
No, thank you, ma'am.

263
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,638
You don't have to talk to us

264
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,174
if you don't want to.

265
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,505
I understand that.

266
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,374
How about telling us your name?

267
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:08,042
We could start with that.

268
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:10,642
He knows my name.

269
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,847
Why don't you tell me

270
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,446
What happened in the woods?

271
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:14,649
Did you know

272
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,386
six billion chickens will die

273
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,122
in slaughterhouses this year?

274
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:19,720
What does that have to do

275
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,628
with what happened
in Silver Falls?

276
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,136
What if there was a species
above us in the food chain?

277
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:26,865
How do you think you'd feel

278
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,932
if that species
lost total respect for us

279
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:32,944
and started
slaughtering us, Wholesale?

280
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:39,011
I don't know...
but it's very interesting.

281
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:42,289
Do you understand it?

282
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:44,291
Oh, yeah.

283
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,383
Good.

284
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,328
What is it you want
to tell Mr. Bonham

285
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,265
you don't want to tell me?

286
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,701
I'd like to talk to him
about Operation Black Eagle

287
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:54,829
and Mongoose, Cobra...

288
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:56,600
Shut up! You want to get
yourself killed?

289
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:57,697
His name is Aaron Hallam.

290
00:34:57,775 --> 00:34:59,175
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.

291
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:00,836
You do remember me, sir.

292
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:02,106
You're talking about shit
that never happened.

293
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,112
They're recording this, bud.

294
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,206
Good. Then there'll be a record.

295
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:05,215
And that record will never say

296
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:06,273
What you want it to say,
Will it?

297
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:09,082
Then what am I doing here,
people?

298
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,919
Mort, you have got
to help me out here.

299
00:35:10,991 --> 00:35:12,083
Is this our guy or not?

300
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,292
I know there
are variables, Mort.

301
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,697
There are always variables,
but we can't indict a variable.

302
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:20,927
Hey, boss.

303
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:28,210
Sir, we understand you have
a man named Aaron Hallam

304
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:30,212
in your custody.

305
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,271
How much do you know
about Mr. Hallam?

306
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,819
Born in 1968.

307
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,822
raised in Barrow County,
West Virginia.

308
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,324
High school equivalency,

309
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:45,023
although he scored
off the charts in science.

310
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:48,328
Joined the Army at 18.

311
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:50,836
That's the strange part.

312
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:52,496
What's that, sir?

313
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:55,508
Well, it doesn't really
tell us any more about him.

314
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,512
The record's incomplete.

315
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,174
Not even a date of discharge.

316
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:03,718
Sergeant Hallam
is unofficially listed

317
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,515
as missing in action, sir.

318
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:08,183
Unofficially?

319
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:10,658
That's a cover.

320
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:13,161
That means he's
still doing work for you.

321
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,995
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.

322
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:20,129
This is not a military base.

323
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:23,197
Your man very likely
killed and mutilated

324
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:25,506
four hunters on federal land.

325
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:31,985
I think you should take
a look at this... sir.

326
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,956
Unless we've been invaded
by a foreign power

327
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:39,960
and are officially at war,

328
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,826
you don't have
any authority here.

329
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,777
Look, I know you want
to get out of here,

330
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,611
but we're waiting
on the blood results,

331
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,843
and I need your statement.

332
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,079
You ever used that thing?

333
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:02,848
Do you mean
did I ever shoot anyone?

334
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:03,854
Yeah.

335
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:05,515
Would you ask a guy
the same question?

336
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,854
Yeah.

337
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,862
Well, as a matter
of fact, I have.

338
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,124
Do we have to go into it?

339
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:12,130
No.

340
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,496
Okay.

341
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,909
Not a great view of the city.

342
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:32,821
It's a wilderness.

343
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,959
What's your
relationship to Hallam?

344
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:39,292
I trained him.

345
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:40,490
To do what?

346
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,693
Trained him to survive...

347
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:45,794
I trained him to kill.

348
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:47,339
I trained a lot
of people like him--

349
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,375
you know, the best
of the best, shit like that.

350
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:53,039
I pulled your file.

351
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:54,513
You were never in the military.

352
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,742
No.

353
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:59,185
You just worked for them.

354
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:01,848
Yeah.

355
00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:03,186
Like a contractor.

356
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:05,193
Yeah.

357
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:08,196
You don't like to
talk about it, do you?

358
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,526
No.

359
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:17,808
My father was a...
Army colonel.

360
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:19,741
When my older brother
was killed in Vietnam,

361
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:21,745
he decided he wasn't
going to lose another son

362
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:22,803
to that particular war.

363
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,144
End of story.

364
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:27,186
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the Army,

365
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,518
and I learned
what I do from him.

366
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,487
What about Hallam?

367
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,689
He's unusual.

368
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:40,202
He can kill anybody...
Without regret.

369
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,832
Most of the people he killed

370
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,534
never knew he was
in the same room with them.

371
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,169
How do you feel about that?

372
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,178
Well, I don't know.

373
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,840
I never had
to kill anybody myself. I...

374
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,219
I just taught people how.

375
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,388
In many ways,
Hallam is a fine warrior.

376
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,052
After a tour in Kosovo,
he was given another

377
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:34,588
sensitive assignment...
off the books.

378
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,503
He went too far.

379
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:43,506
A lot of innocent people
lost their lives.

380
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:46,205
Hallam's battle stress

381
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:50,512
has become so deep,
it is a part of his personality,

382
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:53,212
and it's impossible to reverse.

383
00:39:53,287 --> 00:39:54,914
He's a killing machine.

384
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:57,720
There is no way
he can be indicted

385
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,785
or tried in open court,
or any court.

386
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:03,492
He cannot be processed,
interviewed,

387
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:07,196
charged with a crime,
or copped out as a psycho.

388
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,739
His picture cannot appear
in any newspaper.

389
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,800
As far as the world
is concerned, sir,

390
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,244
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.

391
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:52,185
He's one of them.

392
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,524
They'll handle it.

393
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:53,184
You know why you're here, Aaron.

394
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:57,096
You wandered off the range.

395
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,999
It was way too messy, man.

396
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:04,597
You're supposed to be precise.

397
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:06,801
They weren't his family.

398
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,038
They were soldiers, Dale.

399
00:42:09,113 --> 00:42:11,947
There was no backup,
no way for me to get out.

400
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,279
I was set up.

401
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,978
That's bullshit.

402
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:17,113
You fucked up.

403
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,453
Your actions resulted
in the injury and death

404
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:20,549
of unarmed civilians.

405
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,526
They had weapons.

406
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:27,499
Well, you know,
that's the problem...

407
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:30,594
you can't tell the sharks
from the guppies anymore.

408
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:52,256
That's what they're using now?

409
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:54,265
It's supposed to be painless.

410
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,529
Of course, he'd never
use it on himself...

411
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:00,562
Release him, Aaron!
Release him now!

412
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:12,548
You flying to Vancouver?

413
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:13,848
Yeah.

414
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:15,015
Then a connecting flight?

415
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:17,525
No. I drive.
It takes about eight hours.

416
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,085
That's right-- you don't like
flying much.

417
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:21,562
Must be worth it.

418
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:22,892
It's a very special place.

419
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:24,365
You ought to come up sometime.

420
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,459
I think you'd like it.

421
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,130
You wouldn't have to wear
two guns all the time.

422
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,572
I mean, your whole posture
would... change.

423
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,668
It's an open invitation.

424
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:30,869
Is it painless, Dale?

425
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:34,412
We need paramedics here!

426
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:36,145
It's going to explode!

427
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:38,084
See if you can help him.

428
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:39,018
No, I can't!

429
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:40,853
Somebody help that guy.

430
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,416
Does anyone know
what's going on?

431
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:46,588
Is anyone on the way?

432
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:47,597
Paramedic.

433
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:48,790
Are you all right?

434
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:49,993
Paramedic.

435
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:51,035
Okay, call 911.

436
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm okay, I'm okay.

437
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:54,099
My buddies are in there.

438
00:44:54,173 --> 00:44:57,074
Get 'em out, get 'em out!

439
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,513
I'm okay. I'm okay.

440
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:05,618
Okay?

441
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:08,485
They're coming.

442
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:11,025
Horrible, yeah.

443
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:15,695
Get 'em out!

444
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,426
Hello?

445
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,729
Oh, shit!

446
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:20,736
I can't hear you--
you're breaking up.

447
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:33,814
Please do not leave
your bags unattended.

448
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:37,015
All unattended bags
will be confiscated.

449
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,455
All right, now,
you go over there

450
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:40,221
-Okay, yeah.
-and I'll go over there, okay?

451
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:41,226
All right.

452
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:42,694
-Aah!
-Come on, come on, come on.

453
00:45:42,763 --> 00:45:43,695
One, two, three,

454
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:47,166
four, five, six,

455
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:51,002
seven, eight, nine, ten.

456
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:54,338
Ready or not, here I come.

457
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:56,378
...31 points.

458
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:58,346
It was only the fourth loss
in the last...

459
00:45:58,415 --> 00:46:01,475
May I have your attention
please.

460
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:05,421
This is the last call
for flight 233...

461
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,117
In other action,

462
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:08,319
The 76ers 89 to 82.

463
00:46:08,394 --> 00:46:11,420
Jerry Stackhouse scored
29 points for the Pistons...

464
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:12,555
Hey.

465
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:14,532
...capitalizing on 14
second half turnovers

466
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:15,829
by the 76ers.

467
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:18,837
Alan Iverson who's been
hampered by injuries...

468
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,803
...all season long,
remains on the bench,

469
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:24,003
and it's still not known
when he will return

470
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,306
to the starting lineup.

471
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:28,440
Raptors' star Vince Carter
has also been nagged by injuries

472
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:29,506
all season long,

473
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:31,611
and can do very little
to help his teammates...

474
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:35,988
...seems bound and determined...

475
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,925
We have a breaking story.

476
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,860
We're going to our
correspondent, Jeff Gianola,

477
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,697
Who is live outside
the tunnel to Forest Park.

478
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:44,860
Jeff?

479
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,029
Ken, we have just arrived
on the scene

480
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,936
of a terrible accident outside
the tunnel

481
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,134
in Forest Park.

482
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,336
This is some type of truck,
some type of van

483
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:53,844
that was transporting people.

484
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:55,347
We can tell you there are...

485
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:01,517
Arm... drop...

486
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,113
...recover.

487
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:07,286
Arm... drop... recover.

488
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:09,593
I will teach you
how to kill...

489
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,099
quickly, accurately,
efficiently.

490
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:16,529
It will become a reflex action.

491
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:19,201
You will learn how to enter
a combat zone

492
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,938
and evaporate into shadow.

493
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:24,972
You will learn how to survive...
or you will not.

494
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,416
Ready?

495
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:31,821
Arm... heart...
Ieg, leg... Iung.

496
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,017
Reverse your grip.

497
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:35,083
Bring your knife on the inside
of his arm here,

498
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:36,527
sever all the connective tissue,

499
00:47:36,597 --> 00:47:38,360
pulling his finger
away from the trigger,

500
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:40,764
and at the same time, coming
around his left shoulder,

501
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:41,961
grab the strap, choke him.

502
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:42,969
Now come into his heart

503
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:44,300
through the top of his sternum

504
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:45,566
and bring him to the ground.

505
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,572
Very good.

506
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:47,574
Go.

507
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:50,976
Arm, throat, heart,
leg, leg, arm, lung.

508
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:51,979
Good. Good.

509
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:53,414
Into the thigh here,

510
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:55,610
slice through that thigh
and the femoral artery,

511
00:47:55,752 --> 00:47:57,811
into this thigh
and that femoral artery.

512
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:00,289
You will notice that
this arm is in your way.

513
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:01,290
It cannot hurt you.

514
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,520
The only thing this arm
can do to hurt you

515
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:05,927
is block the lung puncture
you're about to do.

516
00:48:05,998 --> 00:48:08,057
Push this arm over
in front of his face,

517
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,361
go into his lung.

518
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:13,167
Now, arm, neck, heart,
leg, leg, lung.

519
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,434
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

520
00:48:15,508 --> 00:48:18,342
One... two... three...

521
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:22,577
power assist four...
five... six.

522
00:48:22,684 --> 00:48:24,549
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

523
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,519
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

524
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:28,557
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

525
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:30,592
Make this cut
a good power assist.

526
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,525
You're looking
for his backbone.

527
00:48:32,595 --> 00:48:34,029
Here we go.

528
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:37,934
Go.

529
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:40,002
There we go.

530
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:41,436
Once again.

531
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:48,340
"L.T....

532
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:52,848
"I don't think
I can do this anymore.

533
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:55,183
"The nightmares
are getting worse.

534
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,551
"I think I'm losing it, L.T.

535
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:03,564
"I need to talk to you.

536
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:14,902
"I don't know

537
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:18,278
"if you've been getting
my letters, L.T.

538
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:22,844
"I need to hear from you
or talk to you.

539
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:25,890
"You've been like a father
to me.

540
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:27,755
Please write."

541
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:34,132
Once you are able
to kill mentally,

542
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,863
the physical part will be easy.

543
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:40,430
The difficult part...

544
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:42,908
is learning how
to turn it off.

545
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:50,080
At this point,
all we know for sure

546
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,314
is that we have three
confirmed fatalities.

547
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,153
We don't know whether or not
there were any other passengers

548
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,625
inside this van
when it crashed.

549
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,217
Access is very limited.

550
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:02,233
We have no new information from
either the police or the FBl.

551
00:50:02,301 --> 00:50:05,793
However, the van appears to be
a military-type vehicle,

552
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:08,898
possibly the type of vehicle
used to transport prisoners.

553
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:11,239
We'll try to get some
confirmation on that.

554
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,280
Once again,
information very sketchy.

555
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:15,110
Rescue crew's still
on the scene,

556
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,241
along with FBl agents
and technicians.

557
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:21,278
We're getting no comment from
the FBl agents on the scene.

558
00:50:21,356 --> 00:50:22,880
What happened?

559
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,289
Hallam's loose.

560
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:43,510
Hello, Irene.

561
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,447
Oh, Aaron.

562
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:47,247
You scared me.

563
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:48,878
It's good to see you.

564
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:50,980
I'm not listening
to you no more, Aaron.

565
00:50:51,057 --> 00:50:52,684
Everything you
told me was a lie.

566
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,522
I've never lied to you, Irene.

567
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:57,155
Where have you been
the last six months?

568
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:58,528
Doing stuff for the government.

569
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,693
That's a lie, Aaron,
that's a damn lie.

570
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:01,996
Get out of here.

571
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,799
I don't want to see you again.

572
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:06,865
Aaron?

573
00:51:06,943 --> 00:51:08,706
Aaron, you're back!

574
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,006
Hey, Loretta.

575
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,013
Hey.

576
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:13,208
It's so good
to see you.

577
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,751
I missed you so much.

578
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,046
How's my big girl?

579
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,554
Where have you been?

580
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,655
Loretta, I need you
to start your homework.

581
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:25,196
Can I visit
with Aaron some more?

582
00:51:25,264 --> 00:51:26,993
You can visit with him later.

583
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,260
Are you staying
for dinner, Aaron?

584
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:29,996
Go do your homework.

585
00:51:34,976 --> 00:51:36,910
Don't think
you're just going to step

586
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:38,673
right back
into our lives, Aaron.

587
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,769
I understand, Irene.

588
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,282
I don't even know
what you do for a living.

589
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:47,515
Did you look in my locker?

590
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:49,081
How could I do that?

591
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:51,753
You have
four locks on the thing.

592
00:52:01,473 --> 00:52:04,068
What track is that?

593
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:08,080
A squirrel.

594
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:09,079
That's right.

595
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:11,276
Where's the nex one?

596
00:52:11,352 --> 00:52:12,319
Um...

597
00:52:12,386 --> 00:52:14,047
Bring it down.
Where's the nex one?

598
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:15,851
I can't tell.

599
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,983
Hold it flat.

600
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:23,054
See? Every nine inches.

601
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:24,963
That's the gallop pattern.

602
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:26,661
Every nine inches.

603
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:28,967
Oh, yeah, I see.

604
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:29,971
What's this one?

605
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,268
That's a raccoon.

606
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,333
How come you never see any?

607
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,345
Well, they hide
to survive.

608
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:39,248
Men don't respect
animals anymore.

609
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:42,287
They run them down
or kill them

610
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:43,821
any chance they get.

611
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,290
I think that's sad.

612
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:50,291
That's only Kitty.

613
00:52:50,363 --> 00:52:52,594
Here, Kitty.

614
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,931
No, you don't want
to bother him now.

615
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:56,334
Why?

616
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:57,702
He's hunting, too.

617
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:59,934
Does he know we're here?

618
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,703
Oh, he knows.

619
00:53:01,843 --> 00:53:03,334
How?

620
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:08,681
He can sense it.

621
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:17,726
She's so happy to see you.

622
00:53:19,064 --> 00:53:21,226
Sit down.

623
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,805
What's this?

624
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:39,621
You got to leave here.

625
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:41,087
You got to get out of Portland.

626
00:53:41,156 --> 00:53:42,350
What are you
talking about?

627
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:44,222
You're in danger, Irene.

628
00:53:44,294 --> 00:53:45,625
Why am I in danger?

629
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:47,060
You and Loretta.

630
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,328
And they'll come here
and burn this house down.

631
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:53,063
What are you talking about,
Aaron?

632
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,333
House of Leader--
We got visual.

633
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,006
Copy that.
Stand by for intercept.

634
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:13,550
All right, sweetie, you
wait for me after school.

635
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,425
I'm going to be there
to pick you up, okay?

636
00:54:15,497 --> 00:54:17,021
All right.
Is everything okay, Mommy?

637
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:18,396
Everything's fine,
honey.

638
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,456
I love you.

639
00:54:19,535 --> 00:54:20,467
I love you, too.

640
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:22,003
See you later, alligator.

641
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:24,597
Bye.

642
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:27,142
The Leader's approaching
intercept, 6:.00.

643
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,771
Roger that. We got her.

644
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:34,282
Irene Kravitz?
Agent Durrell.

645
00:54:34,352 --> 00:54:35,615
Is that your little girl?

646
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:36,915
Loretta, is it?

647
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:38,889
That's right.

648
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:40,686
We'd like to talk to you.

649
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:41,692
About what?

650
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:43,386
Oh, it's just routine, really,

651
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:45,897
but it'd be a lot easier
if we talked inside.

652
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:49,129
Uh, if you make us come
back with a warrant,

653
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,297
it won't be routine anymore.

654
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:55,237
Going somewhere, Mrs. Kravitz?

655
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,214
No, I'm just cleaning stuff up,
trying to get organized.

656
00:55:00,283 --> 00:55:02,046
We're looking for a man
named Aaron Hallam.

657
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:03,449
Have you seen him?

658
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:05,317
Not for a few months.

659
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,380
But you know him.

660
00:55:07,457 --> 00:55:09,448
This have to do with
his government work?

661
00:55:09,526 --> 00:55:11,688
When's the last
time you saw him?

662
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:13,355
I don't remember.
A few months ago.

663
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:16,765
He... sort of took off.

664
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,359
That's the way he is.

665
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:20,632
Is he here, Irene?

666
00:55:20,706 --> 00:55:22,038
What's this about?

667
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:23,507
What's Aaron done?

668
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:26,545
Please have a seat, Irene.

669
00:55:32,386 --> 00:55:34,252
Nobody said he's done anything.

670
00:55:34,323 --> 00:55:37,417
FBl wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done something.

671
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:39,825
When did you
and Aaron meet?

672
00:55:39,896 --> 00:55:41,557
Eight months ago, maybe.

673
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:43,792
Stayed here a while,
then he just took off.

674
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:46,597
He tell you where
he was going?

675
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,638
Mrs. Kravitz, is he still here?

676
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:50,571
I said I ain't seen him
in months.

677
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,837
How many times
do I have to say that?

678
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:55,543
Excuse me, sir,
where are you going?

679
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:57,138
Irene, you wouldn't be
doing him any good

680
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:59,116
and you wouldn't be
doing your daughter any good--

681
00:55:59,185 --> 00:56:01,710
What do you know
about my daughter?!

682
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:34,082
You want someone around
for her, I understand that,

683
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,751
but you have to look out
for her safety.

684
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:36,816
You have to ask yourself,

685
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,056
"Is this
the right kind of guy

686
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:39,325
to have around
your daughter?"

687
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,833
What has Aaron done?

688
00:56:41,968 --> 00:56:43,732
We just want
to talk to him.

689
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:47,103
Did he kill somebody?

690
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:26,519
Come in.

691
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:33,489
You care about these
people here, Aaron?

692
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:36,760
You're going
to get them hurt.

693
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,357
You here to sweep me, L.T.?

694
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:39,958
You know I don't do that.

695
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:43,131
How do I know that?

696
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,740
They are coming for you.

697
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:52,272
They've been coming for me
for a long time, L.T.

698
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:55,843
You have to answer
for what you've done.

699
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:59,185
I have to live
with what I've done.

700
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:04,953
You can say
whatever you want.

701
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:08,729
I don't trust you, L.T.

702
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:16,407
If you cross this line,

703
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:19,539
you better be ready
to kill me.

704
00:58:25,956 --> 00:58:28,049
Don't move.

705
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,061
Put your hands on your head
and get on the floor.

706
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:35,730
I said get on the floor, now.

707
00:58:37,436 --> 00:58:39,336
Get down.

708
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:04,838
Get on
the sidewalk!

709
01:00:16,953 --> 01:00:18,147
That's a silver star.

710
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:23,693
That is a sketch that
I made for a knife.

711
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:31,632
It's addressed to you.

712
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:38,168
"L.T., those guys you trained
to come and kill me--

713
01:00:38,245 --> 01:00:43,206
they're not soldiers,
they're robots."

714
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:48,077
We've got a positive ID at the
river-front construction site.

715
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:49,351
We're headed to that location,

716
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:50,619
over.

717
01:00:50,693 --> 01:00:52,183
10-9 that location.

718
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:00,400
This is Agent in Charge
Van Zandt, Agent Moret.

719
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:01,733
This is site foreman,
Hank Hooker.

720
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:03,467
One of our guys saw
him pull up over here

721
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:04,803
near that tunnel
entrance there.

722
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:05,934
How many men
work down there?

723
01:01:06,044 --> 01:01:07,807
Maybe three dozen.
They're all coming up now.

724
01:01:07,879 --> 01:01:08,903
Wait, we need an exact count.

725
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,345
I need a set of blueprints,
all right?

726
01:01:10,415 --> 01:01:12,350
All right, this is an overview
of the site.

727
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,147
There's four major sections
down there.

728
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,414
He probably went down here

729
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,319
in the red section,
that's tunnels eight through 12.

730
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,256
How far does this
whole thing exend?

731
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:21,317
About 12 square blocks,
straight into downtown.

732
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:22,555
We'll cover the red section.

733
01:01:22,629 --> 01:01:23,790
Only our people, Ted.

734
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:25,662
All right, show me the
other three entrances.

735
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:32,699
He went in over there.

736
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:34,208
There's three other
entrances here.

737
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:36,040
Make sure they're
completely blocked off.

738
01:01:55,702 --> 01:01:57,431
Lock it down!

739
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:37,977
I got it.

740
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:18,832
FBI!

741
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:21,494
Step away from the column
with your hands up.

742
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:25,836
Let me see your hands.

743
01:03:25,908 --> 01:03:27,535
720, this is Number One.

744
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,668
I need backup right now,

745
01:03:28,744 --> 01:03:31,873
red section, tunnel "A."

746
01:03:31,948 --> 01:03:32,880
Did you hear me?

747
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:36,612
I said step away
from the column now.

748
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:39,588
Step away from
the fucking column!

749
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,620
About halfway.

750
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,091
-60.
-Radio's dead.

751
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:31,481
Shit.

752
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:32,916
Jesus Christ.

753
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:34,476
Bobby!

754
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,188
Leave it in!
Don't touch him!

755
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:39,123
Don't touch him!
Open his mouth.

756
01:04:39,193 --> 01:04:41,924
Keep pressure on the wound.
Keep pressure on the wound.

757
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:45,127
Command Post,
this is Number Two.

758
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,931
We have an agent down,
sector red, sector red.

759
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:56,945
Get me them EMTs now ASAP!

760
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:59,381
Bobby... Bobby...

761
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:00,748
Bobby, listen to me.

762
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:01,808
Bobby, listen to me!

763
01:05:33,924 --> 01:05:35,016
Sorry, man.

764
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,921
Hike!

765
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,619
Hike! Hike!

766
01:10:19,459 --> 01:10:21,256
Number Two, Three-Charlie-One.

767
01:10:21,327 --> 01:10:22,988
Subject spotted on foot,
eastbound, number two lane.

768
01:10:23,062 --> 01:10:23,994
Hawthorne Bridge.

769
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,826
Close off both ends
of the bridge.

770
01:10:25,899 --> 01:10:27,764
Two SWAT teams
on the way. Over.

771
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:36,172
Get everybody off the bridge.

772
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:37,275
Leave that car!

773
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:57,636
Excuse me.

774
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:16,917
Get down!

775
01:12:16,996 --> 01:12:18,520
Let's keep this between us.

776
01:12:18,598 --> 01:12:20,259
Don't get in the way!

777
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,165
Get everybody down on the floor.

778
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:30,268
Get down, now!

779
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:48,461
Down! Get down!

780
01:12:48,533 --> 01:12:49,500
He's on the tower!

781
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:50,829
Target of opportunity!

782
01:12:50,902 --> 01:12:53,269
He's on the tower!

783
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:54,635
Fire!

784
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:12,986
Cease fire!

785
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:16,293
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!

786
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,655
Captain, I need two or three
of your officers on each bridge.

787
01:14:14,734 --> 01:14:16,326
Sweep the western sea wall,

788
01:14:16,402 --> 01:14:18,393
and shut down
the bike paths. SWAT...

789
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:20,997
I need recon teams
on both sides of the river.

790
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:22,802
Sniper units to cover
each team's advance.

791
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,435
You can take your people
off the river.

792
01:14:24,512 --> 01:14:26,275
The currents are strong enough
to carry him,

793
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:27,575
and the kid swims like a fish.

794
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:29,412
This is our show, Bonham.
This is what we do best.

795
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:30,645
How many people are
you willing to lose?

796
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:31,651
Excuse me?

797
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,652
He will kill

798
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:34,120
-as many of you as he can.
-Bonham...

799
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:36,283
You better decide now
what's an acceptable body count.

800
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:37,121
Knock it off!

801
01:14:37,193 --> 01:14:38,285
You want more dead bodies,

802
01:14:38,361 --> 01:14:39,623
that's what you're going to get
if you let these guys

803
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,687
declare war on my boy.

804
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:44,030
I made him what he is
and I can stop him.

805
01:14:44,101 --> 01:14:46,331
We've lost two of our people--

806
01:14:46,404 --> 01:14:48,839
best agents I ever served with.

807
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:50,169
Hallam belongs to us.

808
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,011
If you see a wreck in there,
let me know...

809
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,048
We'll get a vehicle down there.

810
01:24:39,765 --> 01:24:41,494
If he's alive, he won't come in.

811
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,166
Right.

812
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:08,533
-Hallam!
-Get on the ground!

813
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:22,982
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

814
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:41,040
There's a man goin' "round
takin" names

815
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:46,519
And he decides
Who to free and who to blame

816
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:51,252
Everybody won't be treated
all the same

817
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:57,698
There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down

818
01:28:57,767 --> 01:29:01,499
When the man comes around

819
01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:09,142
The hairs on your arm
Will stand up

820
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:13,776
At the terror in each sip
and in each sup

821
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:18,620
Will you partake
of that last offered cup

822
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:25,292
Or disappear
into the potter's ground

823
01:29:25,366 --> 01:29:28,996
When the man comes around?

824
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:34,032
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers

825
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:38,547
One hundred million angels
singin'

826
01:29:38,614 --> 01:29:45,385
Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum

827
01:29:45,457 --> 01:29:50,053
Voices callin',
voices cryin'

828
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:54,930
Some are born
and some are dyin'

829
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,801
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come

830
01:29:58,872 --> 01:30:04,937
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

831
01:30:05,012 --> 01:30:09,950
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks

832
01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:14,649
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

833
01:30:14,724 --> 01:30:18,421
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest

834
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:26,827
Till Armageddon,
no Shalam, no Shalom

835
01:30:26,905 --> 01:30:32,208
Then the father hen will call
his chickens home

836
01:30:32,345 --> 01:30:37,214
The wise men will bow down
before the throne

837
01:30:37,316 --> 01:30:42,380
And at his feet they'll cast
their golden crowns

838
01:30:42,456 --> 01:30:47,190
When the man comes around

839
01:30:47,262 --> 01:30:52,565
Whoever is unjust,
let him be unjust still

840
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:01,905
Whoever is filthy,
let him be filthy still

841
01:31:01,979 --> 01:31:07,885
Listen to the words
long written down

842
01:31:07,953 --> 01:31:11,946
When the man comes around

843
01:31:12,024 --> 01:31:16,462
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers

844
01:31:16,529 --> 01:31:21,297
One hundred million angels
singin'

845
01:31:21,368 --> 01:31:27,831
Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum

846
01:31:27,909 --> 01:31:32,472
Voices callin',
voices cryin'

847
01:31:32,548 --> 01:31:37,316
Some are born
and some are dyin'

848
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:42,223
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come

849
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:47,356
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

850
01:31:47,432 --> 01:31:51,995
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks

851
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:57,135
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree

852
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:02,012
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest

853
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:07,818
In measured hundredweight
and penny pound

854
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:10,290
When the man comes around.

855
01:32:11,305 --> 01:33:11,356
