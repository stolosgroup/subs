2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,890
(train rattling)

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,970
(soft music continues)

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,380
- Thank you.
- Would you like something else?

6
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,340
No. No, no, not just yet. I'm waiting.

7
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm expecting someone.

8
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,120
(sighs)

9
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
(soft music continues)

10
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,620
- (soft rumbling)
- (wind whistles)

11
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,790
(faint rattle)

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
Would this be
one of your regular haunts?

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,100
I don't have any regular haunts.
(chuckles)

14
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,910
Let me see it.

15
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,870
(Grindelwald sighs)

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,920
Sometimes I imagine
I still feel it around my neck.

17
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,670
I carried it for so many years.

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,170
How does it feel around yours?

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,140
We can free each other of it.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,140
(Grindelwald sighs)

21
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,810
Love to chatter, don't they,
our Muggle friends.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,310
Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,190
What you're doing is madness.

24
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,660
It's what we said we'd do.

25
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,870
- I was young. I was...
- Committed.

26
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,410
To me.

27
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,040
To us.

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,830
No.

29
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,210
I went along because...
(inhales sharply)

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,050
Because?

31
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,300
Because I was in love with you.

32
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,180
Yes.

33
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,510
But that's not why you went along.

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,020
It was you who said
we could reshape the world.

35
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,850
That it was our birthright.

36
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,150
(chain rattles)

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Can you smell it? The stench.

38
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,010
(sighs)

39
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,260
Do you really intend
to turn your back on your own kind?

40
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,050
For these animals?

41
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
(tense music playing)

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,230
With or without you,
I'll burn down their world, Albus.

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,150
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,110
Enjoy your cup of tea.

45
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,990
(cup clinking)

46
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,910
(deep rumbling)

(chattering)

52
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,400
She's ready.

53
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,320
(ethereal music playing)

54
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,410

(screeches)

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

63
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,280
(squelching)

64
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,120

(Qilin snorting)

67
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,890
Beautiful.

68
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
All right, you two.

69
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,690
Now, the tricky bit.

70
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,250
(groaning)

71
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,050
(Newt grunts)

72
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,470
(Newt grunts)

73
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,390
(panting) Accio.

74
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,980
(grunts)

75
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,440

89
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,370
I'm so sorry.

(baby Qilin purring)

96
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,330
Twins.

97
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,410
You had twins.

98
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,920
(Qilin sighs)

99
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,260
(baby Qilin trilling)

100
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
(gentle music playing)

101
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,430
(chatters)

102
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,360

(swift whooshing)

115
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,720
(whooshing continues)

116
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,770
(Grindelwald) Leave us.

117
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,610
Show me.

118
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,650
(trilling)

119
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,160
The others, they said it was special.

120
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,710
Ooh, it's beyond special.

121
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,000
See?

122
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,380
See its eyes?

123
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,260
Those eyes see everything.

124
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,600
When a Qilin is born, a righteous leader
will rise to change our world forever.

125
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,150
Her birth brings change,
Credence, to everything.

126
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,570
You did well.

127
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,320
Go.

128
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,610
Rest.

129
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,330
(squeaking)

130
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,090
(continues squeaking)

131
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,740
(suspenseful music plays)

132
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,580
- (trills weakly)
- There.

133
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,540
There.

134
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,090
(wistful music playing)

135
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,766
(Theseus) I don't suppose you'd like to
tell me what this is about, would you?

136
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,790
He just asked that we meet,
and that I be sure to bring you.

137
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
(Theseus) Hmm.

138
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,120
Right.

139
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,460
(patrons chattering)

140
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,720
(mirror squeaking)

141
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,560
Here to meet my brother, I expect.

142
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,480
No, sir.
We're here to see Albus Dumbledore.

143
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,990
- That would be my brother.
- (Newt) Oh.

144
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,860
Sorry. I'm, um... Brilliant.

145
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm Newt Scamander,
and this is Theseus...

146
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,280
Up the stairs. First on the left.

147
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,670
(mirror squeaking)

148
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,680
(Dumbledore) Has Newt told you
why you're here?

149
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,590
Was he meant to?

150
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,550
No. (Laughs) As a matter of fact.

151
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
(Theseus chuckles)

152
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,140
There's something that we, uh...

153
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,190
That, uh, Dumbledore
wishes to speak to you about.

154
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,190
It's a proposal.

155
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,150
All right.

156
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,886
You know what this is, of course.

157
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,280
Newt had it in Paris.

158
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,080
I can't say I have
much experience with such things,

159
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,910
but it looks to me to be a blood troth.

160
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,620
That would be correct.

161
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,420
And whose blood is contained within?

162
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,460
Mine.

163
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,590
And Grindelwald's.

164
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,406
I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?

165
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,430
(Dumbledore) Yes.

166
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,850
Nor he against me.

167
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,440
Can I ask, what would possess you
to make such a thing?

168
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,940
Love.

169
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,320
Arrogance. Naiveté. Pick your poison.

170
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,740
We were young,
we were going to transform the world.

171
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,990
(Theseus) Mm.

172
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,120
This ensured that we would,
even if one of us had a change of heart.

173
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,790
And what would happen
if you were to fight him?

174
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,170
(Dumbledore sighs)

175
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,890
It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.

176
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,980
Were I to even think about defying it...

177
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,400
(pendant humming)

178
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
(Theseus gasps softly)

179
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,570
(Dumbledore) It knows, you see.

180
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,830
(grunts)

181
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,120
(straining)

182
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,790
(Newt) Albus.

183
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,080
It senses the betrayal in my heart.

184
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,500
- Albus.
- (Dumbledore whimpers)

185
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,590
(chokes)

186
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,710
(gasping)

187
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,130
Albus.

188
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,260
(grunts)

189
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,760
(panting)

190
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,440
(Dumbledore)
That would be the least of it.

191
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,690
(sighs)

192
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,860
Young man's magic,
but as you can see...

193
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,580
powerful magic.

194
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,000
It can't be undone.

195
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
(sighs)

196
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,470
(Theseus) So this proposal, I take it
the Qilin has something to do with it?

197
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,220
He promises he won't tell a soul.

198
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,680
(inhales deeply)

199
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,430
If we're to defeat him,

200
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,770
the Qilin's only part of it.

201
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,940
The world as we know it
is coming undone.

202
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,900
Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.

203
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,830
Things that seem unimaginable today
will seem inevitable tomorrow...

204
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,990
if we don't stop him.

205
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,330
Should you agree to do what I ask...

206
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,130
you'll have to trust me.

207
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,590
Even when every instinct
tells you not to.

208
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,850
Let's hear it.

209
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,520
(fly buzzing)

210
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,990
(breathing heavily)

211
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,950
(quiet footsteps)

212
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,590
Does he send you to spy on me?

213
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,970
No.

214
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,380
But he asks.

215
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,640
What ya thinkin', what ya feeling.

216
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,970
And the others?

217
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?

218
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,690
Yes, but it's mostly you.

219
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,060
And do you tell him?

220
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,440
(sighing)

221
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,440
- You do.
- (breathes heavily)

222
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,320
Who's reading whose mind now?

223
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,370
Tell me what you see.

224
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,920
(breathing shakily)
You're a Dumbledore.

225
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,840
It's an important family.

226
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,630
You know this because he's told you.

227
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,720
He's also told you they abandoned you.

228
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,020
That you were a...
A dirty secret.

229
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,230
Um... He says
Dumbledore abandoned him too,

230
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,230
and he knows how you feel.

231
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,450
And for that reason...

232
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,120
he's asked you to kill him.

233
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,830
I want you to go now, Queenie.

234
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,420
(Queenie) I don't tell him.

235
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,090
Not always.

236
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,970
Not everything.

237
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,510
(somber music playing)

238
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,850
(soft whooshing)

239
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,110
(sighs)

240
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,830
(mirror squeaks)

241
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,880
(sighs)

242
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,230
(traditional pop music
playing on speaker)

243
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,820
- (door opens)
- (bell jingling)

244
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,660
(sighs)

245
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,000
Hey, we're...

246
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,540
Queenie.

247
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,050
Hi, sweetie.

248
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,510
(chuckles)

249
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,970
(Queenie chuckles)

250
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,810
Honey... (sighs)

251
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,560
look at your bakery.

252
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,680
It's like a ghost town.

253
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah, well, I missed you.

254
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,440
Oh, baby.

255
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,110
Why don't you come here?

256
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,490
Come here.

257
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,410
(sniffles)

258
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,080
- (crying softly)
- (Queenie) Hey.

259
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,420
Everything's gonna be all right.

260
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,710
Everything's gonna be just fine.

261
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
(suspenseful music playing)

262
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,200
(whistling teasing tune)

263
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,870
Hey, sweetheart,
what brings you downtown?

264
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,540
I really hope you didn't spend all day
coming up with that.

265
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,420
Oh, you want scary,
is that what you want?

266
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,340
You know what it is,
you just aren't menacing enough.

267
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,260
(scoffing)
I think I'm plenty menacing.

268
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Am I not menacing?

269
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,230
Maybe if you waved your arms around,
you know, like a crazy man,

270
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,770
then you'd appear more menacing.

271
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,650
That's good. A little more.

272
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,280
A little more.

273
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,240
Keep going. Perfect.

274
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,790
- (panting)
- Three, two, one.

275
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,870
Hey!

276
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,170
(metal clacking)

277
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,710
That's enough. Get outta here.

278
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,710
What's on your mind, baker boy?

279
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,970
(Jacob) Ah, jeez.

280
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,720
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

281
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,890
(man) Oh, well, we're not.

282
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,390
(Jacob) It's a lady.

283
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,800
(man scoffs)

284
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,930
I tell you what...

285
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,540
I'll give you the first shot.
Go ahead.

286
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
You sure?

287
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,060
(grunts) Oh, boy.

288
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,610
- (body thuds)
- (Jacob sighs)

289
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,280
(pan clatters)

290
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,450
Last time
I ever help that woman out again.

291
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,570
Lally!

292
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,450
Whoopsie, Frank.
Sometimes I forget my own strength.

293
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,870
I'll take it from here.
Thank you!

294
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,870
Welcome.

295
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,210
- (man) Catch you later, Lally.
- (Lally) Bye, Stanley.

296
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,170
I'll be over for a game
of Befudler Dudley soon.

297
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,920
- (Stanley) All right.
- (chuckles)

298
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,420
That's my cousin Stanley. He's a wizard.

299
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,420
No.

300
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,180
(Lally) Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.

301
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,616
I said I wanted out, and I want out.

302
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,720
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

303
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,260
Can't believe my therapist said
you wizards don't exist.

304
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,680
(chuckles) What a waste of money!

305
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,060
You do know I'm a witch, right?

306
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,850
Yeah.

307
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,440
- Look...
- (tool clatters)

308
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,150
You seem like a really nice witch.

309
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,206
You don't know what
I've been through with you people.

310
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,700
So, could you please get out of my life?

311
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,830
- A little over a year ago...
- Oh, my...

312
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,556
in the hopes of securing
a small business loan,

313
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,636
you walked through the doors
of the Steen National Bank

314
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,040
located about six blocks from here.

315
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,766
You then made the acquaintance
of Newt Scamander,

316
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,590
the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.

317
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,736
You then learned of a world

318
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,510
you had previously
been wholly unaware of.

319
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,180
You met and fell in love
with a witch named Queenie Goldstein,

320
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,220
had your brain wiped
by means of Obliviation,

321
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,850
only it didn't take.

322
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,520
And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who,

323
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,190
after your refusal to marry her, mm,

324
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,020
decided to join Gellert Grindelwald
and his dark army of followers,

325
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,520
who pose the single greatest threat

326
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,280
to both your world and ours
in four centuries.

327
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,900
How did I do?

328
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,400
(chuckles) That was good.

329
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,740
Except for the part about Queenie
going over to the dark side.

330
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,540
(sighs) I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.

331
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,120
But she's got a heart
bigger than this whole crazy island,

332
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,080
and she's so smart, you know?

333
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,976
She can legitimately
read your brain, you know,

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,130
she's a whatchamacallit...

335
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,170
- A Legilimens.
- Yeah.

336
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,090
Look... (sighs)

337
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,850
- (pan clangs)
- You see this?

338
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,310
You see the pan?
That's me, I'm the pan.

339
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,650
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
I'm just a schmo.

340
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,456
I don't know what kind of crazy ideas
you have in your head there, lady,

341
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,860
but I'm sure as hell
you could do a lot better than me.

342
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,110
Goodbye.

343
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,570
I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski.

344
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,870
(Jacob groans)

345
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,410
You could have ducked under the counter,
but you didn't.

346
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,580
You could have looked the other way,
but you didn't.

347
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,710
In fact,

348
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,750
you were willing to put yourself
in danger to save a perfect stranger.

349
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,210
Seems to me

350
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,050
you're just the kind of average Joe
the world needs right now.

351
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,470
You just don't know it yet.

352
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,760
That's why I had to show you.

353
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,440
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

354
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,860
(light jazz music playing)

355
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,650
All right.

356
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,650
Call me Jacob.

357
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,820
Call me Lally.

358
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,160
- Lally.
- Mm.

359
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,490
I gotta lock up.

360
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,910
Thanks.

361
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,670
Much better, Jacob.

362
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,750
(light jazz music continues playing)

363
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,340
(Jacob sighs loudly)

364
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,220
I believe you know
how this works, Jacob.

365
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
(Jacob) Mm.

366
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
(magical music playing)

367
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,420
What did they say at the Ministry?

368
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,880
Liu or Santos?

369
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,680
Officially,
the Ministry takes no position.

370
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,180
Unofficially, smart money's on Santos.

371
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,480
Although anyone
would be better than Vogel.

372
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,810
Anyone?

373
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,780
I don't believe
he's on the ballot, Kama.

374
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,030
He also happens to be a fugitive.

375
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,530
Is there a difference?

376
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,030
(rumbling)

377
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,450
Spinning! Always with the spinning.

378
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,530
(Newt) Jacob.

379
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,200
Welcome. You brilliant man.

380
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,580
Sorry.

381
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,290
I was absolutely sure
that Professor Hicks would convince you.

382
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,710
Yeah.

383
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,760
You know me, pal. I can't pass up
a good Portkey. (Chuckles)

384
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,340
Mr. Scamander.

385
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,930
Professor Hicks.

386
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,170
- At long last.
- At long last.

387
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,600
So, Professor Hicks and I,
we've corresponded for many years,

388
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,930
but we've never actually met.

389
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,440
So, her book on advanced charm casting
is a must-read.

390
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,850
Newt is far too kind.

391
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Fantastic Beasts is required reading
for all my fifth years.

392
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,490
Now, let me make some introductions.

393
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,900
So, this is, um,
Bunty Broadacre,

394
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,030
my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.

395
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,660
Eight. Years.

396
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,080
And 164 days.

397
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,710
- (Lally) Hmm.
- As you can see, indispensable.

398
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,000
And this is...

399
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,040
Yusuf Kama.

400
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,420
Pleasure.

401
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,090
And you, obviously,
already made Jacob's acquaintance.

402
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,680
(Theseus clears throat) Newt.

403
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,560
So... So, this is my brother, Theseus,

404
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,100
and, um, he works for the Ministry.

405
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,310
Actually,
head of the British Auror Office.

406
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,860
Ah! Well, I'll have to ensure
my wand registration's up-to-date.

407
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Yes.

408
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,626
Although, strictly speaking,
that doesn't fall within my purview.

409
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,650
(Newt mumbles)

410
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,240
(puts suitcase down)

411
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,330
(gasps) Oh.

412
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,670
(sighs)

413
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,460
(Newt) All right then.

414
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,970
Well, I imagine that you're all
wondering why you find yourselves here.

415
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,720
And in anticipation of that,

416
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,310
Dumbledore asked
that I convey a message.

417
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,600
So, Grindelwald has the ability
to see snatches of the future.

418
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,310
So, we have to assume

419
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,980
that he'll be able to anticipate
what we do before we do it.

420
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,200
So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world,

421
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,990
to save your world, Jacob,

422
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,660
then our best hope
is to confuse him.

423
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,250
Uh...

424
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,410
'Scuse me.

425
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?

426
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,800
Countersight.

427
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,510
(Newt) Exactly.

428
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,420
The best plan being no plan.

429
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,180
Or, many overlapping plans.

430
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,470
Thus, confusion.

431
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,576
It's working on me right now.

432
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,350
In fact, Dumbledore asked
that I give you something, Jacob.

433
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,900
(Pick squeaks)

434
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,190
It's snake wood.

435
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,950
It's, uh, somewhat rare.

436
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,030
Are you kiddin' me right now?

437
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
Is this thing real?

438
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
Yes.

439
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,790
Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.

440
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,750
It's sorta real?

441
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,800
More importantly,
where we're going, you'll need it.

442
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,470
Now, there's something for you too,
I think, Theseus. Um...

443
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,890
- (rustling)
- Teddy, please let go now.

444
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,260
- Teddy, please let go.
- (sighs)

445
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,680
No. Teddy, will you behave?

446
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,390
This is Theseus's...

447
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,020
(chitters, sniffing)

448
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,650
Um, that's...

449
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,320
Well, of course.

450
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,490
Now everything makes sense.

451
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,240
Um, Lally, I believe you were given
some reading material?

452
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,410
You know what they say.

453
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,266
A book can take you around
the world and back,

454
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,160
all you have to do is open it.

455
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,330
She ain't kiddin'.

456
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,830
(Newt) Yes, uh, Bunty, um...

457
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,960
that's for you.

458
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,050
I was told it was for your eyes only.

459
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,010
(Bunty) Oh.

460
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,350
(gasps)

461
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,430
Oh.

462
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,940
And, Kama.

463
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,060
I have what I need.

464
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,990
What about Tina?
Uh, is Tina coming?

465
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,650
Tina's not available.

466
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,900
Um...

467
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,370
Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...

468
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,540
well, from what I understand.

469
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,290
Tina's been made head
of the American Auror Office.

470
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,846
- (Jacob) Oh.
- We know each other well.

471
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,630
She's quite a remarkable woman.

472
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,300
She is.

473
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,316
So, this is the team
that's gonna take down

474
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,930
the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.

475
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,970
A magizoologist,
his indispensable assistant,

476
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,300
a schoolteacher,

477
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,430
a wizard descended from
a very old French family, and...

478
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
(pops lips)

479
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,270
(inhales sharply)
a Muggle baker with his fake wand.

480
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,150
Hey, we got you too, pal,

481
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,730
and his wand works.

482
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,610
(Theseus scoffs)

483
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,570
Who wouldn't like our chances?

484
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,950
(cackles)

485
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,240
Oh. Uh... (clears throat)

486
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,830
- (sighs)
- (train horn toots)

487
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,910
(dramatic music playing)

488
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,800
(brakes squeal)

489
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,710
(announcer speaking German on PA)

490
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,230
You're all right, little one.

491
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,940
(train stops)

492
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,440
Berlin. (Sighs)

493
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,860
Wonderful.

494
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,290
Kama...

495
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,540
stay safe.

496
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,670
(suspenseful music playing)

497
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,050
I must be going too now, Newt.

498
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,060
No one can know everything...

499
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,060
not even you.

500
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Right.

501
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,640
Well, here it is.

502
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
(gateway rattling)

503
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,560
(grunting)

504
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,740
(grunts)

505
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,820
(indistinct chatter)

506
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,910
Huh.

507
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,460
(Theseus) German Ministry of Magic?

508
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,710
Yes.

509
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,790
(fireworks whistling and bursting)

510
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,590
I take it we're here for a reason.

511
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,170
Yes, we have a tea ceremony to attend,

512
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,550
and if we don't hurry up, we'll be late.

513
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,680
Jacob, stay with the group.

514
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,890
(fireworks continue bursting)

515
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,440
(crowd chanting in distance)

516
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,610
(crowd) Santos! Santos! Santos!

517
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,950
Santos! Santos! Santos!

518
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,450
(yells)

519
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,210
(crowd continues chanting)

520
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,340
Evening...

521
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,920
Helmut.

522
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,630
- Theseus.
- (guard speaks German)

523
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,840
(Theseus) Hey, hey.

524
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,600
They're with me.

525
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,930
(Lally sighs)

526
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,060
(fireworks continue bursting)

527
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,150
(crowd continues chanting)

528
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,990
Santos! Santos! Santos!

529
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,910
(chanting continues)

530
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,080
Incendio.

531
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,290
(crowd cheering)

532
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,710
(crowd clamoring)

533
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,470
(lightning crackling)

534
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,940
I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.

535
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,860
Uh, no, I have
a message to deliver.

536
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,240
A message?

537
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,530
To who?

538
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,990
(man) Mr. Vogel,
it's a pleasure to be here.

539
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,490
It's an honor to meet you.

540
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,200
You are joking.

541
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
No.

542
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,080
(Jacob) What am I even doing here?
Let's go outside.

543
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm not very good in these situations.

544
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,170
These situations?

545
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,090
With all the people,

546
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,610
- the fancy people.
- (clicks tongue)

547
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,050
Hello.

548
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
(in German accent)
I saw you enter the room

549
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,560
and I thought to myself,

550
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,890
Edith,
that's an interesting-looking man.

551
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,980
Jacob Kowalski.

552
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,230
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

553
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,190
And where is it you hail from,
Mr. Kowalski?

554
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,490
(smacks lips) Queens.

555
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
Ah!

556
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,990
(Newt) Sorry, Herr Vogel.
Sorry, I wonder if I could have a word?

557
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,370
Oh!

558
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,410
Merlin's beard,
it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

559
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,250
Herr Vogel...

560
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,630
(whispers indistinctly)

561
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,260
I have a message from a friend,
and it cannot wait.

562
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,140
Do what is right...

563
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,520
not what is easy.

564
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,190
He said it was important
that I reach you tonight,

565
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,570
that you hear them tonight, the words.

566
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,570
It's time, sir.

567
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,580
(Vogel whispering) Is he here?

568
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,450
In Berlin?

569
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,330
(in normal tone) No, of course not.

570
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,840
Why leave Hogwarts
when the world outside is burning?

571
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,010
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

572
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,990
(cup clinking)

573
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,030
(clinking stops)

574
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,670
(crowd applauding)

575
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,710
Thank you.

576
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,170
Thank you.

577
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,390
I see many familiar faces here tonight.

578
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,180
Colleagues, friends...

579
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,560
foes.

580
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,810
(crowd laughs)

581
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,020
Within the next 48 hours,

582
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,740
you, along with the rest of
the Wizarding World,

583
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,240
will choose our next great leader.

584
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,240
A choice that will shape our lives
for generations to come.

585
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,620
I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph,

586
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,250
the Confederation will be in able hands.

587
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,960
Liu Tao.

588
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,880
(crowd applauds)

589
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,720
Vicência Santos.

590
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,600
(softly) Thank you, thank you.

591
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,320
It's in moments such as these
we are reminded

592
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,570
that it is this peaceful
transfer of power

593
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,650
which marks our humanity

594
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,780
and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences,

595
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,080
all voices deserve to be heard...

596
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,130
even voices
which many may find disagreeable.

597
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,500
(suspenseful music playing)

598
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,000
Newt.

599
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,300
Any of those lot look familiar to you?

600
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,380
(Vogel continues
speaking indistinctly)

601
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,100
Paris. The night that Leta...

602
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,390
(Theseus whispers)
They were with Grindelwald.

603
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,480
(suspenseful music continues)

604
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,690
Mm.

605
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,620
(Vogel) And so,
after an extensive investigation,

606
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,750
the Confederation has concluded
that insufficient evidence exists...

607
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,630
to prosecute Gellert Grindelwald

608
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,300
for the crimes
against the Muggle community

609
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,800
- of which he was accused.
- (gasps)

610
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,060
He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.

611
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
(crowd clamoring)

612
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,270
Are you kidding me?

613
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,270
They're letting the guy off?

614
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,980
I was there, he was killing people.

615
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,280
You're under arrest.

616
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,860
All of you.

617
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Wands down!

618
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,330
(orders in German)

619
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,870
(Newt) Theseus.

620
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,460
Theseus!

621
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,840
Newt, Newt. Not here.

622
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,510
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

623
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,010
Let's go. Newt,

624
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,640
they have the German Ministry.
We've got to go.

625
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
(Jacob) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

626
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,180
It ain't right. That's not justice.

627
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,060
"Extended investigation." I was there.

628
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,020
Were you there? Were you there?
I was there.

629
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,690
- You just let a killer off!
- Jacob.

630
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,060
Whoa!

631
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,980
We have to go. We have to go.

632
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,940
Jacob, let's go.

633
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,910
(dramatic choral music playing)

634
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
(wind whistling)

635
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,170
(fire crackling)

636
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,980
That's very good.

637
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,730
Her favorite.

638
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,860
Remember how
she begged Mother to make it?

639
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,370
Ariana.

640
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,960
Mother claimed it calmed her,
but I think that was wishful thinking.

641
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,120
Albus.

642
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,920
I was there.

643
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,170
I grew up in the same house.

644
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,590
Everything you saw, I saw.

645
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,260
Everything.

646
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
(knock on door)

647
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,650
(knocking continues)

648
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,990
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

649
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,610
(knock on door)

650
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.

651
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,540
Tell me, what is it?

652
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,250
It's Berlin.

653
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,500
(Dumbledore) What happened?

654
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,800
(McGonagall) Vogel has absolved Gellert
of all his crimes.

655
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,630
He's free. He says there's no proof.

656
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,970
He tried to arrest aurors who were there
the night Leta Lestrange was murdered.

657
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,890
(soft whooshing)

658
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,940
(mirror squeaks)

659
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,570
(Dumbledore) Rather disappointing.

660
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,280
I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.

661
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,030
Can I impose on you?

662
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,790
Of course.
And, Albus, please be...

663
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,750
I'll do my best.

664
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
(McGonagall) Evening, Aberforth.

665
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,210
Evening, Minerva.

666
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,670
Apologies for calling you a stupid sod.

667
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,420
Apology accepted.

668
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,890
(Dumbledore) I'm afraid I'll have to
cut our evening short.

669
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,930
Off to save the world, are we?

670
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,100
That will take a better man than me.

671
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,570
Don't ask.

672
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,990
(door opens)

673
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,540
(door closes)

674
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,670
(mysterious music playing)

675
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:01,400
There are thousands in the streets
chanting your name.

676
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,320
You're a free man.

677
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,950
Tell the others to prepare to leave.

678
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,490
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow.

679
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,460
We'll have a visitor in the morning.

680
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,550
(Rosier) Why does it stay with him?

681
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,840
It must sense what he's about to do.

682
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,180
And you're sure...

683
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,890
that he can kill Dumbledore?

684
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,690
His pain is his power.

685
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,440
(indistinct talking)

686
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,730
(phones ringing)

687
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,740
The man that I am inquiring about
is the head of the British Auror Office.

688
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,070
How can you have misplaced
the head of the British Auror Office?

689
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,660
As our contention said,
since he was never in our custody,

690
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,120
we never misplaced him.

691
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,186
Sir, there were dozens of people there,
any one of them could corroborate...

692
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,250
- And your name is?
- (Jacob) Let's get out of here.

693
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,970
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

694
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,130
Come here. Come here.

695
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,300
Excuse me!

696
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,470
Hey!

697
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,850
That's the guy.
He knows where Theseus is.

698
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:16,930
Hello!

699
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,850
Where's Theseus?

700
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,900
That's him.
He knows about Theseus.

701
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,630
(soft rattling)

702
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
(Lally) Newt.

703
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,590
(Newt) Ah.

704
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,270
Albus. (Panting)

705
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,030
Theseus has been taken to the Erkstag.

706
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,570
Wait, no,
but the Erkstag shut down years ago.

707
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,330
Yes, well, it's the Ministry's
secret little bed and breakfast now.

708
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,000
You'll need this to see him.

709
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,730
- And one of these.
- (Jacob grunts)

710
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,500
- (Jacob) Mm-hmm.
- And this.

711
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,800
- (gateway rattling)
- Wait, wait, wait.

712
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,600
I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

713
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,760
Me? Oh, uh... Yeah, thank you,
Mr. Dumbledore.

714
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,220
It's a real pip.

715
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,560
I advise you to keep it close.

716
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,390
- Professor Hicks.
- Dumbledore.

717
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,900
Assuming you're not otherwise engaged,
and frankly even if you are,

718
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,650
I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.

719
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,280
Take Mr. Kowalski.

720
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,520
I'm quite certain
there'll be an assassination attempt.

721
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,870
Anything you can do to scotch that
will be greatly appreciated.

722
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,950
It's my pleasure.

723
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,410
I shall welcome the challenge.

724
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,950
Besides, I'll have Jacob with me.

725
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,710
Oh, not to worry.

726
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,090
Professor Hicks's defensive magic
is superb.

727
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,210
Until next time.

728
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,840
(chuckles) Such a flatterer.

729
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,720
Well, not really. It is superb.

730
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,760
(Newt) Albus!

731
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,680
I was just wondering...

732
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,970
Ah.

733
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,220
Yes.

734
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,310
- The case.
- Yes.

735
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,230
Rest assured, it's in safe hands.

736
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,820
(cable car bell dings)

737
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,910
- (door opens)
- (bell jingles)

738
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,200
Can I help you?

739
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,370
(smacks lips) Yes.

740
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,330
I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.

741
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,960
Certainly.

742
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,760
Oh. No, you mustn't open it.

743
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,890
Um, I mean, it's not necessary.

744
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
The interior isn't important.
(chuckles lightly)

745
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,020
I see no reason I can't make you one.

746
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,940
(trills softly)

747
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,370
If you leave it here.

748
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,830
Oh. No...

749
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,410
I couldn't leave it.

750
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,960
And I'll be needing more than one.

751
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,460
You see, um... (sighs)

752
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,050
My husband, (chuckles)
he's a bit absentminded.

753
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,050
He's always forgetting things.

754
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,130
Just the other day,
he forgot he was married to me.

755
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,430
(laughs)

756
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,060
Can you imagine? (Laughing)

757
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,810
But I love him.

758
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,400
Exactly how many were you thinking?

759
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,900
Um...

760
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,400
Half a dozen,

761
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,160
and I'll need them in two days' time.

762
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,160
(suspenseful music playing)

763
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,460
(wizard) Show your hands.

764
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,050
Who are you?

765
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,720
My name is Yusuf Kama.

766
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,890
(Grindelwald) Who's our visitor?

767
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,300
(Yusuf) I'm an admirer.

768
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,100
(Rosier) You murdered his sister.

769
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,850
Her name was Leta.

770
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,230
Leta Lestrange.

771
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,480
Ah, yes.

772
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,730
You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.

773
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,240
Shared.

774
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,200
That's the only thing we shared.

775
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,700
Dumbledore sent you, am I right?

776
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,830
He fears
you're in possession of a creature.

777
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,790
He fears the use you may put it to.

778
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,960
He sent me here to spy on you.

779
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,090
What would you like me to tell him?

780
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,010
Queenie.

781
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,470
Is he telling the truth?

782
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,570
What else?

783
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,490
(Queenie) Even though
he believes in you,

784
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,370
he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.

785
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,370
He carries
her absence with him every day.

786
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,370
Every breath he takes
is a reminder that she breathes no more.

787
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,590
Then I presume you won't mind

788
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,670
if I relieve you
of your sister's memory.

789
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,300
Right?

790
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,640
Right.

791
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,520
(strained grunting)

792
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,440
(shuddering)

793
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,660
There.

794
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,790
Better?

795
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,540
I thought so.

796
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,050
When we allow ourselves to be consumed
by anger, the only victim is our self.

797
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,260
Now, we were just about to depart.

798
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,140
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

799
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:31,140
Come, we can talk some more
about our mutual friend, Dumbledore.

800
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,280
After you.

801
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,550
(passersby chattering)

802
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,970
(uneasy music playing)

803
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,150
(suspenseful music playing)

804
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,670
(wind whistling)

805
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,670
(blowing)

806
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,430
(magical music playing)

807
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,110
(fizzling)

808
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,740
Hello, Credence.

809
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,000
Do you know
what it's like to have no one?

810
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,260
To always be alone?

811
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,800
It's you.

812
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,720
You're the one sending messages
in the mirror.

813
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,690
I'm a Dumbledore.

814
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,310
You abandoned me.

815
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,820
The same blood
that runs my veins runs yours.

816
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,660
He's not here for you.

817
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,290
He's here for me.

818
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:16,850
(glass smashes)

819
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,940
(glass smashes)

820
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,780
(glass smashing)

821
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,740
(growls)

822
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,920
Things are not quite
what they appear, Credence...

823
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,050
no matter what you've been told.

824
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,340
(inhales sharply)

825
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,720
My name is Aurelius.

826
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,600
He's lied to you.

827
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,060
Kindled your hate.

828
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,560
(grunting)

829
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,320
(thump)

830
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,240
(melancholy music playing)

831
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,580
(sighs)

832
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,000
(wind whooshing)

833
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,510
(phoenix cries)

834
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:38,810
(melancholy music continues)

835
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,190
(phoenix cries)

836
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,330
What he's told you isn't true...

837
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,710
but we do share the same blood.

838
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,670
You are a Dumbledore.

839
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
(emotional music playing)

840
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,470
(grunts softly)

841
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,060
I'm sorry for your pain.

842
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,400
We didn't know, I promise.

843
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,460
(people murmuring)

844
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,100
NO ENTRANCE!
ACCESS PROHIBITED!

845
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
(clanking)

846
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,620
(snoring softly)

847
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,160
(object thudding)

848
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,620
(exhales heavily)

849
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,620
(Newt) I've come to see my brother.

850
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,620
His name is Theseus Scamander.

851
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,210
(thudding)

852
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,880
Sorry, that's, uh...

853
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,350
Wand.

854
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,860
(squeaks)

855
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,570
(chitters)

856
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,650
Oh, that's, uh...

857
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,030
I'm... I'm a magizoologist.

858
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,310
He's perfectly harmless. He's...

859
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,750
He's just a pet, really.

860
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,620
(squeaking)

861
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,370
- (blows raspberries)
- Sorry.

862
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,880
(Teddy sniffing)

863
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,500
That's Teddy.

864
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,380
He's a total nightmare, truth be told.

865
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,960
They stay here.

866
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,050
(Pick squeals)

867
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,010
(larvae squeaking)

868
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,770
(rattling)

869
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,690
(stridulating)

870
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,950
So, how will I know where to find him?

871
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,950
He's your brother?

872
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,240
Yes.

873
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,950
He will be the one
who looks like your brother.

874
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,710
(Pick squeaking)

875
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,040
I will be back, Pick.

876
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,750
On my word.

877
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,760
(warden) "I'll be back, Pick."

878
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,060
"On my word." (laughs)

879
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,480
And I'll be Minister of Magic
one day. (Laughs)

880
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,480
(sniffing)

881
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,860
- (blows raspberries)
- (laughs)

882
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,690
(groans)

883
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,530
- (grand music playing)
- (crowd cheering)

884
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,710
(screeches)

885
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,210
(mysterious music playing)

886
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,350
- (breathes deeply)
- Take us 'round the back.

887
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,600
It's not safe here.

888
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:50,690
No.

889
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Roll it down.

890
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,940
What?

891
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,230
The window.

892
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,650
Roll it down.

893
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,830
(crowd shouting indistinctly)

894
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,960
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

895
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,040
(windows thudding)

896
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,840
(Rosier) No. No!

897
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,760
(crowd cheering)

898
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,720
(Vogel) Those people...

899
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,390
aren't suggesting we listen to them.

900
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
They aren't asking us to listen.

901
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,480
They're demanding it.

902
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,070
You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?

903
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,490
Yes.

904
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,570
Yes, let him stand.

905
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,490
(cheering continues)

906
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,700
Gellert Grindelwald
wants a Muggle-wizard war,

907
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,830
and if he gets his wish,
he won't just destroy their world,

908
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,250
he'll destroy ours as well.

909
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,210
Which is why he cannot win.

910
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,420
Let him stand as a candidate.

911
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,260
Let the people vote.

912
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,470
When he loses,
the people will have spoken.

913
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,890
But deny them their voices,

914
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,640
and those streets will run with blood.

915
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:12,230
- (fireworks exploding)
- (crowd continues cheering)

916
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,320
(cheering continues)

917
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,870
Theseus. (Echoing)

918
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,250
(footsteps patter)

919
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,130
Theseus.

920
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,880
(faint rustling)

921
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,180
(soft click)

922
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,230
(clicking)

923
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,940
(rustle)

924
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,830
(clicking)

925
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,370
(squeaking)

926
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,540
(screeches)

927
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,470
(chittering)

928
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,810
(footsteps pattering)

929
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,570
(ominous rumbling)

930
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,490
(creatures chitter)

931
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,170
- (lively chatter)
- (classical music playing)

932
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,710
(Lally grunts)

933
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:16,850
(Jacob) Lally,

934
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,060
the guy with the hair...

935
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,860
sitting next to Edith.

936
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
He looks like he can kill somebody.

937
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,160
He also looks like my Uncle Dominic.

938
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,870
Is your Uncle Dominic
the Norwegian Minister of Magic?

939
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,120
No.

940
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,700
Didn't think so.

941
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,380
(music and chatter stops)

942
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,900
(gentle classical music playing)

943
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,070
Queenie.

944
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,360
Queenie.

945
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,330
Ah.

946
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:20,580
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

947
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,840
Your supporters are in fine voice.

948
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,340
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

949
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,680
- (prisoners groaning)
- (seething)

950
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,350
(Newt shuddering)

951
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,900
(Newt whimpers)

952
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,570
(Newt huffing)

953
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,570
Rescuing me, are you?

954
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,610
- (Newt) That's the general idea.
- (Theseus) Huh.

955
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,120
And I presume this...

956
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,160
whatever it is that you are doing,
is strategic.

957
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,330
Yes, a technique called limbic mimicry.

958
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:01,830
It discourages violent engagement,
theoretically.

959
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,500
I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.

960
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,920
- And the results?
- Uh... (panting shakily)

961
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,300
Inconclusive.

962
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,196
Course that was a laboratory setting

963
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,640
and the conditions
were strictly controlled, and the...

964
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,560
Well, the current conditions
are more volatile,

965
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,656
so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.

966
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,980
The ultimate outcome presumably...

967
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,150
being our survival.

968
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,400
(creature chitters)

969
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,900
(clicking)

970
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,620
(prisoners groan)

971
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,120
(seething)

972
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,726
- (lantern clinks)
- (prisoner screams)

973
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,380
(hisses)

974
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,010
(man screaming)

975
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:59,430
(screaming continues in distance)

976
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,810
(Theseus sighs)

977
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,620
(Theseus groans) Well done, come on.

978
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:22,710
(Theseus grunts)

979
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,870
(creatures screeching)

980
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,960
(Theseus sighs)

981
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,790
And the plan is?

982
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,050
Hold this.

983
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,050
(plays tune with hand flute)

984
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,140
- (tune echoing)
- (snoring)

985
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,900
(whispering)
What the bloody hell was that for?

986
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,520
Um... (breathing shakily)

987
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,230
We're gonna need some help.

988
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,280
(creatures chitter)

989
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,950
(comical music plays)

990
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,370
Follow me.

991
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,420
Come on.

992
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,300
(comical music continues)

993
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,760
You're not swiveling properly.

994
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,350
Swivel...

995
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,520
swivel, but delicately.

996
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,690
I'm swiveling
like you're swiveling, Newt.

997
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,400
I don't believe you are.

998
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:29,980
(lantern clinks)

999
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,950

(creatures chittering)

1002

Swivel.

(sniffles)

1005
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,390
(whispers) Go to him.

1006
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:11,730
Queenie.

1007
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,780
Tell him it's all right.

1008
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:20,200
I can see he's failed.

1009
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,700
He'll have another chance.

1010
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,830
It's his loyalty I most value.

1011
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,350
(Jacob sighs)

1012
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,660
Stay here.

1013
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,910
(tense music playing)

1014
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:23,970
(Lally) Oh.

1015
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,270
Apologies.

1016
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:32,980
Hmm.

1017
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,730
(Jacob) Oh, boy. (Sighs)

1018
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,070
(tense music continues)

1019

(searing)

1020
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,290
Let her go.

1021
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,090
Excuse me?

1022
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,130
(tense music intensifies)

1023
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,640
(Jacob huffs)

1024
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,180
- Assassin!
- (Jacob) Huh?

1025
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:10,850

1042

(Theseus) Newt!

(panting)

1072
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,660
Accio!

1073
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,830
Grab the tie.

1074
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,880
(laughing)

(clicking)

1081
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,300
That was a Portkey.

1082
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,970
Yeah.

1083
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,890
Well done, you two.

1084
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,440
(Pick chatters)

(enchanting music playing)

1086
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,670
Not that either of you asked,

1087
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,960
but I would highly recommend
learning Charms.

1088
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,960
(Newt) Lally.

1089
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,460
What kept you two?

1090
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,470
Uh, we encountered
some complications. You?

1091
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,510
We encountered some complications.

1092
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,520
Jacob tried to murder Grindelwald?

1093
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,480
- It's a long story.
- (Theseus scoffs)

1094
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,310
Is it really snake wood?

1095
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,110
Yes, it's really snake wood.

1096
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:29,940
- Can I...
- (Jacob groans) Mm-mm.

1097
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,900
Very dangerous.

1098
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:33,570
It's very powerful.

1099
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:36,610
It's rare. If it got in the wrong hands,
you know...

1100
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,740
mess you up.

1101
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,450
Where did you get it?

1102
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:42,160
I got it for Christmas.

1103
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,330
(Lally) Jacob,

1104
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,710
look who I found.

1105
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:45,870
Hey.

1106
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,340
It's my wizard friends,
Newt and Theseus.

1107
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,800
We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.

1108
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,210
I gotta go.
All right, have fun.

1109
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,510
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1110
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,470
Can you believe this place?

1111
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,866
They got pint-sized little
witches and wizards

1112
01:19:58,890 --> 01:19:59,946
running around here. (Chuckles)

1113
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,220
(Theseus) You don't say.

1114
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,220
(whispers) I was the assassin.

1115
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:05,730
Newt and Theseus both went to Hogwarts.

1116
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:07,916
(Jacob) Oh, I knew that.
Well, they're being very nice to me.

1117
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,900
The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.

1118
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,780
They're delicious. Who wants one?

1119
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,690
I never cared for cockroach clusters
much myself,

1120
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,320
although Honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.

1121
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,830
- (all laughing)
- (bell ringing)

1122
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,200
Off you go.

1123
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,000
(Theseus) McGonagall.

1124
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:27,830
Albus.

1125
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,920
(Dumbledore) Well done.

1126
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,630
All of you, well done.

1127
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,630
Congratulations.

1128
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,420
- Congratulations?
- Indeed.

1129
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:36,760
Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.

1130
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,970
And you are alive and you are well.

1131
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,930
The fact that everything didn't go
precisely to plan

1132
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,310
was precisely the plan.

1133
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,810
Countersight 101.

1134
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:48,350
Albus, forgive me,
but aren't we back where we started?

1135
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,230
Actually, I would argue
that things are...

1136
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,480
a great deal worse.

1137
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:56,990
You haven't told them, have you?

1138
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:01,280
Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.

1139
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,620
- What?
- But how?

1140
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,830
Because Vogel chose easy over right.

1141
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,400
(Jacob) Hmm.

1142
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,730
It's all right.

1143
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,280
Bhutan.

1144
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,360
Correct. Three points to Hufflepuff.

1145
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,820
The kingdom of Bhutan
sits high in the Eastern Himalayas.

1146
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:45,700
It's a place of indescribable beauty.

1147
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:49,290
Some of our most important magic
has its origins there.

1148
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:54,340
They say if you listen carefully enough,
the past whispers to you.

1149
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:58,170
It also happens to be
where the election will be held.

1150
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,590
He can't win, can he?

1151
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,050
Only a few days ago
he was a fugitive from justice.

1152
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:07,600
Now he is an official candidate in the
International Confederation of Wizards.

1153
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,480
Dangerous times favor dangerous men.

1154
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:18,150
By the way, we'll be dining
with my brother in the village.

1155
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,110
Should you need anything before then,
Minerva is here.

1156
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,950
Dumbledore has a brother?

1157
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,250
(Theseus) Huh.

1158
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,870
(trills)

1159
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,380
(purrs)

1160
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,340
(Dumbledore) Here we are.

1161
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,850
(wind whistling)

1162
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,640
(Qilin grunts)

1163
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,430
Bunty, you're here.

1164
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,600
Yes.

1165
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,480
How is she?

1166
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,610
(Bunty) Oh, she's fine.

1167
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,690
(Newt) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1168
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,400
What's Alfie done now?

1169
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,796
Wait, you've not been biting
Timothy's bottom again, have you?

1170
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:05,320
Miss Broadacre, I trust my brother
has been a gracious host?

1171
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:08,040
Yes, ever so gracious.

1172
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,700
I'm delighted to hear.

1173
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:13,330
Uh, so, rooms have been
arranged for you in the village

1174
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,920
and Aberforth here
will prepare you a delicious dinner,

1175
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,590
his own recipe.

1176
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,680
(dishes clang)

1177
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,260
There's more of that if you want it.

1178
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,980
Thank you.

1179
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,810
Thanks.

1180
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,440
Astonishing.

1181
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,820
Never has something that looks
so repellent tasted so delicious.

1182
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,990
- (trilling)
- Who is this little one?

1183
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:46,070
Do you mind?

1184
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,700
She's a Qilin, Jacob.

1185
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,620
She's incredibly rare.

1186
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:53,210
One of the most beloved creatures
in the Wizarding World.

1187
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,710
Why?

1188
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,380
'Cause she can see into your soul.

1189
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,670
Oh. Oh!

1190
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,260
You're kidding me.

1191
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:08,260
No. So, if you are good and worthy,
then she'll see that.

1192
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:12,100
But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful,

1193
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,060
then she'll know that too.

1194
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:16,310
Oh, yeah?

1195
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,980
Does she just tell you that
or... (laughs)

1196
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,190
Not exactly tells.

1197
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:26,110
Well, she bows, but only in the presence
of someone truly pure of heart.

1198
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,870
I mean,
almost none of us are, of course,

1199
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,450
no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.

1200
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,670
There was actually a time,
many, many years ago,

1201
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,170
when the Qilin chose who'd lead us.

1202
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,380
(Jacob) No...

1203
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,550
- (chittering)
- Whoa. Woop. Whoa...

1204
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:46,970
(Bunty laughs)

1205
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,430
(chuckles) Okay. All right, already.

1206
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,890
- (trilling)
- (chuckles)

1207
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:53,390
Here you go.

1208
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Thriving.

1209
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,100
He's just hungry. Look at him.

1210
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,670
- (Bunty) She really likes you, Jacob.
- (Jacob) Oh, all right.

1211
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,490
It's okay.

1212
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,950
- (chatter continues softly)
- (soft music playing)

1213
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,410
(Dumbledore) Come with me.

1214
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,540
I'll help you.

1215
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,420
He's your son, Aberforth.

1216
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,800
He needs you.

1217
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,390
(gentle knock)

1218
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,150
Newt.

1219
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,990
Come in.

1220
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:58,420
Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.

1221
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Close the door.

1222
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,340
It's from Credence, Newt.

1223
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:15,390
The summer Gellert and I fell in love...

1224
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,060
my brother fell in love as well,

1225
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,440
with a girl from the Hollow.

1226
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,230
She was sent away.

1227
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:27,400
There were rumors about a child.

1228
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,200
Credence...

1229
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,780
He's a Dumbledore.

1230
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,200
If I'd been a better friend...

1231
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,370
to Aberforth,
if I'd been a better brother...

1232
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,920
he might have confided in me.

1233
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,170
Perhaps things
would have been different,

1234
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,800
and this boy...

1235
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:52,390
could have been part of our lives,
part of our family.

1236
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:01,350
Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.

1237
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:06,020
But he may yet be able to save us.

1238
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:13,740
Phoenix ash.

1239
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:18,160
The bird comes to him
because he's dying, Newt.

1240
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,910
I know the signs.

1241
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:23,130
You see...

1242
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,260
my sister was an Obscurial.

1243
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,300
And like Credence,
she never learned to express her magic.

1244
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,600
Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.

1245
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,520
Worst of all, none of us
were capable of easing her pain.

1246
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:47,440
Can you tell me how it is that...

1247
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:50,070
or how it came to an end for her?

1248
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,740
Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.

1249
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:01,540
My brother didn't approve.

1250
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,830
One night, he confronted us.

1251
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,840
Voices were raised, threats made.

1252
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,380
Aberforth drew his wand,
which was foolish.

1253
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:16,390
I drew my wand,
which was even more foolish.

1254
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:20,850
Gellert just laughed.

1255
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:24,650
No one heard Ariana
coming down the stairs.

1256
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,110
Can't say for certain it was my...

1257
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:32,700
spell.

1258
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,580
Doesn't really matter.

1259
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:44,170
(sighs) One minute she was there,
and the next she was gone.

1260
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,000
I'm so sorry, Albus.

1261
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,760
But if it's of any comfort,
perhaps she was saved some pain...

1262
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,380
Don't.

1263
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:56,510
Don't disappoint me, Newt.

1264
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,390
You of all people.

1265
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,060
Your honesty is a gift...

1266
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:07,770
even if at times a painful one.

1267
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,990
Our friends downstairs will be tired
and wanting to go home.

1268
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:18,280
You should... You should go.

1269
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:35,630
Albus, Lally said something earlier

1270
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,680
about most of us
being ultimately imperfect.

1271
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:44,100
But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...

1272
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,230
we can try to make things right.

1273
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,440
And that's what matters...

1274
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,660
trying.

1275
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,710
(soft music playing)

1276
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,840
We're with you.

1277
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,630
Thank you.

1278
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,940
Our time is close,
my brothers and sisters.

1279
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,860
Days of hiding are over.

1280
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,820
The world will hear our voice.

1281
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,660
And it will be deafening.

1282
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,580
(crowd cheering)

1283
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:51,710
You didn't come here
to betray Dumbledore...

1284
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,630
You know in your pure-blood heart...

1285
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,220
your place is here.

1286
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:04,180
To believe in me
is to believe in yourself.

1287
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,610
(suspenseful music playing)

1288
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:18,900
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

1289
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:22,410
(cheering continues)

1290
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:26,750
(footsteps)

1291
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,090
(water dripping)

1292
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:41,590
(muffled talking)

1293
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,550
Vulnera Sanentur.

1294
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:48,430
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1295
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:54,230
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1296
01:31:56,650 --> 01:32:02,160
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1297
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,660
(muffled whimper)

1298
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,950
There.

1299
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,540
(squeaking)

1300
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,000
There, there.

1301
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,290
There.

1302
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,880
Come, look.

1303
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:22,840
(Grindelwald) Hmm.

1304
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,850
This is why we are special.

1305
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:32,730
To conceal our powers
is not merely an affront to ourselves...

1306
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,690
it's sinful.

1307
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,570
(trills)

1308
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,780
(uneasy music playing)

1309
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,910
Was there another?

1310
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,380
(Credence) Another?

1311
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,670
That night, was there another Qilin?

1312
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:01,090
(tense music playing)

1313
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,470
I don't think so...

1314
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:06,850
That's twice you failed me.

1315
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:10,850
Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?

1316
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,560
(Credence breathes heavily)

1317
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,400
One last chance.

1318
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,230
Understood?

1319
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,530
Find it.

1320
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,280
(Qilin trilling)

1321
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,380
(purring)

1322
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,260
(magical music playing)

1323
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,930
(bird screams)

1324
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:08,120
(dramatic music playing)

1325
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
(door shuts)

1326
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,630
(Jacob whispering) Hey, Newt.

1327
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,090
What is this place?

1328
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:24,090
The room we require.

1329
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:32,060
I trust you all have the tickets
that Bunty gave you?

1330
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:34,640
You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.

1331
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:35,810
What do you think, Newt?

1332
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:37,560
Can you tell which one is yours?

1333
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,650
No.

1334
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,270
Good. I'd be worried if you could.

1335
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,610
(Lally) I assume
the Qilin's in one of these cases.

1336
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,780
(Dumbledore) Yes.

1337
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:46,740
- Well, which one is it?
- Which one indeed.

1338
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,450
Ooh, it's like
a three-card monte thing.

1339
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:51,370
Like a shell game thing.

1340
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:52,580
Like a short con.

1341
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,540
Never mind, it's a Muggle thing.

1342
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,000
Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers

1343
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,420
to get his hands on our rare friend.

1344
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,710
Therefore, it's essential that we keep

1345
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,970
whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing...

1346
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,140
so the Qilin
gets to the ceremony safely.

1347
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:16,060
If, by teatime, the Qilin,
not to mention all of us,

1348
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,810
are still alive,

1349
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,770
we should consider
our efforts a success.

1350
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:25,190
For the record, nobody ever died
playing three-card monte.

1351
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,610
An important distinction.

1352
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,580
All right, everybody choose a case
and we'll be on our way.

1353
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,330
Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.

1354
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:38,210
Me?

1355
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,920
Okay. (Sighs)

1356
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:47,630
(clears throat)

1357
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,720
(pensive music playing)

1358
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,926
I'm looking forward
to you educating me a little further

1359
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:13,660
on the finer points
of three-card monte.

1360
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:16,790
(Jacob) Mm.

1361
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,540
My pleasure.

1362
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,130
(gasps)

1363
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:28,010
Well, good luck, everybody.

1364
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,840
Good luck.

1365
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:35,680
And you too, Bunty girl.

1366
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,980
See you, Bunty.

1367
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:55,830
(Vogel) It is not lost

1368
01:36:55,910 --> 01:37:00,330
on those of us in leadership
that we are currently a world divided.

1369
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,040
Each day
brings talk of another conspiracy.

1370
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,840
Each hour another dark whisper.

1371
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,800
These whispers have
only increased in recent days

1372
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,720
with the addition of a third candidate.

1373
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:18,930
There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt

1374
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:25,230
that a worthy candidate exists amongst
the three you have been presented.

1375
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:26,820
(crowd murmuring)

1376
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,900
(menacing music playing)

1377
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,990
(crowd gasps)

1378
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:47,840
As every schoolboy and girl knows,

1379
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:54,390
the Qilin is the purest of creatures
in our wonderful magical world.

1380
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,970
It cannot be deceived.

1381
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:58,470
(soft gasps)

1382
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,140
Let the Qilin unite us.

1383
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:03,230
(menacing music continues)

1384
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,280
(crowd cheering in distance)

1385
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:23,410
(crowd chanting) Santos! Santos! Santos!

1386
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:33,630
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1387
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,340
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1388
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:39,430
(tense music playing)

1389
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,190
(swift whoosh)

1390
01:38:49,570 --> 01:38:50,570
Come.

1391
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,030
- (huffs)
- (whispering) Where to, next?

1392
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:58,320
(whispering)
Uh, this is where I leave you.

1393
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:01,200
I'm... I'm sorry, you're what?

1394
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,700
Leaving me?

1395
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:05,410
I have to meet someone else,
Mr. Kowalski.

1396
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,250
Not to worry...

1397
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:09,670
you'll be perfectly safe.

1398
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,880
(magical music playing)

1399
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,130
You don't have the Qilin.

1400
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:19,100
Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.

1401
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,930
One other thing,
if you don't mind me saying.

1402
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,520
You should stop doubting yourself.

1403
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,480
You have something most men
go their entire lives without.

1404
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,980
Do you know what that is?

1405
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,820
A heart that is full.

1406
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:36,700
Only a truly brave man

1407
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:41,740
could open himself up
so honestly and completely, as you do.

1408
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:43,790
(swift whoosh)

1409
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,840
(suspenseful music playing)

1410
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:01,970
(crowd continues chanting in distance)

1411
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,480
(ominous music plays)

1412
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,070
(crowd chanting) Santos! Santos! Santos!

1413
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:18,240
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1414
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
(tense music playing)

1415
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:40,180
(creatures chirping)

1416
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,390
(music crescendoing)

1417
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,190
(bells jingle)

1418
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:55,230
(all grunting)

1419
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,930
(creatures chirping)

1420
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:28,140
(wizard) Cases, please.

1421
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:30,230
(tense music playing)

1422
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:47,950
(Jacob) Hey, fellas.

1423
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,200
(both grunt)

1424
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:51,040
(Jacob exclaims)

1425
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,210
Woo-hoo-hoo.

1426
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:58,000
(chuckles) He's angry.

1427
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:17,110
Wait. Open them,
make sure it's in there.

1428
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:18,190
Idiots.

1429
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,190
(muffled banging)

1430
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,690
(muffled grunting)

1431
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:26,070
(suspenseful music playing)

1432
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,680
(buckles click)

1433
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,940
(chirring)

1434
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,440
(magical music playing)

1435
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:12,710
(rumbling)

1436
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:17,880
(all yelping)

1437
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,800
(yelling)

1438
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:26,590
- (books snarling)
- (grunting and groaning)

1439
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:32,640
(all yelping)

1440
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,400
(chuckles)

1441
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,060
- (books snarling)
- (grunting)

1442
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,070
(huffs)

1443
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:46,160
(tense music playing)

1444
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,870
- (thump)
- (wizard 1 grunts)

1445
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:52,750
- (thump)
- (wizards grunt)

1446
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,420
How long does he have?

1447
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,470
(phoenix cries)

1448
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:11,560
(mysterious music playing)

1449
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,650
(wistful music playing)

1450
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,530
(horn blaring in distance)

1451
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:36,120
(crowd chattering)

1452
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
Here. Hey. Hi.

1453
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,090
You're in danger, all right?

1454
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,760
- You need to leave.
- Well...

1455
01:44:52,930 --> 01:44:55,430
I can't... I can't go, okay?

1456
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,890
I can't come home.

1457
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,350
It's too late for me, all right?

1458
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,730
Some mistakes, they're just too big.

1459
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:02,820
- (breathing shakily)
- Can you listen to me?

1460
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:05,110
There's no time. I was followed.

1461
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:08,820
I gave 'em the slip, but it won't
be long before they find me.

1462
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:10,470
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't care.

1463
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:13,240
All I got is us.

1464
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:14,790
I make no sense without us.

1465
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:17,710
Jacob, what? Come on... (panting)

1466
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:19,750
I don't love you anymore.
Just get outta here.

1467
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:22,170
You're the worst liar in the world,
Queenie Goldstein.

1468
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,750
(bells jingling)

1469
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:24,920
You hear that?

1470
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,510
What? No.

1471
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,130
That's a sign.

1472
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,430
Oh, man.

1473
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,430
- Oh, come on.
- Come here, come here.

1474
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,180
Close your eyes.

1475
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,970
Please close your eyes.

1476
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,520
You know what Dumbledore said to me?

1477
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,150
No.

1478
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:44,110
He said that I got a full heart.

1479
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,570
He's wrong.

1480
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,870
I'm always
gonna have room in there for you.

1481
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,370
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1482
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:56,790
You know it.

1483
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:59,210
Look at me.

1484
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:03,710
Queenie Goldstein.

1485
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,300
(bells continue jingling)

1486
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,050
(Queenie sighs)

1487
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:14,140
(dramatic music playing)

1488
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,520
(crowd chattering)

1489
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,240
Mr. Scamander.

1490
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,160
We've never been properly introduced.

1491
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,160
Henrietta Fischer...

1492
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:17,870
Herr Vogel's attaché.

1493
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,040
(Newt) Ah. Yes, uh,

1494
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,040
hello.

1495
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,170
I can take you up.

1496
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,960
There's a private entrance
for members of the High Council.

1497
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,840
If you just follow me.

1498
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,550
I'm sorry, why would you do that?

1499
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,430
Take me up?

1500
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:36,470
(hesitates) Isn't it obvious?

1501
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,140
No, frankly, it's, uh, not.

1502
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,980
(horn blaring)

1503
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:45,600
(whispering) Dumbledore sent me.

1504
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:51,440
I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1505
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:54,530
(uneasy music playing)

1506
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:05,710
(thud)

1507
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:14,840
(Lally) He should be here any minute.

1508
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:21,520
(wind whistling)

1509
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,020
(suspenseful music playing)

1510
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,880
(uneasy music playing)

1511
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,690
(all grunting)

1512
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,070
What kept you?

1513
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,120
(swift whooshing)

1514
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:30,960
(crowd clamoring)

1515
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:37,220
(Vogel) I thank
the candidates for their words.

1516
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:43,640
Each represents a distinct vision
of how we will not shape only our world,

1517
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,230
but the non-magical world as well.

1518
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:52,730
Which brings us to the most important
part of our ceremony...

1519
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:55,030
the walk of the Qilin.

1520
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,240
(dramatic music playing)

1521
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,740
(crowd cheering)

1522
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:15,960
(chitters)

1523
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,260
(Qilin trills)

1524
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:24,930
(Qilin chitters)

1525
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:27,020
(menacing music playing)

1526
01:50:56,670 --> 01:50:58,090
(Qilin trills)

1527
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,760
(tense music playing)

1528
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:14,270
(dramatic music playing)

1529
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:19,990
(Qilin trills)

1530
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,830
The Qilin has seen.

1531
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:29,250
Seen goodness,

1532
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:31,790
strength...

1533
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:36,540
qualities essential
to lead and to guide us.

1534
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,380
Who do you see?

1535
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:43,680
- (all cheering)
- (thrilling music playing)

1536
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:00,990
Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader
of the magical world...

1537
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:02,780
by acclamation.

1538
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,290
(cheering continues)

1539
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:31,850
(Newt gasps)

1540
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,950
This is the man
who tried to take my life.

1541
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:50,240
This man, who has no magic...

1542
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,290
who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood,

1543
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:57,580
create a forbidden union
that would make us less...

1544
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,420
make us weak, like his kind.

1545
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,170
He's not alone, my friends.

1546
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,760
There are thousands
who seek to do the same.

1547
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:13,890
There can only be one response
to such vermin.

1548
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,740
No.

1549
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:26,820
- (Queenie gasps)
- (crowd cheering)

1550
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,580
- Crucio.
- (Jacob groans)

1551
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:30,740
No!

1552
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:33,290
(Queenie whimpering)

1553
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:35,040
Make him stop!

1554
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:40,670
Our war with the Muggles begins today.

1555
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:42,380
(crowd cheering)

1556
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:50,430
(strained grunting)

1557
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:51,680
(pants)

1558
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,520
(grunts, panting)

1559
01:53:58,230 --> 01:53:59,980
- (sighs)
- Jacob.

1560
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:02,070
(mystical music playing)

1561
01:54:13,450 --> 01:54:14,870
(wind whooshes)

1562
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,900
(Credence) He's lying to you.

1563
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:46,780
That creature is dead.

1564
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,330
- (crowd gasps)
- (whispers) Not now. Wait.

1565
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:02,280
(Newt) He did it to trick you.

1566
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:05,500
He killed it and bewitched it

1567
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:08,300
so that
you might think him worthy to lead.

1568
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,850
But he doesn't want to lead you.

1569
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:17,430
He just wants you to follow.

1570
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:19,350
Words.

1571
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:23,150
Words designed to deceive.

1572
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:26,126
To make you doubt what you've seen
with your own two eyes.

1573
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,756
(Newt) There were two Qilins
born that night.

1574
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,030
A twin.
And I know that...

1575
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:32,570
I know that...

1576
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:33,780
Because?

1577
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,370
Because you have no proof.

1578
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:43,330
Because there was no second Qilin.

1579
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:46,090
Am I not right?

1580
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:47,356
Its mother had been killed, it...

1581
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,920
Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander?

1582
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:17,950
No one can know everything, Newt.

1583
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,250
Remember?

1584
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:30,260
- (suitcase opening)
- (suspenseful music playing)

1585
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:36,550
(Newt breathes shakily)

1586
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,140
(chitters)

1587
01:56:41,230 --> 01:56:42,230
(purring)

1588
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:50,990
(man) I don't get it.

1589
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:57,450
(ethereal music playing)

1590
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:03,120
(Qilin trilling)

1591
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:05,540
(Newt) She can't hear you, little one.

1592
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:06,960
(Qilin chitters)

1593
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,460
Not here...

1594
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,670
but perhaps somewhere she's listening.

1595
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:18,560
(Vogel) This is the true Qilin.

1596
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:21,060
Look at it...

1597
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:23,730
you can see it with your own eyes.

1598
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:26,230
- This is the true...
- (crying)

1599
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,360
(crowd murmurs)

1600
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:32,990
This can't be allowed to stand.

1601
01:57:33,070 --> 01:57:34,650
The vote must be taken again.

1602
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:38,240
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1603
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,250
(chitters)

1604
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,670
(trilling)

1605
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:05,810
(sniffing)

1606
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:07,770
(Dumbledore) You...

1607
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,110
No, no, no, please.

1608
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:13,650
(tender music playing)

1609
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:17,320
(trills)

(purrs)

1612
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:37,340
I'm honored.

1613
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:41,640
But just as two of you
were born that night,

1614
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:45,020
there's another here, equally worthy.

1615
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,310
I'm certain of it.

1616
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:53,440
(Qilin trills)

1617
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:56,240
(sniffs, trills)

1618
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,120
(chittering)

1619
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,160
Thank you.

1620
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:14,460
(chittering)

1621
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,430

(music intensifying)

1624
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:03,640
(high-pitched humming)

1625
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:07,640
(tense music playing)

1626
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:18,240
(rumbling)

1627
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:22,620
(tense music continues)

(heartbeat thudding)

(high-pitched humming)

1638
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:59,710
Who will love you now, Dumbledore?

1639
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,220
You're all alone.

1640

(soft music playing)

1643
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:56,730
I was never your enemy.

1644
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:06,780
Then, or now.

1645
02:03:25,590 --> 02:03:27,590
(somber music playing)

1646
02:03:47,650 --> 02:03:49,660
Did you ever think of me?

1647
02:03:52,330 --> 02:03:53,580
Always.

1648
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,340
Come home.

- Here she is.
- (trills)

1653
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,930
Well done, Bunty.

(both chuckle)

Come on, little one.

1656
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,150
I'm sorry.
I must have given you an awful fright.

1657
02:05:05,230 --> 02:05:06,440
No, I think, um...

1658
02:05:06,530 --> 02:05:10,610
sometimes it takes losing something
to realize quite how much it means.

1659
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:15,660
And sometimes you just...

1660
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:21,210
Sometimes you just know.

1661
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:22,750
(Qilin purrs)

1662
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:33,550
- (chitters)
- Right, in you pop.

1663
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:37,850
Mr. Kowalski.

1664
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:41,190
I owe you an apology.

1665
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:45,820
It... It was never my intent
for you to suffer the Cruciatus curse.

1666
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,070
Yeah...

1667
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:50,530
well, you know, we got Queenie back,
so we're square.

1668
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:52,660
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1669
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:55,160
- Can I keep this?
- (chuckles)

1670
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,910
For, like, old times' sake?

1671
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:03,080
I can't think of anyone more deserving.

1672
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:07,040
Thanks, Professor.

1673
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:09,090
(wistful music playing)

1674
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:21,230
(Dumbledore sighs)

1675
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:28,860
Remarkable.

1676
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:29,780
But how?

1677
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,466
I thought you couldn't
move against one another.

1678
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:32,650
We didn't.

1679
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:36,200
He sought to kill, I sought to protect.

1680
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,120
Our spells met.

1681
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,540
Let's call it fate.

1682
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:46,290
After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?

1683
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:49,420
(Theseus) Albus.

1684
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,800
Promise me.

1685
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:57,140
You'll find him and you'll stop him.

1686
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,560
(wistful music continues)

1687
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:27,880
(Jacob) Albert,
don't forget the pierogis.

1688
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:29,290
(Albert) Yes, Mr. K.

1689
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,000
Albert.

1690
02:07:31,090 --> 02:07:33,170
No more than eight minutes
on the kolaczkis.

1691
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,300
Yes, Mr. K.

1692
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,470
He's a sweet kid.

1693
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:39,010
He doesn't know the difference
between paszteciki and golabki.

1694
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:40,286
- Hey, sweetheart.
- (shouts) What?

1695
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:41,946
Newt doesn't know
what you're talking about.

1696
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:43,456
I don't know what you're talking about.

1697
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,480
And you are not working today, remember?

1698
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,850
- (Jacob) Oh!
- (Queenie giggles)

1699
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,770
Oh, are you all right, honey?

1700
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:51,876
Oh, you're nervous about the speech.
Don't be nervous.

1701
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:52,940
Tell him, honey.

1702
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:54,166
Don't be nervous about the speech.

1703
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:55,070
- I'm not nervous.
- (Jacob sniffs)

1704
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:57,280
What is the smell?
Why is there burning?

1705
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,780
- Albert?
- (Queenie chuckles)

1706
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:00,830
(song playing on speaker)

1707
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:03,910
Mm. Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?

1708
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,830
I can't imagine
what you're talking about.

1709
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,080
(Queenie) Mm-hmm.

1710
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:09,920
(chuckles)

1711
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:15,170
(bell jingles)

1712
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:23,270
So, the day that I first met Jacob...

1713
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:24,350
Uh...

1714
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,850
The day that I first met Jacob,

1715
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:28,230
we were both
sitting in the Steen National Bank.

1716
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:31,270
Never would I...

1717
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,400
(romantic music playing)

1718
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:47,790
The maid of honor, I presume?

1719
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:52,130
The best man, I gather?

1720
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,300
- You've done something to your hair.
- No.

1721
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:57,880
Oh.

1722
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:01,850
Well, yes, actually, just...

1723
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:02,970
Just for tonight.

1724
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:04,680
- Well, it suits you.
- Thank you, Newt.

1725
02:09:06,230 --> 02:09:07,230
(laughs)

1726
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:09,020
(Theseus clears throat)

1727
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,350
Oh.

1728
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,640
- (Theseus) Hello.
- (Lally) Hi.

1729
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:12,810
Look who's...

1730
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:14,270
Hi.

1731
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,320
So good to see you.

1732
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,780
- Hi.
- How are you?

1733
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:20,070
You look wonderful, Lally.

1734
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:22,410
Well, thank you, Newt. I appreciate it.

1735
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:23,530
Good luck.

1736
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:24,620
Tina, come on.

1737
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:26,806
- You must tell me how MACUSA's been.
- See you inside.

1738
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:28,250
- (door opens)
- (bell jingles)

1739
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,750
- What about me? How do I look?
- (chuckles)

1740
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:36,590
- You all right?
- You look fine.

1741
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:37,670
You okay?

1742
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:38,720
Yeah, I'm all right.

1743
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,130
You're not nervous, are you?

1744
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:44,600
Can't be nervous about
a speech after saving the world. Hmm.

1745
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:48,270
- (door opens)
- (bell jingles)

1746
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:50,390
(door closes)

1747
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,450
(Newt sighs)

1748
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:03,200
It's a historic day.

1749
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:09,120
Where once was before,
there will now be after.

1750
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:15,880
Funny how historic days seem so ordinary
when you're living them.

1751
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,566
Well, perhaps that's what happens
when the world gets things right.

1752
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:22,720
Mm, it's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.

1753
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,890
(chuckles)

1754
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:28,640
I didn't know if I'd see you here.

1755
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,140
I wasn't sure you would, either.

1756
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:32,536
- (door opens)
- (Queenie) Hey, Newt.

1757
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,560
Yes.

1758
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:35,560
Jacob seems to think he's lost the ring.

1759
02:10:35,650 --> 02:10:36,820
Please tell me you've got it.

1760
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,820
No, it's all good. Yep.

1761
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:40,150
(Queenie chuckles) Whew!

1762
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,960
- That scared me. Jacob!
- (Pick chattering)

1763
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:43,990
(Newt chuckles)

1764
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:45,740
Good man, Pick.

1765
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,500
I should probably, um...

1766
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:55,420
Thank you, Newt.

1767
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,170
What for?

1768
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,760
Pick your poison.

1769
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:04,550
I really
couldn't have done it without you.

1770
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:13,850
(sniffs) I'd do it again, by the way.

1771
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:17,190
Should you ask.

1772
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:33,540
Okay.

1773
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:36,830
(Jacob) Hey.

1774
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,960
(muffled chatter)

1775
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,640
(laughter)

1776
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,920
- (Lally) Hey!
- (Bunty) Hello!

1777
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,560
(Lally) Bunty!

1778
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:52,930
(in sing-song voice) Bunty!

1779
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:54,850
(soft music playing)

1780
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:56,940
(footsteps approach slowly)

1781
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:12,700
(Queenie chuckles softly)

1782
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:15,750
(whispers) Wow, you're so beautiful.

1783
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,670
(Queenie) Oh.

1784
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:25,430
I can't believe it.

1785
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,260
(muffled chatter and laughter)

1786
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,360
(soft music continues)

1787
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:47,700
(Newt) This is, um...
This is Albert.

1788
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:49,370
I don't know if you've met Albert, yet?

1789
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:50,830
Have you met Lally?

1790
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:54,410
(laughter and chatter continue)

1791
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:57,170
(soft music continues)

1792
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:17,100
(dramatic music playing)

1793
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:34,950
(romantic song playing)

1794
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:36,870
You make a wish

1795
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:40,790
You cast a spell You hope

1796
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:44,290
An angel rings a bell

1797
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:46,790
You find yourself

1798
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:51,840
Still in love with love

1799
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:58,850
You pull the petals from the stem

1800
02:15:59,270 --> 02:16:03,600
You pray that you'll be her and him

1801
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:07,520
You hope for some sweet message

1802
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:10,940
From above

1803
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:17,990
How did you come down from heaven?

1804
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:23,250
I'm glad that you came down from heaven

1805
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:26,500
Did you tumble down?

1806
02:16:26,830 --> 02:16:31,260
Did you hit the ground real hard?

1807
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:37,390
How did you get here, my dear?

1808
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:42,680
It isn't very clear, my dear

1809
02:16:43,310 --> 02:16:49,730
When your hand meets mine
It is so divine, my dear

1810
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:56,030
Love can heal the sting of pain

1811
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,950
Purify just like the rain

1812
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:04,620
Wash your tears away

1813
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:08,790
And dry them in the sun

1814
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:15,510
How did you get here, my dear?

1815
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:19,890
It isn't very clear, my dear

1816
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:24,230
