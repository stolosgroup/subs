00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,700
Now, pay attention,

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,249
'cause I'm about to tell you
the secret to life.

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,060
You ready?

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,529
The whole damn thing is about decisions,

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,220
little, seemingly insignificant decisions

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,940
that clear the road
for monster truck life-altering ones.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,300
You see, every path you take
leads to another choice,

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,020
and some choices can change everything.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,968
Every damn moment of the rest
of your life hangs on them.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,340
And, boy, do I got a choice I got to make.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,780
Dr. Fulton, please call
the admitting office at 325.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,580
Are those for someone special?

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,020
Someone who deserves
the stars and the moon.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,521
All I got are these damn flowers.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,980
- I'm just here to talk to her.
- You go right ahead, Travis.

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,700
If that's what you need.
If that will help.

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,900
Too easy on me, Ryan.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,321
You're too hard on you, Travis.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,260
Whoa!

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,780
They were bred to protect the Arctic
villagers from bear and wolf attacks.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,260
You are so full of crap.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,940
You kiss your mama with that pottymouth?

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,420
I don't know how he does it.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,140
What do you mean? It's his gift.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,966
You know all about Star Wars
and Travis is good with the ladies.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,300
We're all dealt a hand.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,845
Them dogs live in the tundra.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,420
They don't swim in the water.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,540
You couldn't get that dog in the water
for an F-150 full of Milk-Bones

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,740
driven by Lassie wearing a two-piece,

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,820
even if it's a little gold one like that.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,340
So you're saying this dog fights bears
and wolves, but he's afraid of the water.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,260
I see what you're doing.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,100
You're sassing me,
and that's just 'cause you like me.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,820
That's schoolyard 101.
It happens all the time.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,500
Need I remind you,
I let you take Marcie Hoffman

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,860
to the Azalea Fest in seventh grade?

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,220
- You let me? Ha!
- I let you.

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,129
Would you two shut up and help me down?

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,340
Or would you prefer to watch me slip
and crack my skull?

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,780
Oh, excuse me. Look who's sassypants.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,486
You keep that up, there's liable to be
some hair-pulling around here.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,446
Hey, Travis.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,220
Hiya, Monica.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,049
Excuse me, ladies.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,567
You got time to grab a beer
before y'all take off?

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,220
Well, I got to get
these knuckleheads home.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,940
Just one quick beer.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,860
It'll be really fast, I promise.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,086
All right.

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,540
I don't think you and I
have ever had just one.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,483
- Bye, boys.
- Bye, Monica.

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,620
She's back.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,700
Just like a boomerang.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,041
Unbelievable.

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,540
Don't you start.

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,900
Can I just say one thing?

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,180
If that one thing is "boomerang,"

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,487
I'm going to tie an anchor to your nuts
and throw it overboard.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,980
Boomerang!

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,081
Hey!

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,940
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,260
Hey!

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,740
- Hey, hey!
- Hi!

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,820
Look alive, fellas. Here come your wives.

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,940
Y'all better start talking.

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,660
We were about to call the Coast Guard.

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,620
We got into some mackerel
about three miles out.

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,846
They were jumping in the boat.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,380
- Uh-huh.
- Price tag, bro.

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,448
Come on, kids. Let's go.

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,660
Guarantee they've been
at Dockside since noon.

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,340
Eh, more fun to let them think
they're getting away with something.

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,420
- Mobe!
- Where is that damn dog?

84
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,740
Useless!

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
This looks great, Travis. Thank you.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,204
You're welcome!

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,300
Aah!

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,811
See what he does to me?

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,220
Whoa!

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,500
Someone bring me a plate.

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,980
Y'all just have a good time.

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,060
Just kiss on each other
and just laugh it up.

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,900
I'll just be slaving away over here
over the grill like Cinderella.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,180
Hey, turn up the music!

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,580
Your burgers are burnt.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,420
I'm not cutting down that damn tree!

97
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,700
I grilled. Y'all are cleaning.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,980
Boy, get out of there.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,060
Fish guts gonna make you sick.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,580
- Good night.
- Good night.

101
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,260
- Night, Travis.
- Night.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,647
Put this on. Put this on.

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,041
Hey, Molly.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,740
Do you know how many liters of blood

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,740
the circulatory system
processes per day on average?

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,820
Oh, my God! Twenty! That's right!

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,446
Good girl. You got that right.

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,089
Oh, Mol. How you feeling, honey?

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,100
Swollen nipples,
distended abdomen, lethargic behavior.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,820
Oh, my God, this isn't happening.

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,460
This is like Dirty Dancing all over again.

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,940
Oh! No, he did not!

113
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,088
♪ Bam-ba-lam, she said,
"I'm worried outta my mind"

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
♪ Bam-ba-lam, the damn thing gone blind...

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
Excuse me. Hello!

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,460
Yeah, hi. Hello.

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,100
Sorry. Um, music's a little loud.
I didn't hear you.

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,980
Yes, it was. It is so loud...

119
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,580
Hey, you're my new neighbor, aren't you?

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,860
I've seen you over there watching me.

121
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,100
- Watching you?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,568
Oh, my God. Wow. I was not watching you.

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,260
You live 100 yards away.
Where am I supposed to look?

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,260
I'm just kidding with you.
I'm just playing.

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,300
- That is funny.
- What do you say we start over?

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,900
Uh, why don't you have a seat...

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,220
I do not want a seat, thank you.

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,820
- Would you like a beer?
- I'm fine.

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,020
Come on, have a beer. We got, uh...

130
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,740
I do not want that. Thank you.

131
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,980
All right. Well, I'm Travis.

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,780
And the rug there, that's Moby.

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,564
- Yeah.
- And, um...

134
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,500
I think this is the point in the
conversation where you tell me your name.

135
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,220
Oh, you do, do you?

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,845
Well, no.

137
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,540
Okay.

138
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,768
Uh, all right.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,940
Fine. Um... you know,
there's a certain type of woman

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,740
that usually shows up here after 10:00.

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,180
She's wearing ratty sweatpants, no makeup,
and she's usually only after one thing.

142
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,408
Oh, my God.

143
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,740
Are you implying I'm here for sex?

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,100
- You are, aren't you?
- Oh, my God.

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,420
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,260
Could you be any more obnoxious?

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,980
- Lady, you have no idea.
- Lady! Stop calling me "lady".

148
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,900
- Then tell me your name.
- It is Gabby.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,700
Hello, Gabby. Welcome to the neighborhood.

150
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,900
What are you so angry about?

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,287
I am angry about Molly's nipples.

152
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,740
Your stinky-ass dog took advantage
of my sweet little girl.

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,100
Now her nipples are swollen
and she's gained 15 pounds.

154
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,283
She will not get out of bed,
and you play your music too loud!

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,220
So you're saying
that Moby there knocked up your dog?

156
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,700
Oh, I know Moby there knocked up my dog.

157
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,180
He wanders the neighborhood
day and night unsupervised.

158
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,940
He has been wearing her down
since the moment that we moved in.

159
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,940
- Wearing her down?
- That's right. You're responsible.

160
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,580
That's right, this is my fault.

161
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,660
It's all my fault.
I take full responsibility.

162
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,540
I've talked to him so many times
about using protection.

163
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,820
Don't patronize me.

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,420
- Oh, my God, you are...
- I'm sorry.

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,820
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,020
Look, you're right. This is serious.

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,260
This is serious. Um, how long do we have?

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,260
I mean, how far along is she?

169
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,260
Oh, God. This is so funny to you.

170
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,380
It's a little funny, yeah.

171
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,740
Well, I'm not exactly sure, because
I haven't taken her to the vet yet.

172
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,260
So how do you even know she's pregnant?

173
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,740
Because I'm a medical student
and I'm also a woman.

174
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,100
The second I knew, the first one is...

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,220
- Oh, you did?
- ...new information.

176
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,367
Oh, you're so smart.

177
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,540
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

178
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,700
Well, I like your confidence.

179
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,980
And there happens to be
a fantastic clinic right here in town.

180
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,660
It's kind of a father-son thing.

181
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,940
- Okay.
- And I want you to know,

182
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,180
Moby is not going to be a deadbeat dad.

183
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,780
He's... this is not going to be one
of them Dirty Dancing type situations.

184
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,060
Okay.

185
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,260
He's going to stand up
straight like a man.

186
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,220
Hey. Somebody say Dirty Dancing?

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,765
Oh.

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,260
- Oh, my God.
- I'll be inside

189
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,260
eating the rest of the mint chip.

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,601
- I'll get you the card.
- You know, I'm good.

191
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,860
I can probably figure this out...

192
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,020
- No, for the vet.
- ...on my own.

193
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,300
Good night!

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,180
♪ Bam-ba-lam, and she's always ready

195
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,169
♪ Bam-ba-lam, whoa-oh, Black Betty...

196
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,620
Who was that?

197
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,140
Nobody. It's a new neighbor.

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,060
Already bothering the heck out of me.

199
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,650
Where's the damn ice cream?

200
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,900
Uh-oh.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,525
What?

202
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,220
I'll tell you later.

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,163
Dad says hi.

204
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,369
Our patients respond to you, Gabby.

205
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,060
Thank you, doctor. Don't thank me.

206
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,740
Just make sure you stay put
after you finish your boards.

207
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,380
Now, you're going to get
all kinds of offers.

208
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,660
You just remember
who gave you your big break.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,540
Good morning, Dr. McCarthy.

210
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,928
Afternoon, Dr. McCarthy.

211
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,260
Well, I'm off to lunch.
Oh, Ryan, by the way,

212
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,260
your mama needs a headcount for tonight.

213
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,620
Are you gonna bring
that lovely lady of yours?

214
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,940
Of course. Let us know
if we need to bring anything.

215
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,980
- All right.
- Bye.

216
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,500
Gabby, I'd like to have a word in private.

217
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,660
Yeah.

218
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,020
Dr. Richards to post-anesthesia.

219
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,060
Why did you tell your dad
I was coming for dinner tonight?

220
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,660
I have to study.

221
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,780
Because I'm selfish
and I want what I want.

222
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,660
Now tell me, why are you staying
all the way out there on the Sound

223
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,940
instead of on this side of the bridge where
I can keep you handcuffed to my side?

224
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,340
For your own safety
and well-being, of course.

225
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,620
That is why. That!

226
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,740
I have to study for these boards.

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,446
Hey, I would get nothing done otherwise.

228
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,300
Hi.

229
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,845
You must be Molly.

230
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,580
Which would make this little girl Gabby.

231
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,300
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

232
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,940
No, no. I'm Gabby. She's Molly.

233
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,260
- Oh.
- Yeah.

234
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,540
I'm sorry we're late.

235
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,140
There was an emergency at work.

236
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,940
Don't worry, honey, I've heard it all.

237
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,281
Just admit you were off knocking boots
with somebody's husband.

238
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,140
Oh, I'm teasing.

239
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,980
Oh, my goodness,
you should see the look on your face.

240
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,060
Oh, yeah.

241
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,380
Laura, are you giving
this young lady grief?

242
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,500
Oh, well, I couldn't help myself.

243
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,460
You know me, how I get on Mondays.

244
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,140
For the record, I had no idea
how she gets on Mondays.

245
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,969
- Okay.
- I'm Shep.

246
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,620
- You want to follow me back?
- Yeah, sure.

247
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm counting three nuggets,
so congratulations.

248
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,980
In a month, you're gonna be a grandma.

249
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,220
But I'm too young!

250
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,500
Yeah, well, these things happen.
We'll help you through it.

251
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,980
You have any idea who
the responsible party might be?

252
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,060
Ha! Responsible?

253
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,940
That word doesn't even belong
in the same zip code as this guy.

254
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
I meant the dog.

255
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh. Right. Yes.

256
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,620
Well, apple doesn't fall far.

257
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,900
I have it on good information
that the suspect in question

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,020
was neutered seven months ago, Pop.

259
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,780
You? And you?

260
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,380
It's awful cavalier of you to point
fingers at poor, sweet, innocent Moby,

261
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,460
considering six months ago he was
in a shelter set to be put down.

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,580
Now, I didn't save his life so he
could suffer undeserved persecution.

263
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,060
And you'd think as a medical student

264
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,460
you'd be a little more familiar
with basic anatomy.

265
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,609
You know, no balls, no babies.

266
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,140
- Are you two, like...
- No. Hell, no.

267
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,260
No. Eww. Gross!

268
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,940
Doc Shep, Miss Norcross is here.

269
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,441
Apparently her tabby is possessed again.

270
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,900
She needs you to do
that exorcism thing you do.

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,445
Just when it was getting good.

272
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,660
- You tricked me.
- No, no, no.

273
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,140
I just having a little fun.

274
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,129
You showed up in my yard all upset.

275
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,540
And then my sister shows up...

276
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,660
- Oh, your sister?
- Yeah, I told you.

277
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,140
Ratty sweatpants, no makeup.

278
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,087
- Yeah, only after one thing.
- Yeah, to raid my icebox.

279
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,340
No apology necessary.

280
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,060
Good, because none was offered.

281
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,731
Damn, lady. Gabby.

282
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,140
You know, you threw some pretty
big stones in my direction the other night.

283
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,500
Calling my dog stink-ass...

284
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,740
Yeah, well, that stink-ass and you
interrupted my study

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,820
with all that barking
and that awful music you play.

286
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,365
It's annoying.

287
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,420
And for that, we apologize.

288
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,660
Accepted.

289
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,321
Oh, you are one difficult lady.

290
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,300
What do you say we settle this
over a drink at Dockside?

291
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,180
Ha! Okay. No.

292
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,180
♪ And in the corners of my mind

293
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,060

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,220
Monica, hey! We're over here.

302
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,420
Man, they've been
on and off since high school.

303
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,020
He ain't ever gonna commit.

304
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

305
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,340
- Hey! Good to see you.
- How are you? Hey, guys.

306
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,620
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

307
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,007
- Hi.
- So...

308
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,180
...who wants to play Squirt the Jerk?

309
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,620
Would you like to squirt a jerk?

310
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,940
- Sure, let's go.
- Squirt the Jerk.

311
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,500
All right, here we go to Squirt the Jerk!

312
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,940
All right! Come on. Here we go now.

313
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,620
You're almost there. Whoa!

314
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,260
He's all yours!

315
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,180
That's it. Squirt the jerk!

316
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,260
You've done it!
Oh, we've got ourselves a winner!

317
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,060
Oh! Come on!

318
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,845
Congratulations, darling.
Everyone did a nice job.

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,460
You want to go next?

320
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,620
- Let's get a candy apple.
- Candy apple?

321
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,900
- Will you buy me one?
- You want candy or caramel?

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,300
I should have run away and become a carny.

323
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,323
You are a carny.

324
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,860
Remember the other night in the kitchen?

325
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,660
When I said, "Uh-oh"?

326
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah.

327
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,060
As in, "Uh-oh... you just met your wife."

328
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,083
I'm just gonna give you some...

329
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,931
Well, look who it is.

330
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,700
Wow. Can't seem to get away from you.

331
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,220
Yeah, I was gonna walk on by,
but he wanted to say hello

332
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,340
and meet the new doctor and...

333
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,580
Well, I'm not technically a doctor yet,
but it is a pleasure, Mr. Monkey.

334
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,251
- Hello!
- Hello!

335
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,660
Turns out you were right.

336
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,700
We do need tickets for the bigger rides.

337
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,860
Ryan, this is Travis.

339
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,169
He's my vet.

340
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,700
And, Travis,
this is Ryan McCarthy, my boyfriend.

341
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,100
Nice to meet you, Ryan.

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,380
Hey, you want to ride
that rusty old Cyclone?

343
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,860
I heard it only killed
four people this year.

344
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,380
- Hi.
- Hey.

345
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,380
Monica, this is Gabby and Ryan.

346
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,740
- And this is Monica.
- Hi.

347
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,980
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

348
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,180
It's a pleasure to meet you.

349
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,980
- Hello.
- How are you?

350
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,980
- You're the vet here in Wrightsville.
- That's right.

351
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,300
My father's been going there for years.

352
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,740
I see the resemblance.

353
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,180
Dr. McCarthy. He's got two pugs.

354
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,860
- That's right.
- Yeah, he does.

355
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,660
All right, folks.

356
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,580
We're going to let some
rusty carnival ride maim us.

357
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,820
- So...
- Fun.

358
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,700
...y'all have a good night.

359
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,700
- Ryan, it was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys. Bye.

360
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,610
- Bye.
- Gabby, see you back at the ranch.

361
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,620
He's... he's also my neighbor.

362
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,340
Yeah. I know.

363
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,140
Um, should we go on those bumper cars?

364
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,605
- Yes.
- Let's do it, right?

365
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,484
Let's go. Come on.

366
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,524
Hey!

367
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,500
Hey, girl.

368
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,728
Made you something.

369
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,725
Don't work too hard.

370
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,180
What the hell you looking at?

371
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,460
- Hi.
- Hey, hey!

372
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,891
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

373
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,180
Is this how you hold it, honey?

374
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,580
Yeah, sweetie. You got it.

375
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,364
Okay, here it goes.

376
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,740
What in the world?

377
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,380
That's my girl. Whoo!

378
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,140
- I do believe we've been hustled.
- Speak for yourself.

379
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,180
I knew she was holding back 'cause...

380
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,420
Look at her. She's got that look.

381
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,940
Okay, I'll come clean.

382
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,260
I've actually been playing
since I was nine.

383
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,860
I told you.

384
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,860
We had three holes on the property
where I grew up with a water hazard.

385
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,340
With a water hazard, see?

386
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,260
- Gracious.
- I got kind of good.

387
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,580
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

388
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,060
Don't you have a flight to catch, doctor?

389
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,620
- Oh.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,260
Can't somebody else go supervise
the Atlanta opening?

391
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,420
Who would you suggest, Maryanne?

392
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,100
After all, our name is on the door.

393
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,100
I just have to go shake a few hands.

394
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,460
Make sure the ship is sailing straight.

395
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,860
Be back in a few weeks.

396
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,860
- I know.
- You better stay away

397
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,580
from all those pretty interns, hear?

398
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,500
You remember that one back up in Charleston
that couldn't keep her hands off of you?

399
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,460
Sure do. I'm going to marry her one day.

400
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,620
Oh. Oh, really?

401
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,940
Well, who knows? Two or three years,
maybe Gabby and Ryan will be opening

402
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,460
that Savannah facility together.

403
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,340
- I should get going.
- Oh, look at that time!

404
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,647
See, I knew that would do it.

405
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
Thanks.

406
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,402
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

407
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,020
So, seems like you and Monica

408
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,900
are picking up right where
you left off, huh?

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,580
- Don't make a thing out of it.
- I'm not making a thing out of it.

410
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,700
- You are.
- I'm just saying,

411
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,020
seems like maybe she's
sticking around this time.

412
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,540
Mmm.

413
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm sure you know
she rented a place on the mainland,

414
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,820
but did you know she planted herself
a vegetable garden?

415
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,780
- Did she now?
- Ordered cable.

416
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,087
- Premium cable.
- Ooh.

417
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,820
That means something.

418
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,740
It means she can eat a salad
and watch Animal Planet.

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,500
Mm-hmm.

420
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,140
Why are you busting my chops about this?

421
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,500
I feel like if anybody'd
be into it, it'd be you.

422
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,380
Hey, I love Monica.

423
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,082
If y'all ended up together,
I'd be totally happy.

424
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,180
But?

425
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,020
I know you.

426
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,451
What's that supposed to mean?

427
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,620
Remember what Mommy used to say
about opportunity?

428
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,700
She said opportunity
is missed by most people

429
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,500
because it's dressed up in overalls
and it looks a lot like work.

430
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,380
No, Thomas Edison said that, not Mama.

431
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,660
And I thought you were in grad school.

432
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,091
Shut up.

433
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,780
I'm just saying maybe instead of overalls,

434
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,928
your opportunity is dressed up
in green hospital scrubs

435
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,940
and lives about 100 feet
from your back door.

436
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,140
But it is work, and my big brother
does not like it

437
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,580
when things don't come easy.

438
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,648
How dare you?

439
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,728
I ought to squirt you
in the eye with this lemon.

440
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,529
- Drop it.
- Don't.

441
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,961
No. You won't. Aah!

442
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,125
Hi. Can you... can you open?

443
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,220
Uh, puppies!

444
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh, you're half dressed.

445
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,220
You're naked.

446
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,340
Um, but puppies. Thank you.

447
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,727
Oh, sorry.
Something's wrong. She's in pain.

448
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,169
- Gabby?
- Yeah?

449
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,326
We're all good now.

450
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,648
She's been asking for you. Come on.

451
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,540
She was crying and vomiting.

452
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,740
She had a uterine prolapse.

453
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,060
Oh.

454
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,288
Oh, I knew something was wrong.

455
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,740
You were in so much pain.

456
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,128
Hey, Molly. You're a mama.

457
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,380
What am I going to do with all you guys?

458
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,180
Whatever you do, don't name them.

459
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,380
Makes it harder
to put them up for adoption.

460
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,460
Okay.

461
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,140
And you should probably build them a pen.

462
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,540
I'd be happy to help you, if you'd like.

463
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,380
I mean, unless Ryan wants to.

464
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,740
Uh, no. He's out of town for a few weeks.

465
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,561
But I am a handy gal,
so I can figure it out.

466
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,540
Well, I should probably
take her in to monitor her.

467
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,940
What? To the clinic?

468
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,140
- Now?
- Yeah.

469
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,380
But it's 2:00 AM.

470
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,020
It's 3:00 AM.

471
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,900
I thought you just said she was okay.

472
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,380
Hang on. I did. She's doing good.

473
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,980
It's just a precaution.

474
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,580
- Is that necessary?
- Well, most precautions aren't.

475
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,923
- It's why we call them precautions.
- Wow. You're being smug.

476
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,300
No, no. I'm being honest.

477
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,220
That's smug. You're so smug! Oh, wow.

478
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,881
Good Lord, you bother me to no end.

479
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,260
Wait. Where will you sleep?

480
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm not going to sleep.

481
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,020
I'm like an owl.

482
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,500
They're gonna be all right.

483
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,420
Thank you, Travis.

484
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,900
I think that's the first time
you said my name.

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,047
I like it.

486
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,620
Good night.

487
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,100
Good night. Good night.

488
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,247
Okay.

489
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,980
Must be pretty.

490
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,605
Hmm?

491
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,940
If you see a man sleeping on a cold floor,

492
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,249
there's sure to be
a beautiful woman nearby.

493
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,780
Well, Miss Alice,
I hear John Cougar Mellencamp

494
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,940
is scratching himself something terrible.

495
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,700
Why don't you come on back?
We'll take a look-see.

496
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,140
Oh. Okay.

497
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,220
But Shep knows him so well,
I don't mind waiting.

498
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,500
Yeah. We're all full up today.

499
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,780
Shep's busy, so you're just
going to have to deal with me.

500
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,803
Come on back. Come on, bud!

501
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,500
- Back on your right.
- Okay.

502
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,931
Come on. Yeah!

503
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,900
- Hey!
- Hi.

504
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,980
If I were you, I'd build a pen
in either the garage or the laundry.

505
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,923
And for God's sake, don't give them names.

506
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,180
You and Travis have exactly
the same shtick. You know that?

507
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,282
Yeah, well, I don't know
whether he gets it from me

508
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,700
or I get it from him sometimes.

509
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,060
There's nothing cuter
than puppies in a basket.

510
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,340
Got the goods, doc.

511
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,380
- Good.
- Can we trust her?

512
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,380
Yeah, come on.
Let's not make a thing out of it.

513
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,766
What the hell you doing?

514
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,340
What's it look like?

515
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,700
Well, it looks like you're swapping out
a dead lizard for a live lizard.

516
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,940
Yeah, that's right.

517
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,980
Is that for that little girl out there?

518
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,340
Yeah.

519
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,100
Don't you think there's a little more
ethical solution here?

520
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,565
Well, what do you suggest, CPR?

521
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,380
You know, like, the truth, doctor?

522
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,940
The truth?

523
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,060
You want to go and tell that sweet
little girl that her pet lizard is dead?

524
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,140
She's ten years old.
She doesn't even know what death is.

525
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,620
You want to explain death to her?

526
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,620
You may as well tell her that
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny

527
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,420
don't exist while you're at it.

528
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,940
I don't think you should make a habit of it,
but if you get a chance to protect a kid

529
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,001
from the heartbreak that this world
doles out so generously,

530
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,180
I think you should seize it.

531
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,090
Because there's lots more
where that came from.

532
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,980
Okay. I want you to take this
and tell her that Abracadabra

533
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,380
has made a miraculous recovery
and is ready to go home.

534
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,420
Me? You want me to do it?

535
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,140
Yes, because I want you
to get used to this situation.

536
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,260
Uh-unh.

537
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,249
Now go. Go.

538
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,460
He's going to be okay.

539
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,580
Oh. Oh!

540
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:28,609
Now, Taylor, I have something very
important to tell you, okay, honey?

541
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,360
Go on.

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,980
Abracadabra!

543
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,820
- There he is!
- Wow!

544
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,490
It is a miracle.

545
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,260
He's all better now.

546
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,460
Boat day! Hey!

547
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,620
Look, guys, we promised the kids we'd
be home for popcorn and monster movies.

548
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,940
So let's get this show on the road.

549
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,340
Okay, I'm letting y'all know right now

550
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,340
that I am hungover
and altogether irritable.

551
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,420
So don't expect nothing more
than a sunburn out of me today.

552
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,540
Would you do me a favor?

553
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,020
- What?
- Would you clean those steamy,

554
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,620
slimy fish guts out of that nasty,
bloody bucket?

555
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,940
And maybe after that, you can drain
the grease trap on the barbeque?

556
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,940
And make sure you get all the chunks of fat
or you're going to have a maggot problem.

557
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,180
If y'all make me puke,
I'm going to save it,

558
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,380
put it in little plastic bags,
put it on your pillows tonight.

559
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,940
Believe it or not, she's single, folks!

560
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,180
Hey, where's Monica at?

561
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,740
Monica's sitting this one out.

562
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,940
You don't say?

563
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,460
I can invite whoever I want.

564
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,140
- It's my boat.
- It is his boat.

565
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,801
- It's our day!
- It's our day.

566
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,020
Be nice.

567
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,009
You know how to pick 'em, Trav.

568
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,420
You've got an air of authority
and dignity as the captain today.

569
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,885
- You like that?
- Yeah.

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,340
Well, I'm borrowing his ship today.

571
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,900
Yeah, it's new.

572
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,660
You seem awfully focused.

573
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,540
I'm driving, so I can't drink.

574
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,100
She's making me nervous as hell.

575
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,420
Woe is you.

576
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,568
Hey, y'all, this is not
a middle school dance.

577
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,100
Go bother somebody else.

578
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,300
Hey, you doing all right?

579
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,660
Hey. Yeah, I am great.

580
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,980
Not getting seasick on us, are you?

581
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,300
- No.
- Good.

582
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,620
- This is unbelievable.
- It's great.

583
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,620
I can't even believe you get
to come here all the time and do this.

584
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,940
Hey, mind if we join you?

585
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,780
- Hi.
- It's so hot.

586
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,580
It's 80 degrees.
Take off that sweatshirt. Are you crazy?

587
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,660
Okay. Okay.

588
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,180
- It's hot.
- It's the Spanish Inquisition.

589
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,740
You can lay off.

590
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,691
We might be in trouble, boy.

591
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,140
You can do it. You're so close.

592
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,481
- Come on, Moby. You can do it.
- You're going to make it!

593
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,780
Someone needs to teach
that dog how to swim.

594
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,980
- Cooked to perfection.
- All right, thank you, sir.

595
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,540
Thank you, sir.

596
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,660
- Don't even think about it.
- Aww.

597
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,240
I saw that before.

598
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,620
It's happy. It's a happy color.

599
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,087
Well, to good times.

600
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,380
Mattie and Ben have a pretty
successful loan company.

601
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,820
But I keep thinking Mattie wants out,

602
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,140
like he feels like his life
is passing him by or something.

603
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,820
What do you think?

604
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,207
None of my business.

605
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,244
I'm not one to gossip.

606
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
What about that guy?

607
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,780
- That guy?
- My knucklehead brother?

608
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,980
I don't know. You tell me.

609
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,180
Well, he is the glue.

610
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,500
The good old boy who's mastered
the art of Southern charm.

611
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,660
Women give him anything he wants.

612
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,860
Anything.

613
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,620
He gives them just...
just enough to keep them coming back

614
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,780
and has never been in love

615
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,646
because he backs off
when things get too hard.

616
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,860
That's why he has that chair.

617
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,100
You know, the chair
out in the front of his house.

618
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,420
That lonely chair.

619
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,809
Well, it is just one chair.

620
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,408
The man with one chair likes to sit alone.

621
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,860
You know, I sure like talking to you.

622
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,086
Pass it!

623
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,900
- Yeah!
- Nice.

624
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,020
You are in so much more trouble
than I thought.

625
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,940
Hey, over here! Pass it!

626
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,760
♪ I can keep my head inside

627
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,771
♪ When the modern drift is all I have

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,940
Is this seat taken?

629
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,700
No, it is not. Go ahead.

630
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,100
Thank you.

631
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,361
Yeah.

632
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,210
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

633
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,500
Hey, uh, I have a confession.

634
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,090
Okay.

635
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,140
My friends like you better
than they like me.

636
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,620
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,020
I was actually afraid
that was going to happen.

638
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,140
I just don't get it.

639
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,300
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.

640
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,700
I mean, you're not funny,
you're not smart.

641
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,847
You're nothing to look at.

642
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,500
No. I think it's, um...

643
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,540
...it speaks a little more to,
you know, you, and you're just...

644
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,140
you feel quite mediocre and unattractive.

645
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm lowering the bar.

646
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,700
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

647
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,900
That's it. That's why.

648
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,140
So they can tolerate you.

649
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,481
- Yeah, I thought so.
- That makes sense.

650
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,964
Yeah.

651
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,449
I love it here.

652
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,260
Thanks for coming.

653
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,740
I'm really glad you came.

654
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,968
Yeah, me, too.

655
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,280
I feel really good out here.

656
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,684
I haven't felt like that in a while.

657
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,820
- That's good.
- Yeah.

658
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,420
- You dork.
- You're a dork.

659
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,500
You keep looking at me.

660
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,568
Ow!

661
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,980
Son of a...

662
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,889
You look...

663
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,180
Well, good night.

664
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,740
I noticed you didn't eat
a lot out there today.

665
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,520
What do you say we throw some
red meat on the grill, tell a few lies?

666
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,051
Has anyone ever said no to you before?

667
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,340
- "No"?
- No. I thought so.

668
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,420
I am making history,

669
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,010
Good night.

670
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,401
There you go again bothering me.

671
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,860
She said no to us, Stink.

672
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,020
Yeah, I know.

673
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,441
I'm not familiar with that term either.

674
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,041
Come on.

675
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,569
If you've been in the fish guts again...

676
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,041
Hey.

677
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,847
What you got?

678
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,561
Good boy.

679
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,660
Come on, boy. Come on!

680
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,721
- Hi.
- Hi.

681
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,980
- I brought wine.
- Thank you.

682
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,081
Thank you.

683
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,845
Handy, my ass.

684
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,900
Well, the young 'uns are looking good.
I think they're down for the night.

685
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,411
Good.

686
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,260
Damn, I thought you were
just going to whip something up.

687
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,566
I am.

688
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,220
If this is how you whip, I might just
have to get down on one knee right now.

689
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,380
- Excuse me?
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,460
My mama is an amazing cook.
I just paid attention.

691
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,060
Hang on a minute. Is this you right here?

692
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,380
Yeah, it is. It's my favorite memory.

693
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,562
It's at the property where we grew up.

694
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,500
We used to swim and ride bikes and fish,

695
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,820
and I used to put on
these silly little plays.

696
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,940
My dad would tell me stories at nighttime
about the constellations.

697
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,740
They sound like good folks.

698
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,491
Yeah, they are.

699
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,940
A hurricane washed it all away,
though, when I was 12.

700
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,460
Broke my heart.

701
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,660
It's funny, I wonder if that's why
that's my favorite memory.

702
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,500
What do you mean?

703
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,500
When things go away, you know?

704
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,060
Makes you appreciate them so much more
than when you actually have them.

705
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,780
Yeah.

706
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,601
It makes you pay attention to the things
that are just right in front of you.

707
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,180
Okay, dinner is served

708
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,460
on the eastern-most botanical mezzanine.

709
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,180
Ooh, so the porch with the trumpet weeds?

710
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,123
Exactly!

711
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,046
Beautiful.

712
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm sorry.

713
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,560
This view we got here is just beautiful.

714
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,340
Yes. The view.

715
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,020
Mm-hmm.

716
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,566
I really can't get enough of it.

717
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,260
Yeah.

718
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,100
It is really something.

719
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,046
It makes you wonder
where it all comes from, doesn't it?

720
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,921
Not really.

721
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,500
Not really?

722
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,340
- No.
- Okay.

723
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,460
So you don't believe in God.

724
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,180
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy!

725
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,660
This was going so good.

726
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,260
"Oh, boy"? Don't "oh, boy" me.

727
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,809
An honest question
deserves an honest answer.

728
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,260
All right.

729
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,460
- I apologize.
- Okay.

730
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,860
So?

731
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,500
You want to know what I believe in?

732
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,726
Yeah.

733
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,420
Moby, come here.

734
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,620
Oh, he has an opinion on this, does he?

735
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,200
Oh, yeah. Watch this.

736
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,180
Now, you see that?

737
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,123
How he pushes back?

738
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,164
He does it every time,
and he only does it for me.

739
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,980
Now, that's loyalty.

740
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,060
I know it sounds stupid,

741
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,367
but it's love.

742
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,700
Your friends, your family, yourself.

743
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,963
That's all you can count on in this world.

744
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,364
And that's what I believe.

745
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,881
What do you believe?

746
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,100
I believe...

747
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,603
...in the moon,

748
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,401
the stars.

749
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,340
It's that feeling

750
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,604
that I'm a part of something

751
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,889
so much bigger than myself

752
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,244
that I will never,
ever begin to understand.

753
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,060
And it's something that I cannot control,

754
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,924
no matter how hard I try.

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,260
So, if you can tell me
where that comes from

756
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,686
and why it is so damn beautiful...

757
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,526
...then I will stop saying
my prayers before bedtime.

758
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

759
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,700
Well, that was lovely.

760
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,940
It was, wasn't it?

761
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,420
We just had the God conversation
and it wasn't bad at all.

762
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,420
It didn't go that bad. Weird.

763
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,900
- Whew.
- Uh-oh.

764
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,684
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

765
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,380
The couple that used to live here,

766
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,201
they used to have
music playing all day and all night.

767
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,806
You'd see them out in the grass dancing
together on their anniversary.

768
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,730
Oh, my God. That is so lovely.

769
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,260
What happened to them?

770
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,780
They're still around.

771
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,220
They just got old and fragile

772
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,540
and moved into the home
over on Cedar and Marsh.

773
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,291
- Together?
- Yeah.

774
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,640
I love that story.

775
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,568
You're from Charleston, right?

776
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,140
Yeah. I miss it so much.

777
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,980
♪ It's a terrible love

778
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,900
♪ And I'm walking with spiders

779
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,321
All she needs now is a silver spoon.

780
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,124
Scratch that.

781
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

782
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,286
Did you just spin?

783
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,220
No.

784
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,220
I know a spin when I see one.

785
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,660
I'm pretty sure I just saw you spin.

786
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,300
You know, I... maybe there was a twirl.

787
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,460
Twirl, hmm?

788
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,380
- Yeah.
- Oh!

789
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,980
You wash, I'll dry.

790
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,580
No. Here. I will get it.

791
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,100
- Come on.
- No, I'm good.

792
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,602
All right, well...

793
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,408
...you want to dance with me
out on the grass?

794
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,500
No.

795
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,540
Why do you make it so hard for me
to flirt with you?

796
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,450
Because if I made it easy,
you wouldn't flirt anymore.

797
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,291

I would have gotten you a present.

938
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,940
Oh, no, it's not my birthday.

939
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,300
Travis didn't tell you?

940
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,926
No, it's Catherine's.

941
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,601
My wife. Their mom.

942
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,048
She'd be 57 today.

943
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,620
She had cancer, you know?

944
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
First in her breasts,
and then in her bones,

945
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,404
and then... then everywhere.

946
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,124
Travis was 14, mad at the world.

947
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,846
And I... I kind of...
kind of fell into the Bible.

948
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,570
He wanted to burn it, you know?

949
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,740
I kind of figured that I'd lose him

950
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,605
if I tried to make him
see it from my side, so I didn't.

951
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,281

952
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,365

- Mmm!
- All righty.

958
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,500
That looks amazing.

959
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,180
A good-looking piece of cake there.

960
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,860
- Yeah.
- I know there is.

961
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,300
- Yeah, what is...
- Shut up.

962
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,740
...what you're looking for.

963
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,047
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

964
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,569
All right. Happy birthday.

965
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,660
Oh, just... now, hold it
one second there, Gabby.

966
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,700
There is a minor tradition.

967
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,860
Catherine always insisted
that the birthday girl or boy

968
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,140
had to endure a little
ceremonial cake on the face.

969
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,540
She was a little bit of a jokester.

970
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,060
- A little bit.
- Really?

971
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,340
Okay. So who gets it?

972
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,380
Well, you are the guest.

973
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,860
Yeah, I mean, that's only fair, right?

974
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,980
- Guest of honor.
- Yeah, I am the guest.

975
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,340
- It's not as bad as it sounds.
- It'll be over quick.

976
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,410
All right, let's do it.

977
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,140
I'm sorry.

978
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,401
Okay.

979
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,569
One, two, three.

980
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,246
I got that, yeah?

981
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,020
Oh, my God! It's up my nostril!

982
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,100
- It's really good.
- It is?

983
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,580
Yeah. It's in my nose.

984
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,420
It is... you know what?
It is really tasty.

985
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,380
Give me that! Come on!

986
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,926
Out of there! Out of there!

987
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,726
Okay.

988
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,460
Thank you.

989
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,780
- Hang in there, Daddy.
- Thank you.

990
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,929
- Love you.
- Good night.

991
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,362
Are you really going to let him
drive home like that?

992
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,100
He's not driving anywhere.

993
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,931
Yeah, he's just going
to say good night to Mama.

994
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,242
She's just up the road a ways.

995
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,603
I'll check in on him in a few shakes.

996
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,049
- Good night, lovely.
- Good night.

997
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,180
- So glad you're here.
- That was so much fun.

998
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,964
Thank you... for the cake.

999
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,540
Thanks for that, yeah.

1000
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,580
- I love you, dipshit.
- Yeah, I love you.

1001
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,140
- Good night.
- Night, y'all.

1002
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,180
I should get started on the dishes.

1003
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,300
You should not. It's my house, my dishes.

1004
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,050
It'll take me two and a half shakes.

1005
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,447
Yeah. Hi, bud.

1006
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,404
Yeah. Yeah!

1007
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,646
There's something I want to show you.

1008
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,401
Okay.

1009
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,740
All right, so what I'm about to show you,

1010
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,260
I've never shown anybody.

1011
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,488
So you can't tell a soul, all right?

1012
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,201
Okay.

1013
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,927
Yeah.

1014
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,247
All right.

1015
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,530
- Okay.
- Watch it.

1016
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,522
Welcome to my island.

1017
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,940
Your island?

1018
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,121
Yeah.

1019
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,407
My grandfather and I
used to come out here and fish.

1020
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,244
He left it to me when he passed on.

1021
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,403
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

1022
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:47,450
And, uh... I don't know.
I wanted to show it to you.

1023
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,409
It's unbelievable.

1024
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,606
This is my favorite part.

1025
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,401
Look.

1026
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,300
From me to you, Gabby.

1027
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,528
The stars and the moon.

1028
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,365
Let's just stay here forever.

1029
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,367
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

1030
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,450
I do.

1031
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,043
Very much.

1032
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,340
I think John Cougar might be
a little bit of a hypochondriac.

1033
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,060
I wouldn't worry about him, Mrs. Vandy.

1034
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,780
It's Alice, please.

1035
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,940
Oh, oh. Alice, yes.

1036
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,820
Well, thanks again, Dr. Shep.
Well, you're welcome.

1037
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,420
Here, let me, uh, get the door.

1038
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,100
So I'll see you next time?

1039
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,884
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

1040
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,540
Um, Mrs. Vandy?

1041
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,380
Alice?

1042
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:43,203
I was thinking, um, maybe we could
have dinner sometime?

1043
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,380
Yes. I would like that.

1044
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,620
Yes, well, so would I.

1045
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,281
- Well, okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1046
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,700
Earth to Gabby.
Don't you hear the intercom?

1047
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,820
I've been paging you.

1048
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,284
- Oh.
- Phone call. Line one.

1049
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,882
- For me?
- Yeah.

1050
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,820
- Hello?
- Hey, babe. How are you?

1051
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,020
Hi.

1052
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,380
I know I should have called earlier,

1053
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,620
- but I just got back.
- Yeah.

1054
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,361
Meet me at Dockside. At 7:00?
My parents will be there.

1055
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,286
Oh.

1056
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,660
- Gabby. Hi!
- Hi.

1057
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,569
How are you?

1058
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,420
- I missed you.
- Yeah, me, too.

1059
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,602
Come on, my parents are over here.
Let's go.

1060
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,604
Okay.

1061
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,500
Oh, hey, look. Here they are.

1062
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,860
Come over here and give me a hug.

1063
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,140
Good to see you.

1064
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,820
Good to see you. Sit down!

1065
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,500
- She looks gorgeous.
- This place is so much fun.

1066
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,780
Caught you off guard.

1067
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,060
I don't know why we've never
been here before.

1068
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,420
I'm sorry. I should have called sooner.

1069
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,740
Things just wrapped up
quicker than I thought.

1070
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,900
No, it was a nice surprise.

1071
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,300
Evening, folks.

1072
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,620
Travis!

1073
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,620
- How the hell are you?
- Nice to see you.

1074
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,580
Mary, you remember
Shep's son Travis, don't you?

1075
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,300
So you're the one I should thank
for fixing Cotton's eye last month.

1076
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,020
Ryan, did Daddy tell you
Cotton Blossom got stung by a bee?

1077
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,691
His poor little eye
swelled up the size of a walnut.

1078
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,340
Travis, why don't you
pull up a chair and join us?

1079
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,780
Ryan just got back in town, and we decided

1080
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,140
we were going to slum out here
in Wrightsville in his honor.

1081
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,340
Thank you, Doc. I'd like to,
but I got an early morning,

1082
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,220
and I just wanted to say hello.

1083
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,810
Ryan. Gabby.

1084
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,700
Good night, y'all.

1085
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,020
Good night.

1086
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,940
Nice young fella there.

1087
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,122
He certainly is my hero.

1088
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,300
So, tell me,
how was the opening in Atlanta?

1089
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,700
A huge success.

1090
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,300
Really good that I went.

1091
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,220
- Meet Dr. Stevenson?
- Mm-hmm.

1092
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,606
- Yep.
- Would you excuse me a minute?

1093
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,580
I'll be just a minute.

1094
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,445
Where you going? Gabby?

1095
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,970
Travis?

1096
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,940
Are you going to tell him?

1097
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,100
- Please listen to me.
- Are you going to tell him?

1098
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,140
- I didn't know he was coming...
- Are you going to tell him?

1099
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,289
I don't know! I don't know.

1100
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,762
I get it.

1101
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,580
So it's all right to fool around

1102
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,060
in the back seat with a country boy,
but as soon as summer camp's over,

1103
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,100
rich girls go home
to their rich boyfriends, is that it?

1104
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,220
How dare you?

1105
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,660
You don't know anything about my life.

1106
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,820
I know enough.

1107
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,700
Oh, really?

1108
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,660
Well, guess what,
I know about you, too, country boy.

1109
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,980
You see something you like
and you go after it.

1110
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,580
You're damn right I do.

1111
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,260
Not because you want to,
not because you need it,

1112
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,500
because you just want to win.

1113
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,080
I want you.

1114
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,563
We never talked about what this was.

1115
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,460
It just happened so fast.
We got caught up.

1116
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,980
Caught up? Is that what happened?
We got caught...

1117
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,980
We both knew this was coming
around the corner.

1118
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,660
Neither of us wanted to acknowledge it.

1119
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,620
All right. All right, well, here it is.

1120
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,700
It's right here, right in front of us.

1121
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,450
So let's acknowledge it.

1122
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,060
We had an amazing time.

1123
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,820
One of those ground-shaking,
life-altering,

1124
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,845
knock you on your ass months,
and I wish it could be more.

1125
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,728
But this is... this is all I get.

1126
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,300
So what about you?

1127
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,167
No. No, see, that is not fair.

1128
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,220
How am I supposed to know how you feel?

1129
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,780
I love you.

1130
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,740
You hear me? I love you.

1131
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,140
I'll say it again. I love you.
I'll say it a million times.

1132
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,971
I love you, I love you, I love you.

1133
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,360
I knew it the second you walked into
my yard ready to rip me a new one.

1134
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,881
Hell, my damn dog knew it.

1135
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,460
Now, do you remember
what you said to me on my island,

1136
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,460
holding my hand under the stars?

1137
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,244
You said, "Let's stay here forever."

1138
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,242
Well, we can. Me and you.

1139
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,083
Come home with me.

1140
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,926
Come home.

1141
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,246
We'll go in there together
and we'll tell them... together.

1142
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,251
That is what you want, isn't it?

1143
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,611
Isn't it?

1144
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,560
I don't know.

1145
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,460
- All right.
- No.

1146
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,244
All right.

1147
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,643
"Dear Travis,

1148
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,646
I feel like such a coward
writing this letter.

1149
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,420
After you left, I told Ryan everything.

1150
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,900
He yelled and cussed.

1151
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,163
He called me just about
every name in the book.

1152
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,211
He stormed out and told me to go to hell.

1153
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,166
But in the morning, he came back

1154
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,884
and he asked me to marry him.

1155
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,460
Got to thinking that life is held
together by choices,

1156
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,340
one after the other."

1157
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,330
Oh, so cute!

1158
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,404
"All shapes and sizes.

1159
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,885
Right or wrong doesn't matter,
because life just keeps unfolding.

1160
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,329
It won't wait around for you.

1161
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,650
If you sit still,
it could pass you by altogether."

1162
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,560
- Happy anniversary!
- Ten years!

1163
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,243
Hi.

1164
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,220
"I guess I'd like to believe

1165
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,900
all those choices are made for us

1166
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,765
the instant we enter into this world.

1167
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,220
Because if that's true,

1168
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,723
then we're exactly where
we're supposed to be... forever."

1169
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,860
Here you go.

1170
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,803
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

1171
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,370
You, uh...

1172
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,243
...you seem like
you're somewhere else tonight.

1173
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,645
I know. I'm sorry.

1174
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,569
I'm just a little wiped out.

1175
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,081
You'll never look at me
the way you look at her.

1176
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,010
It's true.

1177
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,649
I know it.

1178
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,820
I'd hate her for it if I was
one of those women, but I'm not.

1179
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,685
- Come on, now.
- Travis, I, uh...

1180
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,300
I'm going to give you
some friendly advice,

1181
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,767
and then I'm going to
go home and cry, okay?

1182
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,442
Swallow your pride.

1183
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,580
You want to be the guy
that shows up in ten years

1184
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,940
with flowers in your hand,
Moby by your side,

1185
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,500
hoping that she'll hear you out?

1186
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,729
Praying she'll understand
why you quit so easy?

1187
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,060
Because that's all any woman wants,

1188
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,969
is a man who's gonna fight.

1189
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,887
So why don't you just do it now
and save yourself a whole decade?

1190
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,723
You know, she looks at you the same way.

1191
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,406

I'm not sure what that means,

but I'm pretty sure
that you speak the language.

Yeah.

1216
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,970

Um, no. Uh, I need to see Gabby.

1232
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,540
This young man here
is looking for Miss Gabriella.

1233
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,420
Well, I believe
she's returning from the stables.

1234
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,600
- Hi.
- You?

1235
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,420
What are you doing here?

1236
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,100
Mr. Holland. Mrs. Holland.

1237
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,646
I'm Travis Shaw. Maybe you've heard of me?

1238
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,900
Maybe not. Okay.

1239
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,500
Um, well, I'm here today

1240
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,300
to tell you
that I love Gabby something terrible,

1241
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,020
and I was hoping
I could take her off your hands.

1242
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,620
- Right.
- Young man,

1243
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,380
we love Gabby something terrible, too,
but you are barking up the wrong tree.

1244
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,940
If you're here for Gabby's hand,
you might want to ask her parents.

1245
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,580
- No! No, no, no.
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

1246
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,340
- No! No, no, no.
- I just assumed that they were...

1247
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,620
- It's quite all right, Travis.
- It's nice to meet you.

1248
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,820
So nice to meet you. Pleasure.

1249
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,540
Why are you here?

1250
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,860
I saw you with her on the porch.

1251
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,220
No, hang on now.

1252
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,500
- On the boat.
- Hang on.

1253
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,620
- No, I saw you!
- Hang on.

1254
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,900
Picked up right where you left off.

1255
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,580
Gabby, stop!

1256
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,081
Listen to me, please.

1257
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,240
I love you.

1258
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,860
Well, I don't love you.

1259
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,740
Oh, hush! You do, too.

1260
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,260
Knew it the second you walked inside
and set your eyes on him,

1261
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,260
biting your lip the way you do.

1262
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,500
Mom! He is a walking cautionary tale!

1263
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,284
- Now, hang on a minute.
- You are!

1264
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,460
Gabby, you've been waiting for him to show
ever since you got home and you know it.

1265
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,940
Dad! Whose side are you on, anyway?

1266
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,820
Mr. Holland, Mrs. Holland,

1267
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,260
I'm so sorry for the confusion
and the intrusion...

1268
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,620
- Yeah!
- ...but I love this woman

1269
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,881
and I would love a blessing from you,
whether it's a wink or a nod...

1270
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,020
Oh, my God! A blessing?

1271
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,804
...or anything that you could give me.

1272
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,660
You got a ring, son?

1273
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,728
What? What? What? No, no, no.

1274
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,729
What the hell is going on here?

1275
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,940
Mom? No! No, no, no.

1276
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,740
I am not marrying this man.

1277
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,100
Here.

1278
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,380
- This was her grandma's.
- What? Oh, my God!

1279
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,900
Hello? I am right here!

1280
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,081
- Gabby.
- No!

1281
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,369
- Gabby.
- No, no, no.

1282
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,620
You should probably take a knee, son.

1283
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,900
- Dad!
- Right.

1284
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,020
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.

1285
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,770
Gabby.

1286
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,260
I think I pretty much said all the words,

1287
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,603
so all I need is a lifetime
to prove it to you.

1288
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,606
Will you marry me?

1289
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,644
No!

1290
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,900
Well, yes.

1291
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,340
No!

1292
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,900
- Yes!
- No!

1293
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,220
Yes!

1294
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,100
Come bother me, baby.

1295
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,646
Bother me for the rest of my life.

1296
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,967
Be my wife.

1297
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,481
Okay.

1298
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,400

It was nice to see ya.

You be careful in the rain.

- Good night.
- Thank you.

Oh, shoot. I can't be late.

1331

- Tell me that was the last one.
- Sure was.

1332
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,820
- You got somewhere to be?
- Yeah, I got a date,

1333
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,940
not that it's any
of your business, Miss Cora.

1334
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,500
Oh, a date. Sounds romantic.

1335
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,780
Yeah, I've been promising Gabby
some one-on-one time

1336
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,900
and I stood her up on our last date,
so this one's makeup.

1337
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,660
Well, you two have fun.

1338
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,808
- Thank you. You have a good night.
- Good night.

1339
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,420
Hi, I have reservations for Shaw.

1340
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,602
Follow me, please.

1341
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,500
Have you dined with us before?

1342
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,648
Sorry, ma'am, we're closed.

1343
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,380
Oh, wait, Dr. Shaw.

1344
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,380
She can't keep anything down.

1345
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,860
She's so old. Please.

1346
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,500
Well, let's do it real quick.
Right this way.

1347
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,885
See that? She's got a little...

1348
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,481
Good job. Doing good.

1349
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,340
Will you hold her for me?

1350
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,726
Thank you.

1351
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,620
Can I get you another glass of wine?

1352
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,500
No. Uh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

1353
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,660
Um, I... I'm gonna grab the check.

1354
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,250
- Of course.
- If that's okay. Thank you.

1355
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,060
If you get this, I'm on my way.
I had a feline emergency.

1356
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,180
But I'll be right there.
I am so, so sorry.

1357
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,806
I love you and I'll see you in a sec.

1358
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,420
So, like I was sayin',

1359
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,684
every path you take
leads to another choice...

1360
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,300
...and some choices
could change everything.

1361
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,930
Every damn moment
for the rest of your life hangs on it.

1362
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,969
And, boy, have I got
a choice I gotta make.

1363
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,340
I do not want to see you back here

1364
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,340
unless you bring your wife's cobbler,
Mr. Metcalf, you hear that?

1365
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,920
No more flag football.

1366
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,580
Those for someone special?

1367
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,180
Someone who deserves
the stars and the moon.

1368
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,204
All I got are these damn flowers.

1369
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,380
- How are the girls?
- Terrible.

1370
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,460
Tess is texting already.

1371
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,971
Yeah.

1372
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,740
I'm just here to talk to her.

1373
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,340
All right, you go right ahead, Travis.

1374
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,169
If that's what you need. If that'll help.

1375
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,100
Too easy on me, Ryan.

1376
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,044
And you're too hard on you, Travis.

1377
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,805
Mmm, delphiniums. Her favorite.

1378
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,220
I thought they were lilacs.

1379
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,860
She's all yours.

1380
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,121
Thank you.

1381
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,005
Hey, babe.

1382
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,220
Got you some delphiniums.

1383
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,442
To be honest, I thought they were lilacs,
but Jackie says they're delphiniums.

1384
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,122
I got a decision I gotta make.

1385
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,969
I've been putting it off
and putting it off.

1386
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,810
It's, like, so much harder
than people can even imagine.

1387
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,204
And everybody's got an opinion on it.

1388
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,540
But since yours is the only opinion

1389
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,380
that I give a damn about,

1390
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,244
I just wanted to run it past you.

1391
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,600
So here it is.

1392
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,040
What am I gonna do...

1393
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,081
...about my pickup truck?

1394
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,700
I mean, should I get
one of those new hybrids

1395
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,420
that gets, like, 500 miles to the gallon

1396
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,740
and runs on babies' dreams,

1397
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,860
or should I just go ahead

1398
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,804
and rebuild the tranny in Gertrude?

1399
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,660
Rebuild. All right, great.

1400
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,603
That's what I wanted to do anyway.

1401
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,420
You know, I always had a special
place in my heart for fossil fuels.

1402
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,682
I just hate breathin' all that clean air.

1403
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,571
What is going on in that head of yours?

1404
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,003
Come back to me, baby.

1405
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,330
We are runnin' out of time.

1406
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,689
Come bother me.

1407
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,900
All right, here we go. Please. We need...

1408
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,140
- ...green.
- Green.

1409
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,460
That was mine.

1410
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,020
Ooh, where's mine?

1411
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,660
Messed up.

1412
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,020
- Travis.
- Oh, hey, Travis.

1413
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,460
Daddy.

1414
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,085
Who's winning?

1415
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,220
Well, technically speaking,
it's this pretty little girl

1416
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,260
here on my left, but since she's been
cheating since round two...

1417
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,060
No, I haven't!

1418
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,420
...I'm afraid there's gonna be
some questions about that.

1419
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,660
Well, I don't wanna spoil your fun.

1420
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,205
Finish your game.

1421
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,940
- Okay.
- It's your turn.

1422
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,169
Mm, okay. Green.

1423
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,166
Travis, I just wanted you to know that...

1424
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,808
Send these off to the lab, please.

1425
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,540
What do we got next?

1426
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,210
We've got some friends here.

1427
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,220
It's gonna hurt like hell.

1428
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,641
Like pain that I can't even...

1429
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,771
Come on.

1430
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,700
"'How do you play in the river?'

1431
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,740
Tucker asked Maggie the Mullet.

1432
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,420
'You jump like this.

1433
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,940
Jump, splash, jump, splash, jump, splash.'

1434
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,964
And Maggie was gone in the blue river."

1435
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,100
Daddy, can you do the voices?

1436
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,540
Mommy always did the voices.

1437
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,883
Dad, why don't you let me read it?

1438
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,500
Okay, big guy. Yeah, you read it.

1439
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,260
"It was beginning to get dark,

1440
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,380
and Tucker spied a big owl up in a tree.

1441
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,380
'Hi, who are you?' Tucker asked.

1442
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,340
'Who, who, who are you?

1443
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,900
I am Willa, the wise old owl.'

1444
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,460
'What do you do when the sun goes down?'
Tucker asked."

1445
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,369
Ninety days.

1446
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,887
And where'd you get that number?

1447
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,860
Medical journals and case studies.

1448
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,900
Well, that's just words on paper.
It's statistics.

1449
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,940
It's well-documented, Dr. Shep.

1450
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,340
After 90 days, the percentage
of trauma patients

1451
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:33,260
who regain consciousness
decreases to less than one percent.

1452
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,930
It's a quantifiable fact.

1453
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,242
I'm sorry, Travis.

1454
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,020
If we reach that mark,

1455
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,521
we need to know you're prepared
to carry out her wishes.

1456
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,740
This is her voice.

1457
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,083
No, it's not.

1458
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,926
That is something you do
to prepare for the future.

1459
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,300
For... for old age,
when your life is all behind you.

1460
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,220
You know, you cover for the "what ifs."

1461
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,140
Nah. How could you know?

1462
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,642
How... how could you ever really know?

1463
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,445
It's been a long time since
she's breathed on her own.

1464
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,643
Her body's tired.

1465
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,806
She's tired.

1466
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,844
I wish I could breathe for you, baby.

1467
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,700
Come back to me.

1468
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,211
Come home.

1469
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,446
I love you.

1470
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,248
All I have left are memories.

1471
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,122
Trust me, I remember everything.

1472
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,004
I remember
her coming home... day after day.

1473
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,690
Watching her...

1474
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,700
...staring and thinking,

1475
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,204
I can't believe
that that woman is my wife.

1476
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,646
I kept thinking how many times
I could've told her I loved her.

1477
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,020
How many times I could've showed her,

1478
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,884
how many times I could've loved her hard.

1479
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,980
Oh, I'd give anything
just to be able to tell her,

1480
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,730
tell her one more... one more time.

1481
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,809
- Hey.
- Hey.

1482
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,091
Hi, Mama.

1483
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,965
She's a good listener, huh?

1484
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,445
She's the best.

1485
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,322
I had to make a choice, Steph.

1486
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,805
Just been so long.

1487
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,010
Seeing her like that.

1488
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,408
Knowing it's not what she would want.

1489
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,844
Hell, she'd be so mad at me.

1490
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,362
Last night I told her...

1491
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,420
...today I'd do it.

1492
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,887
Today I would have the strength.

1493
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,367
But I just... I just can't do it yet.

1494
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,282
I'm just not ready to let her go.

1495
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,020
Me, neither.

1496
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:47,100
You did what your heart told you.

1497
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,580
And if anybody has anything
to say about that,

1498
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,921
they gotta go through me.

1499
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,260
...residents are advised to secure

1500
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,180
all windows and doors,
and remember, too, as always,

1501
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,100
that any outdoor furniture
needs to be stowed away.

1502
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,820
Thanks, Karen. Now this is
the first hurricane of the season...

1503
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,980
Travis, this is crazy. Just come with us.

1504
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,900
I got some boarding up to do,
and, besides, I don't go anywhere

1505
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,060
unless its a Category 7 or higher.

1506
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,700
Dad, there's no such thing
as a Category 7.

1507
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,100
Well, aren't you smart?

1508
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,780
I hope you're not
trying to prove something.

1509
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,540
- This thing looks big.
- There's nobody to prove it to.

1510
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,420
I just wanna stay near the hospital.

1511
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,300
Besides, I got stink-dog here
to keep me company.

1512
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,900
Let's saddle up.

1513
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,570
- Come on.
- All right.

1514
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,060
Right now we're seeing sustained
winds, about 75 miles-per-hour.

1515
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,820
Now, those gusts are gonna go up to 90,

1516
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,420
maybe even 95 miles-per-hour.

1517
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:07,330
We're gonna see damage...

1518
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,740
Ah, you're a lucky SOB.
Storm landed in Charleston.

1519
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,260
Knocked it down to a Category 2.

1520
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,250
Looks like the old place
could do with a lick of paint.

1521
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,924
What are you looking for?

1522
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:16,443
Something that... should be here.

1523
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,887
I let her down, Dad.

1524
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,220
I should've been there.

1525
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,020
If I'd have been on time...

1526
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,327
It's not your fault, Travis.

1527
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,329
Get that out of your head.

1528
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,331
The world breaks everyone, Travis.

1529
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,323
The very good,
the very gentle, the very brave.

1530
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,100
And those it doesn't break, it kills.

1531
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,807
Is that from the good book, Pastor Shaw?

1532
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,605
A great book. Hemingway.

1533
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,140
There's no shame in being a broken man.

1534
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,860
I should know.

1535
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,531
You just pick up the pieces...

1536
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,482
...and start rebuilding.

1537
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,820
What are you doing?

1538
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,924
How'd you get all the way
out here, boy? You can't swim.

1539
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,409
What you got there, boy?

1540
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,121
What's that?

1541
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,688
Good boy, good boy.

1542
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,740
What's he doing out there, Grandpa?

1543
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,050
Uh... just going a little crazy.

1544
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,020
Come on, let's go get some ice cream.

1545
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,485
Come on.

1546
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,401
We've got vanilla, we've got chocolate.

1547
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,444
Mm.

1548
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,162
You're late.

1549
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,448
I'm sorry.

1550
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,642
- Mama! Mama, you're home!
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1551
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,380
You've seen your mom every day this week.

1552
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,780
Let's let her get settled, okay?

1553
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,940
- My babies.
- Hi, Mommy.

1554
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,565
Oh, hi.

1555
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,220
Let me look at you.

1556
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,161
Hello, Gabby.

1557
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,780
Congratulations.

1558
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,860
Oh, somebody is dying to meet you.

1559
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,849
Oh, hi.

1560
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,685
Oh, my goodness.

1561
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,860
- Mrs. Shaw.
- Mr. Shaw.

1562
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,884
Well, welcome to the rain-check date.

1563
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,500
What is on the menu?

1564
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,300
Well, that's a... that's a good question.

1565
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,180
The kids have been cooking all day.

1566
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,260
It, uh, started as a pot roast,
but now it's probably a shoe.

1567
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,886
- I'm nervous.
- So am I.

1568
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,765
Uh... but, uh...

1569
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:58,540
Gabby, I, uh...

1570
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:01,500
I know I've had a lot of time
to think about what I'd say

1571
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:08,420
if, uh... what I'd say when...
and, um... dang it!

1572
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,260
I had this all sorted out.
I did. Now I can't, um...

1573
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,921
Travis, I heard you.

1574
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:23,162
I heard... every word that you said.

1575
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,761
You were breathing for me, baby.

1576
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,647
Your heart beat for mine.

1577
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,969
We got through this together.

1578
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,881
You reckon Moby had this
all planned from the get-go?

1579
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:00,020
Moby? What?

1580
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,860
You're gonna give Moby all the credit?

1581
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:04,660
What about my sweet, innocent Molly?

1582
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,380
Sweet and innocent?

1583
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,500
Are you saying she's
not sweet and innocent?

1584
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,700
- No.
- Yes.

1585
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:12,820
- Lady.
- I know.

1586
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,888
You bother me, too.

1587
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,600
I'm really worried about this pot roast.

1588
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,620
We're probably gonna
