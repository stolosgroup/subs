GREENLAND
AS PER LATEST SOURCES 1905

3
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,750
Something's out there!

4
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,625
Iver, follow them.

5
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,625
Go see what it is, quickly.
Hand me the lantern.

6
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,208
It's the captain! It's the captain!

7
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,333
Whoa.

8
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,416
Whoa!

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,916
Sir, did you find anything?

10
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,583
- Help Jørgensen. His feet are frozen.
- Right, come on.

11
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,708
- Holm's on his way.
- Quick, Unger. Get the water.

12
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,458
Jørgensen, lift your head up.

13
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,958
- Unger, hurry up with the water.
- It's coming!

14
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,559
- Raise it. Easy.
- It's all right. We got you.

15
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,833
- We got you.
- Take it easy, Jørgensen.

16
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,750
Unger, the water.

17
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,083
- Come on!
- It's coming.

18
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,333
Hold these.
Take it easy, Jørgensen.

19
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,083
- Do you have some whiskey?
- Yes. Get the man a drink.

20
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,958
Here.

21
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,125
Wait, wait.

22
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,041
I'll take that.

23
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,416
Ejnar, hold him down.

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,666
Jørgensen, breathe.
Keep breathing.

25
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,958
Let's do this.

26
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,375
Okay.

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,208
- Hold him.
- One, two, three.

28
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,083
All right.

29
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,250
- Thank you.
- Got it?

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,625
Good. Smells like Christmas.

31
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,125
One, two, three.

32
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,125
Oh!

33
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,708
- Who's hungry?
- Everybody.

34
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,166
Starving.

35
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,333
Here we go, boys.

36
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,541
- Looks great.
- Finally.

37
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,875
You've done yourself proud,
sunshine.

38
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,708
It's about time we found a use for you.

39
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,250
Gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

40
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,333
- Party's over.
- Quiet, Poulsen.

41
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,333
- I want you all to raise your glasses...
- Of course.

42
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:53,916
...to...

43
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,625
to loved ones back home,

44
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,791
to the men who gave their lives

45
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,291
exploring the last unknown parts
of our kingdom.

46
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,916
To the Denmark Expedition.

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,250
And to you,

48
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,708
for joining me
in fulfilling their mission.

49
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,625
<i>Skål.</i>

50
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,541
<i>Skål.</i>

51
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,625
Halfway there.

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Ah!

53
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,416
Our long search
didn't go quite as planned.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,958
Jørgensen can testify to that.

55
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
As expected,

56
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,333
it was hard to trace any signs
of the vanished expedition.

57
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,125
However,

58
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,458
we found this.

59
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
A diary from one of the men.

60
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,625
And a map

61
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,041
that apparently shows the location

62
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,500
of the cairn

63
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,625
where Mylius-Erichsen left
his final records of the unknown land.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,541
What's a cairn?

65
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,541
A cairn's a stack of stones
you can see from far away.

66
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,375
So, therefore,
I'll attempt another journey.

67
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,500
What?

68
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,583
Another?

69
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,833
Well, this time further,
across the ice cap,

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,125
to retrieve the findings they left behind.

71
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,583
We're not going home then?

72
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,500
This is why we're here, boys.

73
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,583
Without these findings,
the North of Greenland could be lost,

74
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,958
claimed by the Americans.

75
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:15,000
Now, Jørgensen is incapacitated,

76
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,500
and I can't do it alone,

77
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,166
which provides one of you lucky boys
with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

78
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,583
I'll need a volunteer to accompany me.

79
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,083
Has anyone volunteered yet?

80
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,000
You're kidding, right?

81
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,666
Jørgensen's feet were wrecked.

82
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,541
Aren't you next in line, Laub?

83
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,083
Shut up, Poulsen. Some of us have family.

84
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,791
Why don't any of you want to go with him?

85
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,000
You saw the map.

86
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,458
It's like walking from Moscow to Rome
looking for a stack of stones.

87
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,125
Not to mention
doing it with the captain.

88
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,708
Iver knows him all right.

89
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,750
He knew all about him
before he came aboard, right?

90
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,625
I mean, I've read about him,

91
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,291
but everybody has, haven't they?

92
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,291
Not everyone's a fan,

93
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,666
Iver Iversen.

94
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,583
- Not everyone can read. Right, Unger?
- Try reading this!

95
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,541
Come on!

96
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,791
Captain.

97
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,875
Mm.

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,291
I was...

99
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,625
just wondering...

100
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,083
I don't know
how many volunteers you've had already...

101
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,416
Well, that would be none.

102
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,541
What I'm trying to say is

103
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,000
technically, I'm out of a job.

104
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,916
Mm-hm.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,041
As long as we're parked up here,
the motor won't be needed.

106
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,125
I'd like to come with you,
if you'd allow me.

107
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,541
I'm good with a rifle,
and I'm learning how to drive the dogs.

108
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,791
I'd really like to come, Captain.

109
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,708
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Iversen.

110
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,458
Thank you, Captain.

111
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,416
Poulsen, hand me those harnesses.

112
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,541
- What's Iversen up to?
- Come on.

113
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,833
- Looks like he needs a hand.
- Stay there.

114
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,583
Hey! Hey!

115
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,000
All of you stay here, okay?

116
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,666
Okay.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,208
Hey! Hey!

118
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,125
Hey, stop!

119
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,333
Stay there!

120
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,208
- You talk to him.
- Hey!

121
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,416
Here, let me give you a hand.

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,208
Iversen, the dogs work for you.

123
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,375
Remember that.

124
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
Out on the ice,

125
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,666
each dog can pull
a hundred pounds of weight from the start.

126
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,875
Once that hundred pounds has been eaten,

127
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,208
well, that dog
becomes surplus to requirement.

128
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,791
So we shoot the worst dog,

129
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,708
feed it to the others.

130
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,541
So, Iversen, don't become best friends.

131
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,791
You've heard Iversen volunteered.

132
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,500
- I have, sir.
- What are your thoughts on him?

133
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,458
- Iversen?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,875
Uh...

135
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,958
He's a good lad.

136
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,666
- Very brave.
- Mm.

137
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,750
Strong character.

138
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,500
Have you seen him with the dogs?

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,833
Clearly he needs
to work a bit harder to improve.

140
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,791
But you think he can do it?

141
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,166
I believe so, yes.

142
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,875
That's all.

143
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
Don't be ridiculous.
Surely that's too heavy.

144
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,916
I'm telling you, it's unsinkable.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,750
They've spent $1 million already.

146
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,291
It's got combination turbines
and reciprocating engines

147
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,208
guaranteed to maintain
a speed of 21 knots.

148
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,458
- Translation, anyone, please?
- What are you talking about?

149
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,416
Is the Alabama
not up to your standard?

150
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,333
Go on about this with the captain,
he'll put a bullet in your head.

151
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,708
Yeah, usually I'd say
Poulsen's talking shit,

152
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,500
but I've gotta agree,
I daren't say two words to him.

153
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,541
The captain's not that bad.

154
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,625
I have to say, Iver,
I think you've lost your mind.

155
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,541
What do you know about sledging,
surviving on the ice when it's 40 below?

156
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,083
Yeah, and polar bears
and all that other scary shit out there.

157
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,416
I think Iver has got quite the handle
on those dogs now.

158
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,166
It's not too late to change your mind.

159
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,041
This is my third trip up here
and I still hate those fucking dogs.

160
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,625
If they were any more inbred,
they'd be sandwiches.

161
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,541
No, come on. They're amazing.

162
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,083
Once you learn to trust your lead dog,
it kind of falls into place.

163
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,250
Mine's Bjørn.
He keeps the others in check.

164
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,708
He does all the work.

165
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,666
Ooh!

166
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,083
Check out Iver
and his new favorite dog, Bjørn!

167
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,666
I feel like I've let you down.

168
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,416
Ah.

169
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,125
You need to get yourself right.

170
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,833
Besides, Iversen's stepped up.

171
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,708
What?

172
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,375
He's a mechanic.

173
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,750
He wouldn't even be on this trip
if our engine hadn't failed in Reykjavik.

174
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,208
Just look after Alabama for me.

175
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,916
I've got to say this.

176
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,083
You're not a young man anymore.

177
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,791
You're risking your life, Iversen's life.

178
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,916
You want us to give up without trying?

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,166
We did try.

180
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,916
We did our best.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Nonsense.

182
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,875
What about Naja?

183
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,125
Do you expect her to wait for you?

184
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,833
- You've got nothing to prove.
- This is not about me.

185
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,458
The committee's instructions were clear.

186
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,250
The sea opens up by July.

187
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,583
If we're not back by August
before the sea freezes, then you go.

188
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,625
- You'll basically be on your own.
- That's an order.

189
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,666
Iversen is the best, if not the only, man
willing to make the trip.

190
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,375
I respect your concern,
but we are leaving tomorrow.

191
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
Yes, Captain.

192
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,250
Iver, stand closer to the captain.

193
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,041
Yep, that's it.

194
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,250
Three, two, one.

195
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,750
Excellent.

196
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,000
Thanks for that.

197
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,323
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

198
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,375
Thank you.

199
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,833
I'll see you in August.

200
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,791
Take care, lads!

201
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,958
- You too, Captain.
- All the best.

202
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,083
Good luck.

203
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,333
Thank you, Jørgensen. Thank you.

204
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,416
Hup!

205
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,625
Good luck, Captain.

206
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,208
Go on, boys!

207
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,083
Good luck, Iver!

208
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
He's going to need it.

209
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,250
Iversen!

210
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,041
Get behind.

211
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,166
Whoa!

212
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Whoa!

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Go on, Bjørn!

214
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,208
Go on, boys!

215
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,458
Oh, my God.

216
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,375
- Are we gonna try and get up there?
- Well, there's always a way up.

217
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,500
It's just finding the quickest route.

218
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,041
I bet there's a quick way down too.

219
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,541
Mm, which is why I need you
to concentrate at all times.

220
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,166
We need to get up to get across.

221
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,458
Come on.

222
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,291
One, two, three, pull.

223
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,208
One, two, three.

224
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,208
Pull!

225
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,833
That's it. That's it.

226
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,125
It's like we've landed on the moon.

227
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,041
How many cubic meters of ice
do you think this is?

228
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,083
Must be at least two million,
do you think?

229
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,416
I need you to watch where you're walking.

230
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,791
Iversen, let's unhook.

231
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,875
I'm reading this article you wrote
about the Denmark Expedition.

232
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,958
Mm.

233
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,375
Amazing, isn't it?

234
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,708
Now I'm here with you, reading your story.

235
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,750
Very interesting.

236
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:16,083
They had so much equipment, didn't they?
They even had an automobile.

237
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,958
Imagine that! Driving across the ice.

238
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,291
It's ridiculous.

239
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,166
What type do you think it was, Captain?

240
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,541
Crossley?

241
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,541
What horsepower was the engine?
Can you remember?

242
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,125
Was it four to eight perhaps?

243
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,583
Captain.

244
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,583
Captain, that's my lead dog, Bjørn.

245
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,500
I think he'd like to come in the tent.
Would that be okay?

246
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,500
Little wonder they got lost out here.

247
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,208
Right.

248
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,166

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,875
Captain, I wanted to ask,

261
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,125
what do you think really happened

262
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,708
to the Denmark Expedition?

263
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,958
- To Mylius-Erichsen?
- Mm.

264
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,083
Sometimes, it's best
not to think too much.

265
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,750
You knew him well though?

266
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,166
He was a dear friend.

267
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,083
A fine explorer.

268
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,083
But he never knew when to give up.

269
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,541
<i>We only found one body.</i>

270
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,583
<i>The Greenlander Brønlund.</i>

271
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,583
<i>The two others were lost in the ice.</i>

272
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,125
Imagine dying like that.

273
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,166
Alone in this place.

274
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,958
<i>His final words in the diary
and the map were all that survived.</i>

275
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,125
You never think you can't make it.

276
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,791
You always believe there'll be a way.

277
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,166
Hello, Bjørn.

278
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,625
Sorry we left you out.

279
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,958
Captain told us
we can't have you in if you make noise.

280
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,708
Okay?

281
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,875
Yeah.

282
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,458
Captain, I've just put that on.

283
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,458
Well, let me show you something.

284
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,333
Inuit magic.

285
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,875
In Alaska, they do this
in these conditions to go fast.

286
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,958
You see?

287
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,000
Just a thin layer of ice.

288
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,416
Come on, guys!

289
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,666
Woo-hoo!

290
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,000
- Iversen!
- Yeah?

291
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,166
- See the cirrus clouds up in the north?
- No, Captain.

292
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,125
I see only sunshine!

293
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,625
Iversen!

294
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,416
The dogs are smelling land! Slow down!

295
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
Whoa!

296
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,958
Iversen, stop!

297
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,125
Stop!

298
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Stop! Stop!

299
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,458
Whoa!

300
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,416
Careful.

301
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,916
Okay.

302
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,958
- You're gonna climb down.
- Okay.

303
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,416
Oh, shit.

304
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,500
I can see him! It's Bjørn.

305
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,750
Just get the rope.

306
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,333
Okay.

307
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,458
I'll get him.

308
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,583
You all right?

309
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,666
Get up! We'll pull the sledge up.

310
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,958
Just leave the dog!

311
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,333
I'll get him! Wait!

312
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,333
No!

313
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,291
No! No!

314
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,916
By my calculations

315
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:30,083
I've lost us two weeks' worth of dog food,

316
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:35,041
I've lost us half our tea
and one can of paraffin.

317
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,666
Hm.

318
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,208
- And Bjørn, Captain.
- It's just a dog, Iversen.

319
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,458
Bringing you with me was always a risk,

320
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,000
but I judged your Navy background would
arm you with the necessary discipline

321
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,208
to follow orders.

322
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,250
Sorry, Captain.

323
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,500
Well, at least tomorrow,
we'll be off the ice cap.

324
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,000
Come on! Come on!

325
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,041
Hup, hup, hup!

326
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,333
Here.

327
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,791
Hey!

328
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,541
Come on! Now!

329
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,916
Come on!

330
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:55,916
Come on!

331
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's it.

332
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,416
Captain,

333
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,416
can I ask you a personal question?

334
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:09,916
Go on.

335
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,875
Why do you do this?

336
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,750
Keep doing this,

337
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,708
out here, in places like this?

338
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,041
Pretty much alone,

339
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,250
risking your life.

340
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,333
Don't you have...

341
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't you have someone special
at home waiting for you?

342
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:37,083
What we do...

343
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,250
you have to travel light.

344
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,250
You can't have your mind
some 2,000 miles away.

345
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,375
So, why do you do this?

346
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,333
Why does anyone do anything?
Why are you a mechanic?

347
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,291
It's all I was good at, fixing engines.

348
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,375
Exactly.

349
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,666
What did they tell you
back when you joined us in Reykjavik?

350
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,916
Well, I know it's to do with the Americans

351
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,458
and their claim of some land.

352
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,416
But, to be honest, Captain,

353
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,291
I was just excited
to go on a trip to Greenland with you

354
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,416
and join a real expedition.

355
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,375
We're talking unknown land, Iversen.

356
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:25,958
And the Americans claim

357
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,708
that the top of Greenland is
separated by a channel

358
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,250
from the rest of the country,

359
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,416
but no one's proved it yet.

360
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,916
It's important work.

361
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I see.

362
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,166
Might even make you famous, Iversen.

363
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,958
Me, famous? I doubt the ladies
would be queuing up for me.

364
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,875
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

365
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,750
First, we have to find the bloody thing.

366
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,625
Oh.

367
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,333
What's your name?

368
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,500
What's that?

369
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,166
Found them on the ship.

370
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,166
- Hm.
- Yes.

371
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,041
You forget, don't you?

372
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,625
- She's sweet looking.
- Hm.

373
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,333
Kind and thoughtful.

374
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,208
- I call her Miss Affection.
- You named her?

375
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,291
Yeah.

376
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,833
- Miss Affection.
- What sort of name is that?

377
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,416
- What about this one?
- The small, smiley one?

378
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,125
That's Little Miss Sunbeam.

379
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,250
- She'd laugh at my jokes.
- She'd laugh at the stupid name.

380
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,250
Is there one
that catches your eye, Captain?

381
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Uh...

382
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,083
I rather like this one.
Has she got a name?

383
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,083
Not yet.

384
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,833
I'm going to call her Naja.

385
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,208
Yeah. That's Naja.

386
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,041
Well, then.

387
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,791
Unless any man here
should know of any impediment,

388
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,083
you and Naja shall be together
from this day on.

389
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,666
Amen.

390
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,458
Hup, hup, hup! Hike!

391
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,541
Come on!

392
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,166
- You got it?
- I've got it.

393
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,250
That's it. That's it.

394
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
00:30:58,833 --> 00:30:59,833
Come on.

396
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,375
Anything?

397
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,250
Nothing.

398
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,375
No life here. I didn't even see a bird.

399
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,333
No food for the dogs.

400
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,666
- What have you done to this?
- What?

401
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,166
This.

402
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,166
- I've not done anything.
- You must've done something.

403
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,708
It's not working anymore.
Are you a complete idiot?

404
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,458
- We're fucked without this.
- Captain, I...

405
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,500
Just fix it. Fix it.

406
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,666
Without the Primus,
we're as good as dead, understand?

407
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,791
- You do understand that?
- Can you pass the kettle, Captain?

408
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,416
We'll have to go half ration from now on.

409
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,416
Now repack your sledge.

410
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:34,916
Come on, Iversen!

411
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,333
Whoa! Whoa!

412
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,416
Whoa.

413
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:26,125
Now, we have a slight course correction
we need to make.

414
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,166
- Captain.
- Yes, Iversen?

415
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,750
Well, speak up, man.

416
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,708
Well, we have no supplies.

417
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,916
Is there a point where perhaps we...

418
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,125
Where we what?

419
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,458
- Accept that...
- Accept defeat, Iversen?

420
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,666
Do you wanna give up?

421
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,625
It's too tough?

422
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,125
Missing home?

423
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,958
No, Captain. That's...

424
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,958
We have a map. We will find it.

425
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,291
We won't find it
by standing around talking.

426
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,208
Yes, but...

427
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,166
And we will be back
on the Alabama by August.

428
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,125
We're going down to one sledge.

429
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,250
Iversen.

430
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,041
- Mm?
- Iversen, look.

431
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,541
What?

432
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:00,916
That's a cairn.

433
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,666
I think you're right!

434
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,583
Captain, they were here.

435
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,833
They were here, Captain!

436
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,541
This is a camp.

437
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Pemmican.

438
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,916
- And oxtail soup, look.
- Wait.

439
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,375
"August 8th, 1907."

440
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,791
"Being without food
for ourselves and our dogs,

441
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,833
we must leave this place and try to make
our way to coastal areas with game,

442
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,416
enough to sledge
the 580 miles back to the ship."

443
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,541
They had no food, Captain,
but they left this.

444
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,416
"We discovered
and leave a proof in this cairn

445
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,333
that Peary Channel does not exist."

446
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,291
"Navy Cliff is joined by land
to Heilprin Land,

447
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,500
therefore our work is almost done."

448
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,291
"We hope to reach the ship before the end
of September, with or without dogs."

449
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,875
"Lieutenant Mylius-Erichsen,

450
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,125
leader of Denmark Expedition
to Northeast Greenland."

451
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,500
Robert Peary and the Americans were wrong.

452
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,166
This is it.

453
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,208
This is it.

454
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,333
This is why we came.

455
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,166
It's beautiful, isn't it?

456
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:24,541
Beautiful.

457
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:28,333
I don't really understand
why what we found is so important,

458
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,916
but seeing you smile, Captain,
seeing you laugh...

459
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,083
Greenland is one.

460
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,625
The USA has no claim here.

461
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,083
Denmark will thank you
one day, Iver Iversen.

462
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,541
It's time to celebrate.
Now you put that soup on.

463
00:37:58,625 --> 00:37:59,625
Mm.

464
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,000
We can go home now, Iversen.

465
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,625
Like walking from Rome to Moscow
looking for a stack of stones.

466
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,875
What was that?

467
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,458
That's what the guys were saying
on the ship.

468
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,500
Well, you can put them straight now.

469
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,125
Home, to Alabama.

470
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,416
And then home sweet home.

471
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,000
Do you think we could eat the liver?

472
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,375
The rest is skin and bone.

473
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,375
Wouldn't that be poisonous?

474
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,083
Because it died of exhaustion?

475
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,958
Oh, we shouldn't risk it.

476
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,708
But what's that thing

477
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,208
about a silver spoon
in a pot with anything poisonous?

478
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,500
Changes color.

479
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,583
Exactly.

480
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,208
Shame we don't have any silver.

481
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,625
You have silver?

482
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,208
That I do.

483
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,125
What?

484
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,333
What is it?

485
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,375
You said you didn't have anyone back home.

486
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:49,958
You traveled light.

487
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:53,958
It was a present.

488
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,500
All right, let's do it.

489
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
What should it be?

490
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,291
- I don't remember.
- No, I don't remember either.

491
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,791
Should it go green?

492
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,000
If it's poisonous?

493
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,833
Yeah. I think so.

494
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,208
Sounds about right.

495
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,166
- That's... not green.
- That's more brown than green.

496
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,958
It's definitely not green.

497
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,458
Shit!

498
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,291
Bloody dogs!

499
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,125
Shit.

500
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,250
Captain!

501
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,458
Give me your hand!

502
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,791
You're okay. You're okay!

503
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:16,708
I've got it.

504
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's okay.

505
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,041
I can't believe
this was the only thing that got torn.

506
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Right.

507
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,041
That should do it.

508
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,208
Warm enough, Captain?

509
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,083
Losing two dogs like that.

510
00:45:58,416 --> 00:45:59,708
That was our chance.

511
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,500
- What?
- The bear.

512
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,375
Just like us.

513
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,791
Hungry for meat.

514
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:19,916
I miss them.

515
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,375
Who?

516
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,583
Women.

517
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,041
Me too.

518
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,833
Not like that.

519
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,500
Their company, female company.

520
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,750
They're different, aren't they?

521
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,375
Their voices, their smell.

522
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,125
I do miss their laughter.

523
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:44,208
I remember when I was 16,
about to join the Navy,

524
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:49,708
my grandfather asked
if I'd go with him to Copenhagen Harbor.

525
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,458
I thought we were going to look at ships,
so I went along,

526
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,083
even packing a lunch for the two of us,

527
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,500
but he had other plans.

528
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,875
He wanted to make sure
I was ready to set sail

529
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,250
and, in his words, "be a man."

530
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,708
So he took me to the red-light district

531
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,291
to introduce me to women,

532
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:14,250
make sure I wasn't embarrassed
on my travels.

533
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,041
I just went along with it.

534
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:21,333
Ended up with this older woman.

535
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,458
I must admit,

536
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,875
she did expand my knowledge greatly.

537
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,125
When I was 16,

538
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,291
my dad took me to the hospital,

539
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,166
to the venereal-disease ward,

540
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:44,250
to show me the dire consequences
of such behavior.

541
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,666
It was fucking disgusting.

542
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,208
Captain?

543
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,166
What are you doing?

544
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,833
Captain. Captain, stop. Stop!

545
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,791
What are you doing? Stop.

546
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,333
What are you doing?

547
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,458
We have to travel light
if we're gonna make it.

548
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,750
We'll leave everything
that's not absolutely vital.

549
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,666
There's another 200 miles to the ship.

550
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,750
We need to cross here.

551
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,750
What?

552
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,166
- Why can't we go around?
- We won't have time.

553
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,166
We need to build a cairn.

554
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,458
You don't think we can make it, do you?

555
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,750
If we don't, we lose everything.

556
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:22,666
At least if the proof
and our journals are kept here in a cairn,

557
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,125
they can be found.

558
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:36,541
Good.

559
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,125
Iversen.

560
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:42,791
We can do this.

561
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,291
This is what happened
to Mylius-Erichsen, isn't it?

562
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,250
Let's go.

563
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
What is it?

564
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,125
Nothing.

565
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,291
I just need to lie down for a second.

566
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,916
Get up. Come on.

567
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,250
Come on. Get up.

568
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,500
Get up.

569
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:17,875
Look.

570
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,166
That's the Alabama!

571
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,500
- We're back!
- We're back!

572
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:23,583
We're back!

573
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,708
The wayfarers are back!

574
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:27,875
Sound the bell!

575
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,708
Sound the bell!

576
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,000
- It's on land.
- What?

577
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,208
The mast, it's on land.

578
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,041
But where's my ship?

579
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:45,916
I don't know.

580
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,833
They've built a hut
with parts of the ship.

581
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Hello?

582
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:17,666
Hello?

583
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,708
- Hello?
- Hello?

584
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,291
No, they've left us! They've left us!

585
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,208
No! No!

586
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,791
No, no!

587
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,125
You just left?

588
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,208
We had no choice, sir.

589
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:51,291
The Alabama was wrecked,
crushed by the ice.

590
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,583
We had to leave when we had the chance.

591
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,375
We left enough food
to last at least a year.

592
00:54:56,458 --> 00:55:00,166
- Let's pray they make it back.
- They want more than prayers.

593
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:04,583
You're asking the government to fund
another rescue attempt. Is that correct?

594
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:09,541
Lieutenant Laub, it's not your first visit
to the Arctic, is it?

595
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,208
No, sir. It was my fourth.

596
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,791
And Lieutenant Jørgensen?

597
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,083
My fourth also.

598
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,000
And who is this man, Iver Iversen?

599
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,000
Our mechanic, sir.

600
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:25,958
His name is not on the original crew list.

601
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,041
No.
He joined Alabama in Reykjavik.

602
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,000
Mm-hm.

603
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:34,833
And how come a mechanic
is chosen to accompany Mikkelsen

604
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,541
on the second sled journey?

605
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:41,250
- Hm?
- He volunteered.

606
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:43,625
Volunteered. Hm...

607
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:47,666
Did he have any experience
as an Arctic explorer?

608
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,083
No, sir.

609
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:53,458
This was his first time in the Arctic.

610
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:58,333
So, three dead men the first time around
and now two more on the rescue attempt.

611
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,416
Sir, there's no proof that they're...

612
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,333
Proof!

613
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:03,166
Nobody brings home any proof.

614
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:07,083
Now, you two both knew
that the chances of success were minimal.

615
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:10,208
Even less so
when you allow an inexperienced greenhorn

616
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,541
to volunteer for an early death.

617
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,208
I can't possibly justify more expense
on another fruitless mission.

618
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,875
Minister, nobody wants
to waste government funds.

619
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:22,958
Sir!

620
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,333
We were rescued by a whaler.

621
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,666
Perhaps if we can put up a reward.

622
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:31,708
Thank you, Lieutenant.

623
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:46,958
It's gonna be fine.

624
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:50,625
Is it?

625
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,666
A ship will come.

626
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,916
- I can't believe they left us.
- Exactly.

627
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,833
How did they leave us?

628
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,833
They got picked up by a passing ship.

629
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:06,541
The same will happen to us.

630
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,333
If it doesn't?

631
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,833
It will.

632
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,625
<i>They think we're dead.</i>

633
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,750
<i>No one thinks we're dead.</i>

634
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,750
<i>Late summer next year,</i>

635
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,625
<i>a ship will come.</i>

636
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,250
Do you have the postcard?

637
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,041
Imagine if they could see us now.

638
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,083
Probably best they can't.

639
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:35,000
What would you do if a girl
suddenly came walking towards us

640
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,291
from across the ice?

641
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,291
Well, that's not gonna happen.

642
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,083
No, but if it did?

643
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,583
But how?

644
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:49,583
I don't know.

645
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,291
Maybe a hot-air balloon.

646
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,250
Like Salomon Andrée.

647
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,916
- Is that the guy that went missing?
- Yeah. I met him once.

648
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:04,208
I was 15.

649
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,500
I walked all the way
from Copenhagen to Gothenburg to see him.

650
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,708
He was gonna fly his hot-air balloon
to the North Pole.

651
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,541
I wanted to join his expedition.

652
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,333
- At 15?
- Mm.

653
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,541
Bet he was thrilled
to meet a 15-year-old you!

654
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,125
He explained to me that I was too young,

655
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:27,208
but then he paid for me
to catch the train back to Copenhagen.

656
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,125
I guess, in a way,

657
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,375
he saved my life.

658
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,833
- Look what I found.
- Hm!

659
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,458
- Broken though.
- Too bad.

660
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:56,541
I see.

661
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
There you go.

662
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,375
Iver.

663
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,208
Yeah?

664
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:34,291
We need to go back.

665
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:36,666
To the cairn.

666
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,916
To get the journals and the proof.

667
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,333
If a bear finds it...

668
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,750
- We should never have left it.
- Right now?

669
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:49,041
We need to get back here
for when the sea opens up again.

670
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:51,875
Really?

671
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,750
- Captain.
- Yes?

672
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,083
- Do you think we should leave a note?
- No, Iver.

673
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,791
As I told you,
we'll be back before the ice breaks.

674
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,958
Yeah, but it's 200 miles there
and 200 miles back.

675
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,166
For the love of God,
can we just get going?

676
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,625
Suppose it's true.

677
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,625
It's not true.

678
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,125
Well, suppose it is.

679
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,333
It's not.

680
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,958
They say there's truth in every dream.

681
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:42,500
Well, I hope for your sake
there's no truth in my dreams.

682
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,750
I mean, I really couldn't go back.

683
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,416
Imagine arriving back in Copenhagen.

684
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,583
"Oh, you're back!"

685
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,583
"Well done. Where's your work?"

686
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,875
"Oh, sorry, sir. It got eaten by a bear."

687
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,333
The shame of it.

688
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,291
No, no, no.

689
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:17,958
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

690
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:22,500
No, no, no!

691
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,625
What do you think did this?

692
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,416
- I don't...
- No?

693
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,500
I don't know.

694
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,333
A bear.

695
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,125
Yeah.

696
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,083
They say there's truth
in every dream, Iversen.

697
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,708
They say there's truth in every dream.

698
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,250
See it?

699
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:52,916
Is it...

700
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:54,666
No, it can't be.

701
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,375
Is that it, Captain? Is that...

702
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:01,458
Is that the car...
from the Denmark Expedition?

703
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,750
It's a Crossley!

704
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,833
That's ridiculous.

705
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Hm...

706
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,291
It is a Crossley.

707
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,000
- Watch that rock.
- Yeah.

708
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,250
Captain.

709
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,458
- What?
- Captain, someone's here.

710
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:02,916
Hello?

711
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:21,333
"July 23rd, 1911."

712
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,416
"Looking for...

713
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,625
Ejnar Mikkelsen."

714
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
"No sign."

715
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,333
"Joseph Motzfeldt."

716
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,666
"Bergen."

717
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,875
Could've been worse.

718
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,125
Go on, say it.

719
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:56,791
Say what?

720
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,333
I'm just saying it could've been worse.
Could've been worse.

721
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,750
What could've been worse?

722
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,458
I'm just saying...

723
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,625
- If we'd...
- Don't be clever, Iver.

724
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,916
I know what you want to say.

725
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,625
Yes, we should've left a fucking note!

726
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:51,791
Minister, when the sailor
found the hut, it was boarded up.

727
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,625
We never left it like that.
Someone's been there.

728
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,875
Yes, the hut.

729
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:56,958
Hm.

730
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:00,166
Do you mind if we walk and talk?

731
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:01,708
Not at all.

732
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,000
- I know you're a very busy man.
- Busy?

733
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,875
Thank you. The whole nation
seems to be rattling a begging bowl.

734
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:14,000
Then there's this Greenland issue
where we have to convince our own people

735
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,333
that it's financially viable
to maintain these wretched colonies,

736
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,666
which it's not, of course,

737
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,833
whilst trying to persuade
the rest of the world

738
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,375
that we still have
some semblance of control.

739
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:24,958
Are you in pain?

740
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:26,583
I'll survive.

741
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,875
Good, good.

742
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:31,166
Anyway, this Mikkelsen rescue business.

743
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,666
We appreciate and understand
the importance of the work he undertook,

744
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,583
of course.

745
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:38,250
The Americans,
they're desperate.

746
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,166
Sticking their little flags
in the ice all over the place

747
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,416
and this bloody Peary chap
claiming the North Pole.

748
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,166
We can't have that. It's ridiculous.

749
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,833
I'm confident that the captain
secured the evidence.

750
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:50,791
But you don't know that, do you?

751
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:55,125
Nor do you know where in this vast country
we should send a rescue mission.

752
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:59,791
- I know this is difficult for you to bear.
- They won't survive another year.

753
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:03,125
If we don't get a ship there
before the ice freezes next summer,

754
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:07,416
not only do we give up on them,
but we also give up on Greenland.

755
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,000
We have already offered
a very generous reward.

756
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,833
More than that, I cannot do.

757
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:15,458
Now, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

758
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,833
Time is up.

759

760

761
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:35,708
It's not like you.

762
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:36,791
What?

763
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:39,791
Not to know your mind.

764
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,791
Actually, can we just leave it?

765
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:45,625
It's a pretty

766
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:48,125
grim topic.

768

This is our first Christmas here,

769
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,750
Second.

770
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Second?

771
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,500
Yeah, second in the hut.

772
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:06,750
Third in Greenland.

773
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:09,708
Oh.

774
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:16,500
- Happy Christmas, Iver.
- Happy Christmas, Captain.

775
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:25,000
I'll tell you something
that I know for certain.

776
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:29,375
It's that whilst you still
had your hands, I couldn't...

777
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,875
Or at the very least fingers.

778
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,583
I don't like talking about it
or thinking about it,

779
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:37,250
but for me, it's hands
that distinguish humans from animals.

780
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:42,625
It's with our hands we can do
all the things that animals can't do.

781
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,125
So if my hands were removed before I die?

782
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,708
No hands.

783
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:51,125
Yeah, then...
Yeah, I could quite happily eat you.

784
01:11:58,541 --> 01:11:59,666
Can I just say...

785
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:12,541
So...

786
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,500
To hope.

787
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,875
Are you all right, Captain?

788
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,958
Mm.

789
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:37,041
Here! Here!

790
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,166
Hey!

791
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,708
Hey!

792
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,166
It's okay.

793
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,250
Naja?

794
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:38,583
I just missed you so much.

795
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,500
Me too.

796
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,541
Captain, it's getting cold out here.
Come back inside.

797
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:08,791
You okay?

798
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:32,583
Captain, have you...

799
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,458
Oh, yeah.

800
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:40,500
Irritating little bastard.

801
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,333
<i>Was this worth it?</i>

<i>Is this what you wanted?</i>

803
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,875
There's still time, isn't there?

804
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:36,333
For a ship?

805
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:38,458
Yeah.

806
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,083
For someone to come.

807
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:43,666
The ice isn't completely
impassable yet, is it?

808
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,375
I'm going to look anyway.

809
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,250
Water's just boiled.

810
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,291
I'm worried about him.

811
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:08,333
He seems okay.

812
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,791
He seems okay.

813
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:11,875
We can all <i>seem </i>okay.

814
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,041
But inside...

815
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,125
he's not the same.

816
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:20,833
I think he's taken it hard.

817
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:27,500
I think he's blaming me

818
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:29,750
for missing the ship.

819
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,458
We need to keep an eye on him,

820
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,416
make sure things don't get too much.

821
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,083
Do you believe in ghosts, Captain?

822
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:48,791
Ghosts?

823
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,875
Like... dead people still here?

824
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,166
Don't be daft.

825
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,041
I met my grandfather earlier.

826
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:02,708
Your grandfather?

827
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,625
Here?

828
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,166
No. Just up on the hill.

829
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:09,750
Wh-what do you mean you met him?

830
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,083
You sensed him? You felt his presence?

831
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:14,166
No.

832
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,625
I'm not sure.

833
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,958
I think he may have passed away

834
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,375
whilst we've been here.

835
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:36,625
It doesn't necessarily mean he's dead.

836
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:39,500
No. Maybe not.

837
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,916
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm really sorry.

838
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,791
- I didn't mean to...
- No.

839
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,833
- If there's anything I can, you know...
- I know.

840
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:00,458
You're always here.

841
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,375
What if you never come home?

842
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,833
You had everything.

843
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:44,416
- We were going to get married.
- I didn't have an option.

844
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,625
- I couldn't see another way.
- Someone else could do this. Why you?

845
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,416
No one else could have done this.

846
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:56,291
I don't know why it had to be me,
but it did. It was always going to be me.

847
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:02,583
What about Iver? Did he have a choice?

848
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:05,458
He volunteered. He knew the dangers.

849
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:14,291
You do know
that no one is coming to get you?

850
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,375
- I know.
- Don't you?

851
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:16,458
I know.

852
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,500
I shouldn't have left you.

853
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,041
I'm sorry.

01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:59,291
Okay. All right.

879
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,500
- All right.
- Yeah.

880
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:03,583

- Mm.

881
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,875

01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:09,958
Okay.

one.

01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:51,833
Yes!

887
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,166
Morning, Captain.

888
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,916
You've been asleep for hours.

889
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,333
I was dreaming.

890
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:03,666
I was home.

891
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,083
Hm! That's nice for you.

892
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,000
How's the, um, neck holding up?

893
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,416
I had a dream too.

894
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,541
I almost feel guilty about it.

895
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,625
I know you picked her,

896
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:26,750
but I guess last night,
she decided to pick me,

897
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,083
if you know what I mean.

898
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,500
Did you see the tracks outside?

899
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:41,791
I'll go and have a look.
Might be a rabbit or something.

900
01:27:47,666 --> 01:27:49,125
I don't want to know.

901
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,125
It was just a dream.

902
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:54,208
I don't want to know.

903
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,083
I'm gonna kill him.

904
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,750
You took her!

905
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:19,833
You took her! You took her!

906
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:23,958
Captain.

907
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:28,666
Stop, stop. Stop!

908
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,875
- She was mine!
- It's okay.

909
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,750
- Mine!
- It's okay.

910
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:05,416
Captain, it's not real.

911
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:07,875
Calm down.

912
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:09,833
It's not real.

913
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,125
No, no, no!

914
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:15,291
- Captain, put it down.
- Don't do this!

915
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:18,333
It isn't real.

916
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:22,000
- Calm down.
- Don't do this. It's not real.

917
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,458
It's not real.

918
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,500
- Don't do this!
- Put the gun down.

919
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:26,783
- Stop!
- It's not real!

920
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,083
- Put it down.
- Put it down!

921
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:29,625
- Put it down!
- Ejnar, stop!

922
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,125
Just...

923
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,333
I'm sorry, Iver.

924
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,833
It never happened.

925
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:48,708
Okay?

926
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,083
How much food do we have left?

927
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,750
Hardly any.

928
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:08,500
- Ammunition?
- We <i>had </i>two cartridges.

929
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,500

No<i>.</i>

931
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:52,416
It's a bear!

932
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,000
Where's the rifle?

933
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:56,416
- It's in the storage hut!
- What?

934
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,083
Make noise. Make noise!

935
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,750
You think it's gone?

936
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,750
I don't know.

937
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,291
Iver?

938
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:11,583
Iver?

939
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,333
Iver. Iver.

940
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:17,041
The bear. The bear!

941
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:25,875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

942
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:30,416
One chance. One shot. Don't miss.

943
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,708
One, two, three.

944
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:39,208
Okay. Hey.

945
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,833
Give me your weapon.

946
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:46,875
You're safe.

947
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:53,500
It's okay.

948
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,750
You're going home now.

949
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:24,375
<i>What is the single
most important task for an explorer?</i>

950
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:30,875
<i>When you travel into unknown lands

951
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:36,125
<i>it is to ensure the records

952
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:39,083
<i>are delivered back safe and sound,</i>

<i>with or without you.</i>

01:34:43,291 --> 01:34:46,000
<i>Otherwise, it is all in vain.</i>

955
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:51,833
<i>The blood, sweat and tears
would all be for nothing.</i>

956

<i>Unlike the honorable members

Mm.

965
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,166
It only went and sunk.

966
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:31,541

967
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:34,666
Lucky.

968

01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,500
No.

I'm the lucky one.

971
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:47,500
