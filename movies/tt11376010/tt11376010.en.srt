<i>What made Kurupt FM different is</i>

34
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,437
we always played the same songs.

35
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:33,576
Not a lot of DJs do that.

36
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:34,976

00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,745
Charnice, please take
your break. Thank you.

158
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,947
I'd recognize
that MC voice anywhere.

159
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,417
Beats, you piece of shit!

160
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:10,786
Fucking hell.

161
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,819
- Yes, bruv.
- How you doing?

162
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,088
Ah, what are you doing here?

163
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,956
Uh, well,
got some big news, ain't I?

164
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,692
- Yeah, I already told Kevin.
- Oh, well, I wanted to tell him.

165
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,027
- We're definitely going, yeah.
- Yeah, we're going, mate.

166
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,694
It's happening.
It's happening, mate.

167
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,030
- Sold the van. I sold the van.
- Sick.

168
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,830
- I've quit my job.
- He's quit his job.

169
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,265
- Wow, fucking hell. That's mad.
- Hey, we're doing it.

170
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,134
- Kevin. - We're doing it.
- It's happening.

171
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,002
- It's happening. It's happening.
- Yeah, mate. - Kevin, Kevin.

172
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:27,870
Did you call Jeff, yeah?

173
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,271
My son slash boss.

174
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:30,705
I'm not your son.

175
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,407
Well, stepson,
but same smoky eyes,

176
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,176
so people assume I'm his dad,
which I love.

177
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,377
- So yeah.
- Can you just get back to work?

178
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,012
Uh, I'm a proud dad, Craig.

179
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,882
Craig, what do you think
of your dad's record deal?

180
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:41,316
Yeah, just get off me and just
go finish your shift, yeah?

181
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:42,317
Fine.

182
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,419
- Yeah.
- That's mad.

183
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:44,687
- Mad, innit?
- Yeah.

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,055
Ah, bruv.

185
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,389
When the music industry
come knocking

186
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:49,124
at your door, like,
you drop everything.

187
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,992
Yeah, yeah, you rush to
that door and you open it.

188
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,326
- And guess who's standing there.
- Who?

189
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,395
Tiny little three-foot
Japanese fella.

190
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:55,163
No, he's not tiny.

191
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,066
- It's a massive record label...
- A lot of them are.

192
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,134
Yeah, well, and it's a massive
record label and he's saying,

193
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,269
"Oh, I want to sign you lot.
I want to take your lot track,

194
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:04,338
put it on a TV show and fly you
out to Japan immediately.

195
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,375
Yeah, and-and we say,
"Yeah, definitely,

196
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,444
as long as you lot
pay for flights and hotels."

197
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:09,977
- Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

198
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,847
- They agreed?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

199
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,915
What did you say?

200
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,315
- I said, "Yeah."
- Yeah.

201
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,017
I just want to thank everyone

202
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,486
for the past year and a half
of working with me.

203
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,854
I've had the greatest time.

204
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,389
Wilf, Charnice,

205
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:22,958
- thank you for all your support.
- Kevin, Kevin.

206
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,258
Hey, get off. Get off.

207
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,794
And Kurupt FM
are taking over Japan!

208
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,296
Anyway, see you in a bit, mate.

209
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:29,431
Nice one, Kevin.

210
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,266
- <i>Angel!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

211
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,435
<i>Angel, come help Daddy
fold his clothes.</i>

212
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,403
You know he struggles.

213
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,773
Got it. Great.

214
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,007
What are you doing?

215
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,843
Just trying to fit
everything in.

216
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,143
They're gonna get all creased
and you're gonna be upset.

217
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,846
Angel! We got a plane to catch!

218
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,213
<i>What's the first thing</i>

219
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,848
you guys are gonna do in Japan?

220
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,483
- Uh, what are we gonna do, babe?
- Uh, right...

221
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,185
- Get some good pictures basically, won't we?
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,221
We're just gonna, like,
take in the culture

223
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,989
by getting selfies everywhere.

224
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,389
Beats, you still there?

225
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:56,759
Yeah, still here, mate.

226
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,059
- Is Roche there?
- Did that stop...

227
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,461
- I see her.
- Huh?

228
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,496
I haven't seen her for ages.
Let me see.

229
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:01,997
I-I can hear her.

230
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,231
Hi.

231
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,199
Is Roche coming to Japan
as well?

232
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,136
- No. - Oh, that's sad.
- It's not sad.

233
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:08,903
Not everyone wants to go.

234
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:10,472
- Look, babe.
- <i>My talent alone</i>

235
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,541
has taken my whole family
to the best city in the world,

236
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:14,810
- Japan.
- Japan.

237
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,411
Who's that? Robyn?

238
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,479
Hello!

239
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,514
Hello! It's Uncle Tony!

240
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,848
It's Uncle Tony!

241
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:22,350
Hello!

242
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,154
- Oh, she's hiding.
- She's hiding from you.

243
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,955
Yeah, she's a bit scared.

244
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:28,956
She's not scared.

245
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,992
Bubby...

246
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,459
It's Uncle Tony!

247
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:32,494
Hello!

248
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,496
Right.

249
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,865
Yeah, record labels don't
normally fly managers out,

250
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,902
so I'll have to sell the Merc.

251
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,435
To four different people.

252
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,438
Whoever gets here first
can have it.

253
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,474
I'll be long gone by then.

254
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,044
Gonna miss the Merc.

255
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:52,014
- Is it actually a Merc?
- Yeah.

256
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:55,350
Bon voyage.

257
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,489
<i>Well, I'm good to go.</i>

258
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,926
So what have you got there?

259
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,594
So we got uppers, downers, uh,

260
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,330
ones to help you sleep.

261
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:10,365
These ones wake you up.

262
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:12,533
Um, those are good for anxiety,
which is good

263
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:16,370
'cause pretty much
all of these create anxiety.

264
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:18,539
And... yeah.

265
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:22,076
Now just got to get it all
up my ass and we're good to go.

266
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:26,048
<i>Yeah, Japan sounds sick
and everything,</i>

267
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,082
but, uh, apparently they've got

268
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:30,485
a massive drugs problem
over there.

269
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:34,590
Um, you can't get drugs
anywhere.

270
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:37,092
All packed for Japan.

271
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,561
So that's something
that I'm having

272
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:41,864
to take into consideration.

273
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,067
- Do you not have a door?
- Huh?

274
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,571
Are you filming?

275
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,544
Here you go, airport.

276
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,578
Do you know
where the Japan entrance is?

277
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,081
- Over there, mate.
- Oh, that way.

278
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,548
Yeah.

279
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,254
Yeah, once the condoms ran out,

280
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,221
I just started getting
sandwich bags.

281
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:10,259
- A bit bigger, but you can sort of fold them into...
- Yeah.

282
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,494
Just... they still stayed
in all right, to be honest.

283
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,363
That's not Kurupt FM, is it?

284
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:16,464
Oh. Kurupt FM is back.

285
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:19,201

00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,905
Okay, guys, I've got
the boarding passes.

289
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:26,341
- You did there?
- I've printed them out.

290
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:27,909
- Okay.
- Oh, sick, guys.

291
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,510

- No.

292
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:32,514
Um, okay, Deeky, that's for you.

Yeah, okay. Don't touch it.

Don't touch it. Steven Green.

296
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:39,321
There we go. Kevin Bates.

297
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,089
- There you go. Good to go.
- Yes.

298
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,990
Uh, last but not least...

299
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,426
Yeah, yeah.

300
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,227
Oh, Lady Miche.
Sorry, uh, I didn't know...

301
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,962
I didn't know
that you were coming.

302
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,630
- Uh, they only paid for the boys to come.
- Are you joking?

303
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,299
They-they haven't even paid
for me; I had to pay for myself.

304
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,634
Why the fuck
didn't you tell me earlier?

305
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,503
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't know.

306
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,203
- I thought they were just coming to wave us off, friendly.
- No.

307
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:58,606
What?

308
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:04,179
So, sorry to butt in,
but we are cutting into

309
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,114
very valuable duty-free time.

310
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,482
- Yeah, no, I know you're excited about duty-free though.
- Yeah.

311
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:08,582
Tell you what, I can hustle it.

312
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,217
I will negotiate,

313
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:11,452
and I'll say he needs
his hair and makeup team.

314
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:13,020
- We'll fly you out.
- Yes.

315
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:14,322
- Okay, thanks, yeah.
- Yes, duty-free!

316
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,258
- We'll see you in a bit, yeah?
- Yeah.

317
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,225
- What even is duty-free?
- Um, it's this place,

318
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,062
apparently, where they've got
massive Toblerones

319
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,463
and, uh, big packs
of fags and that.

320
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:22,563
- You're joking. Toblerones.
- Yeah.

321
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:24,131
And you look after mummy
as well.

322
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:25,634
- Decoy, come on!
- Yeah. - Yeah? All right.

323
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,202
- Decoy! Dude!
- I'm just saying bye.

324
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,605
Taking ages with
weird emotional goodbyes.

325
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:32,374
- Bye. I'll see you guys later, yeah?
- Bye-bye. We'll see you.

326
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,109
- Grindah's trying Toblerone.
- Bye, now.

327
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,111
- We're gonna watch.
- Come on, hurry up. - Sorry.

328
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,645
- Love you!
- Uh, yeah, same!

329
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:38,746
- Yeah.
- Bye!

330
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,514
- Hello, mate.
- Hi.

331
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,650
- MC Grindah.
- Beg your pardon?

332
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,587
And where are you
traveling to today?

333
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,490
Tokyo. Uh...

334
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:51,326
We just got signed to a music...
you know the... yeah.

Sir. Sir.

336
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:56,097
<i>Oh, mate. Big risk, big risk.</i>

337
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,665
<i>But you know what?
This is what entrepreneurs do.</i>

338
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:00,067
<i>We take risks, you know?</i>

339
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,202
I mean, look at me, yeah?

340
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:03,004
I came to this country in '95

341
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,538
with nothing but five pound
and my brother's passport.

342
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,341
My passport.

343
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,146
My passport.

344
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:13,681
Where you traveling to today?

345
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,517
- Japan.
- Japan?

346
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,287
And what are you doing
over there?

347
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,455
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

348
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,992
Uh... business. Sorry.

349
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,195
- Okay.
- Yeah?

350
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,663
Good to go.

351
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,731
- Oh, thank God.
- Thanks.

Y-You actually fucked someone?

384
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:41,635
No, on my own.

385
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,672
Just had a wank, isn't it?

386
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:46,708
Mate.

387
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,576
I'm gonna have a nap, yeah?

388
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,212
I'm knackered after that.

389
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,514
Was gushing out.
It was gushing out, mate.

390
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,883
From the pressure.

391
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,686
Came out like
a bloody burst pipe, mate.

392
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,194
- Miche.
- Can I ask you a massive favor?

393
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:08,596
So basically I've told
the entire Internet

394
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,197
that I've gone to Japan
with Grindah,

395
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,432
but now it turns out
we weren't included.

396
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,368
Oh, fuck. Sorry.

397
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,902
It's okay though.
I've got a plan.

398
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,872
- All right. Uh...
- Can I just...?

399
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:19,507
- You got chopsticks?
- What?

400
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,243
Can you bring those in, Angel?

401
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,477
- Give us that one.
- Oh, I'm so tired, you know.

402
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,514
Aren't we going home?

403
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,481
We can't go home.

404
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:29,350
But why can't you
go home?

405
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,653
- We're supposed to be in Japan.
- One more.

406
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:40,461
What are you doing, Steve?

407
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,464
Bruv, I need to open the window.

408
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:43,764
Well, you can't open the window.

409
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,799
No, I'm suffocating.
I need to get off.

410
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:48,202
Well, you can't get off.
We're on a plane, Steven.

411
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,571
We need to get off it because...

412
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,540
Fuck are you two doing, man?

413
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,274
- What the fuck's going on?
- The plane's shrinking.

414
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:54,942
Steve's being weird.
I think his wraps have burst.

415
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,544
Bruv, you missed it.
The plane's shrinking,

416
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,312
and, well,
I need to tell the pilot.

417
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,681
No, the plane's normal size,
innit?

418
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,416
- What?
- Let's get our heads together.

419
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:02,783
- Tie this around him.
- 'Cause... Ah, what's that?

420
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,451
- Where are they coming down?
- What?

421
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,556
Steve, we just need you
to calm down.

422
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:08,623
- The government is sedating us.
- Keep talking to me.

423
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:10,291
Keep talking to me. Yeah.

424
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,194
When you look up in the sky,
you see those lines?

425
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:15,197
We need to speak to the crew.
I want to speak to the pilot.

426
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,764
It's all right, it's all right.
It's all right.

427
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,399
We're gonna speak to the pilot.
It's all right.

428
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,768
We're gonna speak to the pilot.

429
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,304
- It's all right.
- Steves! No.

430
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,574
No, Steves, no, no, no, don't.
They'll fucking...

431
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,308
Listen, everyone...

432
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,211
- No, no, no, you're not allowed.
- We should tell everyone.

433
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:30,579
- Come on, Steve.
- They don't know what's happening, do they?

434
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:32,346
- Shh. - Come on.
- Everybody, get down.

435
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,514
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's all good.

436
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:34,515
We're his carers.

437
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:35,549
It's been compromised.

438
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,552
The plane's been compromised.

439
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:39,487
I never take
more than I can handle.

440
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,688
That's the key with drugs.

441
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,790
Know your limit

442
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,825
and take exactly that amount.

443
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,495
- Oh, no. No.
- It's all right, mate.

444
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:48,964
Ah, shit.

445
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:51,699
Oh, fuck's sake.

446
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,300
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- We need to get away.

447
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,868
- We need to get away.
- What are you doing?

448
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:56,004
<i>And literally
the only side effects</i>

449
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,240
<i>I've ever had from drugs is</i>

450
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,675
I've got dyslexia
from smoking skunk,

451
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,745
and I got a free laptop
for that.

452
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,313
So, in a way, it was a victory.

453
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:08,582
- Tie his hands up!
- Why can't anyone see?!

454
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:11,285
- Shut up, Steve.
- Why can't you see?

455
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,354
Can't take him anywhere.

456
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,423
<i>Uh, look happier, Angel.</i>

457
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:17,992
- Why?
- Come on. Smile for the camera.

458
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,860
You're in Japan.
You should be happy.

459
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,364
- We're not in Japan.
- Well, eat some noodles, then.

460
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,598
No.

461
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,466
This is so stupid.

462
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,768
If you're gonna look
miserable, then pout at least.

463
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,036
- All right, Miche?
- Oh, yeah, Roche.

464
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,837
Can you get a pic
for us actually?

465
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,572
'Cause I'm struggling a bit
to get one of the two of us.

466
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,542
Do you not think that this is
maybe completely mental?

467
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:36,778
No, God, no. I need to be there
with, um, Grindah in Japan.

468
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:38,812
- I'm supporting him.
- But you're not there.

469
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,816
I am on Instagram.

470
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:42,917
Temple.

471
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,853
I haven't been to that temple.

472
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:46,320
God, you could've fooled me.

473
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,355
Yeah, exactly.

474
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,923
I'm not doing that.

475
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:51,826
Well, you are.
'Cause you're in Japan.

476
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,629
No, I'm tired of this.

477
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:56,764
Kids.
They won't do anything.

478
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,799
- They don't want to go to school.
- Yeah.

479
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,567
They don't want to go to Japan.
What do they want?

480
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,870
- Yeah.
- Right. It's the kids that's the problem, innit?

481
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,738
Yeah. Hard work.

482
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,005
All right.

483
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,808
Well, have a lovely,
um, evening.

484
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:10,078
Oh, thank you.
Or as you say in Japan...

485
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,413
Thank you.

486
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,548
All right.

487
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,950
Should we take
his life jacket off?

488
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:17,018
Nah.

489
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,019
Great neck support actually.

490
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,323
- Yeah.
- Might get mine out.

491
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,626
You might not be up for this,

492
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,463
but do you want to watch <i>Fast &
Furious</i> at the exact same time?

493
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,898
- Um...
- We can talk about it while it plays.

494
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,299
I'd love nothing more.

495
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,370
Three, two, one.

496
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,038
- Nice.
- Yeah, spot-on.

497
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,406
- Perfectly in sync.
- Exact same time, yeah.

498
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:45,446
- I wonder if we're gonna have fans at the airport.
- Yeah.

499
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,881
- Put shades on him.
- What are you doing, mate?

500
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,415
- I want to go home now.
- Come here. - Come on.

501
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:49,817
- Get your bag on.
- I want to go home now.

502
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,619
Sorry, sir, can I...

503
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:52,987
sorry, can I take this from you
before you leave, please?

504
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,689
- What is it?
- Uh, I'm sorry.

505
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:56,525
You can't leave the aircraft
with this on.

506
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,561
Smell that.

507
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,895
- Petrol.
- No, it's success.

508
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,576
- <i>Japan City!</i>
- <i>Yay!</i> - <i>Japan!</i>

509
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:15,909
Look at the Eiffel Tower.

510
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,511
That is mad, innit?

511
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,080
Oh, yeah, fuck.
They must have moved it.

512
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:21,082
Oh, my days. Look how much neon
there is everywhere.

513
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,585
Oh, God, whoever does
their electricity...

514
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,653
- Scottish Power, they must be raking it in up here.
- Yeah.

515
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,554
Jesus Christ.

516
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:28,822
Look, mate.

517
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,525
Kurupt FM!

518
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,727
Oh, they was all looking.
They was all looking.

519
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,662
Think I might be sick on myself.

520
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:35,829
No, open me first.

521
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,164
This is it, boys.

522
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,700
You all right?

523
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,033
These are bellboys.

524
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,068
They're gonna take
our luggage for us.

525
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:42,437
- Bellboys.
- Huh?

526
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,104
- Do you get it? Bellboys.
- What?

527
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:44,105
Bellend.

528
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,474
Oh, my days, bruv.

529
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,510
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, look at the view.

530
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,646
Wow, Japan City.

531
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,581
All looks the same,
but it is sick.

532
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:54,716
- Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.
- Innit?

533
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,584
I need to go toilet.

534
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,420
- Bagsy my bed.
- Bagsy this one.

535
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:00,187
Bagsy my bed.

536
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,623
Right.

537
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,157
- You're gonna love it.
- Go. Go.

538
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:06,094
Oh, didn't realize
they had a staircase here.

539
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:09,830
Fucking hell, you bastard.

540
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,466
- Do you get it?
- Yeah, let me do one.

541
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:12,901
- Miming. Miming.
- Let me do one.

542
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,403
Uh, check this, check this,
check this.

543
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:18,739
What's that?

544
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,107
Skiing.

545
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:21,676
- Skiing.
- Ski... I'm skiing.

546
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,813
- Yeah, that's good.
- You can literally do anything.

547
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,847
- Yeah. Oh, I got another one.
- Yeah, go.

548
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,682
Go. Tap in.

549
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,153
- Level three please.
- Yeah.

550
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:35,689
- Minus three.
- Yeah.

551
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,125
Lift! Oh, I should've
thought of that.

552
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,195
- It's quite comfortable.
- Yeah.

553
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:41,763
Fucking hell.

554
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,465
- Bruv?
- Yeah.

555
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:44,899
We finally fucking made it.

556
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,601
I think we have, mate.

557
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:49,636
Madness.

558
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,044
Check this out.

559
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,811
Oh, that's insane.

560
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,047
Is this, uh, Pissing Alley?

561
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,215
- What? Huh?
- Pissing Alley.

562
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:02,983
What, can you just
piss anywhere down here?

563
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:04,818
- Yeah, basically.
- <i>What we out here for?</i>

564
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:05,920
What's it look like
we're out here for?

565
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,689
Do you know what I'm saying?

566
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:08,690
- We're out here to get a record deal. Look at us.
- Yeah.

567
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,692
Look at that.

568
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:12,025
<i>We're out here
to take over Japan,</i>

569
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:13,728
- repair their music scene...
- Yeah.

570
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,497
...and show 'em
what Kurupt FM's about.

571
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:16,798
- Right, exactly.
- Do you know what I'm saying, like?

572
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,799
Never do that chick.

573
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,168
I'd give her one.

574
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:21,201
They don't know
what they're in for.

575
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:22,236
No. Do you know what I mean?

576
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:23,671
- Lucky bastards.
- Innit?

577
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,507
15 years later,
we're here, mate.

578
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,974
- Madness. Throw your "K" s up.
- Trust me.

579
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,043
- Kurupt FM, the rebirth, like.
- Yeah.

580
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,578
- Trust me.
- Oh, I'm fucking starving, mate, to be fair.

581
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,014
- Yeah, let's get some food.
- You hungry?

582
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,016
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, I know a spot. I know a spot.

583
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:36,282
This way, boys!

584
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,752
Come on!

585
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,021
- Tokyo!
- Fucking hell, this is nuts!

586
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,490
Why is there so many crossings?

587
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:45,660
Decoy?

588
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,962
Decoy?

589
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:50,865
Decoy!

590
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,166
- Decoy!
- Over here, Steves.

591
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,302
Follow my voice.

592
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,970
Bruv, what are you going, bruv?

593
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,638
You fucking left me
in the middle of the road.

594
00:20:57,672 --> 00:20:59,606
- Do you even know where we are?
- Yeah, Tokyo.

595
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,543
- Go that way.
- Chabzy, I'm starving.

596
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:02,977
Yes, okay, we'll get ramen.

597
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:04,278
- Oh.
- Oh.

598
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,646
Wow.

599
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,914
- Mmm.
- This is soup.

600
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:07,815
- That looks delicious.
- Yeah.

601
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,250
With a brown egg in.

602
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:10,984
How's that?

603
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,854
- I don't like it.
- Ah, I don't...

604
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:14,688
Come, boys, this way.

605
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,557
Be a lot easier to read
if it was in English, innit?

606
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,925
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, mate.

607
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,728
This place is like
a bloody maze, mate.

608
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:21,962
- Bro! McD's!
- Oh!

609
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,331
- Fucking McD's!
- Got a McD's here!

610
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,066
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew I was...

611
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:26,800
I was taking them this way,
so I meant to do that.

612
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,635
Are we really gonna go,
like, McDonald's, like?

613
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,605
Oh, shut up, Decoy. Don't you
dare take this away from me.

614
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,139
Come on, Deeky.

615
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,608
- The golden arches!
- Deeky, come on!

616
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:36,978
- Bonsai! - Bonsai!
- Bonsai. Bonsai.

617
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,946
Drink this, Steves.

618
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:50,223
<i>God, it's like
the future, innit?</i>

619
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,860
Salaryman.
Check out these salarywomans.

620
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:55,797
- It's mad everyone's dressed in suits and that.
- Hello, ladies.

621
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,698
Ah, this is mad, bruv.

622
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,866
Steve?

623
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,636
Steves. Look at me.

624
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:02,937
You got to concentrate on

625
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,605
not looking like
an absolute mess, yeah?

626

00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,094
Fixer?

672
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,428
Well, if you wanted a fixer,

673
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:35,896

00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,173
No, no, I paid for myself. Yeah.

listening to my track,
that's up to you.

721
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:34,816
<i>It's like when you hear</i>

722
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:36,983
<i>a drum and bass tune
in an advert.</i>

723
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,820
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>And that drum and bass tune wasn't made</i>

724
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,153
for the new Fiat Punto.

00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:41,988
- No, it wasn't.
- Do you know what I mean?

726
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,925
It was made for ten white bros
with dreadlocks in a squat rave.

727
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:49,931
Yeah, they're nuts out here.
Yeah.

728
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:51,832
- Mental.
- This TV show

729
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:54,100
is massive in Japan,

730
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:58,038
so basically everyone in Japan
knows your track.

731
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:01,041
So what we want to do now
is to put...

732
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:03,411
- Please, uh, excuse me.
- Are you...

733
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:04,979
- Um...
- I was...

734
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,379
I'm just gonna go toilet...

735
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,849
- Steves, this is the best bit.
- Uh...

736
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:10,484
- It's just a...
- I'll show you where it is.

737
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,953
Thank you. It's just a piss,
so I won't take long.

738
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:14,889
- Thanks. - Thank you.
- Back to it. Um...

739
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,891
- Looks like a Calvin Klein advert.
- Yeah, it does as well.

740
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:20,394
Yeah. I love you guys, and I
think there's great potential.

741
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:22,262
We look fucking great
in black and white, mate.

742
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,497
Okay, so, um...

743
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,269
What the fuck are you doing?

744
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:34,141
This... the toilet sprayed me.

745
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:36,143
- Sprayed water.
- Oh.

746
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:37,310
Oh.

747
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:38,645
Does it look like
I pissed myself?

748
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,648
Yes, a little bit.

749
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,984
I actually haven't this time.

750
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,419
This time?

751
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,388
I mean, some...

752
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:50,591
- You are funny.
- Yeah, no.

753
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,326
I was joking about that.

754
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,429
- Um...
- Uh, there's a dryer in the toilet.

755
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:57,664
Okay.

756
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,533
- Can you pull the pants?
- And then take...

757
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,402
Pull-pull pants down?

758
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:04,304
No, no, no, no.
Just pull th-this area.

759
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:06,574
I've developed
a plan for you guys.

760
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:10,211
Some promo work
with TV shows and radio,

761
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:13,547
and then a big concert

762
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:16,182
to introduce you
to your Japanese fans.

763
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:18,218
- Yes! Yeah.
- Fireworks as well.

764
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:21,121
I've developed a plan,
uh, for you guys as well.

765
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,690
Um, I think
we'll do some promo work,

766
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:25,326
then big concert

767
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:28,995
to introduce you
to the Japanese fans.

768
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:31,365
Yes, what do you think?

769
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:33,134
- Yes, I agree with that.
- Yeah? Yeah.

770
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,101
- It seems he is their manager.
- Great idea. Uh...

771
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,436
Hi. Manager.

772
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,706
- The manager.
- Yeah, manager, manager.

773
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,008
- Hi.
- Hi.

774
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,871
I didn't know he was coming.
I'll sort it later.

775
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:45,378
Just get right in there.

776
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:46,713
Okay, oh.

777
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:50,418
You can... you can
put on my shoulder.

778
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,055
Thank you.

779
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:55,455
You're welcome.

780
00:27:57,257 --> 00:27:58,726
How many tracks do you have?

781
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,127
Ballpark is, uh,

782
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:04,065
- about two...
- Two...

783
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,967
I mean...

784
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,069
I mean, two, three.

785
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:11,105
- Do you know what I mean? At least.
- Max.

786
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,339
Yeah, at least max.

787
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:14,141
- So, you know.
- Two.

788
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,675
So, I mean, that's
how potent our tracks are.

789
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,311
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

790
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,080
- And-and they've lasted that test...
- Beats.

791
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,115
- Timeless. - Yeah?
- Why you showing me your crotch?

792
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:22,750
I mean, Leonardo
da Vinci only did one painting.

793
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,584
- Think about it.
- Yeah.

794
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:27,020
Um, so, um, Miki will
look after you guys...

795
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:28,422
And I'll look after you.
Obviously I'm here as well.

796
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,457
Whatever you guys need,
just ask.

797
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,727
Yes. Uh, can we get weed?

798
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:37,631
Steves, come on.

799
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,067
- No.
- Don't lower the tone.

800
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,201
Enough of the foreplay.

801
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:44,504
Let's get down... to business.

802
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:50,076
We want 10,000 Japanese yen,
up front, in cash, each.

803
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:52,212
- Yeah.
- 10,000 yen?

804
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,215
But that's just like
70 quid, right?

805
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:55,615
What do you mean it's like...
10,000.

806
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:57,083
Oh, well, not that, then.
Not-not that.

807
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,184
- Guys.
- Yeah.

808
00:28:58,218 --> 00:28:59,553
We wanted to talk to you

809
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,355
about the money side
of things as well.

810
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:03,590
Um, did the TV show
never contact you

811
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:05,125
about the rights to the song?

812
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,527
- No.
- No.

813
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,794
- Haven't got anything. Yeah.
- No.

814
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:11,432
Actually, they did
contact me, um,

815
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,199
but the thing is
I've had to actually

816
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:14,701
completely delete
my email address

817
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,303
'cause I'm in the process
of being, uh, blackmailed

818
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:18,571
- at the moment.
- Oh.

819
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:21,142
Why would they blackmail you?

820
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:22,675
Well, they said they've got
footage of me wanking

821
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,111
through the webcam,
and they're gonna upload...

822
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:25,712
Chabzy, bruv,
that's just a scam.

823
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,248
Yeah, well, then how do they
know I was wanking, Deeky?

824
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,816
Don't translate this bit.

825
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:32,052
- Uh, we'll-we'll make sure you're looked after.
- Great.

a big opportunity for you guys.

828

No, we-we don't queue.

Oh, yeah, we don't queue.

No, just act completely natural.

Nice, huh?

- Wow.
- I choose to be ginger.

859
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:41,422
- In England, it's the sign of a weaker person.
- Yeah.

860
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:43,389

Okay, guys, shall we do a toast?

so we just got to give the fans
what they want.

00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:26,219
I don't know. Can I just be,
like, a DJ at the back?

1088
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,855
Yeah, could I be
a DJ at the back as, well?

00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,760
We're doing the dance,
end of, all right?

1091
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,195
It's just what people do
out here.

1092
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:36,797
If you don't agree with it,

1093
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,831
you're basically being racist,
all right?

1094
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,967
- Yeah, I don't want to be racist.
- Good.

1095
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:42,936
It's gonna be hard for me
'cause I got jeans on.

1096
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:45,806
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to take 'em off.

1097
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:46,974
Come on.

1098
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:48,175
- Really?
- Yeah.

1099
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,776
Take your jeans off. Come on.

1100
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,913
Trust me, you're gonna thank me.

1101
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:55,315
We're gonna be playing
to thousands of people

1102
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:56,817
on a massive stage.

1103
00:38:57,983 --> 00:38:59,752
<i>Pretty lonely without the boys.</i>

1104
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:02,655
Apparently, I'm not needed.

1105
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,690
The manager.
Can you believe it?

1106
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,327
You know what it is, yeah?

1107
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,230
Taka's trying to push me out.

1108
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:13,032
"Oh, don't worry about coming.
We've got it all sorted."

1109
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,902
<i>Listen, Taka is not
on my level, yeah?</i>

1110
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:19,306
<i>I'm like bloody Simon Cowell.
I'm a showman.</i>

1111
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:20,974
<i>I used to run a titty bar</i>

1112
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,643
<i>back in Hounslow, yeah,
back in the '90s.</i>

1113
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,144
And I turned that place around,
you know?

1114
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:28,147
Mercedes, she was one
of our top strippers, yeah?

1115
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:30,217
She was 62, yeah?

1116
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,052
Caesarean scar, fake teeth.

1117
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,954
She was busy all night long.

1118
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:36,789
And who did that? I did that.
I turned that place around.

1119
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:38,658
I'll tell you what, yeah,
if Taka doesn't

1120
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,260
take me seriously, yeah,

1121
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:44,999
then he's gonna make himself
a very, very dangerous enemy.

1122
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:53,339
- He will help you.

Very good.

1138

It feels a bit mad,
but no, I trust you.

1139
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:24,905
This is what
the people want to see.

1140

<i>Can you MC and dance</i>

1141
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:29,175
- at the same time? Uh...
- I didn't think you could.

1142
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,744
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>But we're still working it out.</i>

1143
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,980
Yeah. But you can,
because you can have headsets.

1144
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:37,284
<i>So you're excited
about playing the gig?</i>

1145
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:38,784
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

1146

<i>Yeah, I'm excited about the gig.</i>

1147
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,788
It's just all this
sort of mad shit around it

1148
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,289
- that's a bit weird, innit?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1149
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,125
- Like, uh, all the dancing.
- Yeah.

1150
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:46,826
Yeah, but it's got to
be done, innit?

1151
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,829
Yeah, well, I mean,
a lot of people don't do it,

1152
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:50,396
- but it seems to be a thing out here.
- Yeah, well...

1153
00:40:57,003 --> 00:40:59,806
<i>One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...</i>

1154
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,307
And then we go forward.
One, two...

1155
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,476
Just concentrate on the hips.

1156
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:04,211
One, two, three, four.

1157
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:05,846
One, two... Nice.

1158
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,248
Four. One, two...

1159
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,317
Can we go karaoke later?

1160
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,887
- <i>Konnichiwa,</i> bitches!
- Wh-what...

1161
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,289
Surprise! Aw.

1162
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,291
Oh, you can see Japan
out the window.

1163
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:20,527
- So cool. I love it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's...

1164
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,429
- You flew her out?
- No, no, I didn't fly her out.

1165
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,498
I didn't... I didn't know.

1166
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,099
I-I bought a ticket.

1167
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:27,467
Oh, wow. Where did you get
the money from?

1168
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,934
Oh, Roche lent me some. Yeah.

1169
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,269
She said I should come out,

1170
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:31,471
or otherwise we'd all go
completely insane.

1171
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,405
- Uh, uh...
- The best surprise ever!

1172
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:35,341
Well, it's definitely
a surprise.

1173
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:40,480
- Oh, man, man. That's...
- Oh! It's crazy.

1174
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:43,817
Are we still sharing a room,
or am I gonna have to move?

1175
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,251
Uh, hmm.

1176
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:47,420
Wh-What did you think?
Did you have a...?

1177
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:49,288
Oh, obviously, I was gonna
stay in here with you.

1178
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,891
- Yeah? No, okay. Yeah, no.
- Yeah.

1179
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:52,425
Of course. Yeah, just...
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

1180
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,293
Shall I just get
your key card now, then? Just...

1181
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:55,896
Well, we don't
have to do it now.

1182
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,798
- How are you, then, bubby?
- Yeah.

1183
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:59,065
Tell me all about Japan.

1184
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:01,067
I love it from up here.

1185
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,802
<i>You do need to be there
to support your partner.</i>

1186
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,403
You know, it's important,

1187
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,239
even if they say
they don't want you there.

1188
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:07,907
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

1189
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,475
I'm knackered,
but I'm gonna keep going.

1190
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:11,277
'Cause I was reading about
jet lag, and I was like,

1191
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,313
- you stay awake, then it's fine.
- Yeah.

1192

<i>You know, it's about me

Has he eaten enough?
Has he eaten too much?

1194
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:20,452
You know, is he tired?
Is he happy? Is he sad?

1195
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:22,521
And, you know,
I suppose, in return,

1196
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:24,523
that gives my life some purpose.

1197
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:28,160
'Cause I'd love another baby,
but until then, I've got him.

00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:29,228
- See you later.
- You good?

1199
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:30,564
Yeah, I'm good.

1200
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:31,431
What shall we do
about the room service?

1201
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,099
Oh, she can have it.

1202
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:35,335
The honeymoon suite.

1203
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:39,039
Hello.

1204
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,539
All right? What you saying?

1205
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:42,041
Yeah, good, man. You all right?

1206
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:44,210
- Kevin.
- What you doing?

1207
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:45,612
Oh, it stinks in here, man.

1208
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,880
What's happening?

1209
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:49,149
Yes, bruv.

1210
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,417
So, I'm in here now.

1211
00:42:53,385 --> 00:42:54,887
Where can I sleep?

1212
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,388
Oh, tell you what,
you can have it.

1213
00:42:56,422 --> 00:42:59,059
Oh, no, let me just
clear it up for you.

1214
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:04,130
Sorry, I just had
a bit of a cold, basically.

1215
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:06,498
So, yeah, just go for it, man.
It's all yours.

1216
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:09,501
Beats, does it smell of skunk?

1217
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:11,070
Yeah.

1218
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:23,983
Did they straighten your hair,
as well?

1219
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:25,284
Yeah.

1220
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:28,088
It feels really weird
without the hat.

1221
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:30,023
Yeah.

1222
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:31,391
Hi, Steves.

1223
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:41,201
- Good. That's good.
- Yeah. Good, yeah?

1224
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,002
- Sweet. Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

1225
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,271
- Can I get my hat?
- Yeah.

1226
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:45,672
Yes, yes, yes.

1227
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:47,306
I'm not sure about this, mate.
It's a bit...

1228
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,643
It's not really Kurupt FM.

1229
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,443
Okay.

1230
00:43:51,476 --> 00:43:53,179
- Let's go.
- What the fuck does that mean?

1231
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,547
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

1232
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:55,681
- Signature fringe.
- Come on, boys.

1233
00:43:55,715 --> 00:43:57,017
That's spot-on.

1234
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,251
Like that?

1235
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:00,320
Um, no, a bit more front.

1236
00:44:00,353 --> 00:44:02,088
Nice.

1237
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,590
Well, Grindah... just-just
Grindah, uh, step forward.

1238
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:06,192
- Just Grindah?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:08,360
And, boys, let's step back.

1240
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:10,096
Me, like,
back here a little bit?

1241
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:12,132
- Nice.
- Bubby, remember your angles, yeah?

1242
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:14,300
- Your chin's coming out.
- Oh. Yeah, okay.

1243
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:17,304
And, Beats, step back, please.

1244
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:18,704
- Oh, with... Yeah? Okay.
- Oh, beautiful.

1245
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:20,205
I just want to make sure
we're definitely in shot.

1246
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,541
Yes. Yes.

1247
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:22,675
Definitely getting us
back there, yeah?

1248
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,244
Yes. Okay.

1249
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:25,277
Let's put them even further
back.

1250
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:26,179
- More back.
- More back.

1251
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:29,148
- More back.
- More back? Hmm.

1252
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:31,483
Well, maybe ten steps back.

1253
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:33,519
- Ten?
- Ten.

1254
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:35,221
Something like that,
just leaning?

1255
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,523
Oh, Grindah, that looks amazing.

1256
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:39,625
Feel like I'm in
quite an unnatural position.

1257
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,235
Hi. Hi.

1258
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:51,604
What does Taka wear?

1259
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:53,373
<i>I read a lot of literature.</i>

1260
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:55,574
<i>And one book that I-I love</i>

1261
00:44:55,608 --> 00:44:57,010
is Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War.</i>

1262
00:44:57,043 --> 00:44:58,345
Don't know if you've read of it.

1263
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:00,547
But in there,
he basically says that

1264
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,614
in order to defeat your enemy,

1265
00:45:02,648 --> 00:45:06,519
<i>you first must know your enemy,
become your enemy.</i>

1266
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:08,255
Oh, it's a bit tight.

1267
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:11,458
Oh, shit.

1268
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,592
Sorry. Yeah, sorry,
it's a bit tight.

1269
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:15,996
Just get... It's too small.

1270
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,697
Sorry, get... get it off me.

1271
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,432
- Slowly, slowly.
- Pull.

1272
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:21,233
- Oh.
- Oh, God.

1273
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:23,102
I nearly had
a panic attack then.

1274
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:24,403
Oh, <i>benchod.</i>

1275
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:25,739
<i>Are you jealous, then?</i>

1276
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:27,306
<i>I'm not jealous of Taka.</i>

1277
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,108
What's to be jealous of?

1278
00:45:29,141 --> 00:45:31,744
Like, yeah, okay, sure,
he's, you know, young,

1279
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,779
successful,
good-looking, handsome.

1280
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:36,583
He smells amazing.

1281
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:38,351
Like, really good.

1282
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:40,320
<i>But what's to be
jealous of, mate?</i>

1283
00:45:40,353 --> 00:45:42,021
- No. No. No.
- No. No.

1284
00:45:42,054 --> 00:45:43,455
- Yeah, probably...
- No.

1285
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:45,057
...this one.

1286
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,326
Too fat.

1287
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:48,027
<i>I'm not jealous!</i>

1288
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,030
Look at this,
look at this 'stache.

1289
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,365
He can't grow this if
his bloody life depended on it.

1290
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:54,134
Got pubes on his face, mate.

1291
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,068
<i>Taka.</i>

1292
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:57,503
Too fat.

1293
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:59,138
All right, you've said that.
Stop saying that.

1294
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,075
All right, then get me that one.

1295
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:04,144
Grindah, Grindah,

1296
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:05,612
- maybe bow to the lens.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

1297
00:46:05,644 --> 00:46:07,480
But, uh, Grindah,
look at the lens.

1298
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,581
- Okay.
- And, guys, uh, look at the ground.

1299
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:11,183
I don't know, mate.

1300
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:12,285
Can I try one where I look
at the lens as well?

1301
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:13,520
Just to see what it looks like.

1302
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:15,454
Okay, we can, we can
have a go at it.

1303
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:17,156
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, you ready?

1304
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,258
- Okay, start again, then? On three.
- Start again?

1305
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:19,659
- Okay.
- Three.

1306
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:21,094
It doesn't work.

1307
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,429
Okay, thank you.

1308
00:46:24,163 --> 00:46:26,099
<i>Are you guys a boy band now?</i>

1309
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:29,269
<i>Well, not really
a boy band as per se, but...</i>

1310
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:30,603
<i>It's going that way, though.</i>

1311
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:32,072
<i>No, it's not going that way.</i>

1312
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,472
<i>What is a boy band?</i>

1313
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:35,141
- <i>Was Heartless Crew a boy band?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

1314
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:36,643
Think about it.

1315
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:38,811
It's a group of boys
that are in a... like, a band.

1316
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:40,312
- Something like this?
- So we're together?

1317
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:42,148
- Yeah, like...
- Um, actually,

1318
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:44,184
- let's do individual ones.
- Okay. - Okay.

1319
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:59,665
Uh, just me. Cheers.

1320
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:02,302
<i>I declare war, Taka!</i>

1321
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:03,769
<i>Have you told him that?</i>

1322
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:05,737
<i>No, I haven't told him that yet.</i>

1323
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:08,807
But when I see him,
I'm declaring war.

1324
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,676
Lovely to meet you, Taka.

1325
00:47:12,777 --> 00:47:14,313
<i>He doesn't really know
there's a war going on,</i>

1326
00:47:14,347 --> 00:47:16,349
<i>but I know
there's a war going on.</i>

1327
00:47:16,382 --> 00:47:18,818
So I'm ten steps ahead. Chess.

1328
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:20,487
And guess what, Taka.

1329
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:23,523
Checkmate, mate.

1330
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:25,358
Hey, Taka, remember me?

1331
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:27,159
I'm Chabuddy G, the manager!

1332
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:28,562
Sorry. Sorry.

1333
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:31,396
Ah, yes, lovely.

1334
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,465
One more. One more.

1335
00:47:33,498 --> 00:47:36,168
Yes, we got it!
I think we're done.

1336
00:47:36,202 --> 00:47:37,637
- Oh, sick.
- Well done, bubby.

1337
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,905
- Thank you so much.
- Where do you want me?

1338
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:41,608
- Just like... here?
- Huh?

1339
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,409
Sorry.
Uh, we ran out of time. Um...

1340
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:45,311
I thought you said
it was individual shots.

1341
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:46,913
Yes, um, but, um...

1342
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:48,681
While they're just here,
maybe one?

1343
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:49,882
- Maybe a couple? I don't know.
- Yeah, but we got some...

1344
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,351
Okay, well, just take one.

1345
00:47:51,384 --> 00:47:52,851
- Just take one.
- Okay.

1346
00:47:52,885 --> 00:47:54,254
Done.

1347
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:55,621
We, uh, still on
for dinner later?

1348
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,724
You know it, brother.

1349
00:47:57,757 --> 00:47:59,559
- What?
- Let's go.

1350
00:47:59,592 --> 00:48:01,894
But I thought he said
we were all going karaoke.

1351
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:05,765
<i>The-the things I learned today,</i>

1352
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:07,766
<i>the different
sort of looks I could do.</i>

1353
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,869
- Yeah. Very versatile, though.
- Yeah.

1354
00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:11,670
Innit, boys? It was good fun

1355
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:15,142
for Kurupt FM first photo
shoot out in Tokyo, innit?

1356
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:17,744
Yeah.

1357
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,378
- Oh...
- Yeah.

1358
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:20,812
Oh, Beats,
you're not still being salty

1359
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:22,748
because he was doing
more of me than you?

1360
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:25,585
No.

1361
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:27,386
I feel like an idiot.

1362
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,889
Beats, if you feel like
an idiot,

1363
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:31,858
you will look like an idiot.

1364
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,960
So, at the moment, you look like
a fucking idiot. Well done.

1365
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:36,328
Do you not feel like an idiot?

1366
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:39,264
Well, no, 'cause I'm wearing it
with confidence.

1367
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:40,832
Do you know what I mean?
Like an admiral.

1368
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:42,668
Well, I don't think
anyone pulls off

1369
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,537
this admiral look,
to be honest, like.

1370
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,306
- Um... - Oh, really?
- We're a garage crew.

1371
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,840
- Oh, oh, thanks, mate.
- We're not, we're not...

1372
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:49,842
- A garage?
- We don't work on a boat.

1373
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,443
Oh, that's funny,

1374
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:52,844
'cause where did pirate radio
come from, then?

1375
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:55,381
- On pirate ships back in the day, bruv.
- Yeah.

1376
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:57,350
Think about it.
This all makes sense, bruv.

1377
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:58,650
He's looked into
the history of it.

1378
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:00,320
You're not thinking about that.

1379
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:03,889
The original pirate radio, yeah,
was on a ship, yeah?

1380
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:06,391
Pirates on boats, yeah?

1381
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:08,428
I am the captain of our ship.

1382
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,330
Why did we straighten
our hair, though?

1383
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:14,434
Yeah. Pirates don't have
hair like this.

1384
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:17,537
I look like fucking Leslie
from <i>EastEnders.</i>

1385
00:49:26,012 --> 00:49:28,514
Do you reckon, uh, it's
a bit much, what you're wearing?

1386
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,617
No, I googled "What do
Japanese women wear to dinner?"

1387
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:32,852
and this came up.

1388
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:34,954
Taka! You all right? Oh.

1389
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:37,724
Sorry.
Forgot about the old shoes.

1390
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:40,726
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's fine. She...

1391
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,428
- Does she need to do that?
- No... Yes.

1392
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,762
Okay.

1393
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:45,364
Oh, my God.

1394
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:46,932
- This is mad, innit?
- Fucking hell.

1395
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:49,034
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Yeah.

1396
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:51,738
- Please, have a seat.
- So, just, yeah, have a seat.

1397
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,473
That's mad. Just on the floor?

1398
00:49:53,505 --> 00:49:54,574
No one look.

1399
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,311
Look, origami. That's so cool.

1400
00:49:58,344 --> 00:49:59,612
Yes, I can make it...

1401
00:49:59,644 --> 00:50:01,380
Oh, and then
it becomes a napkin.

1402
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,920
♪ So good ♪

1403
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:09,489
♪ My love... ♪

1404
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:11,458
Ah.

1405
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:14,460
♪ So good... ♪

1406
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:16,695
- Hi, Steves.
- Fucking hell. This place is nuts.

1407
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,599
I normally just pick up
from Decoy's uncle's car.

1408
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,503
Just doing it here?

1409
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:25,904
Are you in a rush?

1410
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:26,905
No.

1411
00:50:26,938 --> 00:50:28,641
Do you want a drink?

1412
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,076
Uh, oh, what,
just sit and have a drink?

1413
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,079
Pretend we're normal people?

1414
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:35,682
- Yeah, we can try.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1415
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:37,617
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1416
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,985
Uh...

1417
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,952
How-how long shall we...?

1418
00:50:40,985 --> 00:50:43,789
We... I suppose we finish
the beers at least, yeah?

1419
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:44,990
Yeah.

1420
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,661
- And-and then that's her performing.
- Wow.

1421
00:50:48,693 --> 00:50:50,429
- Yeah.
- So, she does a bit of singing.

1422
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,332
- Wow. - Sort of a professional dancer.
- Does it all.

1423
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:54,599
- Are you her father?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1424
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:56,034
- But...
- I know what you're thinking actually.

1425
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:57,970
She's a little bit darker
than I am,

1426
00:50:58,003 --> 00:51:00,606
but that's because
I'm a quarter Cypriot,

1427
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:02,809
so she's got
the, uh, lovely coloring.

1428
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:05,478
Yeah, uh,
and when I was pregnant,

1429
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,447
I used a lot of fake tan,
um, on my skin,

1430
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,049
and then it seeped through
just into my womb.

1431
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:13,452
But, uh, who-who is
the man in the photo?

1432
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:15,454
That is, uh... that's just Decoy.

1433
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:18,423
Yeah, no, he, um...
he's just a family friend.

1434
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:20,759
Yeah, he's got nothing
to do with it, so...

1435
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,695
Oh, hey, guys.

1436
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:26,031
Sorry I'm late.
What have I missed?

1437
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:27,934
You all right, Chabuddy?

1438
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:29,936
- Yeah.
- Why are you here?

1439
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,405
Why are you dressed like that
and barefoot as well?

1440
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,474
Well, this is what I'm wearing.
This is what managers wear.

1441
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,509
I'm your manager,
aren't I? So...

1442
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,943
- Nice Kindle.
- Yeah?

1443
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:40,579
It's cheaper than
your iPad, mate.

1444
00:51:40,612 --> 00:51:42,047
Bruv, what you doing here, man?

1445
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:43,783
We're fucking having a meal.

1446
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:46,651
- I'm supposed to be your manager.
- Yeah, supposed to be.

1447
00:51:46,684 --> 00:51:48,688
You can't do everything
without me.

1448
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:50,423
We seem to be doing okay, right?

1449
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:52,057
I wasn't talking to you, Taka.

1450
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,992
I'm talking to my artist.

1451
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:57,163
Come on. I mean,
what-what are you saying?

1452
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:59,030
That y-you basically...
you don't need me?

1453
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:01,600
What have you done
since you've come out here?

1454
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:04,971
You've just followed us
and done fuck all as usual.

1455
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:07,806
I-I get it. No, I get it.
It's like that, yeah?

1456
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,776
So I might as well just go home.

1457
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:14,713
Huh? Shall I go home, Tony?

1458
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:20,887
How long have I known you for, man?

1459
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,889
Been through so much.

1460
00:52:24,722 --> 00:52:26,592
Okay, just think.
I'm giving you ultimatum.

1461
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,628
It's me or Taka.

1462
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:30,695
Well...

1463
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:31,830
it's up to you.

1464
00:52:31,864 --> 00:52:33,599
It's not my game, is it?

1465
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,704
Okay, I'm going now.

1466
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:41,840
This is me going home.

1467
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,914
What's...?

1468
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:50,750
Sorry.

1469
00:52:58,056 --> 00:52:59,991
Wow.

1470
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:01,994
So, is that tea in there?
Is that see-through tea?

1471
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:04,030
- No, no, it's sake.
- No, no, sake.

1472
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,698
Okay, look, that didn't go
exactly as I planned.

1473
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:09,135
Um, just to be clear,
did I just fire myself?

1474
00:53:09,168 --> 00:53:11,037
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think that's what happened.

1475
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,738
That was also my understanding.

1476
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:14,841
Okay, just checking.

1477
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:20,947
- Back home, I have a weed farm.
- Yes?

1478
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,548
- I grow my own cannabis.
- Really?

1479
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:26,751
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a cannabis, uh, expert...
- You-you have a farm?

1480
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:28,687
...I would say. Yeah.

1481
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:30,623
You're-you're a DJ?

1482
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:31,990
- Yeah.
- And a farmer?

1483
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:34,960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You do a lot.

1484
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:36,596
- Yeah.
- You're a hard worker.

1485
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:38,563
Yeah, very...

1486
00:53:38,597 --> 00:53:39,865
- I mean, for me...
- Wow.

1487
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:41,867
...for me, it's very easy.

1488
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,635
<i>Have you ever
had a girlfriend?</i>

1489
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,871
<i>I do look at people who, like,</i>

1490
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:47,840
<i>are in, like, relationships
and that,</i>

1491
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:49,242
<i>and I sometimes think,</i>

1492
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:53,512
"What am I doing
that's so different to them?"

1493
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:55,647
- Thank you.
- <i>Arigato.</i>

1494
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:57,048
<i>And then I think
it's probably just</i>

1495
00:53:57,081 --> 00:53:59,117
that I don't
leave the house ever.

1496
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,853
Fucking hell. Watch the doorway.
Oh, you don't need to.

1497
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:05,525
<i>And that I sleep on the floor
and don't wash that much.</i>

1498
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,060
Apart from that, though,
it's like,

1499
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,096
"What do you want from me?"

1500
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:11,963
Okay, well, you have my number.

1501
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:13,132
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1502
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:14,666
I'll just, uh, yeah...

1503
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:16,067
- Yeah, okay.
- ...shout you or whatever.

1504
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:17,737
- Yeah.
- Yeah, o... yeah.

1505
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:19,871
- All right, yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

1506
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:21,541
Oh.

1507
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:23,610
- Good night.
- Night.

1508
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,282
Miki?

1509
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:32,818
Miki, come back!
I need to say something.

1510
00:54:34,353 --> 00:54:36,755
- I forgot to get the weed off you.
- Yeah, I forgot.

1511
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:37,990
I know.

1512
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:39,659
The point of the drinks.

1513
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:42,295
Whole thing would've been
completely pointless.

1514
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:43,695
Um, yeah.

1515
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:46,298
Well, it was still fun.

1516
00:54:46,331 --> 00:54:48,000
- Shall we...?
- Yeah.

1517
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:49,801
Uh, let's go over there.

1518
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:51,003
- Over there? Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1519
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:52,238
That's a bit bait, innit?

1520
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:54,774
All right? There you go.

1521
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:56,575
See... all right, see you later.

1522
00:54:56,608 --> 00:54:59,878
Drug dealers are mad out here,
innit? So elaborate.

1523
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:03,115
Me and Alfie Danger literally
never been for a drink once.

1524
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:06,786
Shall we try it
and see if it's...?

1525
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:08,688
Let's see.

1526
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:09,889
It's...

1527
00:55:10,822 --> 00:55:12,357
- Good?
- Oh, yeah.

1528
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:14,693
Yeah, it tastes normal. Tastes normal.

1529
00:55:14,726 --> 00:55:17,730
Now, Grindah-san,
one thing I wanted to run by you

1530
00:55:17,762 --> 00:55:19,065
is the name change.

1531
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:20,766
Mm. Yeah.

1532
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:22,634
For what? What-what name change?

1533
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:24,870
We're a bit worried people will

1534
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:26,838
find the name
Kurupt FM confusing.

1535
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:27,940
Really?

1536
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:30,208
You're not a radio station now.

1537
00:55:30,242 --> 00:55:32,778
You want to be
a successful music act.

1538
00:55:32,811 --> 00:55:34,380
- Right?
- Uh, yeah, but... - Yeah.

1539
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,916
So we're gonna be looking
at rethinking the name

1540
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:38,951
to something
a bit more relevant.

1541
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:41,186
We're thinking Bang Boys.

1542
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,022
- Bang Boys?
- Bang Boys.

1543
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:45,224
- Bang Boys.
- Bang Boys?

1544
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:46,759
People have already

1545
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:49,060
started calling you
the Bang Boys.

1546
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:50,362
I haven't heard that.

1547
00:55:50,396 --> 00:55:52,031
"Oh, my God,
it's the Bang Boys."

1548
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,332
- Really?
- Yeah. "Where's the Bang Boys?"

1549
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:58,137
See? So we're really
just doing it for the fans.

1550
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,206
It's all about as many people
knowing who you are

1551
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,008
- as possible, right?
- Yeah.

1552
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:06,746
The audience will love it.
Trust me.

1553
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,719
Bubby, are you feeling
a bit nervous?

1554
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:16,355
No, I'm not nervous.
I'm excited if anything.

1555
00:56:16,387 --> 00:56:18,223
First time on telly,
innit, boys?

1556
00:56:18,257 --> 00:56:19,291
It's not my first time.

1557
00:56:19,324 --> 00:56:20,760
I-I was on <i>Live & Kicking.</i>

1558
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:22,195
Wait, what-what is it
we're doing?

1559
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,968
<i>Look, promo is very important.</i>

1560
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,203
<i>And one of the main things
about promo</i>

1561
00:56:31,235 --> 00:56:33,705
is doing things you wouldn't
really usually want to do.

1562
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,675
- Yeah.
- Nice, innit, Beats?

1563
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,009
What? Yeah, it's weird.

1564
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,210
Fucking hell, this is pink.

1565
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:40,913
Who'd have thought it, innit?

1566
00:56:40,945 --> 00:56:42,347
Yeah, I would never
have thought this.

1567
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,715
Wow.

1568
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,417
<i>If we do do well,</i>

1569
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,052
like, Taka said
he's gonna hook us up

1570
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:49,120
with one of the biggest artists
in Japan.

1571
00:56:49,153 --> 00:56:50,956
- Oh, yeah, exactly, yeah.
- So...

1572
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,125
- And probably sort of grime or... reggae artist.
- Reggae.

1573
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,993
- Yeah.
- Do you know what I mean?

1574
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:56,394
And maybe doing, like, a, like,
a double album or something.

1575
00:56:56,427 --> 00:56:57,762
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1576
00:56:57,795 --> 00:56:59,297
Sort of like, um,
Shaggy and Sting.

1577
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:01,901
- That's a great album.
- Really good.

1578
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:03,069
- Mad.
- Look how they're dressed.

1579
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,135
You all right?

1580
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,275
Massive. GM probably.

1581
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:13,712
"Bang Boys."

1582
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,248
- Yeah, that's our new name now.
- What's that?

1583
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,784
- What?
- It's only a name. I'll talk to you about it later.

1584
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:20,920
- Bang Boys?
- Yes, Bang Boys. What?

1585
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,188
What do you mean
that's our new name?

1586
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:23,923
It's our new name just for now.

1587
00:57:23,956 --> 00:57:25,157
We can change it back
to Kurupt FM when we're ready.

1588
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,826
- Taka... look...
- Wait, hold on.

1589
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:29,228
That's a big change,
Bang Boys from Kurupt FM.

1590
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,130
- Bang Boys?
- Yeah. - Yeah, Bang Boys.

1591
00:57:31,163 --> 00:57:33,065
Yeah, yeah, no, it's 'cause of
the "bang" song, innit?

1592
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:34,467
- Bang Boys.
- What?

1593
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,235
It's not a big deal.
It's just what they...

1594
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:38,237
- Bang B...
- It's what you translate our name out here.

1595
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:40,105
- Yeah.
- Do you know what I mean? So...

1596
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:41,373
- Bang Boys?
- It's just...

1597
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:42,741
- It's easier for them.
- Yes, Bang Boys.

1598
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:44,242
What's wrong with Kurupt FM?

1599
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,443
It sounds like a pirate
radio station, and, uh...

1600
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:47,045
- Yeah, well, that's what we are.
- No.

1601
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:48,948
Yeah, but we're not anymore.
That's the point.

1602
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:50,216
There's no bands that sound
like radio stations, are there?

1603
00:57:50,248 --> 00:57:51,516
Yeah, but there's no bands

1604
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,119
that sound like
a pedophile ring either.

1605
00:57:53,152 --> 00:57:54,519
Yeah, it doesn't sound like
a pedophile ring.

1606
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,454
It sounds like
we bang people in the face.

1607
00:57:56,487 --> 00:57:58,123
So we're going with Bang Boys.

1608
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,161
Okay, these are your outfits.

1609
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:04,864
- There you are.
- For fuck's sake.

1610
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,264
- Can't we just wear our own stuff?
- There you are.

1611
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:08,000
- There you are.
- It's called promo, mate.

1612
00:58:08,032 --> 00:58:09,835
If you can't handle the fame,
then get out the kitchen.

1613
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,369
- There you are.
- What?

1614
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:13,972
Fucking Taka.

1615
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,878
Thinks he can come over here
and shit on my plate, yeah?

1616
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:20,378
Fucking <i>benchod.</i>

1617
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:24,083
Thinks he's won the war, yeah?

1618
00:58:24,115 --> 00:58:26,384
Well, guess who's still paying
for my drinks, mate.

1619
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:32,258
Barmaid.

1620
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:33,859
Yes?

1621
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:36,094
Double whisky on the rocks.
Hold the ice.

1622
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:40,431
And I'll tell you what,
get yourself one as well.

1623
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,068
It's on me, Taka.

1624
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:48,273
Who else wants one, huh?

1625
00:58:48,306 --> 00:58:50,575
Boys, you want a drink?

1626
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:53,545
Come on, let me get you a drink.

1627
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,582
It's on me, Taka.

1628
00:58:56,614 --> 00:58:58,149
Come on!

1629
00:58:58,182 --> 00:59:01,554
Aw, look at you lot.
You look so cute.

1630
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:04,090
All your little bottoms
walking along.

1631
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,293
I've never seen
so much of you all.

1632
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:10,930
Aw, cute bum.

1633
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,566
We're actually doing it.

1634
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:18,570
- Beats.
- Yeah.

1635
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,409
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1636
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:26,913
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1637
00:59:29,114 --> 00:59:31,416
It'll be done soon, and then...
Do you know what I mean?

1638
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:33,918
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, great. Here we go.

1639
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:36,021
Stop being selfish.
It's not about you.

1640
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:38,990
Just, uh, w-with the swimming...

1641
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:41,226
- I'm not sure if I can swim.
- Yeah, we're not doing this.

1642
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,928
- Me and Steves aren't doing it.
- Oh...

1643
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,262
Yo, I'm out, too, man.

1644
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:45,897
What the fuck
are we even doing here?

1645
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:47,365
This ain't
what Kurupt FM's about.

1646
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:49,268
This is bigger than Kurupt FM,
bruv. Look at it.

1647
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,936
What? Nothing's bigger than
Kurupt FM. You used to say that.

1648
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:53,638
Yeah? And you used
to work in Megabowl.

1649
00:59:53,672 --> 00:59:55,340
Yeah? Well, I'd rather
work in Megabowl

1650
00:59:55,373 --> 00:59:56,975
than be a fucking Bang Boy.

1651
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:59,144
So why don't you and Taka
be the Bang Boys

1652
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:00,479
since he loves you so much?

1653
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,148
N-No. I'd just do it
on my own, yeah?

1654
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:04,550
I'd be called the Bang Boy.

1655
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:07,552
Or, uh, MC Grindah,
brackets, Solo Project.

1656
01:00:07,585 --> 01:00:09,288
How's about that? Yeah?

1657
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,556
- Hold me back, bruv. Hold me back.
- Hmm?

1658
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,325
You're fucking lucky
Decoy's holding me back, bruv.

1659
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:14,460
I swear down.

1660
01:00:14,492 --> 01:00:16,161
He's-he's not even touching you.

1661
01:00:16,193 --> 01:00:18,329
Oh, is he not?
He's not touching me?

1662
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:20,298
- No.
- Okay. All right, then. Cool.

1663
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:22,433
- What you doing? What you doing?
- He's not touching me. No, no.

1664
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,269
- No, you want me in your face, do you? Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

1665
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:26,105
- Not really. Not really.
- Oh, you want me, yeah? What?

1666
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:28,039
Oh, you want me off the leash?
You want me off the leash? Okay.

1667
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:29,607
- Yeah, well, go off the leash.
- Now see-see what happens then.

1668
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:30,643
- Go off the fucking leash.
- Fucking see what happens.

1669
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,478
Go off the leash. I'm ready.

1670
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:34,079
- Oh, my God.
- My jaw's clenched ready for impact, bruv.

1671
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:35,447
- Oh, my God.
- I'm ready for fucking impact.

1672
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,215
I beg you, I beg you,
try something now.

1673
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:38,616
- Yeah? I'm waiting for you.
- I beg you... No, go on.

1674
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,617
- Free hit. Free hit.
- I'm waiting for you.

1675
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,119
Oh, I'm waiting for it.

1676
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:42,353
- Come on, boy, hit me. Hit me.
- Yeah.

1677
01:00:42,387 --> 01:00:43,655
- I'd love to.
- Go on, sweetheart.

1678
01:00:43,688 --> 01:00:44,956
- I'd fucking love to.
- Go, sweetheart.

1679
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:46,224
- What you doing?
- Fuck you doing?!

1680
01:00:46,257 --> 01:00:48,059
- What are you fucking doing?
- Boys.

1681
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:50,128
Don't you dare touch my hat!

1682
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:51,663
- The hat's fine.
- Stop it.

1683
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:53,164
- Get off me!
- Stop.

1684
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:54,299
- No punching!
- No, don't grab his...

1685
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,168
Aah! That's my leg!

1686
01:00:56,201 --> 01:00:58,670
I've got you by the balls now.
Got you by the balls now.

1687
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:01,340
No cocks. No cock grabbing.

1688
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,443
- Don't you...
- Stop it.

1689
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:07,712
Stop it. Stop it.

1690
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,383
Stop it. Stop.

1691
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,485
Stop.

1692
01:01:13,518 --> 01:01:15,286
- Say sorry!
- You say sorry!

1693
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,056
- No, you say sorry!
- You say sorry!

1694
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:18,257
No, you say sorry!

1695
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:19,557
Your shoe's come off.

1696
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,491
Beats, I'm gonna put
your shoe back on.

1697
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:22,126
Yeah, that's right.

1698
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:23,661
Your shoe's off now.

1699
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,434
And that's what fucking happens
if you fuck with me, yeah?

1700
01:01:29,467 --> 01:01:32,270
- I'm done.
- You're fired! You're all fired.

1701
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:34,106
Come on, Steve, let's go.

1702
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:36,175
Where's my helmet?

1703
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,675
What are you doing?

1704
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,111
Sayonara, you fat lemon.

1705
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:43,082
Bubby, calm down. Stop it.

1706
01:01:43,114 --> 01:01:45,216
- Are you crying?
- I'm not crying!

1707
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,018
Okay, calm down.
You've got a show on, right?

1708
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,586
- Please stop it. Stop it.
- What are you doing now?

1709
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:50,521
It's making me cry
'cause of the adrenaline

1710
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:52,423
- that's coming through my body.
- So you are crying?

1711
01:01:52,456 --> 01:01:54,125
I'm not crying.
It's adrenaline!

1712
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:56,395
You're not making sense.

1713
01:01:56,427 --> 01:01:58,196
Stop it.

1714
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:00,733
- Fucking little prick.
- Shh.

1715
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:02,401
How dare he try to fight me!

1716
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:04,269
Stop it.

1717
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,538
- Please keep your voice down.
- It's adrenaline.

1718
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,240
It's natural for this
to happen after a fight.

1719
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:12,076
This happens after fights.
You've never had one.

1720
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:15,480
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm so angry!

1721
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:18,717
I'm so angry.

1722
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,552
Nice.

1723
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:23,121
- Hey. <i>Kanpai.</i>
- <i>Kanpai!</i>

1724
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:24,590
Fuck Taka.

1725
01:02:24,623 --> 01:02:26,492
Fuck Taka!

1726
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:32,164
Oh! More drink!

1727
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:34,365
Hey! <i>Kanpai!</i>

1728
01:02:34,398 --> 01:02:35,701
This is a bloody wooden box.

1729
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,302
We're drinking out
a bloody wooden box.

1730
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:44,643
- Have you called them?
- Yeah.

1731
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:46,378
They're not answering
their phones.

1732
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:48,380
- Fucking little pussyos, man.
- Are you ready?

1733
01:02:48,413 --> 01:02:49,514
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1734
01:02:49,547 --> 01:02:50,615
It's just a bit of fun.
Come on.

1735
01:02:50,648 --> 01:02:52,417
It looks fucking tiny.

1736
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:54,186
- He's a bit worried about the size.
- What is tiny?

1737
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:55,653
- I'm not worried. No, no.
- What's-what's tiny?

1738
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:57,355
- I'm trying...
- Nothing's tiny.

1739
01:02:57,389 --> 01:02:58,791
- Just stop telling everyone.
- Come on. You're on.

1740
01:02:58,824 --> 01:03:00,793
- But you're on telly. It's amazing.
- Have fun.

1741
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:03,429
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang!

1742
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:40,264
Oh, my God. Yeah!

1743
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:54,313
Um, I think
there's been a mix-up.

1744

I-I don't know how to do this.

No, I've... Fuck's sake.

1746
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:02,187
I-I've never done
anything like this before.

1747
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,222
What?

1748
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:08,494
I don't know how to do it.
I don't know how to do it!

01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,276
Fuck!

01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,512
Oh... I'm doing it.

<i>Everyone wants to be famous.</i>

1757
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:41,226
That's the main ambition
that everyone has.

1758
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:43,262
And if they don't get that,
then they want to be, like,

1759
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:45,230
a teacher or whatever
until they become famous.

I pop the shoulder out.
I pop it back in.

I'm a hard geezer.

I look like a nice guy,
but, really, I'll kill you.

01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:20,831
Excuse me. The bill.

1770
01:05:20,864 --> 01:05:22,366
It's okay.
Put it on the room tab.

1771
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,802
The room tab.

1772
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:25,269
And that's what I'm saying.
I'm a hard...

1773

Sorry. The tab has been closed.

No tab.

01:05:30,976 --> 01:05:32,477
What?

1776
01:05:45,456 --> 01:05:47,759
Hey, listen, guys. Guys, guys.

1777
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:49,795
There's been a mix-up,
and I need you lot

1778
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:51,463
to help me with the bill.

Okay, no problem.

No problem. I'll be back.

- Yes.

You-you know the guys there
at the table?

1784
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:16,387
Um, they actually...

1785
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,856
'cause they're so nice,
they're really nice guys,

1786
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:21,460
they said that they're gonna
pay for the bill.

1787
01:06:21,492 --> 01:06:22,860
- Yes?
- Yeah, they said they will pay.

1788
01:06:22,893 --> 01:06:24,629
They're going to pay, so...

1789
01:06:24,663 --> 01:06:26,632
Hey, if you're gonna pay
for the bill, say, "Fuck Taka!"

1790
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:28,567
- Fuck Taka!
- Okay?

1791
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,568
Okay, thank you.

1792
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:33,938
Uh, I'll go for a wee...
a wee-wee.

1793
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:35,340
Fuck Taka.

Just popping out

1796
01:06:49,586 --> 01:06:50,755
Shit.

1799
01:06:57,896 --> 01:06:59,464
Don't go!

1800
01:06:59,496 --> 01:07:01,466
I'll be right back!
Don't worry!

1801
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,702
I'll be right back!

1802

<i>I wish Grindah

want him to fail,

1804
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:27,826

<i>Oh, you need me

<i>Well, no one gives a shit
anymore.</i>

1808
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:36,434
And I'll tell you why:
because you sold out.

1809
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:40,739
<i>I thought he cared, like,</i>

1810

<i>and, like,

1811
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:44,775
they'd just put on
the fucking leotard.

1812
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:46,111
Do you know what I mean?

1813
01:07:46,143 --> 01:07:49,047
Is a leotard worth
a friendship of 15 years?

1814
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:52,883
Okay, okay. Okay, I'll go.

1815
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:54,353
Okay, I'm going.

1816
01:07:54,385 --> 01:07:55,753
Bloody hell.

1817
01:07:55,786 --> 01:07:57,822
<i>You know what,
all these years, yeah,</i>

1818
01:07:57,856 --> 01:08:00,625
<i>I thought, yeah, I'm a hustler,
I'm an entrepreneur.</i>

1819
01:08:00,657 --> 01:08:02,827
But you know what,
maybe I just messed this one up.

1820
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,730
Maybe I have failed.
Maybe I'm not a hustler.

1821
01:08:04,762 --> 01:08:06,531
Maybe I'm not an entrepreneur.

1822
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,470
<i>All good things do have
to come to an end eventually.</i>

1823
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:15,039
Like Queen, like, one of
the greatest bands of all time

1824
01:08:15,072 --> 01:08:18,542
till Eddie Murphy got fucked up
on-on coke and ruined it.

1825
01:08:18,576 --> 01:08:23,815
Even when he's dead, yeah,
those songs will live on.

1826
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,023
I'm just thinking, um...

1827
01:08:32,457 --> 01:08:35,560
Do we, um...
Do we have anyone there that...

1828
01:08:35,592 --> 01:08:37,162
- Taka?
- Yeah?

1829
01:08:37,194 --> 01:08:38,963
Do we have anyone there
that would, uh...

1830
01:08:38,997 --> 01:08:40,766
- Uh, sorry. Hang on.
- What...

1831
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:43,902
Just got to...

1832
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:45,971
Uh, he's just doing
an email, I think.

1833
01:08:46,003 --> 01:08:47,872
I presume he's emailing.

1834
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:01,420
So, we're at studio.

1835
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,488
You always open the
back one first. Why did you...

1836
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,922
- Bubby. Bubby.
- Grindah-san.

1837
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:06,925
Bubby, I can't believe
I'm at studio!

1838
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:09,627
- Don't shout so much.
- Say it. Studio!

1839
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:11,430
- Come on.
- Studio! - Studio!

1840
01:09:11,462 --> 01:09:12,764
Hey, we don't say it
too many times

1841
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:14,165
- when we do it, so just come on.
- Yeah.

1842
01:09:20,537 --> 01:09:23,007
Yeah? Some of that,
you fucking prick!

1843
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,112
What you saying, Steves?

1844
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:28,947
Uh, just, uh, texting Miki.

1845
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:30,581
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1846
01:09:30,614 --> 01:09:33,652
Trying to link her
before we leave, yeah?

1847
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:36,721
Uh, no, I've got
enough draw now, so...

1848
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:38,989
What? Bruv, come on.

1849
01:09:39,023 --> 01:09:40,692
Like, you like her, innit?

1850
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:43,595
Just lips her,
for God's sake, Steve.

1851
01:09:43,627 --> 01:09:45,663
You're exotic out here.

1852
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:47,865
Back home,
you're just a butters freak.

1853
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:49,768
Make the most of it.

1854
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:52,504
Yeah, listen, yeah,
if you like her, just tell her.

1855
01:09:52,537 --> 01:09:54,539
You're both weird.
It makes sense.

1856
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:56,541
Yeah, don't overthink it.

1857
01:09:56,573 --> 01:09:59,444
Like, just go down there.
Be a man.

1858
01:10:00,612 --> 01:10:01,913
Be a man?

1859
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:03,747
Be confident, as well,
sort of...

1860
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,783
Yeah, exactly.
And make your voice deeper

1861
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:07,819
and push your shoulders back.

1862
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:14,926
Here we go.

1863
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:17,261
Oh, my God. I feel like
we're in a Drake video.

1864
01:10:17,295 --> 01:10:18,896
Yeah.

1865
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:21,099
- What is that?
- Just a classic mixing desk.

1866
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:23,100
- It just turns it up and down.
- Really? Ooh.

1867
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:24,703
Grindah.

1868
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:26,270
- Yeah?
- You remember Shiro, right?

1869
01:10:26,304 --> 01:10:28,172
Yeah. I'm not working
with him, am I?

1870
01:10:28,206 --> 01:10:29,708
Oh, yes.

1871
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,076
He's got millions of fans
out here in Japan,

1872
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:32,777
so it'll really get you noticed.

1873
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,246
Well, if you're famous,
we should get a selfie,

1874
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:35,881
- shouldn't we?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1875
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:37,248
I'm sorry.

1876
01:10:38,248 --> 01:10:40,085
What shall I say to her?

1877
01:10:40,118 --> 01:10:41,553
Should I say, like,

1878
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:42,954
"Do you want to link
or something?"

1879
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:46,157
Write W-Y-D...

1880
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:49,860
W-Y-D.

1881
01:10:49,894 --> 01:10:51,630
Space.

1882
01:10:51,662 --> 01:10:53,731
- Space.
- Safe.

1883
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,236
- S-A-F-E?
- Yeah.

1884
01:10:58,235 --> 01:11:00,171
- "WYD safe."
- Yeah.

1885
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:02,239
- Send that, yeah?
- Yeah.

1886
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:04,810
- Sent.
- Sick.

1887
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:09,648
No, the intro, the in...

1888
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,949
Shh, just talking on the intro.

1889
01:11:11,983 --> 01:11:16,622
It's the MC Grindah
featuring Shiro.

1890
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:19,824
Let's go.

1891
01:11:19,856 --> 01:11:21,560
One, two, three. Let's go!

1892
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:22,894
You.

1893
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:24,828
Oh, fucking hell.

1894
01:11:24,862 --> 01:11:26,698
Start again.
You've missed the drop.

1895
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:27,965
Start again.

1896
01:11:27,998 --> 01:11:29,900
Stop. Start again.

1897
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:32,237
You missed the drop.

1898
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:37,841
Oh, she's replied.

1899
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,344
Oh, sick. What'd she say?

1900
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:41,179
Uh, question mark.

1901
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:42,314
Oh.

1902
01:11:43,347 --> 01:11:45,317
- That's good.
- Is that good?

1903
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:47,285
Do a question mark back.

1904
01:11:47,318 --> 01:11:48,587
Sick.

1905
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:51,155
It's the MC Grindah.

1906
01:11:52,923 --> 01:11:55,292
Alongside man that's Shiro.

1907
01:11:55,326 --> 01:11:57,596
And we're ready to roll
right now.

1908
01:11:57,628 --> 01:11:59,064
Why?

1909
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:02,634
We got the lyrical flow
right now. Go!

1910
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,872
♪ With the lyrical,
biblical sound, sound, sound ♪

1911
01:12:12,877 --> 01:12:14,980
♪ When I pick up the mic,
I get down ♪

1912
01:12:15,012 --> 01:12:17,748
♪ Say, oh, I get back up
all ready to bounce... ♪

1913
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:27,224
♪ Bass, lyrical shout,
lyrical shout ♪

1914
01:12:27,257 --> 01:12:28,893
♪ Down with the roughneck vibe ♪

1915
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:30,362
♪ Bass, lyrical shout,
went up on left ♪

1916
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:33,164
♪ Then I bring it back
to the right ♪

1917
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:35,033
Obviously go, then,
if I've stopped.

1918
01:12:35,065 --> 01:12:36,300
Fucking hell.

1919
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:40,372
- Just sing. Sing.
- Sing?

1920
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:46,243
Steves.

1921
01:12:46,277 --> 01:12:47,846
Is everything okay?

1922
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:50,280
Yeah, yeah, just, um...

1923
01:12:50,314 --> 01:12:52,384
Normal. Yeah.

1924
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:54,653
Um, I don't know
what this text means.

1925
01:12:54,685 --> 01:12:58,155
Uh, I just wanted to come
and, um, speak to you,

1926
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:00,325
'cause obviously we've been...

1927
01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:03,095
And... I guess, um...

1928
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:06,965
What I'm trying to say is
that you're...

1929
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:10,402
...weird and...

1930
01:13:10,435 --> 01:13:12,003
What?

1931
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:15,273
And I'm leaving, so it's, um...

1932
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,376
Just wanted to come
to say that, really,

1933
01:13:18,408 --> 01:13:20,110
and just see, um...

1934
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:22,113
What do you think about that?

1935
01:13:22,145 --> 01:13:24,682
I don't know.
I'm a bit confused.

1936
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:26,317
- Yeah, I'm-I'm...
- Yeah.

1937
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:29,221
...confused, as well,
but it's just, I guess...

1938
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:34,192
I-I feel like, for me, um...

1939
01:13:34,225 --> 01:13:38,063
I feel like I'm doing
all the talking at the moment,

1940
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:41,065
and just, like,
maybe it'd be good

1941
01:13:41,099 --> 01:13:43,268
if you just said something
just to...

1942
01:13:44,735 --> 01:13:46,203
...help.

1943
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:48,940
Okay, um, um...

1944
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:54,078
I'm not sure
what you're trying to say.

1945
01:13:54,112 --> 01:13:56,146
I'm trying to say
that I'm a man,

1946
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,417
and what are you saying?

1947
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:03,121
- About...
- I-I don't know.

1948
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:05,757
Okay, well, you don't know.
That's fair enough.

1949
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:08,492
- What do you mean?
- I'll just, um...

1950
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:11,496
I've obviously embarrassed
myself, as usual, so...

1951
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:13,131
- All right.
- S-Steves, uh...

1952
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,865
I'll see you later.

1953
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,170
It's that way, innit?

1954
01:14:33,518 --> 01:14:35,487
How far are we from the place?

1955
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,423
- Uh, in five minutes.
- Right.

1956
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:40,125
- Right.
- Yes.

1957
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,194
Is that Japanese time
or UK time?

1958
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:45,296
What's the difference?

1959
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:47,965
Well, there's a seven-hour
time difference, isn't there?

1960
01:14:49,033 --> 01:14:50,835
Five...

1961
01:14:50,868 --> 01:14:52,437
Just classic five minutes,
is it?

1962
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,105
- Normal five minutes. Normal.
- Yeah. Normal.

1963
01:14:54,137 --> 01:14:55,974
- Normal. Right, okay.
- Yeah.

1964
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:57,775
- So that's quite soon. Great.
- So... so, English. English.

1965
01:14:57,809 --> 01:14:59,811
Exciting.

1966
01:14:59,844 --> 01:15:01,945
- Smile.
- Oh, for fuck...

1967
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:04,015
Smile. Go on.

1968
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:05,849
Aw.

1969
01:15:05,882 --> 01:15:08,019
<i>To be honest, yeah, like,</i>

1970
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:10,454
I had a different view
of what fame would be like.

1971
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:12,289
Like, I always thought

1972
01:15:12,323 --> 01:15:15,059
fame would just be,
like, me and my boys,

1973
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:17,094
<i>yeah, on a private jet,</i>

1974
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,429
<i>blazing zoots,
going out to every country</i>

1975
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:22,399
and spitting
the finest UKG lyrics, yeah?

1976
01:15:22,432 --> 01:15:24,234
- Now what?
- Okay, now look a bit stronger

1977
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:26,136
and prouder and happier.

1978
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:29,273
<i>It turns out fame is,</i>

1979
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:31,542
um, me and Miche, mainly,

1980
01:15:31,576 --> 01:15:33,811
<i>and Taka making me
do weird shit.</i>

1981
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:35,113
Fuck's sake.

1982
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:36,914
That's... I'm on the flyer.

1983
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:39,217
Fuck's sake. Why have I got
a guitar in my hand, yeah?

1984
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,451
You got it?

1985
01:15:40,484 --> 01:15:42,354
Bubby. Okay.

1986
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,389
Oh, my God. Look.

1987
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:47,524
- "Bang Boys dressing room."
- Yeah.

1988
01:15:47,557 --> 01:15:49,226
Do you want to say it?

1989
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,061
Why? It just says it there.

1990
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:53,431
Sausage rolls.

1991
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:56,533
Yeah. Me and Beats used to
insist on them for the rider.

1992
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:58,536
Well, more for you now,
so, you know, that's one of

1993
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,405
- the perks of them all going, isn't it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1994
01:16:02,006 --> 01:16:04,309
Why are all the boys
still on the poster?

1995
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:06,877
Yes, I'm glad you asked,
Grindah-san,

1996
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:09,247
because we've got
a little surprise.

1997
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,349
- Miki. Miki.
- Yes?

1998
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:13,183
- Go and get the guys.
- Yes.

1999
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:15,319
The guys? Are you joking?

2000
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:17,154
You little bastard!

2001
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:18,623
You bastard!

2002
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:20,057
- Oh, my God. Did you know about this?
- Oh, my God.

2003
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:21,626
- No. The big reunion.
- Yes, you did.

2004
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:23,961
- You lot knew about this, innit?
- Oh, my God.

2005
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,296
- You're gonna go onstage!
- Oh, my days.

2006
01:16:25,328 --> 01:16:27,297
We're all gonna be
onstage together.

2007
01:16:27,331 --> 01:16:28,600
Yes, all four of you.

2008
01:16:28,632 --> 01:16:30,234
Oh, my God,
you've been so worried,

2009
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:31,935
- and you didn't need to panic.
- I know.

2010
01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:34,038
The Bang Boys.

2011
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:37,442
What the fuck is that?

2012
01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:39,143
It's just their heads.

2013
01:16:39,176 --> 01:16:41,312
Yes, we were gonna go
with even bigger heads,

2014
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:43,914
but we thought
we'd keep it subtle.

2015
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:45,316
How is that subtle?

2016
01:16:45,349 --> 01:16:46,985
Look at the size of that.

2017
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,387
Th-They're cute, aren't they?

2018
01:16:50,421 --> 01:16:51,890
No, they're not cute.

2019
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:53,257
Decoy hasn't even
got an Afro in real life.

2020
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,326
I know,
but we thought it made him look

2021
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:57,128
more cool and hip-hop this way.

2022
01:16:57,161 --> 01:17:00,131
Hip...? It's not meant to be
hip-hop, for fuck's sake.

2023
01:17:00,163 --> 01:17:02,399
We got you a foam head
as well, if you want.

2024
01:17:02,432 --> 01:17:04,101
Bubby?

2025
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:07,104
Are you sulking?

2026
01:17:39,136 --> 01:17:40,939
It's so cool.

2027
01:17:41,706 --> 01:17:43,141
Amazing.

2028
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:51,215
You okay, hon?

2029
01:17:51,247 --> 01:17:53,984
I'm not okay. This is mad.

2030
01:17:54,018 --> 01:17:55,619
Come on,
you were born to do this.

2031
01:17:55,653 --> 01:17:57,387
This ain't
how I imagined it, though.

2032
01:17:57,421 --> 01:18:00,124
But you're gonna be amazing.
You're just nervous.

2033
01:18:00,157 --> 01:18:01,559
It's not nerves. It's just...

2034
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:03,260
It's just this.

2035
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:05,563
What the fuck is this?

2036
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:08,231
Come on, let's look excited
for a pic-pic.

2037
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:10,368
Just do that... Bubby.

2038
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,135
Okay, I'll just get you
walking off for now.

2039
01:18:12,168 --> 01:18:13,671
Really good emotion.

2040
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,117
What's this? What's going on?

01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:10,542
Hey, is everything alright?

2057
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:11,627
Yes, I'll find him.

2058
01:19:12,328 --> 01:19:13,797
He's in the bathroom.

2059
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:15,042
He won't come out.

I'll find him.

He'll get him on stage in time.

01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:19,944
You dickhead. Huh?

2162
01:23:19,976 --> 01:23:21,979
See?! See what happened?!

2163
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:24,282
Oh, how the tide has changed!

2164
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:25,983
How the tide has changed!

2165
01:23:27,051 --> 01:23:29,387
Let's go for
a more up-tempo one now.

2166
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:30,954
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2167
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:33,957

Grindah.

2177
01:23:59,682 --> 01:24:01,319
Beats.

2178
01:24:02,786 --> 01:24:04,021
You're back.

2179
01:24:05,456 --> 01:24:06,658
If you'll have me.

2180
01:24:11,395 --> 01:24:12,863
Yeah, of course I'll have you.

2181
01:24:21,637 --> 01:24:23,873
It's good to have you back.

2182
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:27,110
I don't want to do this
music shit without you, man.

2183
01:24:27,144 --> 01:24:28,346
Same.

2184
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:30,347
Kurupt FM, yeah?

2185
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:33,384
The rest are irrelevant.

2186
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:36,586
Feels good.

2187
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:40,557
How did you know
where we were, man?

2188
01:24:43,127 --> 01:24:45,563
I knew you wanted
to do karaoke, so...

2189
01:24:45,595 --> 01:24:47,997
Yeah.
But how did you know which one?

2190
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:50,100
Like, there's thousands
of them here.

2191
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:52,970
Yeah, I... Well, I texted Decoy.

2192
01:24:53,002 --> 01:24:54,070
Oh.

2193
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:56,006
I'm sorry.

2194
01:24:56,038 --> 01:24:58,542
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

2195
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:00,844
Same.

2196
01:25:04,814 --> 01:25:07,719
Uh, where's-where's Miche?

2197
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:10,720
Oh, yeah.

2198
01:25:10,753 --> 01:25:13,123
I should probably text her,
let her know.

2199
01:25:22,099 --> 01:25:23,701
What's happened, Taka? Huh?

2200
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:24,833
OK guys, put your heads on.

2201
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:27,044
We can do this without him.

2202
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:28,739
What's he saying?

2203
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:30,140
He's saying they can do it
without him.

2204
01:25:30,173 --> 01:25:31,609
- What's wrong?
- No, you can't do that.

2205
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:32,675
- Grindah, that's his group, hon.
- Yeah.

2206
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:34,110
Your husband is replaceable.

2207
01:25:34,144 --> 01:25:35,780
Are you joking me?
You do not disrespect my family.

2208
01:25:35,813 --> 01:25:37,547
I don't care
who you think you are.

2209
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:38,983
- You do not disrespect my family.
- Don't-don't do that.

2210
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,483
Grindah needs to be on stage.

2211
01:25:40,538 --> 01:25:41,685
Is he saying something else
about my family?

2212
01:25:41,717 --> 01:25:43,453
'Cause I will slap him.
Did you hear what I said?

2213
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:45,122
No, he said Grindah
needs to be onstage.

2214
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:46,791
Yeah, he does need
to be onstage.

2215
01:25:46,823 --> 01:25:48,458
Grindah will never be on
your stage. You know what, Taka?

2216
01:25:48,492 --> 01:25:50,561
You're lucky I don't
lick you clean out, mate.

2217
01:25:51,761 --> 01:25:53,663
Shit manager.

2218
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,533
- We're going to do this without him.
- <i>You seriously think that's going to work?</i>

2219
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:02,538
Taka knows the dance routine.

2220
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:07,845
- Come on.
- What did you say?

2221
01:26:07,877 --> 01:26:09,880
I told him that
Taka knows the dance routine.

2222
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:13,217
- Fuck Taka!
- Fuck Taka!

2223
01:26:14,984 --> 01:26:17,154
Hang on.
I missed what happened there.

2224
01:26:18,154 --> 01:26:19,856
No.

2225
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,158
You sure you spelt Kurupt
properly?

2226
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,527
- Yeah. Yeah.
- With a "K." Yeah.

2227
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,729
- They ain't got it.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

2228
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:27,230
Um...

2229
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:28,966
Try "Bang Boys."

2230
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,470
Oh, my days.
Bruv, we're on karaoke.

2231
01:26:32,502 --> 01:26:34,704
Oh, my days. Steves!

2232
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:36,039
Bruv, we're in
the karaoke machine.

2233
01:26:36,073 --> 01:26:37,541
That is nuts, bruv.

2234
01:26:42,845 --> 01:26:45,048
<i>It's not easy managing Kurupt.</i>

2235
01:26:45,082 --> 01:26:48,986
I've lost, I mean,
roughly around seven K.

2236
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:51,922
And, uh, deep, deep, deep
in the red.

2237
01:26:51,954 --> 01:26:53,756
Deep.

2238
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:58,061
<i>And they made me realize that,
God, I'm a good friend.</i>

2239
01:26:58,095 --> 01:26:59,896
<i>Because any...</i>

2240
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:02,733
sane manager would have quit
a long time ago, but not me.

2241
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,057
WEAR IT!

2242
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:06,737
<i>I'm loyal.</i>

2243
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:09,039
<i>Chabuddy G,
not the best manager,</i>

2244
01:27:09,072 --> 01:27:11,942
but the best friend
you will ever have in your life.

2245
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:13,210
<i>Hey, boys!</i>

2246
01:27:13,243 --> 01:27:14,245
- Hey!
- Hey!

2247
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,746
Guess who defeated Taka

2248
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:17,047
- and rescued the fair maiden!
- Yeah!

2249
01:27:17,079 --> 01:27:18,582
- That's mental.
- Yeah, innit? Innit?

2250
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:19,817
- I love you. Oh!
- Oh, uh... Oh.

2251
01:27:21,184 --> 01:27:22,619
You all right?

2252
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:24,121
Yes. And you?

2253
01:27:24,154 --> 01:27:26,257
- You came.
- Yeah.

2254
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:27,992
Uh, chicken nugget
or anything or...

2255
01:27:28,024 --> 01:27:29,259
- Yes, thank you.
- Uh...

2256
01:27:40,871 --> 01:27:42,105
<i>Deeky, man, bring it in.</i>

2257
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:43,641
What-what are you doing?

2258
01:27:43,673 --> 01:27:45,175
Oh, my God,
you're on the karaoke!

2259
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:46,777
- Yeah. Yeah, we're in there.
- That's mental.

2260
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:47,811
- We're in the karaoke machine.
- What?

2261
01:27:47,844 --> 01:27:48,811
That's cool.

2262

- You go ahead. Yeah.
- Uh, okay.

2308
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:13,864
I was just gonna say,
can I lips you?

2309
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,865
- If that's... if you want.
- Uh, I...

01:29:17,801 --> 01:29:20,638
Oh, great. So I've literally
embarrassed myself again.

2312
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,007
Um, yeah, uh, it means:
"Can I kiss you?"

2313
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:25,275
But, obviously,
the moment's sort of gone now.

Oh. Oh, my God.

2315
01:29:32,349 --> 01:29:34,118
Look at Steves
thinking he can lips!

2316
01:29:36,052 --> 01:29:37,887
- That is great!
- Love is in the air, mate!

2317
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:40,024
Steves, you dirty bastard!

2318
01:29:40,056 --> 01:29:41,925
Thank you.

2319
01:29:43,827 --> 01:29:46,730
Can we... can we do more?

2320
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:47,965
Sure.

2321
01:29:49,932 --> 01:29:52,836
That's my Stevie boy.
That's my Steves.

2322
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:57,941
<i>The little things
in life are the most important.</i>

2323
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:02,011
Like, if you start
thinking too big,

2324
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:06,315
you realize
the world's ending, like,

2325
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:08,786
everything's
completely pointless.

2326
01:30:10,487 --> 01:30:12,155
<i>Focus on just enjoying</i>

2327
01:30:12,189 --> 01:30:13,891
<i>the things around you
that are good,</i>

2328
01:30:13,923 --> 01:30:18,729
<i>like your mates,
like make music, make art,</i>

2329
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:21,297
make a fucking spaghetti
Bolognese, whatever you make.

2330
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:23,033
Do something for someone else.

2331
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:25,469
Make them a fucking
spaghetti Bolognese.

2332
01:30:27,237 --> 01:30:29,739
Yeah, drink! I want a drink!

2333
01:30:29,773 --> 01:30:31,175
That's mine. That's mine.
Cheers.

2334
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:32,975
<i>You know, obviously,
we've been trying</i>

2335
01:30:33,009 --> 01:30:35,078
for a long time now
for his fame to sort of birth.

2336
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:36,980
Have they got other drinks?
I love you.

2337
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:38,948
<i>But he'll probably go back
to postman stuff, as well.</i>

2338
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:41,217
<i>That's fine 'cause, you know,
he can dream still.</i>

2339
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:42,953
He can be a postman in the day,

2340
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:44,921
and he can dream about
being a pop star at night.

2341
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:47,824
And that's our life,
and I'm happy with it.

2342
01:30:47,858 --> 01:30:49,460
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, brother.

2343
01:30:49,493 --> 01:30:51,195
- Listen, it's water off a ducky's back.
- You all right?

2344
01:30:51,228 --> 01:30:52,762
Okay? Water off
a ducky's back, mate.

2345
01:30:52,796 --> 01:30:54,264
- Cheers, mate.
- No problem.

2346
01:30:54,296 --> 01:30:55,898
I'll tell you what,
Chabuddy's a hustler.

2347
01:30:55,931 --> 01:30:57,467
<i>And you can't hustle a hustler.</i>

2348
01:30:57,501 --> 01:30:59,036
<i>I'm Chabuddy G.</i>

2349
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:03,073
<i>The thing with Taka, yeah,
is that he's a salaryman.</i>

2350
01:31:03,105 --> 01:31:05,108
<i>You know what I mean? Robot.</i>

2351
01:31:05,141 --> 01:31:07,944
<i>Oh, wake up,
have my, uh, coffee,</i>

2352
01:31:07,978 --> 01:31:10,047
go to work, pay my taxes, die.

2353
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:13,884
<i>Me, I've never received
a salary in my life, mate.</i>

2354
01:31:13,917 --> 01:31:18,088
I've never been paid
for anything in my whole life.

2355
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:19,789
Think about that, mate.

2356
01:31:19,823 --> 01:31:21,492
Stevie! Stevie!

2357
01:31:21,524 --> 01:31:23,426
<i>A lot of people have</i>

2358
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,296
<i>bad things to say
about going away.</i>

2359
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:28,431
- Yeah.
- They say, "Oh, it's expensive.

2360
01:31:28,465 --> 01:31:30,801
Oh, it's a long flight."

2361
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:33,336
But I tell you what,
get out your comfort zone.

2362
01:31:33,369 --> 01:31:36,539
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Go somewhere, like, different.

2363
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:39,009
Do you know what I mean?
'Cause do you know what?

2364
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:40,878
- Yeah.
- You might not enjoy it at the time, yeah?

2365
01:31:40,911 --> 01:31:42,179
- You won't.
- You won't. No one...

2366
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:43,313
You don't enjoy things
in the moment.

2367
01:31:43,345 --> 01:31:44,881
- Yeah.
- That's a fact.

2368
01:31:44,914 --> 01:31:46,382
- So you didn't enjoy it?
- No.

2369
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:48,152
- But...
- But that's the whole point, innit?

2370
01:31:48,185 --> 01:31:49,486
- But I fucking loved it.
- Exactly.

2371
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,221
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

2372
01:31:51,253 --> 01:31:53,423
- No, I didn't enjoy it, but...
- Yeah. But I loved it.

2373
01:31:54,824 --> 01:31:56,926
After it was done.

2374
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,328
So go and do it.

2375
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,930
You'll fucking love it.

2376
01:31:59,962 --> 01:32:02,298

Conducta. ♪

2381
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:54,917
What's mad is, yeah,
is that after all of this,

2382
01:32:54,951 --> 01:32:56,485
Grindah put it
in perspective for me

2383
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:58,387
- that it was just all my fault.
- Yeah.

2384
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:00,224
- And that's, like...
- Do you know what I'm saying?

Some-Sometimes I can't even see
where I'm going wrong.

- Like, it's...

But sometimes you need that.

2388
01:33:05,028 --> 01:33:06,363
Uh, it was just... I don't know
how it was my fault,

2389
01:33:06,395 --> 01:33:08,097
but somehow it was, wasn't it?

2390
01:33:08,131 --> 01:33:09,633
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You were saying last night.

2391
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:11,969
- And I just want to apologize.
- Yeah. No, it's all good.

2392
01:33:12,002 --> 01:33:13,937
No need to apologize.
I mean, and I apologize...

2393
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:16,139
- But I am sorry.
- No, no, but I apologize

2394
01:33:16,171 --> 01:33:18,407
for not explaining that
to you earlier.

2395
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,911
Yeah. It kind of makes
a little...

2396
01:33:20,944 --> 01:33:22,312
- Perfect sense. Yeah.
- Yeah.

2397
01:33:22,345 --> 01:33:24,146
Or a little bit
of perfect sense, I guess.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.
