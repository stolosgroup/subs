-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

2
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,282
Everyone get close to everyone
so you can touch someone.

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,411
This is very serious.
It's more serious than you can imagine.

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Let's pray.

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,333
Father, we thank you for...

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,503
just being our God,
and for all that you do.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,714
We thank you for this day, and...

8
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,467
we thank you for the chill
in this air, Father.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,094
Because we thank you for the sunshine,

10
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,972
because you create the chill
and you create the sunshine.

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,392
And you know
these are tough times, Father.

12
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,729
We're asking this morning
for your guidance.

13
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,690
- Amen.
- Amen.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,820
We stand here today, uh,
with a plant that's closing,

15
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,615
with a... a deep, rich history,

16
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:17,660
and, uh, it's sad for me and, I'm sure,
everybody else in there to see it go,

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,953
but I will say this:

18
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,999
I'm extremely proud of the people
that work in this plant here.

19
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,168
There's none better.

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,670
They know how to get the job done.

21
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,942
- How old are these houses?
- Two hundred years?

22
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,487
No way!
America was founded only 200 years ago.

23
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,655
Oh.

24
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,866
- Then at least several decades.
- Yeah, maybe.

25
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,496
- Cold?
- Yeah.

26
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,683
But this is really beautiful.

27
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah, gorgeous.

28
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,630
See, America's airspace is really busy.

29
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,007
There's one.

30
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,634
- And there.
- Mmm.

31
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,650
When you take a look
at an automobile,

32
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,994
you see glass all around it.

33
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,954
That's what we do.

34
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,707
We have about 70% of the market.

35
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,168
Okay? Which is pretty extensive.

36
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,795
We have facilities around the world,

37
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,758
throughout China, United States now,
with our plant here.

38
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,887
What we're doing is we're melding
two cultures together:

39
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,598
the Chinese culture and the US culture.

40
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,560
So we are truly a global organization.

41
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,273
So, we do have three different shifts
right now that we are working with.

42
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,277
A first, second, and a third.
Pretty traditional.

43
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,695
You'll also have a 30-minute unpaid lunch.

44
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,406
Plus, there's two 15-minute paid breaks.

45
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,951
Plenty of opportunities,
ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,536
Plenty of opportunities.

47
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,623
Is this a union shop?

48
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,916
We are not.

49
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,168
It is our desire to not be.

50
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,965
But we recognize that, one,
we need to do things right by employees.

51
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay? We recognize that.

52
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,431
- I have, actually, 28 years experience.
- Very good.

53
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,976
Payroll, human resources,
operations, things like that.

54
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,894
I have a master's

55
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,997
- in mechanical engineering too, so...
- Okay, good. Super.

56
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,042
- Sounds like you got a lot of good skills.
- Well, I... Actually, I've worked

57
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,002
- in all kinds of different levels of...
- Yeah? Okay, good.

58
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,529
What we'll do is we'll take a look
at your résumé. All right?

59
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,928
Where you sit today
used to be a General Motors plant.

60
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,013
This plant closed,

61
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,475
leaving 2,000 families unemployed.

62
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,939
And now, there are over 1,000 employees
working here,

63
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,774
with still more to be hired.

64
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,740
It was a little over two years ago
that this facility was a very dark

65
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,578
and very stark reminder
of the greatest economic downturn

66
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,080
in American history
since the Great Depression.

67
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,752
And with that, you understand the...
the personal impact that that has,

68
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,173
individually and for the families
of all those involved.

69
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,430
It's been a very fast process
from the very beginning.

70
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,099
When I hired in,
there was nothing in the plant.

71
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,227
And since that time, you can see,
in the last six months,

72
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,855
the amount of people
and equipment that have come in.

73
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,940
And it's, uh, exciting.

74
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,526
The commitment everybody's put in,
hard work.

75
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,488
Uh, we're looking forward
to starting production.

76
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,449
Since you've arrived in America,

77
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,017
I believe you've found
many things different

78
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,560
from life in China.

79
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,979
We need to get to know Americans.

80
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,276
America is a place
to let your personality run free.

81
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,779
As long as you're not doing
anything illegal,

82
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
you're free to follow your heart.

83
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,825
You can even joke about the president.

84
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,036
Nobody will do anything to you.

85
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,374
Americans' cars are big and huge,
very comfortable.

86
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,587
This represents
the American sense of casualness.

87
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,132
They don't place a heavy importance
on outfits and attire.

88
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,719
If you travel in Europe in the summertime,

89
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,181
and you see someone walking
in front of you,

90
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,977
if he's wearing shorts,
vests, and sports shoes,

91
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,521
they must be an American.

92
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,149
Americans say
what they are thinking directly.

93
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
They don't hide anything.

94
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,154
They are very obvious.

95
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,448
Everything is practical and realistic.

96
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,536
They dislike abstractions and theory
in their daily lives.

97
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,331
Time is limited today,
so I won't keep going.

98
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,418
The list here is really long.

99
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,461
Wow, thank you.

100
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,841
As required by Chairman,

101
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,804
we will have an opening celebration
on October 7th.

102
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,973
From now on,

103
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,895
I ask you to keep October 7th in mind

104
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,733
and work hard
towards this grand celebration.

105
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,257
Welcome, Chairman. Good to see you.

106
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,395
This one is the Chevrolet S-10.

107
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
It was made in 1982.

108
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,319
That's the first one they made.

109
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,736
The first car from the GM plant.

110
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,405
Wow, Dayton was very well developed
back then?

111
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,200
Exactly. A very well developed area.

112
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,803
"I have a secret to share,
and from the bottom of my heart,

113
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,806
I love Ohio, and I love the place

114
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
where I invest significantly,
here in Dayton."

115
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,271
This is a historic project
that is gonna help grow this community,

116
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:34,068
give people jobs, and give a future
to your kids and my kids

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,697
that did for those trucks back there
when our parents

118
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,450
and grandparents worked on refrigerators
and cars.

119
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,370
And the future is bright, folks.
The future is bright.

120
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,258
Please join me in acknowledging
the newly-named Fuyao Avenue.

121
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,409
"Good morning, everyone.
And we meet again today."

122
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:29,915
Every time I visit
this plant, I see a lot of changes.

123
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
"Every time when I visit,
I see great progress."

124
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,256
You see there's still
empty space for more equipment.

125
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,300
It will all be installed within a year.

126
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,191
"If we can follow through
with our plan and become successful here,

127
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,067
this will be a great example

128
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,987
of the US successfully attracting
foreign investment."

129
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,131
Thank you very much.

130
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,573
"Thank you very much."

131
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,305
He says that a lot
of people lost their jobs in this area,

132
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,164
and he thanks you for the opportunity.

133
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,476
And tell him, one time,
he has to come down here

134
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,918
and eat some barbecue with us.

135
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,298
- Okay.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,196
So the clients are satisfied?

137
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,972
Yes, very satisfied.
Especially Chrysler.

138
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,559
I am pairing an American with a Chinese.

139
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,230
The American is the main operator,
with a Chinese supervisor by their side.

140
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,149
They're pretty slow.

141
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
They have fat fingers.

142
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,362
We keep training them over and over.

143
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,745
How you doing?

144
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,083
The chairman has said from the beginning
this is an American company.

145
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,586
It's Fuyao Glass <i>America.</i>
It needs to be an American company,

146
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,147
we need to treat it
like an American company,

147
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,633
but we need to be successful just like
all our plants throughout the world.

148
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,302
So, basically,
this line, that's the stage.

149
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,280
So from there back to the stage,

150
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,990
- and then people out that way.
- Facing that way.

151
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,558
- Yeah.
- We're talking, like,

152
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,644
a concert stage without cover

153
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,022
and potentially a overhang for weather.

154
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,732
We're gonna have to plan for that.

155
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,630
You know what I mean? Like, a concert...

156
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,076
Chairman thinks
we're okay with October weather,

157
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,846
so you don't need any hang.

158
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,246
- No hang.
- What if it rains?

159
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,249
It won't.

160
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,532
It won't.

161
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,884
In October,
the weather will be like it is today.

162
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,029
Chairman thinks, in October,
the weather will be similar

163
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
- to... today.
- Today?

164
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,518
Also, Chairman says
that door can't face this way.

165
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,842
- What door?
- Face... You know, the opening right there.

166
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,649
Well, we just signed a contract, so...

167
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,401
- What?
- That's a big...

168
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,368
You gotta talk to Jimmy about...
I don't know.

169
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,298
- I think it's...
- Jimmy, do you understand what he means?

170
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,783
We just did a purchase order
and ordered a garage door and stuff.

171
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,520
So, you gotta face
some other direction, I think.

172
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,539
- So...
- They already put the door in.

173
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,417
So we're gonna have to change it.
Is that okay?

174
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
- Yeah, we need to change it.
- Okay.

175
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,629
Yeah, Z, just change it.

176
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,341
That's gonna cost us $35,000.

177
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,451
I have an idea,
but I am not sure it's a good one.

178
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,060
We hang two artworks here.

179
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,064
One is something iconic of China,

180
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,815
like the Great Wall.

181
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,653
- The other one is from the US.
- No. Only American ones.

182
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,196
Only American ones.

183
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,448
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

184
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
Don't upset them.

185
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,428
American, just...

186
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,413
They haven't done
good decorative work here.

187
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,624
This can't be here.
It should be moved to the side.

188
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,101
There are... It's required by law

189
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,853
to have one in here,
and it has to be that height.

190
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,021
They're just saying

191
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,273
- that it should be moved to the side.
- We can move it, yeah.

192
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,131
Huh?

193
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,509
David says that is the required height.

194
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,824
We can't place it
down there. It has to be that high.

195
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,225
We can move it to that corner.

196
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
Then up there.

197
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,062
It's a legal requirement. I'll ask him.

198
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,065
He has to ask and see.
He knows this is the right height.

199
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,071
But sometimes,
you have to think, uh, before you do,

200
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,448
so then we don't have to redo the work,

201
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,908
because it costs money.

202
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,035
Yeah, I've... That was done...

203
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,205
I wouldn't have necessarily moved,
but that was done way before I got here.

204
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
Catch another big fish!

205
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,012
Did you all set the bait this way?

206
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,115
- Looks fucking cool!
- How do you set it?

207
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,683
You got the Fuyao employees
down here doing it.

208
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,560
- Oh, yeah?
- They all work at Fuyao.

209
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
- Fuyao or Fiyao?
- Fuyao.

210
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,980
Fiyao? Is that how it's pronounced?

211
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,109
Fuyao. F-U-Y-A-O.

212
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,360
- Fuyao, Inc.
- Fuyao?

213
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,196
- Yes, Fuyao Company.
- What type of company is that?

214
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,614
Uh...

215
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,868
- Automotive glass. They make the glass...
- Yes, make glass.

216
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
- Oh, nice. Okay.
- The car glass.

217
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,121
- Okay, wow, glass.
- Yes.

218
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,933
- Ooh, that's a big one right there.
- Big, yes.

219
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,957
Very big.

220
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,586
- How speak English?
- Carp.

221
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,004
- Carp.
- Carp.

222
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,672
C-A-R-P. Carp.

223
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,717
- C-A-R-P. Carp. Carp.
- Yep. Those are carp.

224
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,635
Now, the carp that you're catching

225
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
- likes corn and Wheaties.
- Uh-huh.

226
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,973
Have you heard of Wheaties cereal?

227
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,201
- I don't know. Wheaty...
- Never heard of Wheaties?

228
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,769
- Wheaties? I don't know.
- Wheaties.

229
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,645
- Wheaties.
- Wheaties.

230
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,441
Yeah, buddy. You'd be surprised
how good Wheaties works.

231
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
Wheaties? W-E-D-S?

232
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
W-E-E-T-E-S.

233
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,659
- No. I don't know that.
- Okay. Yup, it does the best.

234
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,963
Looks like
they're getting ready to go, huh?

235
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,249
We're going home
to gut the fish, and we'll come back.

236
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,877
All right, Leon.
I'mma go home and get me something to eat.

237
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,378
- I'll be back down.
- Okay, okay.

238
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,047
- I'll be back down.
- Nice to meet you.

239
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,298
All right, Leon.

240
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
- Patty?
- Yes?

241
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,266
- I'm getting ready to leave.
- Okay. Mmm.

242
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,643
- All right.
- Have a good day.

243
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,323
For a year and a half,
I didn't have anything.

244
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,914
When I started at Fuyao,

245
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,543
I was thankful, I was blessed, I was...

246
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,255
just on my knees,
thanking God that I had something.

247
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,299
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

248
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,384
Going good.

249
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,802
- All right?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,683
This is the best game in town right now.

251
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,231
Going back in there for the first time,

252
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,150
I kind of welled up because...

253
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,735
I could see the post locations...

254
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,155
you know, on the columns, you know?

255
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,907
Which actually tells you
where you are in the plant.

256
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,451
People still get lost.
I said, "I don't get lost."

257
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,715
<i>At General Motors, I was making $29</i>

258
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
<i>and some change an hour.</i>

259
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,722
<i>At Fuyao, I make 12.84.</i>

260
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,190
<i>Back then, if my kids wanted
a pair of new gym shoes,</i>

261
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,359
<i>I could just go get them.
I can't just do that now.</i>

262
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,906
<i>We lost our home, we lost a vehicle.</i>

263
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,408
- Have a good weekend.
- All right, you too.

264
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,754
When GM closed, I foreclosed on my house.

265
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,674
Ever since then,

266
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,887
I have struggled to try to get back
to middle class again.

267
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,980
I've been living in my sister's basement.

268
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,369
I am fortunate enough to have a bedroom.

269
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,836
And the only thing in here
is my end tables and my TV.

270
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,839
The bed isn't mine. The bed is theirs.

271
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,593
You know? So, yeah.

272
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,362
We've been down about...
I don't know, 45 minutes or so.

273
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,615
Water spots, I guess.

274
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,588
Thank you.

275
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,885
They've drained the washer.
They're slowing it down.

276
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,248
They get upset when
we're all trying to figure something out.

277
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,358
Everybody gets upset,
and then everybody's upset

278
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,443
in their own language,

279
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,070
and then everybody just walks
their own way, and...

280
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,323
meet back here in five minutes.

281
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,491
Set the water temperature to 60°.

282
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
Because it has high alkalinity.

283
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,956
Okay. Later on,
we're going to try to lower the...

284
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,588
Okay.

285
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,801
Be careful!

286
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,264
Beautiful! Beautiful!

287
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,974
Down a little.

288
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,058
Down a little bit!

289
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,661
This damn thing...

290
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,063
- Allen wrench.
- Allen. Allen.

291
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,230
Allen wrench.

292
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,858
- Allen wrench.
- Allen wrench.

293
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:50,202
My first impression
of Ohio was how flat it is.

294
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,123
My family's in China.

295
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,627
Two lovely children

296
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,254
and a beautiful wife.

297
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,429
Fuyao offered me my first job at 18.

298
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,228
I've worked in the furnace
for more than 20 years.

299
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,106
It's a hard job, but I love it.

300
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,074
Because of the language barrier
and cultural differences,

301
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,955
it's hard to quickly integrate
everyone's ideas.

302
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,109
I don't have much time to eat every day.

303
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,260
So every week, I bring a box of Twinkies.

304
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
This is my lunch.

305
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,805
I eat two at a time.

306
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,401
Look at the red sticks.
This one is broken.

307
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,488
We have to pull it out by ourselves.

308
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,159
Look at the scars on my arm.

309
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,411
These are all scalds.

310
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,912
I got burned.

311
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
Air.

312
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,713
Uh, Wong and I have spent
a lot of time together

313
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,631
with him teaching me everything...

314
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,429
Mother's Day, we spent
the whole weekend working together

315
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,348
with our little translators,
talking back and forth.

316
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,600
Uh...

317
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,020
That's when they told me
that they had to be here two years,

318
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,272
away from their family, no extra pay.

319
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,107
That really made me start thinking

320
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,068
and appreciating
what they're doing for us more and more.

321
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,698
I've ate at their house,
they've ate at my home.

322
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,033
We've just bonded.

323
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,369
And we've tried to learn
each other's culture.

324
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,833
I got the big idea, Thanksgiving, to...

325
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,711
invite my close friends,

326
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,714
which should have been
about four or five of them.

327
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,967
It ended up being, I think, 13.

328
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,931
Bought a 25-pound turkey,
the biggest honey-baked ham I could get,

329
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,225
and all of the traditional trimmings.

330
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,479
I know that in China
they're not allowed to have guns.

331
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,691
We had my 12-gauge shotgun out there,
pistols.

332
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,588
Couple of the very brave ones wanted
to go up and down the road with me

333
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,613
on my Harley.

334
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,992
They talked about it forever.

335
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,579
That made me happy.

336
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,126
That's the front page
of <i>The Washington Post, </i>fellas.

337
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,461
That's big-time.

338
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,217
The only negative thing
that I can see from this article

339
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,636
is that, out of our 2,000 people,

340
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,722
they picked the number one UAW...

341
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,685
uh, organizer and sympathizer to talk to.

342
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,768
Number one.

343
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,941
- Anyway, um, it's a big deal.
- That's a big deal.

344
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,442
With all of this scrutiny

345
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,738
and with all of this visibility comes
even more responsibility on us

346
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,699
to do things right.

347
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,993
Now the whole world is watching.

348
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,954
Now the whole world is watching us.

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,674
It should say have "to be <i>the</i> world."

350
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,970
Yeah, they said they had an S.

351
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,262
Good afternoon.

352
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,162
- Right?
- Good afternoon!

353
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,685
Good afternoon.

354
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,391
Thank you guys very much.

355
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,709
You don't know how important this is
to Fuyao

356
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,294
and to the chairman.

357
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,005
The plant looks great.

358
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,632
These people are coming here

359
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,511
to see something that they never
in their lifetime thought would happen.

360
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,640
You have given hope
and you have given life to a community

361
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,558
that was desolate.

362
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,689
This is one of the greatest projects
in the history of the United States.

363
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,150
So, be proud, and most importantly,

364
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,609
have fun.

365
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,695
Two lands,

366
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,589
- the bridge is what brings us together.
- Yeah.

367
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,973
And the...
How do you say in English?

368
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,119
- The bond.
- Bond. Yeah, bond. Bond.

369
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,537
Yes, bond.

370
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,604
Welcome.

371
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,193
Welcome to the US!

372
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,333
<i>Today the chairman's vision
has been fulfilled.</i>

373
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,628
<i>Fuyao has invested close to 500 million.</i>

374
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,892
<i>Ni hao.</i>

375
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,454
Really good seeing you guys. Thank you.

376
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,646
Thanks for having us out here.
We really appreciate it.

377
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,832
- It's a big deal.
- Absolutely.

378
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,274
This is big. A lot of people.

379
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,109
- Nice weather, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

380
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,402
Chairman ordered the weather.

381
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,246
- Oh, I mean, it couldn't be better.
- Right.

382
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,321
Hang in there.

383
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,217
- How you doing, Dave?
- Good to see you.

384
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,326
Yeah, all right.

385
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,172
"My dear guests
and friends, good morning."

386
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:05,011
Today, we hold the opening ceremony

387
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,138
of Fuyao Glass America.

388
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,121
We've heard both candidates
for president

389
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,105
refer to Ohio as the Rust Belt.

390
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,691
And, you know, you look at...
look at this today,

391
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
and we reject that term.

392
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,005
With Chairman Cao, we know
how to make everything in this state.

393
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,782
And, uh, this is a terrific example.

394
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,410
One last point: I know many workers here
are trying to form a union

395
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,871
to strengthen their voice
in this great company.

396
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,749
Ohio has a rich... a rich, rich history

397
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,460
of unions and management working together.

398
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,423
I support those in this community,
in this plant, in this crowd

399
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,927
that want to vote
on whether or not to join a union.

400
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,098
I hope Fuyao looks at it the same way.
Thank you all so much.

401
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,687
Who the fuck does he think he is?

402
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,106
Out of place, totally out of place.

403
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,982
Fuck him.

404
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,485
Three, two, one!

405
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,077
Our glass is totally made in USA.

406
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,833
Ladies, you're doing a beautiful job.

407
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,010
Create good glass and transfer good glass.

408
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,056
The senator mentioned
the workers union in his speech.

409
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,395
Does Fuyao have any good strategies
for avoiding these risks?

410
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,032
Hey, Charles. How you doing, man?

411
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,004
Dave, there's one thing
I gotta talk to you about.

412
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,447
- Mm-hmm.
- Regarding Sherrod Brown's comments...

413
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,198
- Yes.
- Uh...

414
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,951
You know,
that's obviously not beneficial to us.

415
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,035
Absolutely right.

416
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,847
- Don't wanna talk about certain topics.
- Correct.

417
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,290
So I think, at this point,
Chairman, you know,

418
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,167
will definitely ask about

419
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,450
- what we're gonna do about it.
- It's okay. Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,506
I'm gonna have to kill a senator.

421
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:11,095
I'm gonna take those big scissors
and cut the... Senator Brown's head.

422
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,222
He...

423
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,976
- It's big.
- He didn't tell us he was gonna do that.

424
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,395
He did that on purpose,
so they're cut off.

425
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,314
They'll never be allowed
in the plant again.

426
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,488
You all know our stand on this.

427
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,992
We don't want to see the union
developing here.

428
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,662
"First, you all know our stand on this,

429
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,622
that we want to avoid unions."

430
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,501
If we have a union,
it will impact our efficiency,

431
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,127
thus hurting our company.

432
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,714
It will create loss for us.

433
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:52,428
If a union comes in, I'm shutting down.

434
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:58,685
They keep interfering with my production.

435
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,854
Slowly bleeding money is even worse
than a union.

436
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,058
"Uh, right now,

437
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,441
if they're creating extreme inefficiency
in my production,

438
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,610
I'm just bleeding money."

439
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,072
John, if you want
to continue to be president,

440
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,533
you have to listen to my advice.

441
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
Every piece of glass counts.

442
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,713
Every piece that goes down that line
and goes... gets on that customer truck,

443
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,796
it matters.

444
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,049
Our customers are counting on us.

445
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,469
General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda.

446
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,612
Whether it's coming from China
or whether it's coming from Dayton,

447
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,433
it's the same... it's the same thing.

448
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,102
We have to be able to provide them glass

449
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,521
at the same level of efficiency,

450
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,774
the same level of cost and quality.

451
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,068
It's audit day.

452
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,446
We don't have glass to show them.

453
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,656
We should have some ready

454
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,366
for the customers to check.

455
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,370
The glass is gonna
run through the furnace,

456
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,746
basically the same
as the other furnace over here.

457
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,748
This one's just a little bit faster.

458
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
So it comes down the line,
it comes in here.

459
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
Down in here is another one
of those free-liners

460
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,087
that puts the glass into position.

461
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,714
This is an automatic...

462
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,443
Keep it or throw it out?

463
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,278
- Throw out.
- Throw it...? Okay.

464
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,158
There must be some flaws
if the glass exploded.

465
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,080
The overall quality of the glass
is not good enough,

466
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,291
but there's no way to improve it now.
We still want to achieve our targets.

467
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,376
One is output. The second is speed.

468
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,128
We need one more person.

469
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,923
Transfer someone from China here.

470
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,884
You have the Chinese,
who want numbers on this side.

471
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,972
You have Quality, who wants
customer satisfaction on this side.

472
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,516
And we're in the middle.

473
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,145
Today was a shitshow, totally a shitshow.

474
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,774
Any little microscopic chip
can cause a breakage.

475
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,693
As soon as it hits the press,
it begins to cool.

476
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,654
If there's a...

477
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,282
Got it?

478
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,694
Four hundred-and-something degrees.

479
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,517
And they're six feet away from it?

480
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,602
We need to find some solutions,

481
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,605
whether it's them
stepping into a colder room

482
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,399
as soon as they leave there...

483
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,277
We've gotta get them some relief.

484
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,748
How much time do you spend in there?

485
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,000
About ten minutes or so.

486
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,460
- Ten minutes an hour, a day, a...?
- Uh...

487
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
Sometimes every hour.

488
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,841
So every hour? So you go in there,
it's about 200 degrees,

489
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,495
and you clean up in there
for about two hours... All right.

490
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,773
<i>The conditions...</i>

491
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,526
<i>are not favorable.</i>

492
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,448
<i>Doing the same thing over and over again.</i>

493
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,701
<i>That wears on you.</i>

494
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,624
<i>Body, mind...</i>

495
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,046
<i>You're so... It's...</i>

496
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,797
<i>Sometimes you think...</i>

497
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,676
<i>"Why am I doing this?"</i>

498
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,477
<i>You think about
whether you have the stamina</i>

499
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,439
<i>and the will to do this type of job.</i>

500
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,049
Anything they're not happy about?

501
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,592
It gets really hot in here.

502
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,035
Our American colleagues
are very afraid of heat.

503
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,747
We try to give them
the environment they want,

504
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,750
as long as it's within
a reasonable budget.

505
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,589
The spaces between the production lines
are pretty narrow.

506
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,510
The Occupational Safety
& Health Administration

507
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,928
thinks it's too dense.

508
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,056
"A tall tree catches the wind."

509
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,975
Yes, it's a huge tree.

510
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,817
Let's welcome Chairman!

511
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,324
Dear staff,

512
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,075
good morning.

513
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,664
We haven't reached our goals.

514
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,918
This is a very tough challenge for us.

515
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,715
We are all Chinese.

516
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,385
We were born

517
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,557
of Chinese mothers.

518
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:38,232
No matter where you die or are buried,
you will always be Chinese.

519
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,861
The motherland is like a mother.

520
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,321
This is eternal.

521
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,325
Today, Chinese come to the US
to operate factories.

522
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,497
The most important thing
is not how much money we earn,

523
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,960
but how this will change
Americans' views of the Chinese

524
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,087
and towards China.

525
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:08,304
Every Chinese person should do things
for our country and our people.

526
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,060
It's down to every one of you here.

527
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,531
<i>American workers are not efficient,
and output is low.</i>

528
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,950
<i>I can't manage them.</i>

529
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,832
<i>When we try to manage them,
they threaten to get help from the union.</i>

530
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,979
<i>How can we make Americans understand</i>

531
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,316
<i>that the Chinese can open factories
in America?</i>

532
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,529
<i>This is a big problem.</i>

533
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,386
- Hey. Welcome. Thank you.
- Welcome. Nice to see you again.

534
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,536
- How are you? Good?
- Good.

535
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,621

<i>Ni hao.</i> Good morning.
Pleasure to meet you.

551
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,580

<i>Ni hao.</i>

557
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,052
Good morning, my name is John Withrow.
I'm supervisor in Lamination.

558
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,846
Uh, good morning. I'm Austin Cole.

559
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,724
I'm a tempering backlight
production supervisor.

560
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,271
Uh, Jon Helton,
the continuous improvement supervisor.

561
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,526
Good morning, Darren Noble.
Lead supervisor, ARG packaging assembly.

562
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,280
Welcome, everybody.

563
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,282
Welcome home.

564
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,832
The whole world is looking at FGA
and you guys are the top guns.

565
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,089
We are investing in the US.

566
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,509
We love the country,
and we want to be part of the country

567
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,178
and provide benefits to the country.

568
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,599
And we hope that FGA
will be profitable soon

569
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:26,854
and to let our customers know
that we are a strong company.

570
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,233
This is a very valuable time
and also a special time.

571
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,445
Tonight we'll have you join
our year-end group party,

572
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:39,867
and, uh, we also hope you can, uh,
get some time to taste local cuisines.

573
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,828
Thank you for putting us up
in a nice hotel.

574
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,245
Yes.

575
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,584
I think that we are also anxious
to see how your process runs

576
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,170
and look forward to taking back new ideas

577
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,797
and implementations
to help us run better as well.

578
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,697
I can't breathe in that.

579
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,452
Nonstop.

580
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,312
This is the line they'll run 7,000 on?

582
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,692
We hope someday to get this good.

583
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,205
Attention!

584
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,249
Dress right!

585
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,755
Keep an eye on the distance

586
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,048
between yourself and others.

587
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,175
Eyes front!

588
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,968
Straddle.

589
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,472
Hello, everyone!

590
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,057
Good! We are good.

591
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,476
Number off!

592
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,393
- One.
- Two.

593
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,311
- Three.
- Four.

594
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,228
- Five.
- Six.

595
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,229
- Seven.
- Eight.

596
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,147
- Nine.
- Ten.

597
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,064
Eleven.

598
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:16,982
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

599
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:17,941
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen.

600
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:18,901
- Sixteen.
- Seventeen.

601
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,860
Eighteen.

602
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,069
Nineteen. Report!

603
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,590
There should be 19 people in this team,
and all 19 people are here.

604
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Over!

605
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
Good afternoon.

606
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,660
Good afternoon.

607
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,413
- Sorry.
- Sorry! Sorry!

608
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,124
- Please.
- Please. Please.

609
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

610
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,835
Attention.

611
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,798
- Our team name is?
- Improvement!

612
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,256
Our slogan is?

613
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,927
To stand still is to move back!

614
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,344
Attention!

615
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,268
The preparation meeting is over.

616
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,439
Dismissed.

617
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,090
I heard things
are not going too well over there.

618
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,163
Right. That's true.
That's why we're doing training here.

619
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,710
You guys have eight days off
every month.

620
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,128
You have all the weekends.

621
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,297
Only eight hours a day.
That's an easy life.

622
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,381
Yes.

623
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,677
These workers only have
one or two days off per month.

624
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,428
They're not too happy about that.

625
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:34,434
That's why I told you
American workers are too lazy.

626
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,062
It's just your nature. But you're not bad.

627
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:41,900
- Every person can be changed.
- We have some extremely diligent workers.

628
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,070
Very motivated, very ambitious.

629
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,153
They're great.

630
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,242
But most workers are there
just to make money,

631
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,660
not to make glass.

632
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,412
How many hours a day do they work?

633
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,788
Eight hours per shift.

634
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,583
Eight hours. So about 100 dollars a day.

635
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,545
Here we say you have to be worthy
of your salary.

636
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,298
You need to prove you deserve it.
You understand, right?

637
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,591
Yes, I understand.

638
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,263
I heard that your workers like
to joke around and talk a lot.

639
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,683
The best tool we can use is duct tape.

640
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,978
Put it over their mouths.
They will perform better.

641
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,733
- Tape?
- Tape on their mouths.

642
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,817
Can you do that there?

643
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,238
No, we can't. But if we could do that,
we'd have improved production.

644
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,241
Because they're too chatty now.

645
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,161
Well, the most important thing

646
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,915
is thatyou all should be united
and concentrate your efforts.

647
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,719
It's not bad working here.

648
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,387
I'm married.

649
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,056
My child is in my hometown.

650
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,226
We don't have many holidays,
so I don't have much time to go back home.

651
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,188
Only during the Spring Festival,
once a year.

652
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,775
We work 12 hours a shift.

653
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,406
I'm tired, but I have no choice.

654
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,394
<i>We work
whenever we're asked by our leader.</i>

655
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,997
<i>I have two kids now.</i>

656
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,833
<i>One is six months old,
the other is four years old.</i>

657
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,918
<i>They're pretty young.</i>

658
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,172
<i>If we're too busy, we may not be able
to take days off.</i>

659
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,467
<i>I only go home once or twice a year.</i>

660
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,139
<i>My older kid is 11,
and the younger one is eight.</i>

661
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:43,355
<i>I work long hours
and I spend very little time with them.</i>

662
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,904
Holy shit.

663
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,409
They don't have any safety glasses on,
nothing. Unbelievable.

664
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,202
Those aren't even cut-resistant gloves.

665
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,454
Man, that is nuts.

666
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,456
You gotta be kidding me.

667
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:08,005
The glass in our factory...

668
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,009
Different glass colors
have different values for recycling.

669
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,412
So they have to sort the colors.

670
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,282
These people sit there
all day long doing that.

671
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,476
That's fucking crazy.
Picking through fucking glass like that.

672
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,014
We are energetic at Fuyao.

673
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:04,561
All of us are energetic
and happy to work here.

674
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:09,566
All of our workers
are members of the workers union.

675
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,541
Mao Zedong,

676
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,628
and this is Deng Xiaoping,

677
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,338
Jiang Zemin,

678
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,506
Hu Jintao,

679
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,757
Xi Jinping.

680
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,971
These are the five leaders
since China was established.

681
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:46,937
Without backing from the government,
the company wouldn't get too far.

682
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,315
Our workers union and the company

683
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,068
are closely related to each other.

684
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:57,280
They are like two gears rotating together.

685
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,826
We need our workers
to fight for Fuyao's success.

686
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,162
We are all in the same boat.

687
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,790
Keeping the boat safe
means everyone is safe.

688
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:11,294
If the boat sinks,
everyone loses their jobs.

689
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,797
It's quite simple.

690
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,267
Chairman Cao, here is a <i>hada</i> for you.

691
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,773
Next on the red carpet will be workers
from two teams.

692
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:36,027
They have won the Excellent Team award.

693
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,230
Year 2017...

694
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,283
"Soaring ambitions."

695
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,245
"The spirit of craftsmanship
is all over China."

696
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:06,600
Let's welcome
Chairman Cao with our warmest applause!

697
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,825
Dear Chairman,

698
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,037
dear colleagues,

699

everybody from the United States,
with China's operations.

727

Very harmonious people.

728
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,762

739
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,998
From this moment on,

740
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,834
no matter poor or rich,

741
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,254
you will always care for her,

742
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,297
cherish her, and protect her,

743
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,715
until forever.

744
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,842
Will you?

745
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,605
- Yes, I will.
- Yes, I will.

746
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,330
We're one...

747
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,083
big planet.

748
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,299
A world...

749
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,261
somewhat divided.

750
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,601
But we're one.

751
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,941
And tonight is an example.

752
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,571
- Happy. Happy.
- Aww!

753
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,739
Happytears.

754
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,325
I'm very happy to share in your culture.

755
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,660
- Thanks so much.
- No, thank you.

756
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,120
We are one.

757
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,122
- Yes, we are one.
- We are one.

758
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,875
Yes. One tongue, one company.

759
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,959
Yes.

760
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,627
Thank you.

761
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,297
- Aren't watermelons sweet?
- Sweet!

762
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:35,011
Choose the best picture
to put on the cover

763
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,094
of the next edition of <i>Fuyao People!</i>

764
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,607
<i>This is my community,</i>

765
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,610
<i>um, and to see
this building come back to life,</i>

766
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,902
<i>it meant a lot to me.</i>

767
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,615
<i>Fuyao is the leader,
Fuyao is changing the industry,</i>

768
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,202
<i>and I see us becoming
number one in the world next year</i>

769
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,704
<i>and number one in the world every year.</i>

770
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,768
- Yes, sir. How are you doing?
- I have a really good idea for you.

771
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,668
Why don't you film

772
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,712
those three microwave ovens
that have been out for two weeks

773
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,881
- that haven't been replaced?
- Okay.

774
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,175
- Why don't you film that?
- We will.

775
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:18,137
And tell me why this area
is now gonna be used for production

776
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,515
- and no longer a lunchroom.
- Uh...

777
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,726
There's signs all over that say that.
Where's the lunchroom gonna be?

778
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,145
- I have no clue. You're telling me...
- That's typical.

779
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,915
You're telling me...
telling me something new.

780
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,566
I just got back from vacation.

781
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,835
They're gonna take all the tables
and all the chairs out

782
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,779
and make this a production space.
Like everywhere else.

783
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,532
I hope they make your office
a production space.

784
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,413
They manage to have these things on
all the time. This is America.

785
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,874
We don't need Chinese children
singing and praying.

786
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,546
Coming back from the China trip, uh,

787
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,509
some of the things
I started implementing, uh...

788
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,800
Well, the first thing
I implemented was, uh...

789
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,468
At our pre-shift meeting,

790
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,221
we used to just kind of sit at the tables
and talk and...

791
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,057
watching the Chinese shift meeting,
where he had them all lined up...

792
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,269
I've found that that's worked out
really well for me back here.

793
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,187
Good morning, everybody!

794
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,150
Greg, I need you to stand on two,
starting off.

795
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,234
Uh...

796
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,363
Chuck, I need you standing on three.

797
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,950
I think that's everybody.

798
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,702
It's an experiment.

799
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,872
So, the lines are running okay today?

800
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,333
Uh, everybody got your glasses and boots?

801
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,001
We're good?

802
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,420
Any questions?

803
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,216
Okay, let's have a good day.

804
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,118
- They're gonna do surgery for your hand?
- They're gonna tell me tomorrow.

805
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,478
They'll tell you tomorrow
what your recovery's gonna be.

806
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,355
Yeah, they'll probably start
at four weeks,

807
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,273
determine what...
you know, how it's gonna be,

808
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,651
and then, from there,
go to the eight weeks.

809
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,528
I'm worried about my points.

810
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,238
- No, no...
- No, no, no, no.

811
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,382
Don't worry about any of that.

812
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,967
Don't have to worry
about your points for missing time.

813
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,201
I don't wanna lose my job.

814
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,328
No, you're not gonna lose your job.

815
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,245
- What's that?
- My pay?

816
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,163
Yes.

817
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,081
It's covered?

818
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,333
Yes. I don't know how all of that works,

819
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,416
but it is.

820
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,459
Yeah.

821
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,724
<i>Everybody at every level will say
we really, really, really want to be safe.</i>

822
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,977
<i>But safe doesn't pay the bills.</i>

823
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:42,657
<i>The room that we work in,
there's only one way in,</i>

824
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,742
<i>no doors on the opposite side.</i>

825
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,496
<i>If a fire breaks out,</i>

826
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,873
<i>that's like being trapped.</i>

827
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,883
They're wanting us to pull one
of those big sheets off and inspect it.

828
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,637
Some of this float glass is so big

829
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,931
that I'm gonna have people
exposing their face,

830
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,642
and I don't... I don't need to do that.

831
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,105
A couple days ago,
I had to tell the Chinese fellow

832
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:19,777
that I absolutely refuse to pick up
two loads with a stand-up forklift.

833
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,320
It's not strong enough.

834
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,991
I said, "If you want to do it,
that's fine, you do it. I'm not doing it.

835
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,952
I'm not...
I'm not risking somebody's life."

836
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,799
Out of all my working life,

837
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,804
I have never ever
had a workplace injury, ever.

838
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,850
I mean, 15 years at General Motors,

839
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,811
you know, never a workplace injury.

840
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,274
And then my new job at Fuyao...

841
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,817
what happens?

842
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,236
I get a workplace injury.

843
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,808
Right now,
I'm outside the Moraine plant here,

844
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,334
off of Kettering Boulevard.

845
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,879
There have been
11 safety complaints filed against Fuyao.

846
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,465
Some workers claim
unsafe working conditions

847
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,548
and unfair treatment.

848
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,260
I say "people," you say "power."

849
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,595
- People!
- Power!

850
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,263
- People!
- Power!

851
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,641
I say "people," you say "union."

852
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,184
- People!
- Union!

853
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,685
- People!
- Union!

854
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,996
All right! Whoo!

855
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,439
Uh, meeting after work,
don't forget, next week.

856
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,608
We'll see you there. Bring your coworkers.

857
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:45,780
There's a lot of information
that you're seeing on TV about Fuyao.

858
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,491
"Safety concerns,"

859
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,453
um, other things that are...
are being reported,

860
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,373
much of which we do not believe are true.

861
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,459
'Cause if you bring in a union...

862
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,255
this becomes illegal.

863
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,215
You cannot do it anymore.

864
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,680
Instead, if I'm an employee,

865
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,224
I have to take my concerns
to the union rep.

866
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:18,020
When we had this training in private,

867
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,857
I was horrified by this picture.

868
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,528
If this becomes a reality,

869
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,865
we wouldn't be able
to communicate directly

870
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,159
with our American coworkers.

871
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,288
Isn't that terrible?

872
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,891
If we are able to improve
our management capabilities,

873
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,269
it will help quell the union rebellion.

874
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,498
"And if we are able
to improve our management capabilities,

875
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:05,234
it will help with our campaign
against union organizations..."

876
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:10,656
<i>We hired Americans to work
as our managers and supervisors.</i>

877
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:16,746
<i>Our expectation was
that we could trust them,</i>

878
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,875
<i>pay them a high salary,
and they would serve the company.</i>

879
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,258
<i>Why didn't they?</i>

880
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:35,890
<i>I think they are hostile to Chinese.</i>

881
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:44,190
The loss from January to October

882
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,860
is about 40 million US dollars.

883
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,615
We have to reverse the tide
as soon as possible.

884
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,701
With the new restructuring,

885
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,663
I believe we will see this plant
in profit very soon.

886
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,750
We've invited Jeff Liu
to be our new president.

887
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,300
Uh, good morning, everyone.

888
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:18,015
I was born in 1963,
in the Year of the Rabbit.

889
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,228
I've spent 27 years in the US
and 26 years in China.

890
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,108
People always guess I am in my 40s,
but I'm actually 53.

891
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,819
Why is that? Because I have passion.

892
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,321
I have determination to do things well.

893
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,665
"A major shake-up
of the company's senior management team,

894
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,750
with company President John Gauthier

895
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,004
and Vice President Dave Burrows leaving."

896
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,547
Actually...

897
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,673
terminated.

01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,606

907
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,158
Hello, everybody!

908
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,869
I would like to use this opportunity

909
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,414
to thank each of you for the hard work.

910
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,501
And also, we need to work as a team

911
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,504
under one roof, one culture,

912
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,216
and make a great year for 2017.

913
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,676
We can turn the company around.

914
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,806
We make more money, and everybody
gonna share the piece of pie.

915
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,015
How's that?

916
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:28,938
Not bad.

917
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,292
You want a hat, Chairman?

918
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,402
He asked if you want a hat.

919
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:39,698
Of course.

920
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,283
Here you go, boss.

921
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,746
Let me wear a hat.

922
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,166
Hi.

923
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,003
- <i>Ni hao.
- Ni hao, ni hao, ni hao.</i>

924
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,463
- Hello.
<i>- Ni hao.</i>

925
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,340
<i>Ni hao.</i>

926
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,113
<i>Someone from work
was kind enough to tell me</i>

927
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,240
<i>that there were these apartments.</i>

928
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,243
<i>Four hundred and eighty dollars a month.</i>

929
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,078
<i>I fell in love with it.</i>

930
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,542
<i>I can afford to live here</i>

931
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,130
<i>and have my own place
and feel independent again.</i>

932
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,808
Mmm. Smells good.

933
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,209
This is the most enjoyable moment
in a day.

934
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:17,838
After I finish the cigarette,
my mind just calms down.

935
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:25,512
We workers lay down tracks

936
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,767
so the train can run smoothly.

937
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:36,482
The only thing we have in mind
is to do our best.

938
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,944
That's true for everyone here.

939
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:42,947
My wife.

940
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:49,245
My toothache has gone.

941
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,332
I've fully recovered.

942
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,557
The last time I cried, I was a teenager.

943
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,561
But I cried once after coming here.

944
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,857
I don't dare mention that to other people.

945
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:26,448
But when all is quiet
in the dead of night,

946
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:32,746
I miss my family.

947
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:52,016
<i>I've learned most of what I learned
from Leon and Wong.</i>

948
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,646
<i>None of us knew glass when we came there.</i>

949
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,844
<i>When you get to be my age,
not too many people wanna hire you.</i>

950
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,536
<i>They don't wanna take a chance.</i>

951
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,876
<i>My brother, he's my Chinese brother.</i>

952
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,048
<i>I would have his back, just like I'd have
one of my own brothers'.</i>

953
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,592
<i>I just... I think the world of him.</i>

954
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,099
Are you okay?

955
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,896
My supervisor started yelling at me.

956
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,442
- When... You work at the table right there.
- I was working right here just fine.

957
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,087
- Now he wanna change it right over here.
- We know, the table over there.

958
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,739
Now, instead of here,
they want you to do it here? Okay.

959
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:51,116
He said he expects us
to do eight boxes at a time.

960
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,219
I just want to make sure
you're not gonna get hurt.

961
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,804
He said he want us to push them in here.

962
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,140
Well, now, you... It's probably too heavy
for you to push it.

963
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,958
- So you need to let him know that.
- I don't understand.

964
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,420
Sometimes,
why she don't know to tell that?

965
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:06,131
Make sure you're communicating to them
that you need help.

966
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,049
I have.

967
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,217
He knows.

968
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,557
Rather than trying to find resolution,
they try to find out who's wrong.

969
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,310
And, in this case, they're both wrong.

970
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,675
You need some skills to handle Americans.

971
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,985
How can we take advantage
of American characteristics

972
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,571
to make them work for Fuyao?

973
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,951
There's a culture in the US

974
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:38,372
where children
are showered with encouragement.

975
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:44,086
So everyone who grows up in the US
is overconfident.

976
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,464
They are super confident.

977
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:52,177
Americans love being flattered to death.

978
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,806
You will get into trouble
if you fight with them.

979
01:13:56,723 --> 01:14:00,269
"Donkeys like being touched
in the direction their hair grows."

980
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,186
Right?

981
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,275
You should touch donkeys
in the direction their hair grows.

982
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,734
Otherwise, they'll kick you.

983
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,447
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You do? Okay.

984
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:16,910
We need to use our wisdom
to guide them and help them.

985
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,495
Because we are better than them.

986
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,785
<i>They refer to us as "the foreigners."</i>

987
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:30,132
<i>People just want... They wanna feel
like they're in America working,</i>

988
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,029
<i>not like, when they walk in the door,</i>

989
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,428
<i>that they've left America
and they're now in China.</i>

990
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,016
<i>They work nonstop.
They're in there all the time.</i>

991
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:42,186
<i>Around the clock, 24 hours a day.
They're in there on Sundays.</i>

992
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,914
<i>There's been some days, they don't want us
to take a break for lunch,</i>

993
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,441
<i>because they need X amount of glass out.</i>

994
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,903
<i>The Chinese really
don't help us out at all.</i>

995
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,530
<i>They just walk around
and tell the Americans what to do.</i>

996
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,991
<i>"Just do this." And you're like, "Why?"</i>

997
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,994
<i>They don't tell you why at all,
and they walk away.</i>

998
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,081
<i>I know it's a growing company,
I know it's new.</i>

999
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,167
<i>But with the workload that comes with it,</i>

1000
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,090
<i>you know,
you wanna keep your employees around,</i>

1001
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,712
<i>especially your good workers.</i>

1002
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,965
<i>A simple pay raise,
even if it's just a dollar.</i>

1003
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,885
<i>Just show your appreciation for them
and their hard work.</i>

1004
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,891
<i>Optimism, hope.
That was what we were all going in with.</i>

1005
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,060
<i>The future looked bright.</i>

1006
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,355
<i>Now, it's just... It's a 180.</i>

1007
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,317
<i>To me, it's like they don't respect you.</i>

1008
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,535
<i>At least 3,000 people have come and gone,
either fired or quit.</i>

1009
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,916
Whenever you have a frustrating day,
you can go outside and...

1010
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,668
throw your bin over.

1011
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,097
Every one of our bosses were demoted.

1012
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,724
- Yeah.
- The Chinese are in control.

1013
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,894
Have the Chinese changed their mind?

1014
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,689
Are they not gonna turn this over to us?

1015
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,418
Because that was one of the...
definitely that was one of the things

1016
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,278
that intrigued me about coming here.

1017
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,573
I love the fact that they came in here.
I love this business.

1018
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,158
I worked at Appleton for over 20 years

1019
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,161
and I was one of the guys
that got laid off in 2012.

1020
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,081
I've been looking for something
for four years.

1021
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,793
I like working
with the people on the floor.

1022
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,837
They are working their tails off.

1023
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,591
And they're not getting anything for it,

1024
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,135
and I'm not talking about compensation.

1025
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:40,304
They're not getting patted on the back.

1026
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,791
I've seen the Chinese
pouring chemicals down the drain

1027
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,351
- out the back of our dock.
- Mm-hmm.

1028
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,435
Chemicals.

1029
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,373
There was a trail of yellow paint
going right to the sewer.

1030
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,208
- Right out our back door.
- You couldn't miss it.

1031
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,735
It... It's like they don't even know
what the rules are.

1032
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:55,986
It's...

1033
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:59,406
And I'm thinking,
"This is all going into the sewer

1034
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,075
and going into drinking water somewhere."

1035
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,955
I don't wanna waste your time
and I don't wanna to waste my time.

1036
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,624
With what we say at this table,

1037
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,375
will it make a difference?

1038
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,407
I've asked security to come escort you out
if you're going to do that.

1039
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,491
Okay.

1040
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,896
Man, they treat these people like shit
in there.

1041
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,529
Sometimes, you gotta be Sally Field.

1042
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,454
If there are things your boss
can't fix for you, come talk to me.

1043
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,290
Especially how to manage American workers.

1044
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,628
Can we force them to work overtime?

1045
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,755
- Americans?
- Americans.

1046
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:40,924
From HR's perspective,

1047
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,594
we can't force them to work overtime.

1048
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,180
We can't say anything like that.

1049
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,976
But in China, it's mandatory.

1050
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,062
The Americans...
I don't give a shit what they think.

1051
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,897
Go ahead and sue me,

1052
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,066
but they should come the hell in
on Saturdays.

1053
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,026
That's how I would do it.

1054
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:27,554
I think the most
important thing is mutual understanding.

1055
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:34,728
We're under enormous pressure here.

1056
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,398
A lot more pressure than in China.

1057
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:44,529
There was a guy who couldn't fall asleep
for a couple of days.

1058
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:49,868
I really admire Americans.

1059
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,369
They can work two jobs.

1060
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,331
They can have another job
besides working here.

1061
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,044
I always thought Americans lived
a comfortable and superior life.

1062
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:04,549
I thought they didn't have
to make any sacrifices.

1063
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,405
Good afternoon, everyone.

1064
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,449
Good afternoon.

1065
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:33,203
All the stories that you've heard
about Fuyao is true.

1066
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:35,789
Just to give you an idea how things are,

1067
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,542
my daughter does nails for a living.

1068
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,087
Last year,
she made $13,000 more than I did.

1069
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,006
Now, think about that.

1070
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,510
She cleared $40,000. I made 27.

1071
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,804
Something's wrong with that.

1072
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,141
A coworker of mine was fired

1073
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,145
for being hospitalized for a week
and not calling off.

1074
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,274
That could've been me. What if I got sick?

1075
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,025
Would they fire me?

1076
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,111
The man I was working with,

1077
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,822
the cardboard he was sitting on
caught on fire.

1078
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,032
And they just kept right on working.

1079
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:15,036
Dayton taxpayers
and the state of Ohio have committed

1080
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,832
tens of millions of dollars to Fuyao,

1081
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:24,004
and yet Fuyao management has failed
to provide the good and the safe jobs

1082
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,339
that this community deserves.

1083
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:29,885
Labor.

1084
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,930
Working people and the labor movement
built America.

1085
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,310
It is what made America great
the first time.

1086
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,480
The working people at Fuyao right now
who don't have a...

1087
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,608
You have a birthright that's paid for

1088
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:47,360
by the sweat and blood
of people in this room

1089
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,613
and people who have gone
before people in this room,

1090
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,574
so that you had a right to fair life,

1091
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,618
to a workplace that was safe.

1092
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,954
We fought these battles 70 years ago.

1093
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,248
We rejected 70 years ago

1094
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,293
that management and companies
and rich people

1095
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,295
get to pick and choose

1096
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,298
what happens to you or what you get
or what you don't get.

1097
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,552
Nothing in America has changed

1098
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,013
in terms of working people working hard.

1099
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,806
That's not what changed in America.

1100
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,643
What changed in America
was people at the top

1101
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,312
deciding they wanted to rewrite the rules

1102
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,105
to take advantage of people.

1103
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,235
To make it in their favor at your expense.

1104
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,697
And you have a right and an obligation
to say no to that,

1105
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,951
and that's what unionizing at Fuyao
is all about.

1106
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,246
And over the course of fighting for this
all these years,

1107
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:44,376
we found a way for companies to make money
and still be fair to employees,

1108
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,628
and still pay employees a decent wage,

1109
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,713
and still make sure that they were safe.

1110
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,715
These two things can exist together.

1111
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,551
As you fight this fight at Fuyao,

1112
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,805
as UAW stands by you
and fights that fight with you,

1113
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:01,726
as we show Fuyao that we do things
a little bit different in Dayton, Ohio,

1114
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,313
I will be there every step of the way
fighting with you,

1115
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,983
on the side of UAW,
on the side of workers,

1116
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,694
and we will win this fight. Thank you.

1117
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,910
- Morning.
- Morning.

1118
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,913
Next Monday...

1119
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,083
everybody already employed in this room,

1120
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,502
whatever you're paid today,
two dollars more.

1121
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:31,840
Thank you.

1122
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:43,101
Everybody, whatever you make today,
two dollars more next Monday.

1123
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,352
Yeah!

1124
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,563
Great?

1125
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,749
And the people say, "Why are you
doing that? We're losing money."

1126
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:57,907
The good efficiency generate
from the good employee.

1127
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,745
How do we keep a good employee?
Better pay.

1128
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:08,251
We want to be the best employer
in this town. But in return...

1129
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,880
work hard, work longer.

1130
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,216
Our team here,
we can do the same job as China.

1131
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:22,390
Raise the bar, and I believe the future
will belong to everybody.

1132
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,016
Thanks again.

1133
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:06,643
Victory! Whoo!

1134
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:12,690
- We are the union!
- We are the union!

1135
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,485
- UAW!
- UAW!

1136
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:18,822
They don't want to have to abide
by the rules and regulations

1137
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,323
of the United States.

1138
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:23,284
They're in America,
and we want to make sure

1139
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,246
that they abide by the laws in America.

1148
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,089
<i>if we have it written out in a contract.</i>

1149
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,758
<i>That's why we need a union.</i>

1150
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,846
<i>Management would listen to us
because they had to.</i>

1151
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,852
<i>Every job I've ever worked on,
being a black woman,</i>

1152
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:36,941
<i>that's the only way that we have a chance.</i>

1153
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,361
I understand that, at times,
there's gonna be a need for a union,

1154
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,573
but right now, I got a man
that's given me a good job,

1155
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,951
given me a good wage,
and allowed me to come to work every day.

1156
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:50,747
I don't have any need for somebody else
to come in and get in the middle of this.

1157
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:56,044
<i>The only thing the union's
gonna do is keep the bad workers.</i>

1158
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:59,505
<i>And the good workers, it's just gonna
go along like it is for us.</i>

1159
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,634
<i>How's that work for me?</i>

1160
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:19,817
I know
there are some union activists here.

1161
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:24,530
I know because I have people

1162
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,491
who spy for me.

1163
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:30,870
I have many different ways
to deal with them.

1164
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,206
Here is one. He is pro-union.

1165
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:39,462
This is him. This person here.

1166
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,550
Look, we get along pretty well.

1167
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,929
You won't see him here
in two weeks' time.

1168
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,484
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1169
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,403
<i>I want to thank you so much for coming.</i>

1170
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:05,321
<i>I know you didn't have a choice.</i>

1171
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,329
<i>The union will go out of their way</i>

1172
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,493
<i>to try to convince you
that it's a good thing for you</i>

1173
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,375
<i>and that it is in your best interest.</i>

1174
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:19,877
<i>The contract that you get,</i>

1175
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,296
<i>if you get one,</i>

1176
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,923
<i>might include better wages and benefits.</i>

1177
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:27,677
<i>That contract might include the same wages
and benefits you have today.</i>

1178
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:33,641
<i>And that contract finally might include
less wages and less benefits.</i>

1179
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,604
<i>And the threat of a strike
is no longer scary to employers,</i>

1180
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:42,650
<i>because today if you go on strike,
while you can't get fired,</i>

1181
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,820
<i>the employer has the right
to permanently replace you.</i>

1182
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:48,489
<i>I'll let that sink in.</i>

1183
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:54,120
<i>You can't get fired for going on strike,
but you can get permanently replaced.</i>

1184
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,415
<i>So are you telling us
not to vote for the union?</i>

1185
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,418
<i>I'm here to tell you to do what you want.</i>

1186
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,545
<i>I got a question. Who do you work for?</i>

1187
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,065
<i>I work for a company called
Labor Relations Institute.</i>

1188
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,507
<i>We're a labor consulting firm.</i>

1189
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,676
- <i>Is the company paying you?
- Yes.</i>

1190
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,738
<i>Didn't I say that?
I usually say that in every meeting.</i>

1191
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,406
- <i>No.
- No, you didn't say that yet.</i>

1192
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,600
<i>Well, the reality is,
they pay me to consult with you here...</i>

1193
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,310
<i>They pay you to talk to us?</i>

1194
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:20,289
<i>They pay me. They don't pay me
enough to stand up here and lie to you.</i>

1195
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,148
<i>Okay?</i>

1196
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:30,615
He says that he was being impartial,
but he wasn't.

1197
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,621
The UAW is free to use
everywhere else in the world.

1198
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,415
If they want to pay our...
pay our workforce

1199
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:42,335
to sit through a presentation,
to listen to the pitch,

1200
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,003
that's their right.

1201
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,465
But while they're on our clock,
it's our message.

1202
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,261
They spent a lot of money
to bring these people in here

1203
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,847
to make sure that every employee

1204
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,100
goes through this session,

1205
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,852
not once, but twice, maybe three times.

1206
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:05,149
They have people walking around there
with patches and stickers on

1207
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,860
that's saying: "Vote no.

1208
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,779
You still have a voice."

1209
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:11,864
Now, my question to them people are:

1210
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,242
What voice do you have?

1211
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,619
When have you ever had a voice?

1212
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,855
Ever since they started
this job, it's been a two-man job.

1213
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,816
When they put me out here on it,

1214
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:49,819
they decided they wanted it to be
a one-person job.

1215
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,866
When I went to talk to HR,
I told them they were targeting me.

1216
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:00,413
Put me on a job to set me up
to write me up for performance issues

1217
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:01,789
and fire me.

1218
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,902
<i>I got the phone call from Fuyao</i>

1219
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,820
<i>that they had fired me.</i>

1220
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,365
<i>I really truly feel like...
that they targeted me.</i>

1221
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:42,371
<i>I was on the news,
I was at the city council meetings.</i>

1222
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,753
<i>It's been a pretty sad...</i>

1223
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:51,296
<i>few days.</i>

1224
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,800
<i>This sinking feeling of...</i>

1225
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,886
<i>"I don't have a job."</i>

1226
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,640
<i>I mean, I'm a good worker.</i>

1227
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,809
Workers union!

1228
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,189
<i>Should I have gotten so involved?</i>

1229
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,150
<i>Put my whole life into it?</i>

1230
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,117
Here's old Fuyao.

1231
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,621
Can't spell Fuyao without F-U.

1232
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,379
When I was at Fuyao,
I didn't think we needed a union.

1233
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:35,591
Move forward to today, you have no voice,
you have...

1234
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:38,844
Truly, you...

1235
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:43,808
From what I'm told, there really isn't
an American with authority

1236
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,394
that they can talk to.

1237
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:48,728
You know, I...

1238
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,399
I think these employees need something.

1239
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,447
I think I need to make
only two more trips this year,

1240
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:01,701
if you achieve what you planned.

1241
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,454
Why do I need to come here?
It's not convenient for me. Right?

1242
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,541
You think I like to come to America
every month?

1243
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,668
It's tiring.

1244
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:14,797
Is the union making any noise?

1245
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,674
No, not too much.

1246
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,217
Better than it was before.

1247
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:22,763
Recently,
we fired a lot of union supporters.

1248
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:28,144
We have tried different ways.
It's worked out.

1249
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,080
- Uh...
- A lot of active ones left...

1250
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,648
Then you guys should hire
more excellent people.

1251
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:33,774
Young people.

1252
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:37,415
This is the culture I want
for our company.

1253
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:40,197
- Mmm.
- Then we will have a good atmosphere here.

1254
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,281
Mmm.

1255
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:46,370
A lot of things here in the US
are different from China.

1256
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:50,249
Well, we've invested here already.
It's just not working that well.

1257
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,295
- Ah?
- Mmm.

1258
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,220
Morning, y'all.

1259
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,640
- Fired up, ready to vote.
- Ready to win!

1260
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:07,099
- Ready to vote.
- Ready to win.

1261
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,934
- Ready to win!
- There you go.

1262
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,812
- You ready to win.
- All right, girl!

1263
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,689
Fired up, ready to win!

1264
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:17,693
These are actually people
from the United Auto Workers Union,

1265
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:21,572
and they're out here demonstrating,
trying to encourageFuyao employees

1266
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:22,782
to vote "yes."

1267
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,325
Fuyao released a statement earlier

1268
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:27,745
saying that they believe
the United Workers Union is corrupted

1269
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,872
and they hope that the workers vote "no."

1270
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:33,668
More than 1,500 workers are expected...

1271
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,630
We all have a psychological shadow.

1272
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:48,057
Fuyao doesn't want to be controlled
by the union.

1273
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,603
As the Chinese saying goes,

1274
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:55,606
"One mountain cannot hold two tigers."

1275
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,366
<i>Voting just ended an hour ago.</i>

1276
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:09,912
<i>Now the National Labor Relations Board
is counting those votes inside the plant</i>

1277
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:13,124
<i>with both Fuyao and UAW watching...</i>

1278
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,381
Yes!

1279
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,968
<i>We won by a landslide.</i>

1280
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:27,221
We won 60%?

1281
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:28,597
<i>Right.</i>

1282
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,266
We're awesome!

1283
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,520
868 noes, 444 yes.

1284
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,648
Yeah.

1285
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:39,399
Yeah.

1286
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,610
I wasn't shocked...

1287
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,614
because I know the...
the young people got scared.

1288
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:50,619
Them LRI people
scared the shit out of 'em, that's all.

1289
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,499
Before we started having those trainings,

1290
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:56,834
I felt like there was a big "yes" vote.

1291
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,419
They spoke a lot about a strike,

1292
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:01,130
and like, not being able to be paid,
unless we... You know.

1293
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:05,009
So, I feel like people, you know,
are worried about their income.

1294
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,428
'Cause I definitely was, you know? So...

1295
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:10,765
There you have it. Overwhelming no.

1296
01:36:30,242 --> 01:36:31,442
Good morning, everyone.

1297
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,870
Morning.

1298
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:34,955
Last night I couldn't sleep

1299
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,790
because I feel...

1300
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,711
even more heavier burden on my shoulder.

1301
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,714
You guys gave me a chance

1302
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,467
to make FGA better.

1303
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:52,056
My goal is gonna work with the team
to make sure

1304
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:56,769
every single issue
I cannot resolve overnight,

1305
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,312
but give me some time.

1306
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:00,773
Can we do this?

1307
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,983
Yeah?

1308
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:06,153
All right, one more thing: life is short.

1309
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:12,034
We're gonna select the best ten employees
go to China.

1310
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:14,370
There's some pictures.

1311
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:15,996
This is Shanghai.

1312
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:20,042
Shanghai is the most modern city in China.

1313
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,837
Look like Manhattan, right?

1314
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,714
It's like a Manhattan too.

1315
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,718
Yeah, this is a Hyatt Hotel. Hyatt Hotel.

1316
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:33,931
They have a sky pool, 55 floor.

1317
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,976
You swim in the sky.

1318
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,854
And I'm gonna share the good news for you.

1319
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,730
One of you lucky guys,

1320
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,732
you're gonna see that city.

1321
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,611
We're one Fuyao, one family.

1322
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,738
We create the miracle.

1323
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:53,075
We need to create success forever.

1324
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,412
Let's make American great again.

1325
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:05,689
The smooth operation of our US project

1326
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,632
has laid a solid foundation
for our global strategy.

1327
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,471
We've achieved double-digit growth
in operation management.

1328
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,266
Both our earnings and profits
have reached new digits.

1329
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,777
<i>The China of my youth was poor</i>

1330
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,615
<i>and undeveloped.</i>

1331
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:37,786
<i>I feel I was happier then.</i>

1332
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:42,291
<i>Now I live in a new era</i>

1333
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:47,546
<i>of prosperity and modernity,</i>

1334
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:53,344
<i>but I have a sense of loss.</i>

1335
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:06,273
<i>I miss the croaking frogs
and chirping bugs of my childhood.</i>

1336
01:39:06,398 --> 01:39:10,653
<i>The wild flowers blooming in the field.</i>

1337
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:17,701
<i>In the past few decades,
I have built so many factories.</i>

1338
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:24,750
<i>Have I taken the peace away
and destroyed the environment?</i>

1339
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:33,008
<i>I don't know if I am a contributor
or a sinner.</i>

1340
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,182
<i>But...</i>

1341
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:45,896
<i>I only think that way when I'm unhappy.</i>

1342
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:56,240
<i>The point of living is to work.</i>

1343
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:01,912
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

1344
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:11,171
Last Friday, I was terminated from Fuyao

1345
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:12,923
after two and a half years.

1346
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:14,799
Uh...

1347
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:19,805
The excuse given was I was too slow
pulling up something on the computer.

1348
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,808
Took me about two or three minutes.

1349
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,268
It wasn't quick enough.

1350
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,273
I wouldn't take away
the last two and a half years.

1351
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:32,484
I met a lot of good friends

1352
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,528
and I learned a lot from the Chinese.

1353
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,876
I don't have any food for you.

1354
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,545
I have some watermelon in my apartment.

1355
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,175
I don't think he can eat fruit.

1356
01:40:56,258 --> 01:40:57,926
He can eat grass.

1357
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:02,323
- Take care, guys.
- See you later.

1358
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:03,891
- Bye, Wong.
- Bye-bye.

1359
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:12,024
In the old days,
all Chinese people wanted in life

1360
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:14,943
was to have enough food
and to raise their kids.

1361
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:17,654
That's all they wanted.

1362
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:26,413
When it comes to my generation,
we want it all.

1363
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:33,837
We travel wherever we want
and buy whatever we like.

1364
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:43,180
<i>GM afforded me a great life...</i>

1365
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:44,890
<i>that was cut off</i>

1366
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:47,226
<i>when they closed the doors.</i>

1367
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:55,651
<i>We will never ever make
that type of money again.</i>

1368
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:57,986
<i>Those days are over.</i>

1369
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:20,551
There you go!

1370
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:25,472
All right!

1371
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,808
- Hey!
- Yay!

1372
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,394
Well, I didn't even know.

1373
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,273
<i>You never give up
on the American dream.</i>

1374
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:36,900
<i>To me, that would be un-American.</i>

1375
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,696
<i>I can have that white fence.</i>

1376
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:42,948
<i>I can have that nice home.</i>

1377
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,119
<i>Send my children to college
if that's what they want to do.</i>

1378
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:53,500
<i>Get treated with common decency.</i>

1379
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,255
<i>You have to be able to believe in it.</i>

1380
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,483
We used to have one person here.

1381
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:20,360
Now we don't have anyone.

1382
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:23,906
Next, I'm going to get rid
of four workers here.

1383
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:26,074
Two for each line.

1384
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:31,038
Automation means standardization.

1385
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:32,623
After we finish this,

1386
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:36,126
we will have two fewer workers
uploading on the encapsulation line.

1387
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,170
The mechanical arms do that instead.

1388
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,464
You have already finished that?

1389
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:41,840
Yes. These are all automatic.

1390
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:43,943
And you're replacing the rest
with mechanical arms too?

1391
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:46,595
Yes. I will replace the ones
on side-window tempering.

1392
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,556
This one is being tested now.

1393
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,309
We're hoping to cancel four workers
in July or August.

1394
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:54,978
I'll change that into machine work.

1395
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:57,522
We can't get the work done now.
They are too slow.

1396
01:43:58,305 --> 01:44:58,692
