[man] For the record,
state your name and age.

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,250
Gert de Jager.

8
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,666
Forty-three years.

9
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,666
[Gert] I want to put on the record

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,375
that I'm not doing this
for any time off or anything like that.

11
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,291
I just want to help the girls' parents.

12
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,375
You know.

13
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,958
Find out what happened to them.

14
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,000
[man] Okay. So tell us what happened.

15
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,500
[car rattling]

16
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,000
[Gert] They're gone.

17
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,833
Not just the five or six that you know of.

18
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,708
There's more than 40.

20
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,833
[Gert] My girlfriend and I…

21
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,333
we kidnapped them, but…

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,375
it wasn't for us.

23
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,583
We were acting under instructions.

24
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,916
[man] From whom?

25
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,958
From a National Party cabinet minister.

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,416
[man] Which minister?

27
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,625
I can't say.

28
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,958
He'll have me murdered.

29
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,791
[Gert] Even here.

30
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,333
[man] Okay, and the girls?

31
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,958
[girls sobbing]

32
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,333
He had a farm in Brakpan.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
[Gert] It's like a lodge.

34

[sobbing]

35
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,000

[woman] Hey!

42
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,708
My goodness…

43
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,791
[Gert] They had this airstrip.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,583
From here, the girls were smuggled
to the Middle East, maybe Iran.

45
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,666
There were sanctions back then
so they were traded for oil.

46
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,291
Kind of like a barter deal.

47
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,375
[girls sobbing]

48
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,666
-[man in Afrikaans] Take them away.
-[man] Go, go, go. Go here.

49
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,958
The thing is,
not all of them were smuggled.

50
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,458
[man] Why's that?

51
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,750
Some were used and…

52
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,166
then killed.

53
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,541

Ugh!

Freeze! Halt!

76
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,666
Pursuing a suspect on foot, rear window.

[man on radio] Check in.

82
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,666

Oh, fuck…

86
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,958
[man over the phone] Get your act
straight! Get your shit together!

87
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,166
I don't want to have
this conversation with you again.

"Tactical and financial constraints"?

93
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,250
-They had counter-surveillance.
-Should've waited.

94
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,750
If we don't get to them in 48 hours…

95
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,500
-I know.
-Life expectancy…

96
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,250
The resources are
the damned resources, Jodie.

97
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay.

98
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,083
So you tell me how do we get to here?

99
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,583
I mean, never mind how they traffic
underage girls overseas

100
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,125
when we don't have what we need

101
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,458
to catch the guys
snatching girls right off the street.

102
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,666
Jodie…

103
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,000
If you don't make busts,
I can't get funding.

104
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,500
No funding, and this whole
operation gets shut down.

105
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,458
Anything?

106
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,541
[woman] Some prints, but no.

107
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,958
[knocking]

108
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,250
I've asked Samuel
to come speak to us today.

109
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,375
He has a case we may be interested in.

110
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,500
Arendse, Murder &amp; Robbery.

111

White male, 60s,
looks like some kind of ritual killing.

112
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,291
Oupa here is a suspected pedophile.

113
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,500
He used to be on a trafficking watch list.

114
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,791
[Jodie] When?

115
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,708
[man] Twenty, thirty years ago.

116
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,125
Captain, with all due respect…

117
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,750
Jodie, I want you to take this case.

118
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,416
-Sorry?
-Look, just do it.

119
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,708
Thamsanqa, you take over here.

120
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,500
Captain?

121
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,291
I'm sorry, but am I off the operation?

122
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,458
-The Brigadier called me.
-That asshole.

123
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,375
We're not meeting the minimum requirements

124
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,041
-for the victims'--
-Give me what I need.

125
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,208
Listen to me! You're fucking up.

126
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,875
-This is the third bust.
-Give me one more surveillance team.

127
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,083
Take the case and take a break!

128
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,458
That's an order.

[sobbing]

131
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,500
[man] Cause of death
is a gunshot wound to the chest,

132
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,125
resulting in a cardiac arrest
caused by hemorrhage.

133
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,375
Superficial burn on the neck.
Could be a Taser.

134
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,291
And then this.

135
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,583
Had me stumped as well.

136
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,750
Where was the body found?

137
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,750
James and Ethel Gray Park.

138
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,916
But he wasn't killed there, he was moved.

139
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,375
Thanks.

140
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,583
[woman] Another drink?

141
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,583
Sure, why not?

[chuckling]

148
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,833
I love this song.

149
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,041
What?

150
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,208
-Mh-hm.
-No.

151
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,291
Don't worry, there are
some white people there.

152
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,458
[laughing] What?

153
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,625
Oh.

[song fading out]

156
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,166
[Samuel] Can you think of anyone
who wanted to hurt your father?

157
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,041
He had his flaws, but…

158
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,541
But he was a good man.

159
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,208
Mrs. Lourens, did you know his name

160
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,083
was on the old National Register
for Sex Offenders?

161
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
He was found not guilty.

162
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,416
Who made the allegations?

163
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,000
Mrs. Lourens,
it's easier here than in court.

164
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,250
[Mrs. Lourens] At that time,
he was high up in the National Party.

165
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,958
They had many enemies, as you know.

166
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,041
[Jodie] Excuse me.

167
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,375
Hey.

168
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,541
[in Afrikaans] Are you a police lady?

169
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,500
Mm-hm.

170
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,041
[in Afrikaans] I'm Jodie.

171
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,500
[in Afrikaans] What's your name?

172
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,458
Liezel.

173
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,166
[in Afrikaans] That's a pretty name.

174
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,791
-[in Afrikaans] It's not necessary…
-[in English] Just give me one second.

175
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,000
[in Afrikaans]
I'm sorry about your grandfather.

[Jodie in English] Open the garage.

177

-[in Afrikaans] Open the garage!

178
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,708
[Samuel in Afrikaans] We have a warrant.

181
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,083
Arendse, get me that ladder.

182
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,500
Holy shit.

183
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:01,750
[thunder roaring in the distance]

[sighs]

186
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,500
What do you think?

187
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,541
I think whoever murdered Carel
knew he was into this.

188
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,708
"T.S.C." It's…

189
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,875
Some kind of message.

190
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,291
Are you okay?

191
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:54,416
I'm fine.

192
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,083
It's just…

193
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,000
This is kind of monstrous
in its own right, you know?

194
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,458
Why don't you check out other crimes
in the same area? Same date.

195
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:10,791
Thanks.

196

Quickly. Move, move! Come on!

199
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,583
[man in Afrikaans]
Come on, come on. Hurry up!

200
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,541
[in Afrikaans] Come on, come on.

201
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,375
[woman in Afrikaans] My goodness, get in!

202
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,958
[man in Afrikaans] Thanks, Gert.

203
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,500
[in Afrikaans] Get in.

204
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,000
[man in Afrikaans]
That one has been used up.

-Jodie, what are you doing here?
-I have something you need to see.

215
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,458
Personal residences
are strictly off-limits.

216
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,041
Just listen to me for a second.

217
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,916
Get in your car
and go home, get some sleep.

218
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,833
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

219
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,083
Come on.

220
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:37,875
[Jodie] T.S.C.

221
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,541
I believe it stands
for Tarrynlee Shaw Carter.

222
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:50,208
[in Setswana] Hey, guys, go to bed,
you know the rules.

223
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,333
Agnes…

224
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,625
His body was found
in James and Ethel Gray Park.

225
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:05,458
Same place and date that Tarrynlee
was abducted by Gert de Jager.

226
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:06,750
Gert de Jager…

227
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,083
-De Jager abducted six girls.
-Yeah, I know the history.

228
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,041
This man is a pedophile.

229
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,916
Even his own granddaughter.

230
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,125
Which he recorded.

231
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,958
Wait until your kids are in bed.

232
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,583
Jodie, how much sleep have you had?

233
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,791
George, I want to bring in the operation,
this could be a new line of inquiry.

234
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,500
We barely have the resources
for our current investigations.

235
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,958
Gert de Jager…

236
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,916
Gert de Jager took six girls
who were never found.

237
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,208
Tarrynlee, Frances Hughes,
Jenna Hartley, Olivia Booysen,

238
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,666
-Abigail Viljoen and Yvette Rossouw.
-Twenty years ago.

239
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,791
If the killer is using them
as a scorecard,

240
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,000
there's going to be five more bodies.

241
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,541
-Murder &amp; Robbery's problem.
-I know. But get this:

242
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:53,625
Shortly after he was arrested,
Gert de Jager confessed on tape.

243
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,666
He fingered a National Party minister,

244
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,666
and the next day he was found
murdered in his cell.

245
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:00,958
Do you have the tape?

246
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,083
No, it was classified under apartheid,
but I'm going to find it.

247
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,958
Jodie, you're making connections
you simply can't prove.

248
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,375
I need the operation, damn it, George, I--

249
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,083
[sighs]

250
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:19,541
Jodie, I'm going to suggest
that you go to Health &amp; Wellness

251
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,208
for psychological evaluation.

252
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,875
-It is my assessment…
-Here we go.

253
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,166
-…you're suffering post-traumatic stress.
-Bullshit.

254
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,041
This job gets to all of us.

255
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,583
[softly] It's supposed to get to us,
otherwise what the fuck are we doing?

256
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm going to insist
that you take three months off.

00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,458
Give me your hands, Jodie,
and close your eyes.

269
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,666
Take a deep breath in…

to know where you live, right?

278
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,083
Why, are you coming after me?

279

280
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:01,916

you don't distance yourself.

I never know what you're thinking.

290

Captain told me.

291
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,541
Three months.

I'm sorry.

293
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:41,958

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,916
This is where the killer wants us to be.

312
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,916
What about her?

313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,666
She works here, but she's not talking.

314
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,500

Waybills.

00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,958
All from the same shipping

-I'll do recon only.

So what's your deal, Arendse?

My deal?

337
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:54,208
Yeah, your deal.

Are you profiling me?

00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:03,416
I heard you worked undercover,
street gangs in Cape Town…

340
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:07,791
Apparently they're
into trafficking these days.

You realize, even if we did get a warrant,
whatever we found would be inadmissible?

I have some
uncomfortable questions to ask.

Only some members of your unit
knew what was going on at this yard.

What are you trying to say?

It's more than likely
that someone in your operation

was involved in some way or the other.

[Samuel] Jodie, I like you.

But you have to admit,
the most likely scenario is

01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,833
that somebody is working from the inside.
