00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,922
I'm tired, Mommy.

3
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,624
- Okay, okay, sweetie.
- We're all tired, honey.

4
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,959
Okay.

5
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,761
Here we go.
Hold tight.

6
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,131
Come on, sit.
Now hold on tight.

7
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,800
WOMAN: Like that.
MAN: This is border patrol.

8
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,366
This is border patrol.

9
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,635
You are approaching the border
of the Republic of Gilead.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,205
You're not allowed
any closer. Turn back.

11
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,775
This is border patrol.
This is border patrol.

12
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,143
You are approaching the border

13

of the Republic of Gilead.

14

You are not allowed
any closer. Turn back.

15
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,017
This is border patrol.
This is border patrol.

16
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,853
You are approaching
the border of the republic...

17
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,654
I'll keep them busy.

18
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,385
No! No!

19
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,963
Aah! Aah!

20
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,172
No!

21
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,571
Mommy!

22
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,942
Jill! Stay there!

23
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,505
Oh! Jill! No!

24
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,148
My baby! Jill! Aah!

25
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,921
No!
Let's go.

I know! Please!

Mommy.

49
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,127

(Bell Clangs)

53
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,671
Hello, girls. Relax.

54
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,836
Relax.
I'm Aunt Lydia.

55
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,771
Are you all well?

56
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,142
Come on, I want you to say

57
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:16,208
"we're very well,
Aunt Lydia."

58
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,179
So, are you well?

59
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,645
WOMEN: Very well, Aunt Lydia.

60
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,215
That's great,
because you are well.

61
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,417
You're healthy,
you're free from infections,

62
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,587
and you're the only ones
whose tests are positive.

63
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,522
You're the lucky ones.

64
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,391
WOMEN: We're the lucky ones.

65
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,962
Amen. You're going
to be handmaids.

66
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,098
You're going to serve God

67
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,469
and your country.
(Snaps Fingers)

68
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,003
All right, girls.
Into the bus. Let's go.

69
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,540
How long were you in?

70
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,914
I'm not sure.

71
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,650
What'd you do,
and how'd they get you?

72
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,721
We tried to cross the border.

73
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,221
What about you?

74
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,891
Gender treachery.
I like girls.

75
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,630
Christ, they could have
sent you to the colonies.

76
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,595
They don't send you
to the colonies

77
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,026
if your ovaries
are still jumping.

78

WOMAN: Come on, sister.
MAN: Move it! Move it!

79
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:06,151
WOMAN: Move it.
Get on that bus. Move it!

80
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,419
Go on, sisters.

81
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,390
You can't make me break my vows!

82
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:12,191
Get on that bus.
Quiet.

83
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,660

Remove your arm.

132
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,556
Today, only one out of 100 women

133
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,694
can still bear children,
and some women stopped.

134
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,597
Believing there
would be no future,

135
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,898
they refused.

136
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,067
Refused to bear children!

137
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,169
They wouldn't even try!

138
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,374
They were lazy women!
They were sluts.

139
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,135
There is more than
one kind of freedom.

140
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,615
In the days of anarchy,
it was "freedom to."

141
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,751
Now, you're being given
"freedom from."

142
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,252
Don't underrate it.

145
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,291
Aunt LYDIA:
I hate to punish her,

146
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,392
but she abused herself,

147
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,333
and your body
is a temple of purity.

148
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:45,030
So let that be a lesson to you.

149
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:49,801
We know men can't help it,
but we're different.

150
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,502
We have self control...

151
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,966
Dignity.

152
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,279
(Men Yelling)

153
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,927
Remember, you're not her equal.

154
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,896
You're a handmaid.

155
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,757
That is your role in life.

156
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,772
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

157
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,972
She could do you a lot of harm.

158
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,208
Well, if you are chosen,

159
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,079
it will be a great honor.

160
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,323
(Whistles)

161
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,483
Aunt LYDIA:
I must stress

162
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:15,287
that another incident
of the previous nature

163
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,589
will not be tolerated,

164
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,125
but I think you'll find

165
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,326
this young woman satisfactory.

166
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,703
You may come in now.

167
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,881
Come in.

168
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,384
Sit down.

169
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,356
Is this your first placement?

170
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,158
Yes, it is.

171
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,089
Well, here's how it works.

172
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,895
I see as little
of you as possible.

173
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,903
Understand? But
if I get trouble,

174
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,838
I give trouble back.

175
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,440
Is that clear?

176
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,208
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,739
I've read your file.

178
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,648
I know you're not stupid.

179
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,520
Do you want this job?

180
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,721
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,589
Don't call me "ma'am."

182
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,120
You're not a Martha.

183
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,796
You will sleep here,
in your own room,

184
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,170
but if the commander goes to the front
or to the capital,

185
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,136
you'll go back to sleep
at the red center.

186
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,972
Now, I want to ask you
one question.

187
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,673
Answer from your heart.

188
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,844
Do you want a baby?

189
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:46,978
Do you really want one?

190
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,249
It won't work
if you don't want one.

191
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,251
Do you really want
to have a baby?

192
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,886
Yes, I do.

193
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,887
We could help each other...

194
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,686
We could.

195
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,195
(Claps)
Sit down.

196
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,796
Everybody sit.
Girls.

197
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,602
Right. Anyone.

198
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,243
GIRL: There was date rape,
even on campus.

199
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,439
(Women Chatter)

200
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,743
It was horrible.

201
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,946
WOMAN: Name her.

202
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,647
Yes, your name?

203
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,982
Come on.

204
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,123
Aunt LYDIA:
Step forward now.

205
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,556
W-what am I
supposed to say?

206
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,027
Just tell us
how it was back then.

207
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,863
I-it was horrible.

208
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,599
Speak up.

209
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,300
I... I was raped
when I was 14 by 6 guys

210
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,639
in my high school class.
It, um...

211
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,809
It was at a party.
We'd all been drinking.

212
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,380
I thought that
they were my friends.

213
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,054
Then I, um...

214
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,953
I had a-an abortion...

215
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,722
But it wasn't my fault.

216
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,793
My mother, she made me do it.

217
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:07,225
She wouldn't
let me have the baby.

218
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,994
Whose fault was it?

219
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,355
WOMEN: Her fault.

220
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,069
WOMAN: Who lead them on?

221
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,267
WOMEN: She did.

222
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,940
She did.

223
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,507
Why did God allow

224
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,242
such a terrible thing to happen?

225
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,413
- Teach us a lesson.
- Let's hear it.

226
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,747
WOMEN:
Teach us a lesson.

227
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,482
Teach us a lesson.

228
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,150
What is she?

229
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,785
WOMEN: She's a whore.
She's a whore.

230
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,786
WOMEN: Whore! Whore! Whore!

231
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,392
I'm going crazy.

232
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,494
This is a fucking looney bin.

233
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,029
That's enough.

234
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,200
WOMEN: Whore! Whore!

235
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,865
(Crying)
I didn't...

236
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,167
I didn't mean to do it.

237
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,403
I lead them on.
I assume the pain,

238
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,470
and I'm sorry.

239
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,871
Very good, Janine.

240
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,723
Bathroom?

241
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,119
Is that you?

242
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,361
Yes.

243
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,930
God, do I need a cigarette.

244
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,501
Listen...

245
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,903
I have a placement.
I go tomorrow.

246
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,714
Oh, fuck!
I'll miss you.

247
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,608
I'll miss you, too.

248
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,744
The damn wives don't want me.

249
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,946
I don't know why.
Maybe I scare them.

250
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,014
Maybe they think I want
to touch their tits.

251
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,150
Maybe it's the damn
fucking husbands.

252
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,985
Maybe they know
I think they suck.

253
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,589
Jesus, Moira. Be careful,
for christ's sake.

254
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,290
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

255
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,027
I gotta get outta here, Kate.
I gotta do something.

256
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,762
I'm gonna fake like I'm sick.

257
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,430
Really bright.
Then what?

258
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,701
Then there'll be 2
guys in the ambulance.

259
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:29,400
They must be starved for it.
I'll suck their fucking cocks

260
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,635
till they're blue in the face.

261
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,737
They'll do whatever I say.

262
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,939
You're not serious.

263
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,810
Yes, I am. I'm going to.
I swear to God.

264
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,246
You'll never get away with it.

265
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,417
Don't think like that.
It's bad for business.

266
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,057
All right, girls.
Move along.

267
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,677
Hello, my name is Janine,

268
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,848
and I'll be your
wait person this morning.

269
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,414
- Let me get you...
- Janine.

270
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,982
Get your clothes on, Janine.

271
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,184
Come on.

272
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,745
Shh.

273
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,221
Put your clothes on.

274
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,492
You're gonna get extra prayers

275
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,958
for the rest of us.
Hello...

276
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,699
Kate! Kate! Come on!

277
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,233
Janine.
Get you some coffee.

278
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,869
- Hello, my name...
- Ok, come on.

279
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,039
Hello, my name is Janine.
Good morning to you, too.

280
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,610
Hello, my name is Janine, and
I'll be your wait person...

281
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:44,709
Snap out of it, Janine,

282
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,477
snap out of it!
(Slap)

283
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,179
Look at me.
Look at me.

284
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,349
What'd you hit me for?

285
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,118
Wasn't it any good?
I can get you another one.

286
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,484
Look at me.
I am Moira.

287
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,752
This is the red center.

288
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,753
Look at me.

289
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,498
Sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,934
She does that again, and I'm not
here, slap her. Talk to her.

291
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,669
Don't let her
get away with that shit.

292
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,370
That stuff is catching.

300
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,676
for the greater glory of God.

301
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,678
On this day of consecration,

302
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,079
you would do well to remember

303
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,483
by what deadly steps
you were brought here...

304
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,351
the folly of mankind

305
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,922
and of womankind as well.

306
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,990
Sexual promiscuity,
widespread abortion,

307
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,291
birth control, test tube babies,

308
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,828
genetic engineering...

309
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,859
(Women Gasp)

310
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,237
Aunt LYDIA:
Quick, get an ambulance.

311
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,944
PREACHER:
Genetic engineering,

312
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,207
artificial insemination...

313
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,478
God, in his profound compassion

314
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,847
has seen fit to punish us.

315
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,650
To send a plague
of barrenness...

316
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,421
A desert of infertility.

317
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,723
You have been given
this precious gift.

318
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,658
WOMEN: Precious gift.

319
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,259
You are fertile.
You can give birth.

320
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,534
WOMEN: Precious gift.

321
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,266
You can give birth.

322
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,569
You can give birth

WOMEN: Oh, precious gift.

324
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,773
May the lord open.

325
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,142
WOMEN: May the lord open.

326
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,678
Let the handmaids ascend.

327
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,714
You will look
neither to the right,

328
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,448
nor to the left.

329
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,950
You will remain
steadfast and true.

330

We pledge allegiance
to the bible.

00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:11,189
The old testament
shall be our soul

332
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,860
and only constitution.

333
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:20,955
I pronounce you handmaids
in the sight of God. Amen.

334
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,322
(Beeps)

335
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,063
Blessed be the fruit.

336
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,473
Thanks.

337
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,637
She's up there.

338
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,968
WOMAN: Is that her?
Send her up.

339
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,955
Cora or Rita
will bring your meals.

340
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,016
There's everything you need.

341
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,886
Any questions?

342
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,264
Are you clear
about the ceremony?

343
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,625
About the form...

344
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,235
Of the ceremony?

345
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,204
Yes, I'm clear.

346
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,905
As for the commander...

347
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,835
He's my husband.

348
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,280
Fred is my husband
till death do us part.

349
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,850
It's one of the things
we fought for.

350
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,219
Your name is offred.
Say it.

351
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
Offred.

352
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,351
Yes. Of-fred.

353
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,723
You may call me Serena...

354
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,761
Serena Joy.

355
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,453
(Men Laugh)
Good.

356
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,894
Thank you.
(Laughs)

357
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,002
(Scrapes)

358
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,043
JILL: Mommy.

359
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,941
Mommy.

360
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,982
Mommy.

361
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,457
(Sniffs, Sighs)

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,970
Resettlement
of the children of han

363
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,970
is continuing on schedule.

364
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,941
20,000 have arrived this week

365
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,173
in the national homeland

366
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,642
with another 10,000 in transit.

367
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,781
Team of eyes, working with

368
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,445
an inside informant, has cracked

369
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,113
an underground espionage ring.

370
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,852
This ring is suspected
of smuggling healthy women

371
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,020
across the border,
out of the country.

372
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,788
These women
have been chosen by God

373
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,156
to fulfill his task.

374
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,391
They are our most
precious resource.

375
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,230
No defection will be tolerated.

376
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,162
We are weeding out the traitors.

377
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,133
We are weeding out the godless.

378
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,533
We are winning God's fight.

379
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,734
All right, sir.

380
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,931
COMMANDER: The book
of<i> genesis,</i> chapter 30.

381
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,834
"And Rachel had no children,

382
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,969
and Rachel said..."

383
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,740
"Give me children,
or else I shall die.

384
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,344
"Behold my maid Bilhah.

385
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,481
"Go in unto her,

386
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,617
"and she shall bear
upon my knees

387
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,654
that I may also have
children by her."

388
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,691
"So, she gave Jacob
her maid Bilhah as a wife,

389
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,932
"and Jacob went into her,
and Bilhah conceived

390
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,630
and bared Jacob a son."

391
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,168
Uh, could I have
a glass of water, please?

392
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,248
We will now have
a moment of silent prayer.

393
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,379
We will ask for a blessing
for our endeavor.

394
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,528
COMMANDER: Amen.

395
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,159
Amen.

396
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,291
(Kate Grunts)

397
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:25,232
Shh. Shh.
Stop it. Stop.

398
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,029
(Gasps)

399
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,299
SERENA: Shh.

400
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,904
(Moans, Grunts)

401
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,111
(Cries)

402
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,073
(Grunts)
Ah...

403
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,926
(Sobs)

404
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,974
Get up and get out.

405
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,856
(Sobbing)

406
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,022
(Whispers)
Get outta there.

407
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:20,301
I wouldn't debase myself
like that.

408
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,907
Nobody's asking you to.

409
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:26,377
Anyways, they're doing it
for all of us.

410
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:30,681
Could have been me,
say I was 10 years younger.

411
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,916
It's not that bad.

412
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:35,417
It's not what you'd call
hard work.

413
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,762
You're to meet your companion
at the corner.

414
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,328
She's called ofglen.

415
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,729
Wait for her.

416
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,270
She takes you
to the grocery store.

417
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,701
Tell them fresh eggs, milk,

418
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,706
and a chicken, not a hen.

419
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,609
Tell them who it's for,
and they won't mess around.

420
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,210
We get the best here.

421
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,697
Are you ofglen?

422
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:23,233
Yes. I'm meeting offred.
Who are you?

423
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,774
I'm offred.

424
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,101
Oh, I see.

425
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,906
Blessed be the fruit.

426
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,410
May the lord open.

427
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,215
The war is going well, I hear.

428
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,146
Praise be.

429
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,322
I see they have oranges today.

430
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,092
They didn't give me
any tokens for that.

431
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,495
The war interferes with fruit
and vegetables from California.

432
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,832
Even Florida isn't
dependable anymore.

433
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:59,103
The rebels have blown up
some of the highways.

434
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,578
Tokens, please.

435
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,482
(Computer Beeping)

436
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,294
Thank you.

437
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,170
She must be a very happy girl.

438
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,705
Praise be.

439
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,686
Shh.

440
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,528
It's all right.

441
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,667
What are you doing in here?

442
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,319
I've been looking for you.

443
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,825
Why?

444
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,286
He wants to see you
in his office.

445
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,901
What do you mean?

446
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,705
Tomorrow night...

447
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,306
10 PM. In his office.

448
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,728
Hello, hello, hello.

449
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,135
Nice day, isn't it?

450
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,309
What happened
to the last offred?

451
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,246
How do I know? I thought
you would be her.

452
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,748
How do I know?

453
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,650
But what do you think?

454
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,781
I don't know.

455
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,262
So what are these?

456
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,472
Impatiens,
if they grow this year.

457
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,739
How's she working out?

458
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,874
Who?

459
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,475
The new one.

460
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,312
Oh, her.
Better than the last one.

461
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,351
Well, you don't have to
throw it up to me.

462
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:32,082
I thought we weren't
going to mention it.

463
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,485
If you don't like her, we can
send her back. You know that.

464
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,422
(Chuckles)
Who cares if I like her?

465
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,963
You know, I think...

466
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,486
She was a good choice.

467
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,931
Well, I want you
to be happy, Serena.

468
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,502
Yes.

469
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:53,704
Life is so much easier
for you when I am.

470
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,505
(Chuckles)
That's right.

471
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,488
(Clock Chimes 10:00)

472
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,940
(Knock On door)

473
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,241
FRED: Come in.

474
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,012
(Buzzer)

475
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,648
Hello. Come in.

476
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,082
You don't need the veil.

477
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,183
This isn't an official visit.

478
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,554
Lift it up.

479
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,876
Why don't you take it off?

480
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,577
May I?

481
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,246
Beautiful.

482
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,353
What it is...
I thought it might be nice

483
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,289
if we met under less
artificial conditions.

484
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,590
I thought I'd like
to get to know you a little.

485
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,095
Get to know me?

486
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,798
(Chuckles) Yes.

487
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,202
How will you do that?

488
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,205
Well, we don't have to push it.

489
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,044
We could break the ice by playing
some sort of game, for instance.

490
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,715
- A game?
- Yeah.

491
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,416
What game?

492
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,317
<i>Scrabble.</i>

493
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,287
<i>Scrabble?</i>

494
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,421
Have you ever played?

495
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,294
- I mean, have you ever played before?
<i>- Scrabble?</i>

496
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:58,162
Yes, when I was young.
When my family...

497
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,964
Well, what do you say?
How about it?

498
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,895
All right.

499
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,199
Good.

500
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,644
Here we go.

501
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,475
(Fingering Pieces in bag)

502
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,111
NEWSCASTER: Good news
from the Appalachian highlands

503
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,350
where the angels of the
apocalypse, fourth division,

504
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,418
are smoking out a pocket
of baptist guerillas

505
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,418
with air support
from the 21st battalion

506
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,685
of the angels of light.

507
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,154
Casualties are reported high

508
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,655
as hand-to-hand fighting
continues.

509
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:05,563
I can use my last 3 letters
in one go.

510
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,003
I won.

511
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,274
You certainly have won.

512
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,472
Congratulations.

513
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,308
I think you play this game
a lot better than I do.

514
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,309
Oh, no.

515
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,111
No, I know you do.

516
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,852
Thanks.

517
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,424
- But I knew you would.
- Why?

518
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:30,388
Because you're a librarian.

519
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,315
Was.

520
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,792
I'll be away for a week

521
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,993
at the capitol.

522
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,263
So don't forget me.

523
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,170
All clear.

524
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,445
You play a mean game.

525
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,319
Offred.

526
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,827
It's so damn close in there.
Come on out.

527
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,898
You need a little fresh air.

528
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,598
Here.

529
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,942
Why do you think
we go through...

530
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,679
What we do?

531
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,350
You mean the ceremony?

532
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,315
Because a baby
would make my life whole.

533
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,889
You've had a child.

534
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,029
Yes.

535
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,487
A little girl.

536
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,600
Yes.

537
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,365
Do you know
what happened to her?

538
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,070
Do you know if she's...

539
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,266
I could try to find out.

540
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:04,214
I still have access
to some information.

541
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,076
See, we have a lot in common.

542
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:11,786
We could have motherhood
in common.

543
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,214
Good luck.

544
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,392
(Computer Beeps)

545
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,193
Second door on the left.

546
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,035
How are we today?

547
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,766
Fine.

548
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:40,441
3 months, and nothing
in the wind, huh?

549
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,023
You're in good shape, though.

550
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,150
Ripe.

551
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,557
I know your commander.

552
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,328
He's tried twice before.

553
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:58,762
He's probably sterile.

554
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,603
Don't they test
the... the men?

555
00:45:00,604 --> 00:45:03,667
No. They don't test them.

556
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:07,868
You get the blame, honey,
if it doesn't work.

557
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,975
- Let me help you.
- How?

558
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:15,606
The door's locked.
Nobody'll come in.

559
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,383
They'll never know
it wasn't him.

560
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:21,284
I've helped others...
lots of women do it.

561
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,285
No, thanks.

562
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:27,324
I'd hate to see
what they'd do to you.

563
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,793
You know what could happen
if it doesn't work.

564
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:32,762
It's the wives
you have to look out for.

565
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,299
They don't like you girls
hanging around the house.

566
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,670
Just imagine
what they must feel.

567
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,738
See, they're defeated women.

568
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,406
Especially Serena Joy.

569
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,608
She was quite a celebrity.

570
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,843
What do you say?

571
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,746
You stop right there
or I'll scream.

572
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,947
It's your life.

573
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,088
See you next month.

574
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,291
WOMAN: How many ceremonies
have there been?

575
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,762
3.

576
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:08,063
Dates? Last month?

577
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,569
The 16th.

578
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,771
What about the 19th?
What about the 20th?

579
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,006
That's your best time.

580
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,007
I know.

581
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,538
I guess he was busy.

582
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,981
You have one more month,

583
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,522
then you'll be up
for reassessment.

584
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,891
WOMAN: Men didn't
love you then.

585
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,161
They didn't value
what we could do.

586
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,163
They... they wouldn't
look at you twice

587
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,704
unless you were some
kind of beauty queen.

588
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:43,900
You had to have big tits
and a little nose,

589
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,770
and even if they did marry you,

590
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:47,771
they would knock you up

591
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,842
and run off with somebody else.

592
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,470
Now...

593
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,779
now you get...

594
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,212
A little respect.

595
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,483
My baby's gonna grow up healthy.

596
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:04,423
Not my baby. Our baby!

597
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,093
Our baby.

598
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:10,594
(Clap Clap)

599
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,862
Second WOMAN:
Put your lockers away.

600
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,531
Pre-natal next.

601
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:14,764
(Whispering)
What are you doing here?

602
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,566
Me? What about you?
What happened?

603
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,837
Nothing. Guys must have
been gay or something.

604
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,056
Aunt Lydia...

605
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:48,101
There's a toilet
overflowing in the john.

606
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:14,057
Don't you dare
fucking move around,

607
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,459
or I'll stick this thing
so far up your fucking ass

608
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,594
you won't know what hit you.

609
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,930
You'll go all the way
to the moon.

610
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,201
Yes, you little
goody two-shoes.

611
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,995
Okay.

612
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,075
That's it. Now we take
the pretty pearls

613
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,543
from the pretty lady,

614
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,982
and whose fault is it?

615
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:37,479
It's her fault,
her fault, her fault.

616
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,883
That's it.

617
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,751
Easy. Easy.

618
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,386
That's a good girl.

619
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,188
All right now.

620
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:48,224
You can fuck all your
little girls on the latrine.

621
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,761
Come on. Over here, now.

622
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,398
Over here. Huh?
Absolutely,

623
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,799
you piece of turd.

624
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,081
OFFRED: Hurry up.

625
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:15,222
Maybe with luck they'll
find you before Christmas.

626
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:17,954
Remember I didn't kill you.

627
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,957
I like your panties, sweetie.

628
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,718
Come on!

629
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,708
(Muffled Screaming)

630
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,212
Go.

631
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:24,991
(Laughing)

632
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:28,691
You've done it again.
You're the winner again.

633
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,062
Do I get a prize?

634
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,433
Sure do.

635
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,126
A surprise prize.

636
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:49,012
Now... what do you like?

637
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:51,313
There's<i> vogue...</i>

638
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,516
<i>Cosmopolitan.</i>

639
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,851
I thought all this stuff

640
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,853
was supposed
to have been burned?

641
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,255
It was. It was bad
for people's minds.

642
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,356
It confused them.

643
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,092
It was ok for me
because I'm mature.

644
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,662
Come here. I got a whole
stack of them for you.

645
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,231
See? Just for you.

646
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,299
Does she know about these?

647
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,740
FRED: No.
She wouldn't understand.

648
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,132
Could you do something for me?

649
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,296
Could you get me
some hand lotion?

650
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,573
Hand lotion?

651
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,582
You know, how they used to have?

652
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,479
My skin gets...
gets very dry.

653
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,682
Well, what do you use normally?

654
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,985
I use butter. I steal pats of
butter from the food trays.

655
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,246
(Laughs) Butter.
That's very clever.

656
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,958
Can you do it?

657
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,693
Yeah, I can do it.
Why not?

658
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,664
Now wait, wait.
Now wait, wait, wait.

659
00:52:12,665 --> 00:52:14,601
Just think about it a minute.

660
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:16,468
Uh, she might smell it on you.

661
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:19,335
She's never that close to me.

662
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,936
Uh, sometimes she is.

663
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,572
Well, I won't use it
on those nights.

664
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,597
(Buzzer)

665
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:34,076
Don't do that again.

666
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,237
Do what again?

667
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:40,449
Try to touch me like that.

668
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,185
Did I?
Well, I'm sorry.

669
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:45,121
It's just that, uh,
I find it, uh...

670
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,752
what?

671
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,191
Impersonal.

672
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:52,292
How long did it take you
to figure that out?

673
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,776
Here's your hand lotion.

674
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,322
She can do whatever she likes.

675
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:22,963
She can have me
sent to the colonies.

676
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,758
Don't you know that?

677
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,965
Don't do it again, please!

678
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,766
Okay, ok.

679
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,310
What happened to the last one...

680
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,511
My predecessor?

681
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:48,284
- She couldn't cut it.
- Cut it?

682
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,287
She couldn't conceive,
could she?

683
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,556
Don't push your luck.

684
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:56,025
So what happened to her?

685
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,060
She hung herself.

686
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,431
(Telephone Rings)

687
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:01,464
(Ring)

688
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,800
With what?
Where'd she get the rope?

689
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,671
It doesn't matter
where she got the rope.

690
00:55:06,672 --> 00:55:08,139
She didn't do it with rope,

691
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,108
so what difference does it make?

692
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:13,409
Maybe I shouldn't
come here anymore.

693
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,010
Maybe you better stay there
until I tell you to go.

694
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,416
Yeah?

695
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,315
So what?

696
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,025
Well, what are you calling for

697
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,527
this time of night
with that kind of crap?

698
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,663
I told you once to do it.

699
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,864
Now just do it.

700
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,177
(Beeping)

701
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,392
Offred...

702
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,391
Come over here.

703
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,925
Sit down.

704
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,743
Did you find out anything?

705
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,784
No, not yet.

706
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,775
Any sign?

707
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,985
No. Nothing.

708
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:32,254
Too bad.
Your time's running out.

709
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,255
Yes.

710
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:35,291
Maybe he can't.

711
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:39,092
Maybe you should...
Try it another way.

712
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,863
What other way?

713
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,895
Another man.

714
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,570
- They hang you for that.
- It's done.

715
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,207
Women do it frequently.
All the time, in fact.

716
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,508
With doctors, you mean.

717
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,876
No, no, no, no.

718
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,111
Doctors blackmail.

719
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:58,182
It has to be someone we trust.

720
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,776
Who?

721
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,994
I was thinking of Nick.

722
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,162
- Did you ask him?
- No...

723
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:11,160
But he's been with us
a long time.

724
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:14,001
I think I could fix it with him.

725
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:15,998
And he's...

726
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,499
Quite good-looking.

727
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,203
What about the commander?

728
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,044
Well...

729
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,540
We just won't tell him, will we?

730
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:35,416
He lives above the garage.

731
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,653
He's expecting you.

732
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,194
No one will see you.

733
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,546
Come in.

734
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,360
Have you come to do your duty

735
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,861
for the fatherland?

736
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,926
Yup.

737
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,679
Boss' wife was real ladylike.

738
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,914
She said, I want you
to fuck her, Nick.

739
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,250
I want you
to give her the works.

740
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,751
I said, yes, ma'am.

741
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,523
Anything you say, ma'am.

742
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,502
I could always
squirt it into a bottle,

743
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:02,673
and you could just pour it in.

MAID:
Blessed be the fruit.

760
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,455
Morning.

761
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:42,056
Blessed be the fruit.

762
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,593
Eat it.

763
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,295
It's full of vitamins,

764
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,426
good for you.

01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,272
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

Hmmph.

767
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,808
Maybe not.

Where is she?

01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,960
She's in good hands

774
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,761
with people who are fit.

775
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,934
When can I see her?

776
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,702
That's impossible.

777
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,703
Impossible?
What do you mean?

778
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,175
She's my baby.
I'm her mother.

779
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,836
She wouldn't know you.

780
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,052
Wait.

781
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,081
What's happened to her?

782
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:18,021
She hasn't been harmed
in any way.

783
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,654
She's dearly loved.

784
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,363
How long have you known?

785
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,801
Why didn't you tell me?

786
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,036
I wasn't sure.

787
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,304
How could you keep it from me?

788
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:40,565
I wasn't sure whether it would
be good for you to know.

789
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,448
How is she?

790
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:50,117
She's fine.

791
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,421
You mustn't worry.

My daughter is alive.

794
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,907
How do you know she's alive?

795
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,454
She showed me a picture.

796
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,361
I don't know what to do.

797
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:09,498
I can't stand it.
I have to see her.

798
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:10,699
Kate.

799
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,869
Kate, you must realize

800
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:13,736
that they'll never
let you see her.

801
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:14,837
No.

802
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,305
Kate, they will never...

803
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,406
no!

804
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,037
Kate.

01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,745
She's alive.

01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,585
My baby is alive.

808
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:30,819
Shh.

809
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,020
It's all right.

810
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,532
Offred,
the birth mobile. Hurry!

811
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,265
Oh, and may it go well.

812
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,873
- Who is it?
- It's ofwarren.

813
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:51,610
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it wonderful?

814

815
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,629
INSTRUCTOR: And breathe.

816
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,630
Just relax.

817
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,232
Breathe.

818
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,333
- Ooh.
- Deeply.

819
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,801
- Deep.
- (Panting)

820
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,404
Breathe through the nose,
out through the mouth.

821
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,165
Breathe.

822
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,967
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Pant.

823

(Pants)

824
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:30,412
Well, tell her to
hurry up, for crissakes.

825
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,713
We haven't got all night.

826
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,115
Maybe it's stuck.

827
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,083
Listen, I know these girls
from way back.

828
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,554
I tell you,
they're tramps, all of 'em.

829
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:39,588
They've spiked it.

830
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:42,089
It's a special day.

831
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,426
Are you all right?

832
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,761
What?

833
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,295
Oh, yes.

834
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,426
Are you sure?

835
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,396
I have a daughter living
with people like these.

836
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,706
Suck it.

837
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,249
WOMAN: Good.
That's it. Just relax.

838
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,217
That's it.

839
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,090
Just relax.

840
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,363
(Talking)

841
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:30,005
It could be any time.
It could be any time now.

842
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:31,006
Hurry. Hurry.

843
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:32,774
It's coming!
(Panting)

844
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,777
Take a deep breath in
and let it go.

845
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,712
(Exhales)

846
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,413
Deep breath in and push.

847
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,916
Come on. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

848
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,218
Hold it. Hold it.
Quick breath in.

849
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,119
(Gasps)

850
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,389
And again. Quick breath,

851
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:46,888
and hold it. Push down.

852
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,023
You can do it.
That's it.

853
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:49,264
And quick breath in again.

854
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:51,793
- And push down one more time.
- Uhh!

855
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,534
Good. Good.

856
01:08:52,535 --> 01:08:55,330
Push a little more, little
more, little more...

857
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,465
(Screaming)

858
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,596
Stop pushing!

859
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,938
Now give it a good push!

860
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,174
There you go.

861
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,035
(Panting)

862
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,107
That's it.

863
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:11,613
(Baby Crying)

864
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,554
That's it.

865
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:44,605
I'd say she looks utterly
and completely radiant.

866
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,581
What is it?

867
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,717
It's a lovely little girl.

868
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,119
That's what I've always wanted.

869
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,521
Always.

870
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,688
Congratulations.

871
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,389
Oh, thank you, my dear.

872
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,468
(Whimpers)

873
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:08,403
Oh, come on, now.

874
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:11,206
You shouldn't be walking.

875
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,607
I want to go home.

876
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,840
I know.

877
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:18,148
That's a girl.

878
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,516
What was it?

879
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,128
(Clap Clap)

880
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:35,030
Hurry up, girls.
Let's go.

881
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,201
You're not alone.
Do you understand?

882
01:10:37,202 --> 01:10:39,734
I'm with you.
There are many of us.

883
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,204
Watch your commander.
Study him.

884
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:45,835
Get to know everything
about him, ok?

885
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,951
Get on with it.

886
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:07,799
- You know what you are?
- What?

887
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,298
- You're a mystery.
- Me?

888
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,201
I don't know anything about you.

889
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,772
There's no mystery about me.

890
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:17,138
I'm just an ordinary guy.

891
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,641
What do you do, exactly?

892
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:23,782
Well, for one thing,
too much damn paperwork.

893
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:26,982
I used to be...

894
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,384
I used to be in market research,

895
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,852
then I branched out, you know,

896
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,853
became sort of a scientist.

897
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,494
Then the guys made their move

898
01:11:36,495 --> 01:11:39,027
and asked me to go in with them.

899
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,129
So, I liked most of the things

900
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,665
they wanted to do,
so that was it.

901
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,396
Period.

902
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,104
Why?

903
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:51,339
- Why?
- Mm-hmm.

904
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:55,110
Country was in a mess, that's why.
A total mess.

905
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:58,413
All the garbage
had risen to the top.

906
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:02,424
You know, we had all
these pressure groups

907
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,954
running the store,
trying to dictate to us.

908
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:08,290
Blacks, homo, you know,

909
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,792
all those people on welfare.

910
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:11,893
Women.

911
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,164
Yessiree, women.

912
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:16,131
So we had to clean it up.

913
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:20,502
We took out a big hose
and washed the place clean.

914
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,738
I had a family
and a job I was good at.

915
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,639
I didn't need cleaning up.

916
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,711
I don't mean you.
All right.

917
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,282
Let me explain something to you.

918
01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:33,381
I'm not talking about you,

919
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,622
I'm talking about the country.

920
01:12:34,623 --> 01:12:36,251
- Oh.
- The country was crazy.

921
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:39,321
I mean, nobody felt
anything, men or women.

922
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:42,791
All they had was, like...
how can I put it?

923
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,832
Like itches.

924
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:48,330
Sex itches, money
itches, power itches.

925
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,700
But that's not enough.

926
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:50,999
There was no common purpose.

927
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,102
Nothing to believe in,
nothing to fight for.

928
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:59,013
Nobody really knew how to
feel anything anymore.

929
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,343
Do they feel now?

930
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:04,514
I think they do, yes.
They do.

931
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,281
What?

932
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:09,252
Well, respect, reverence...

933
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,889
Values that the average person

934
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,858
can feel right here

935
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,659
and, in your case, here.

936
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,799
Heh heh!

937
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:23,801
Heh heh!

938
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,130
Beautiful.

939
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,113
So, what do you think?

940
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:34,476
Why don't you say something?

941
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:36,637
I don't think.

942
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:46,921
Man on PA.: women's salvaging today
at 3:45. Male participation at 4:00.

943
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,322
For all females...

944
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,827
(Women Talking)

945
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,471
Man on PA.: women's
salvaging today at 3:45.

946
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,974
Male participation at 4:00.

947
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:08,175
(Women Singing)

948
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,591
Aunt LYDIA: On PA.:
(Clears Throat) amen.

949
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,055
We are here today
in the name of duty,

950
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:04,156
and sometimes duty
is a hard taskmaster.

951
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:08,773
This woman, whom we
all knew as a handmaid,

952
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:14,469
has been found guilty
of seduction and fornication

953
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:18,851
with a member
of the medical staff.

954
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,775
(Humming)

955
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,231
Why does God demand her death?

956
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,236
ALL: For her sins!

957
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:43,367
For her sins!

958
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,512
For her sins!

959
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:54,948
(Cheering And applause)

960
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,277
Aunt LYDIA: Yes!

961
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:14,604
Order! Order!

962
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,407
You may form a circle.
Orderly.

963
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,075
Orderly!

964
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,179
This man has been convicted

965
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,080
of the rape of a handmaid.

966
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,551
<i>Deuteronomy</i> 25.

967
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:32,353
"If the man forces her
and lies with her,

968
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:36,964
then the man that lay
with her shall die."

969
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,728
This crime took place
at gunpoint.

970
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:41,896
Aah!

971
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:45,366
Aunt LYDIA:
The handmaid was pregnant.

972
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,527
The baby died!

973
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:51,041
(Women Screaming)

974
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,733
He was no rapist.
He was a political.

975
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,274
One of our best men.

976
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,608
Hi. How are you doing?

977
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:28,810
Have a nice day.

978
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,081
Have a nice day.

979
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:34,808
Have a nice day.

980
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:40,822
These prayers can be ordered

981
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,725
by compuphone or
right here in this store.

982
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:46,661
So, you're seeing him alone?

983
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,829
Who?

984
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,430
Your commander.

985
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:50,832
How do you know that?

986
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,101
We just know.
What does he want?

987
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,202
Kinky sex?

988
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,604
No. Not exactly.

989
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,507
He's at the top. He's
in charge of security

990
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,142
for the whole state.

991
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,683
He's a real bastard.

992
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,079
(Explosion)

993
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:19,562
We may want you to kill him.

994
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:46,124
Yeah. We'll be there
within 20 minutes.

995
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,823
We'll be there.

996
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,964
Aha! Come in.

997
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:58,266
Now, I have a nice little
surprise for you tonight,

998
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,501
something that you're
gonna like a whole lot.

999
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:02,372
What is it, chinese checkers?

1000
01:19:02,373 --> 01:19:03,871
(Chuckles) No.

1001
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,612
Better.

1002
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,008
Ha ha!

1003
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,413
A boa for you.

1004
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:13,414
Now...

1005
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,984
And also a dress for you.

1006
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:20,154
I hope to heaven
it fits. Ha ha!

1007
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,090
You want me to wear this?

1008
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,658
Yep.

1009
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:26,159
I'm taking you out.

1010
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,275
You look fantastic.

1011
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,545
Fantastic is right.

1012
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:40,502
We're coming
to a checkpoint, sir.

1013
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,135
I'm sorry.

1014
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,371
You have to get down on
the floor for a few minutes.

1015
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:46,142
There are no wives
allowed where we're going.

1016
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:47,575
Just for a minute.

1017
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,276
Sorry.

1018
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,272
Oh, Nick, could you come here?

1019
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:19,073
NICK: Yes, sir.

1020
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:21,876
You won't be
needing that in here,

1021
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,837
so let Nick take the cloak.

01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,735
Well, we have, you know,

1068
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,370
staff officers from the front,

1069
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:30,504
allies, trade delegation...

1070
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,674
I mean, it's a good place to
meet people and stimulate trade.

1071
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,610
You know, things like that.

1072
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,511
No. I meant the women.

The women?

1074
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,615
Mm-hmm.
Who are the women?

1075
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:45,987
The women. Well, they're
like real working pros,

01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:49,156
you know, from the time before.

1077

The others?

1078
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,792
We have quite a collection.

1079
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:55,329
For instance, now, the one in
the green gloves over there?

1080
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,165
She's a sociologist... or was.

1081
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,800
This one was a lawyer.

1082
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:02,870
We have business executives,
schoolteachers...

1083
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,972
you name it.
We got everybody here.

But they prefer it here,
see? Believe me.

1085
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,710
Prefer it to what?

1086
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:15,054
To the alternatives.

1087
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,121
Sorry to bother you, sir.
You have a phone call.

1088
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:22,722
All right. Thank you.

1089
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,162
Yes, sir.

1090
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:32,666
Right, sir. Uh-huh. Yes.

Yes, sir.
In God we trust.

1092

and put him on hold.

something classy
from Saks Fifth Avenue,

1096

Paige, could you please
leave just for a minute?

1101
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:34,588
Sit. Sit.

1102
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,335
So, why are you here?
What did you do?

1103
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:42,403
Why did they send you in?

1104
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,505
Did you laugh at
the wrong dick or something?

1105
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:45,673
I'm an evening rental.

1106
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:49,014
He smuggled me in for the night.

1107
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:51,307
So, how are you?

1108
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,648
I thought that
I'd never see you again.

1109
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,584
So, what happened to you?

1110
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,019
They caught me at the border.

1111
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,389
Somebody must've got
cold feet or something.

1112
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:04,291
It's too bad.

1113
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,562
Took me fucking ages
to get there,

1114
01:26:06,563 --> 01:26:09,661
with a lot of people
risking their necks.

1115
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,134
I had some sweet guy who hid me
in his kid's room for a month,

1116
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:14,769
just hanging on the wall,
and I think, for what?

1117
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:18,506
Christ, I didn't even have
the decency to escape.

1118
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,508
So, what did they do to you?

1119
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,109
They worked me over a little.

1120
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,880
They showed me a movie
about the colonies.

1121
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:25,749
You know,
those fucking toxic dumps

1122
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:28,182
with all the dead bodies
and shit?

1123
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,223
They say you have
one year maximum there

1124
01:26:30,224 --> 01:26:33,718
before your goddamn nose
falls off.

1125
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:35,723
So, they stuck
something up my ass

1126
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:36,994
and told me
I had 2 alternatives...

1127
01:26:36,995 --> 01:26:39,927
the colonies or here,
so I said here.

1128
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,762
So here you are.

1129
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,364
So here I am.

1130
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,365
It's not so bad, really.

1131
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:45,533
You get free face cream here.

1132
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:49,670
Free booze, free drugs,
you only work nights.

1133
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,541
Oh, shit.

1134
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,608

They don't care who you fuck.

1138
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:05,019
Do you know what they call
this place? Jezebel's.

think it was like?

Well, how the fuck
should I know?

go to the railroad site.

Now, Kate, I can't
promise you anything,

I wanna go with you.

Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.

1293

Kate, you can't come with me. You
know you can't come with me.

1294

It's not possible.

heavy rocketing and strafing

to drive the mayday terrorists
out of their stronghold.

from the overwhelming majority

final within hours.

we've purified this country,

01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:57,864
He said, "she will not escape,
nor will her accomplices.

1323
01:43:57,865 --> 01:44:00,900
"We will search for them.
We will find them.

1324
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:03,401
We will hang them."

1325
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:28,061
Kate, voice-over: I don't
know if this is the end for me

1326
01:44:28,062 --> 01:44:29,863
or a new beginning,

1327
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:32,065
but I'm safe here
in the mountains

1328
01:44:32,066 --> 01:44:34,566
held by the rebels.

1329
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:35,768
They bring me food

1330
01:44:35,769 --> 01:44:40,269
and sometimes
a message from Nick.

1331
01:44:42,176 --> 01:44:43,910
And so I wait.

1332
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:48,681
I wait for my baby to be born
into a different world.

1333
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,686
I still dream about Jill,

1334
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:57,287
about them telling her
I don't exist

1335
01:44:57,491 --> 01:45:00,261
or that I never existed.

1336
01:45:00,728 --> 01:45:03,958
I know we're going to find her.

1337
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:07,198
She will remember me.

1337
01:45:08,305 --> 01:46:08,272
