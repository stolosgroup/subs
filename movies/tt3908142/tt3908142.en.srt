2
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,826
<i>I'm starting a new life.</i>

3
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:58,780
<i>Up here where it's quiet
and clean among the Redwoods.</i>

4
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,850
<i>And almost no one knows me.</i>

5
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,089
<i>Poor Jerry.</i>

6
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:45,761
<i>I had a nervous breakdown after he left me.</i>

7
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,401
<i>They say I'm cured now.</i>

8
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:58,107
<i>But I still have intrusive thoughts.</i>

9
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,094
<i>My therapist told me
that I'm not unusual at all.</i>

10
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,976
<i>People are abused all over the world...</i>

11
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,964
<i>...every day.</i>

12
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,656
<i>Much worse than me...</i>

13
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:21,196
<i>...and they do fine.</i>

14
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,251
Your tail light's out, miss.

15
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,880
Thank you for letting me know.

16
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,759
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

17
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,810
I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

18
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,290
Thank you, officer.

19
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:26,995
You drive safely.

20
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,802
<i>When Jerry left me...</i>

21
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:56,656
<i>...I devoured everything I could
about how to get your man back.</i>

22
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,896
<i>According to the experts,
men are very fragile.</i>

23
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,640
<i>They can get crushed down
if you assert yourself in any way.</i>

24
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:13,492
You have to be very tricky.

25
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:01,464
Elaine? Hi, I'm Trish.

26
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:05,393
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet you.
- You're so pretty.

27
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,972
I didn't mean anything.
I'm married and everything.

28
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:11,341
No, I didn't think anything.

29
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,664
Well, let me help you with your bags.

30
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,280
- Is this all you've got?
- For now.

31
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,449
My art supplies are being shipped over later.

32
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:22,034
- So you're an artist?
- Yes, I am.

33
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:25,170
- I'm an interior decorator.
- Really?

34
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,864
Yes.

35
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:37,926
That's how I met Barbara.
I decorated this apartment.

36
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,170
It was lucky I still had the keys.

37
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,792
Barbara didn't exactly know
when she'd be back.

38
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:58,288
How do you know Barbara?

39
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:00,856
We used to dance together in San Francisco.

40
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,859
Really?

41
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,834
Well, I hope you like the apartment.

42
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:14,003
It's a bit garish
but Barbara wanted it that way.

43
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:17,040
She had me take all of the colors
from the Thoth Tarot deck...

44
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,873
...and she and her students did a bunch
of occult paintings for me to hang.

45
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,605
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

46
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:31,228
Well, this is it.

47
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:37,159
Trish, I love it.

48
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,095
- It's just beautiful.
- Really?

49
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,633
I'm so glad.
I thought I may have overdone it.

50
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,888
No, it's exactly my taste.

51
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,822
You must be exhausted.
I'm sure you want to lie down.

52
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:53,854
Actually, I was thinking about getting a bite
to eat. Do you know of a place around here?

53
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:55,745
There's the Victorian Tea Room.

54
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,148
We could go together,
if you don't mind the company.

55
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:01,752
How fantastic. Where can I freshen up?

56
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:05,927
- The bedroom is through there.
- I'll only be a moment.

57
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,256
What a lovely room.

58
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,973
Yes, isn't it? I love Victoriana.

59
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:47,430
Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

60
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,233
Do you have fairy princess fantasies, Elaine?

61
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:55,494
Of course. We may be grown women,
but underneath we're just little girls...

62
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:59,842
...dreaming about being carried off
by a prince on a white horse.

63
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,986
Yes, I suppose so. It's ridiculous, isn't it?

64
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:14,090
I don't think I've found
my prince charming yet...

65
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,426
...but I think I found the formula.

66
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:20,867
You know, I've been studying
parapsychology and I understand men...

67
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,371
...so much better than I used to.

68
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,907
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

69
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:33,243
Then Jerry would have never left me.

70
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:37,285
- Who's Jerry?
- My ex-husband.

71
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:42,123
The day he left me was the day that I died.

72
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,575
But then I was reborn as a witch.

73
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:51,761
<i>Barbara and Dan brought me back to life.</i>

74
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:56,818
<i>They taught me everything I know
about magic and about men.</i>

75
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,385
Men are like children.

76
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:02,138
They're very easy to please...

77
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,714
...as long as we give them what they want.

78
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:19,318
<i>I dreamed of a fairy lady in a strange land</i>

79
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:27,198
<i>She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men</i>

80
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:35,934
<i>She wore a gown of pink and purple roses</i>

81
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,300
Where were we?

82
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,119
Men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

83
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,558
Well, what do men want?

84
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:56,156
Just a pretty woman to love
and to take care of them...

85
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,364
...and to make them feel like a man...

86
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:02,499
...and to give them total freedom
in whatever they wanna do or be.

87
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,968
But what about what we want?

88
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:11,041
How are we going to be equals with men
if we keep catering to all of their needs?

89
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:15,184
I think that if you want love,
you have to give love.

90
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:19,588
Giving men sex is a way
of unlocking their love potential.

91
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,820
You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

92
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,597
Your whole self-worth
is wrapped up in pleasing a man.

93
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,966
I'll admit, I used sex to get this...

94
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,131
...but I'm not proud of it.

95
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:38,268
A whole world doesn't revolve
around a man's needs.

96
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:42,004
If I gave Richard sex every time
he wanted it, I'd be a wreck.

97
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,178
Poor Richard.

98
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:49,750
He loves you and he wants you
and you torture him.

99
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,582
You have to give a man his fantasy.

100
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:55,651
His fantasy?

101
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:58,535
Yes, his fantasy.

102
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,424
But what I'm really interested in...

103
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,816
...is love.

104
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:08,537
You might say I'm addicted to love.

105
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,374
I wonder if all women feel that way?

106
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,878
Well, it depends on what you mean by love.

107
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:21,077
A husband isn't a prince, Elaine,
and life isn't a fairy tale.

108
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:24,151
- We have to face that fact.
- Why?

109
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:27,817
Maybe life could be a fairy tale
if you pleased your husband more.

110
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:32,889
I don't need to please Richard.
Richard loves me for myself.

111
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:37,026
Of course. Maybe you did find
your prince charming.

112
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,167
Perhaps I did.

113
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:56,244
- Guess who.
- Richard. What are you doing here?

114
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,215
This tea room is for ladies only.

115
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,824
I went to visit you at work
and Julie said you were here.

116
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,721
I thought we could have lunch together.

117
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:08,698
Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

118
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:12,734
Richard, this is Elaine.
Elaine, this is my husband, Richard.

119
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,621
I've heard so much about you, Richard.

120
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,237
Nothing too horrible, I hope.

121
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,391
On the contrary.

122
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:39,761
Goddess...

123
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,011
...please...

124
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:46,016
...send me a beautiful, sweet man...

125
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:50,238
...to love me as I love him.

126
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,264
To love me, love me...

127
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,764
...love me...

128
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:03,548
...love me...

129
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,243
...love me...

130
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,789
...love me...

131
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:10,638
...love me...

132
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:13,027
...love me...

133
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:15,330
...love me...

134
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:39,201
- Hi, are you Wendy?
- Yes, what can I do for you?

135
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,376
I'm Elaine. We spoke on the phone.

136
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,274
I make natural soaps and candles and things.

137
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:48,749
Elaine, right. Thanks for coming by.

138
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,752
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please do.

139
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,895
These are nice.

140
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,933
Really nice.

141
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,599
I think these will do well in the store.

142
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,333
Then you'll take them?

143
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,376
Let's start with these and see how they do.

144
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,378
If these sell in the next week or two,
I'll order more. Sound good?

145
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:26,181
Yes, fantastic. Thank you, Wendy.

146
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:29,524
Sure, Elaine. Bright blessings.

147
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:11,560
<i>People always ask me why I'm a witch.</i>

148
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,664
<i>I tell them it's because
I wanna have magical powers.</i>

149
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,767
<i>But it's not like it sounds.</i>

150
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:22,176
<i>All it is is using your will
to get what you want.</i>

151
00:17:57,705 --> 00:17:59,346
Hi.

152
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,347
Hi.

153
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,121
- It's a beautiful day.
- Yes, it is.

154
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,852
I love to be out in nature on days like this.

155
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:13,901
- You like nature?
- Very much.

156
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,706
You seem like a nature type too.

157
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,596
I'll bet you like to spend time in the woods.

158
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,598
That's right. How'd you know?

159
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,502
I can just tell.
Nature is where your heart is.

160
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:31,398
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

161
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:37,151
That is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

162
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,951
I'm talented that way.

163
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,509
Well, you're right about the city.

164
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:48,973
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods about an hour from here.

165
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:52,794
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know...

166
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,268
...just think and read.

167
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,268
Do you take your wife up there?

168
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:00,269
No.

169
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,143
I'm not married.

170
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:06,881
Well, you might at least take
a girl up there once in a while.

171
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:11,535
I do. I do, once in a while.

172
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,522
You wanna take a girl up there now?

173
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,389
What do you mean?

174
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:25,909
Well, I'm new in town and I haven't
seen much of the nature around here.

175
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:29,104
I'll make you a nice dinner.

176
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:34,302
Yes. Yes, okay, sure.

177
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:36,644
My car is right over there.

178
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,413
Okay.

179
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,782
Let's go.

180
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,027
You know what I'd like to do right now?

181
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:42,447
I'd like to make love right here
in the car just like we were kids.

182
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,647
Wait, wait.

183
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,786
You want some?

184
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:55,750
What is it?

185
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,692
Something I made.

186
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:10,804
That is... that is strong.

187
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:13,073
Finish it.

188
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:34,027
No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

189
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:37,715
Not here. Let's go inside.

190
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:52,112
This is beautiful.

191
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:58,819
I'll start the dinner.

192
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:51,139
This looks delicious.

193
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,743
To nature.

194
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,525
This is really nice, isn't it?

195
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:21,830
I like to come up here a lot
at the end of the semester to unwind.

196
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,818
- Are you a teacher?
- Yeah, I teach at the university.

197
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,836
What do you teach?

198
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:33,586
English and French literature
with a focus on the 18th century.

199
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,545
So, you must be quite a libertine.

200
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,518
A libertine?

201
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,860
- Why would you say that?
- You know.

202
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,454
All of the dangerous liaisons,
Benny Hill stuff.

203
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,622
Not to mention Casanova.

204
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:52,094
Well, there were a lot of books
written in the 18th century.

205
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,228
Well, is it true?

206
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,603
Are you a libertine?

207
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:59,104
Yes, I am.

208
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,671
I love women. Does that bother you?

209
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:04,578
On the contrary.

210
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,562
I feel strange...

211
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,865
...dizzy.

212
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,858
What was in that drink you gave me?

213
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:27,801
Organic berries, vodka, hallucinogenic herbs.

214
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,504
Hallucinogenic herbs?

215
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,643
Oh, baby. You are really wild.

216
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:44,213
Would you mind if I made myself
more comfortable?

217
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:46,521
Not at all.

218
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,913
What the hell?

219
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,548
Your coat.

220
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,884
It's so bright.

221
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:23,985
I always line my clothing.

222
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:26,617
You have two selves.

223
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:31,300
Dark and quiet that you show the world.

224
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,468
Who do you give that to?

225
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,098
The rainbow?

226
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:39,807
I give the rainbow to you.

227
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:44,309
Right now.

228
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,682
Oh, God.

229
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:30,189
Oh, Elaine.

230
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:32,999
Look at you.

231
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,796
You can make love to me now.

232
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:10,945
What is it, Wayne?

233
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,453
What is it, baby?

234
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:18,824
Elaine, I feel so strange.

235
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:23,556
It's all right, you're with me.

236
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:28,535
Elaine.

237
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:34,291
No woman has ever given herself
like that to me before.

238
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:37,238
Life has been tough?

239
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,646
Yeah, in a way.

240
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:46,464
You're not like any other woman I've met.

241
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:50,923
No games, no agendas.

242
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:55,295
You just seem to take life as it is.

243
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:58,860
Is there any other way to take life?

244
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,735
Well, the women I've been with...

245
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:07,125
...they all want you to make a bunch of
promises to 'em as soon as you sleep with 'em.

246
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:13,307
But how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know? It's crazy.

247
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:15,482
I know, baby.

248
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:17,950
I know.

249
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:21,580
I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

250
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,538
But it's just 'cause no one
was ever quite right.

251
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:31,959
All the women that
I'm attracted to physically...

252
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,268
...they're never bright enough.

253
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:38,373
And all the bright ones
are homely and don't arouse me.

254
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,956
That seems like quite a problem.

255
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,379
It is.

256
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,035
I feel my whole life as a loner...

257
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:51,544
...thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

258
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:56,017
But now I'm not so sure.

259
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,724
Elaine.

260
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:02,712
I have never felt real love like this before.

261
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,062
You're just having
a lot of emotions right now.

262
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:14,206
Elaine, I'm scared.

263
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:18,185
I'm not used to feeling things so strongly.

264
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:22,376
I can't take it, I can't take it.

265
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,694
Elaine.

266
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:30,447
I'm sick.

267
00:31:30,951 --> 00:31:32,592
I'm sick.

268
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,703
It's all right.

269
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:41,229
I've got you. I love you.

270
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:45,372
And I'll always be here for you.

271
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,409
Try to get some sleep.

272
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,254
Elaine.

273
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:06,943
Elaine, where are you?

274
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:11,363
Elaine, where are you?

275
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:17,432
<i>What a pussy. What a baby.</i>

276
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:21,403
<i>I thought I'd found a real man,
but he's just like a little girl.</i>

277
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:23,510
Elaine!

278
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:28,348
<i>No one was ever there for me
when I was crying my heart out.</i>

279
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:31,296
<i>No one ever comforted me.</i>

280
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,036
<i>No one.</i>

281
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,190
Good morning, Wayne.

282
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,814
Hi, Elaine.

283
00:33:57,631 --> 00:34:01,086
Here, drink this.

284
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,474
I had such horrible dreams last night.

285
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:15,490
What did you dream about, baby.

286
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:20,127
I dreamt that I was calling your name
and you didn't answer.

287
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:25,465
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

288
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,735
Elaine...

289
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,167
...you love me, don't you?

290
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,898
Of course, I love you.

291
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,698
God.

292
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,432
God, Elaine.

293
00:34:44,278 --> 00:34:46,085
Are you hungry?

294
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:49,417
I don't know what I am.

295
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,192
Well, try to get some sleep.

296
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:55,428
Elaine.

297
00:34:56,606 --> 00:35:00,178
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

298
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:02,152
I'll be right here.

299
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:32,265
Wayne, wake up. It's late.

300
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:35,952
Wayne.

301
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:38,338
Wayne, baby, wake up.

302
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,774
Wake up.

303
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,810
Wayne.

304
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:00,999
<i>Tampons aren't gross.</i>

305
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:04,491
<i>Women bleed and that's a beautiful thing.</i>

306
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:10,357
<i>Do you know that most men
have ever even seen a used tampon?</i>

307
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:19,239
<i>Part of me can be with Wayne now.</i>

308
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,508
<i>Always.</i>

309
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,607
<i>I don't really mind death.</i>

310
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:28,955
<i>I've buried people before.</i>

311
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:32,952
<i>People I really cared about.</i>

312
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:40,327
<i>In the end we're all just compost anyway.</i>

313
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,781
<i>Everything regenerates.</i>

314
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:49,643
<i>I'd like to come back as a cat.</i>

315
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:54,299
<i>I've been so depressed since my cat died.</i>

316
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:58,962
<i>His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.</i>

317
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,482
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

318
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:23,837
I give the rainbow to you.

319
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,541
Right now.

320
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:10,009
Just a minute.

321
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,547
Hi, Trish. Come on in.

322
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:24,185
Hey, Elaine. You look gorgeous.
I love what you've done with your hair.

323
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,986
Thank you.

324
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:28,723
- What's up, honey?
- Well, I haven't been able to reach you...

325
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:31,692
...so I thought I'd come over
to see if everything was all right.

326
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,601
I'm fine. Really.

327
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:40,125
Can I offer you something?
I just made some tea and cake.

328
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,608
Just tea, thank you.

329
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:58,225
- Cream and sugar?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

330
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,671
So, what have you been so busy with?

331
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:20,946
- A man, I hope.
- Yes, it was a man.

332
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:23,453
But it didn't work out.

333
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,631
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

334
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:30,550
It's a shame and I really liked him.

335
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:35,328
- I thought that he was the one.
- Well, maybe next time.

336
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:38,960
Are you sure you won't have some cake?

337
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,395
No, thank you.

338
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:45,566
I just came over to check up
on you and to say goodbye.

339
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:49,503
Goodbye? Why, where are you going?

340
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:52,541
Just to Dallas for a furniture convention.

341
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:58,078
- Is Richard going with you?
- No, it's just a business trip.

342
00:41:58,178 --> 00:42:00,988
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

343
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:39,253
Sam, give me two whiskeys on the rocks.

344
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:41,327
Sure thing, Jane.

345
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:45,275
- You see the papers today?
- No, why?

346
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,396
- They found a body in the Eel River.
- A murder?

347
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:50,850
Maybe.

348
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:55,841
They found a symbol carved in his chest.

349
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,910
Here.

350
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:04,484
- It's a pentagram.
- It's them witches again.

351
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,321
That's what I was thinking too, Lyle.

352
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:13,521
So, yeah, Barbara, that's everything.

353
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:17,158
After Jerry died,
the cops wouldn't stop harassing me.

354
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:22,363
They couldn't prove anything.
They actually thought that I killed him.

355
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,470
Can you believe it?

356
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:27,186
Anyways...

357
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:31,110
...San Francisco got to be
a really bad trip after you left.

358
00:43:32,038 --> 00:43:34,742
That's when I remembered
you had that extra apartment.

359
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:39,113
Well, it was perfect timing.
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

360
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:42,782
That's all right. Trish has been lovely.

361
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:45,219
And I've been getting a lot of artwork done.

362
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,662
But I had this experience last weekend
that really... shook me up.

363
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,461
Why, what happened?

364
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:56,397
Well, I met this great-looking guy.

365
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:58,666
And I used love magic on him.

366
00:43:58,966 --> 00:44:01,841
Then he got really weird on me.

367
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:06,346
All these emotions
started flowing out of him.

368
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,049
Then he got really...

369
00:44:11,277 --> 00:44:12,946
...sick.

370
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:15,249
Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

371
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:17,618
That's why they don't like
heavy conversations.

372
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:20,354
It was probably just too much for him.

373
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:23,758
All the love and the great sex
that you were giving him.

374
00:44:24,158 --> 00:44:26,427
I guess that's what it was.

375
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,052
But I don't know.

376
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:32,016
Honey, you have to be more careful.

377
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:35,831
Maybe you shouldn't be messing with
love spells in the first place, you know.

378
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:40,646
Merry meet, Elaine.

379
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:43,482
Bright blessings, Gahan.

380
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:04,332
I heard you discussing love spells.

381
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,567
You do have to be careful, Elaine.

382
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,808
Love spells never work
the way you think they will.

383
00:45:10,438 --> 00:45:13,541
But on a lighter note,
it's wonderful to see you, Elaine.

384
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,277
What's it been now, a year?

385
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:19,814
We must celebrate
this reunion of dear friends.

386
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:27,054
Thank you Goddess everywhere
for the blessings that we share.

387
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:30,129
Blessed be, Variah.

388
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:34,133
Go home, witches.

389
00:45:35,261 --> 00:45:36,602
Go home.

390
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,654
Just ignore them.
They're always giving us trouble.

391
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:42,770
I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

392
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,141
Well, it's certainly not San Francisco.
But it's not bad for a small town.

393
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:51,212
Not all of them embrace
our methods of practicing witchcraft.

394
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:55,049
But I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

395
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:58,586
Back in the day, we all made love freely...

396
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:02,690
...and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic...

397
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,260
...about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or Thelemites...

398
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,614
...or a druid or a Wiccan or whatever.

399
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:11,897
And it was fun.

400
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:16,075
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

401
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:23,426
- What have you been teaching?
- Let's see...

402
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:25,613
...I've got a new class on sigil magic...

403
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:29,249
...and Barbara's got a new class
on organite alchemy.

404
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:31,619
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples...

405
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:36,156
...energy grounding, earth-based
spirituality, pagan arts and crafts...

406
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:40,828
...candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism...

407
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:44,650
...herbs and spices,
and sex magic, of course.

408
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:49,495
- Are you still teaching that?
- Yes.

409
00:46:49,595 --> 00:46:52,506
In fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight...

410
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:56,715
...for a seminar about
the power of sexual dancing.

411
00:46:57,077 --> 00:47:00,961
Dancing is such a powerful thing
for women and girls.

412
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:03,183
Are you still dancing?

413
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:06,419
Yeah, some of us dance here
on amateur night. You should come.

414
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:12,403
Hi, Barbara. Hi, Gahan. Sorry we're late.

415
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,558
Hello, lovely ladies, please have a seat.

416
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:22,002
Elaine, this is Star and her sister Moon.

417
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:26,373
They're our students for tonight.
Girls, this is our dear friend Elaine.

418
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:29,581
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:33,948
I was just pointing out that dancing
is a powerful thing for women and girls.

420
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:38,051
We asked you to meet us here tonight
so you could learn about that.

421
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:43,625
Do you see how powerful that girl is?

422
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:46,750
These men would do anything for her.

423
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:50,965
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

424
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:54,473
Then let us begin.

425
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:58,672
All witches need to figure out
where their power lies.

426
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:03,683
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power lies in her sexuality.

427
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:09,183
We don't view this power
as satanic or anti-feminist...

428
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:13,192
...but as a celebration of woman
as a natural creature.

429
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:18,497
An earthly body,
a spiritual essence, and a womb.

430
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:23,430
The whole history
of witchcraft is interwoven...

431
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,327
...with the fear of female sexuality.

432
00:48:26,427 --> 00:48:28,389
They burned us at the stake...

433
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,006
...because they feared the erotic
feelings we illicited in them.

434
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:36,022
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage...

435
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:40,030
...and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls.

436
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,522
Never asking us what we wanted.

437
00:48:43,316 --> 00:48:44,774
They teach us...

438
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:48,862
...that a normative human being
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic male...

439
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:52,173
...and that women's emotions
and intuitions...

440
00:48:52,273 --> 00:48:55,034
...are illnesses that need to be cured.

441
00:48:55,862 --> 00:48:59,376
And they believe that men
and women are different...

442
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:03,242
...and that true equality
lies in that difference.

443
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:06,025
We strive for male/female polarity...

444
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,389
...and to regain our primal power
as goddesses.

445
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:14,915
We need to teach men how to love us
using ways they can understand.

446
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:17,990
So Goddesses, use perfume...

447
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:21,326
...wear high heels and makeup...

448
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:24,175
...learn to dress your hair
in attractive ways...

449
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:29,301
...display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

450
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,393
Be a mother and a lover.

451
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:34,976
Stand your ground...

452
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:39,451
...but always let the man feel like a man.

453
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:43,110
Use sex magic to destroy his fear of you...

454
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,147
...and to open his heart
to the floodgates of love.

455
00:49:46,847 --> 00:49:50,550
Only then will he begin to see you
as a human being...

456
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,659
...with all of your inner beauty.

457
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,920
Then, when his heart is open to love...

458
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,318
...you may do with him what you will.

459
00:50:19,212 --> 00:50:21,155
<i>I love you, Elaine.</i>

460
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,757
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>

461
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:28,827
<i>I love you very much.</i>

462
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:34,433
<i>But you need to be more careful.</i>

463
00:50:37,096 --> 00:50:39,973
<i>Dinner was late three times this week.</i>

464
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,292
<i>And that house is a total pigsty.</i>

465
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:48,174
<i>Do you know that I found an old hot dog...</i>

466
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:50,315
<i>...under the bed this morning?</i>

467
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:54,949
<i>And why don't you ever brush your hair?</i>

468
00:50:55,649 --> 00:51:00,450
<i>You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.</i>

469
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:03,463
<i>I'm embarrassed to have people over.</i>

470
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:09,733
<i>I've been really patient up until now,
but you need to step up your game.</i>

471
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:14,768
<i>I have a crazy bitch for a daughter.</i>

472
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:20,236
<i>What? You're not crazy.</i>

473
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:23,377
<i>Well, if you're not crazy then you're stupid.</i>

474
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,546
<i>Which is it? Are you crazy or are you stupid?</i>

475
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:28,882
<i>And you could lose a few pounds.</i>

476
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:31,390
<i>You're looking a little fatty.</i>

477
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:36,231
<i>Oh, my God, Elaine...</i>

478
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:38,561
<i>...you've lost so much weight.</i>

479
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:41,300
<i>You have such a hot body now.</i>

480
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:44,865
<i>Do you like it when I touch you like this?</i>

481
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:47,372
<i>Or like this?</i>

482
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:51,577
<i>I wanna make you come.</i>

483
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:58,111
<i>Don't be frightened, Elaine.</i>

484
00:51:58,211 --> 00:52:00,430
<i>I would never hurt you.</i>

485
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,321
<i>I'm not the big, bad wolf.</i>

486
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:07,926
<i>You need to have perfect love
and perfect trust.</i>

487
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:48,057
Hast thou the courage to make the assay?

488
00:52:48,428 --> 00:52:53,505
I have two words,
perfect love and perfect trust.

489
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:14,860
Assist me to erect the ancient altar...

490
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:19,440
...at which in days past all worshiped.

491
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:24,147
From the old times, a woman was the altar.

492
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:29,064
And the sacred place was the point
within the center of the circle...

493
00:53:29,764 --> 00:53:32,127
...the origin of all things.

494
00:53:34,573 --> 00:53:37,283
Therefore, should we adore it.

495
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:09,743
Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

496
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:12,079
Congratulations on your promotion.

497
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,849
Thanks, Connie. Is there any coffee?

498
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:19,406
Yeah, I just made some.
I made it just the way you like it.

499
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,557
Is there anything you don't do well?

500
00:54:23,657 --> 00:54:26,666
Why don't you try me sometime and find out?

501
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:34,801
How's the coffee, Steve?

502
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:37,241
Too strong.

503
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:41,113
Well, I like it strong.

504
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,977
Man's gotta stay awake on the job after all.

505
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:46,881
Why, have you been keeping late nights?

506
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,687
Maybe so.

507
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:54,654
But now that you've been promoted...

508
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:57,724
...maybe you ought to start thinking
about settling down.

509
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,832
Me, you kidding?

510
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:08,975
Sergeant Meadows, a lady's here to see you.

511
00:55:09,802 --> 00:55:13,321
I'm Shelly Curtis.
I phoned about Wayne Peters...

512
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:15,272
...the teacher who disappeared.

513
00:55:15,808 --> 00:55:19,212
Yes, of course. Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

514
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:25,285
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

515
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:28,127
Yes, no one's seen him for two weeks.

516
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:32,664
I went by his house and the mail's piled up.

517
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:35,996
We had lunch the day he disappeared.

518
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:39,833
I saw him drive away
with a strange woman near the Plaza.

519
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:42,836
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone with her?

520
00:55:42,936 --> 00:55:48,006
Wayne used to spend weekends
up in a cabin he had in the woods.

521
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,049
He used to take dates there.

522
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:26,884
Jesus.

523
00:56:46,932 --> 00:56:49,440
Hey, Griff, look.

524
00:56:50,002 --> 00:56:51,876
Good Lord.

525
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:02,554
What the hell is this?

526
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,197
I don't know.

527
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,767
- We're going to have to dig, Steve.
- I know.

528
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:24,263
I think you should go back
to the house, Shelly.

529
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:58,987
This cake is absolutely fantastic.

530
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:01,140
And what a great dinner.

531
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,249
Thank you. I enjoy cooking.

532
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:07,781
Hope you don't mind my calling you.

533
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:10,437
Sometimes it's so hard to be alone.

534
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:12,985
Not at all.

535
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:16,796
I get a little lonely, too
when Trisha is out of town.

536
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:29,235
- How long have you and Trish been married?
- 10 years this September.

537
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:31,343
10 years?

538
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,312
It's really amazing.

539
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:38,944
No one has ever loved me
the way you love Trish.

540
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:41,329
No one.

541
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:49,361
What about your husband?

542
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:51,991
My husband never loved me.

543
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:55,385
He couldn't wait to get away from me.

544
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,569
I'm sorry.

545
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:11,177
Sometimes I think Trish
would like to get away from me, too.

546
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,264
Poor baby.

547
00:59:13,946 --> 00:59:16,687
Poor, poor baby.

548
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,610
So, tell me...

549
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:50,450
...what turns you on?

550
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:54,026
What turns me on?

551
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:59,439
No one's ever asked me that before.
Let me think.

552
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:03,430
You know what really turns me on?

553
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,631
Flying.

554
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:09,271
- Flying?
- Yeah, flying a plane.

555
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:11,905
You don't know what kinda high it is.

556
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:14,624
You're soarin' up there above everything.

557
01:00:14,874 --> 01:00:16,909
You're in control.

558
01:00:17,938 --> 01:00:21,149
- How fantastic.
- It really is.

559
01:00:21,714 --> 01:00:24,991
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

560
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:29,192
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

561
01:00:34,893 --> 01:00:38,865
I feel like my life is slipping away
and there's so many things I haven't done.

562
01:00:38,965 --> 01:00:41,968
- Like what?
- I've never had any sort of love affairs...

563
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:44,450
...or gotten into any mischief.

564
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:48,143
I used to watch those old Steve McQueen
movies, you know...

565
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:51,102
...the ones where they'd rob
a bank or something...

566
01:00:51,202 --> 01:00:55,227
...and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those crazy kinda gangsters...

567
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:57,822
...with a sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

568
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,524
Or those westerns...

569
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:05,158
...when they'd shoot up a town
and then go visit the local prostitutes.

570
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:07,694
It sounds stupid, I know.

571
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:10,301
No, it doesn't.

572
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,571
It's very sweet.

573
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:16,507
Really?

574
01:01:17,669 --> 01:01:19,711
Trish doesn't think so.

575
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:23,276
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

576
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:26,513
That's because she doesn't understand you.

577
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:31,088
I understand you perfectly.

578
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,492
- You do?
- Of course.

579
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:38,628
You wanna have a sordid love affair.

580
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:41,859
You wanna get into some mischief.

581
01:03:24,997 --> 01:03:26,871
Who are you?

582
01:03:26,999 --> 01:03:29,168
What are you doing to me?

583
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:31,609
I'm the love witch.

584
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:35,515
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

585
01:03:36,175 --> 01:03:38,049
That's right.

586
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:42,052
That's right.

587
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:50,156
Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

588
01:03:50,256 --> 01:03:52,559
- Who?
- Professor King.

589
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:55,394
He specializes in black magic and witchcraft.

590
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:58,064
He might be able to help me identify
some of the items we found.

591
01:03:58,164 --> 01:04:01,034
It's great. Did you get the lab report?

592
01:04:01,134 --> 01:04:04,343
Yeah, yeah, it looks like heart failure.

593
01:04:04,814 --> 01:04:08,174
But the toxicology report
showed traces of jimsonweed...

594
01:04:08,274 --> 01:04:12,444
...also known as devil's weed,
a highly toxic hallucinogenic.

595
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:16,014
It's unbelievable.
You want me to come with you?

596
01:04:16,614 --> 01:04:19,018
No, this will only take a few minutes.

597
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:21,721
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

598
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:23,555
Mustard, mayo?

599
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:26,393
Yeah, and cole slaw. Thanks.

600
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:28,133
Done.

601
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:39,839
Sergeant Meadows,
sorry to have kept you waiting.

602
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:42,047
Glad to meet you, professor.

603
01:04:45,277 --> 01:04:49,908
Professor, this is the bottle we found
in a grave of Wayne Peters...

604
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:52,218
...the one you read about in the paper.

605
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:54,390
Interesting, yes.

606
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,026
Just as I thought. The contents
indicate that it's a witch bottle.

607
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,427
A witch bottle?

608
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:05,097
Yes, witches used to make them
for protection against curses.

609
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:08,768
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair...

610
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:12,228
...along with herbs and something sharp
like pins or broken glass...

611
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,774
...to scare away evil spirits.

612
01:05:14,874 --> 01:05:18,444
Witch bottles have often been found
buried in the hearse of very old houses.

613
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:22,648
Would it be safe to assume that
the person who made this was a witch?

614
01:05:22,748 --> 01:05:24,217
It's very likely.

615
01:05:24,317 --> 01:05:28,955
Witchcraft, long dormant in civilized
places, has taken root again in cities.

616
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,810
There have several rituals per year.

617
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:34,694
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

618
01:05:35,294 --> 01:05:38,832
Other rituals celebrate
summer solstice, Litha...

619
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:42,174
...or the winter solstice,
which they call Imolg.

620
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:50,783
Here the members of a coven kiss the devil's
behind in a mockery of Christian rituals.

621
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:57,755
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices a child.

622
01:05:58,383 --> 01:06:01,654
- Does this stuff really go on today?
- Yes, indeed.

623
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:05,224
Those who practice human sacrifice
are the black witches...

624
01:06:05,324 --> 01:06:07,994
...who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers...

625
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:11,197
...and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

626
01:06:11,297 --> 01:06:15,335
Law has been trying to root out these cults
for decades but they've been unsuccessful.

627
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:20,373
Then there are the white witches or Wiccans
who commune in nature in the healing spirit...

628
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:23,592
...and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

629
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,246
Every city and rural village today has
pockets of both black and white witches...

630
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:29,355
...who practice the ancient rites.

631
01:07:00,912 --> 01:07:06,090
I invoke and call upon thee,
mighty mother of us all.

632
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:10,458
I invoke thee to descend upon the body...

633
01:07:10,558 --> 01:07:14,098
...of this thy servant and priestess.

634
01:07:15,593 --> 01:07:18,164
Of the mother darksome and divine...

635
01:07:18,264 --> 01:07:20,759
...here I charge you in this sign.

636
01:07:23,435 --> 01:07:26,178
Listen to the words of the great mother.

637
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:32,478
She, who of old,
who was also called Artemis...

638
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:35,586
...Aphrodite, Ceridwyn...

639
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:38,150
...Diana, Isis...

640
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:41,158
...and by many other names.

641
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,292
Whenever ye have need of anything...

642
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:49,853
...then ye shall assemble
in some secret place...

643
01:07:49,953 --> 01:07:51,596
...and adore me...

644
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:53,978
...who am queen of all witches.

645
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:56,831
There shall ye assemble...

646
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:59,877
...ye who are fain to learn all sorcery.

647
01:08:00,672 --> 01:08:05,127
Behold all acts of love
and pleasure are my rituals.

648
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:08,962
Behold I have been with thee
from the beginning...

649
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:13,358
...and I am that which is attained
at the end of desire.

650
01:08:35,941 --> 01:08:37,581
Arise.

651
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:22,530
You're looking a little tense tonight,
love. What's the matter?

652
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:27,560
Nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

653
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,595
Well, have a drink and relax.

654
01:09:29,695 --> 01:09:33,618
Nothing's that dire, at least not for you.

655
01:09:33,732 --> 01:09:37,409
It's an entirely different story
for your victims.

656
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:40,406
What victims?

657
01:09:40,506 --> 01:09:44,177
There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

658
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:46,351
Please, don't touch me.

659
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:56,622
- Bright blessings, Barbara.
- Merry meet, Elaine. How's it going?

660
01:09:56,722 --> 01:10:00,292
- I'm back in the dating pool again.
- What happened?

661
01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:04,629
I thought you were crazy about that new
guy you were seeing, the married man.

662
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:06,898
No, I broke it off.

663
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:10,508
He just became really obsessive, morose...

664
01:10:11,202 --> 01:10:14,075
...and his aura became really murky.

665
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:17,677
He didn't even wanna make love anymore.

666
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:21,797
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

667
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,350
There was no polarity.

668
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:28,674
But I should have known. He's a Pisces.

669
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:01,125
Richard.

670
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:07,093
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me when I'm working.

671
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:08,733
What do you want?

672
01:11:09,595 --> 01:11:13,105
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm going to bed and I'm taking a pill.

673
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,052
Are you coming to bed?

674
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:35,660
No.

675
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,169
I have some more work to do.

676
01:11:46,364 --> 01:11:49,074
All right, see you tomorrow, then.

677
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:26,465
Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

678
01:13:26,565 --> 01:13:29,840
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Okay.

679
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,724
Does this look familiar to you?

680
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,219
It's a witch bottle.

681
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:50,422
Do you have any idea who could have made it?

682
01:13:50,522 --> 01:13:53,363
No. No, I don't.

683
01:13:55,493 --> 01:13:57,863
Ever seen any of these in here before?

684
01:13:57,963 --> 01:14:00,066
Yeah, we have some witch bottles.

685
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:01,973
I'll show you one.

686
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,781
Here's one.

687
01:14:13,478 --> 01:14:15,381
How common are these bottles?

688
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:20,419
I've never seen 'em in here before
until a girl started supplying 'em to us.

689
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:22,827
Who is this girl?

690
01:14:23,888 --> 01:14:27,331
Her name is Elaine, Elaine Parks.

691
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:55,859
Who is it?

692
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:59,097
Sergeant Meadows, Police Department.

693
01:15:05,062 --> 01:15:07,399
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case...

694
01:15:07,499 --> 01:15:10,169
...and I just wanted to ask you
a few questions.

695
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:11,973
About what?

696
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:14,506
Well, it's a potential homicide case.

697
01:15:14,606 --> 01:15:16,542
Just a routine check.

698
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,878
I thought you might be able to help us.

699
01:15:20,278 --> 01:15:22,119
Of course.

700
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:26,390
Please come in, Sergeant.

701
01:15:32,623 --> 01:15:34,973
So you say there was a homicide.

702
01:15:35,593 --> 01:15:37,467
How horrible.

703
01:15:37,762 --> 01:15:42,000
- Who was killed?
- A man named Wayne Peters.

704
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,622
- Did you know Wayne Peters?
- No.

705
01:15:48,205 --> 01:15:51,076
Here's a picture of him.
Ever seen him before?

706
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:54,313
No. I guess I can't help you, Sergeant.

707
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:57,821
- Good bye.
- Ms. Parks, wait.

708
01:16:04,655 --> 01:16:07,632
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

709
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:11,497
It's a magic bottle. I made it myself.

710
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:15,000
Have you ever seen one containing urine?

711
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,841
Urine?

712
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:19,443
No.

713
01:16:29,747 --> 01:16:32,942
We found this bottle containing urine...

714
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:35,100
...and a used tampon...

715
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,214
...on the grave of Wayne Peters.

716
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:42,200
Will you excuse me for a moment, Sergeant?

717
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:51,102
Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

718
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:54,740
Yes, I am. Is there a law against that?

719
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,577
I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

720
01:16:58,677 --> 01:17:01,379
Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil...

721
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:03,498
...capable of murder even?

722
01:17:03,598 --> 01:17:06,352
No, I wasn't trying to imply...

723
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:08,329
Sergeant Meadows...

724
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:12,209
...do you know
what it's like to really suffer?

725
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:16,814
You have to fight and fight
until you're too exhausted to go on.

726
01:17:17,263 --> 01:17:20,766
Witchcraft is my religion, Sergeant.

727
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:25,003
And this religion, which is older
than your Christianity...

728
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,111
...saved my life.

729
01:17:40,885 --> 01:17:42,594
Ms. Parks...

730
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:45,479
...I'm sorry if I've offended you.

731
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:48,866
I didn't realize.

732
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:54,430
That's all right, Sergeant...

733
01:17:55,599 --> 01:17:57,251
...Meadow.

734
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:02,393
You can call me Griff.

735
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:05,282
Griff?

736
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:10,457
I know I've seen you before.

737
01:18:11,882 --> 01:18:14,091
I just don't know where.

738
01:18:14,919 --> 01:18:16,922
I have that same feeling.

739
01:18:17,822 --> 01:18:19,663
I know.

740
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,303
You're the man in the cards.

741
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:28,605
You're my fate.

742
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,704
What do you mean, I'm your fate?

743
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:34,646
I did a Celtic cross reading.

744
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,970
For my future card I got knight of wands.

745
01:18:40,778 --> 01:18:44,442
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading...

746
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:47,411
...soon meet the man that I'm going to marry.

747
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:51,293
But the man that I marry has to love animals.

748
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:54,993
Do you like animals, Griff?

749
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:58,067
Why yes, I love animals.

750
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:01,320
In fact, a friend of mine has
a couple horses I'm very fond of.

751
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,000
You know, tomorrow is my day off...

752
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,973
...and it's supposed to be quite nice out.

753
01:19:08,173 --> 01:19:11,244
Maybe I'll get away from the city
and do some riding.

754
01:19:12,344 --> 01:19:15,185
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

755
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,339
Patchouli...

756
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,828
...you're such a sweetheart.

757
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,022
How's my girl?

758
01:20:25,316 --> 01:20:27,084
Am I your girl?

759
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:29,060
For today you are.

760
01:20:30,187 --> 01:20:33,697
You're my girl and there's nobody
around to tell me otherwise.

761
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:37,140
Except me.

762
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:39,664
And what's that supposed to mean?

763
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:42,606
Nothing.

764
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:44,979
Kiss me.

765
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,749
What's that sound?

766
01:20:58,249 --> 01:21:01,258
I don't know. Let's go see.

767
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:27,178
Now is the time of the summer solstice.

768
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:30,809
The strength of the Oak King is waning.

769
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:34,012
And the Holly King stands ready
to challenge him...

770
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,654
...for the hand of the Green Maiden.

771
01:22:38,582 --> 01:22:40,691
Let the battle begin.

772
01:22:46,057 --> 01:22:49,166
- Your season is over, old man.
- Never.

773
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:59,471
- I will have her.
- Never have her.

774
01:23:00,371 --> 01:23:01,986
Never.

775
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:07,292
Holly King, I name you the victor.

776
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:10,954
- The Green Maiden is yours.
- M'lady.

777
01:23:12,484 --> 01:23:14,324
Come on.

778
01:23:19,623 --> 01:23:21,264
Elaine.

779
01:23:21,525 --> 01:23:24,496
- You know these people?
- Well, yes, in a way.

780
01:23:24,596 --> 01:23:29,067
All hail, fair lord and lady.
Welcome to our little gathering.

781
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,966
All hail.

782
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:34,657
We are the good people of
the renaissance and medieval players...

783
01:23:34,757 --> 01:23:37,142
...and we are celebrating the mid-summer.

784
01:23:37,242 --> 01:23:38,810
Won't you join us?

785
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:41,818
To be sure, fair consort.

786
01:23:48,686 --> 01:23:52,629
- They are charming, are they not?
- Yes, quite charming.

787
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,293
I see two people in love.

788
01:23:55,393 --> 01:23:57,562
This calls for a wedding.

789
01:23:57,862 --> 01:24:00,799
- A wedding?
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you will.

790
01:24:00,899 --> 01:24:04,373
To honor the Gods of love.

791
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:15,310
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

792
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:19,378
<i>Love will make you feel
like a queen or a king</i>

793
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:23,699
<i>Unicorns, rainbows, lucky charms</i>

794
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:29,000
<i>Await you in your true love's arms</i>

795
01:24:30,889 --> 01:24:35,046
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

796
01:24:35,146 --> 01:24:38,885
<i>Mystical, physical, alchemical</i>

797
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:43,366
<i>We're pretending to be in love today</i>

798
01:24:43,616 --> 01:24:48,174
<i>But pretending is also real</i>

799
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:53,887
<i>There's a lady in a castle</i>

800
01:24:53,987 --> 01:24:56,784
<i>She's sad and so forlorn</i>

801
01:24:57,174 --> 01:25:00,572
<i>When her troubadour returns and kisses her</i>

802
01:25:00,872 --> 01:25:04,155
<i>She's all smiles and laughter</i>

803
01:25:04,255 --> 01:25:07,221
<i>Lady, you're so beautiful</i>

804
01:25:07,321 --> 01:25:10,586
<i>Come lie with me and be my love</i>

805
01:25:10,686 --> 01:25:14,221
<i>I'd slay any dragon, endure any danger</i>

806
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:18,872
<i>Just to have you near me</i>

807
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:23,574
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

808
01:25:23,894 --> 01:25:27,998
<i>Lucky lovers mate in the spring</i>

809
01:25:28,098 --> 01:25:32,007
<i>We sip from goblets full of joy</i>

810
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,334
<i>But when love dies</i>

811
01:25:34,434 --> 01:25:40,002
<i>All life it does destroy</i>

812
01:26:04,857 --> 01:26:06,497
Okay.

813
01:27:28,422 --> 01:27:30,630
Now, ye are wed.

814
01:27:37,048 --> 01:27:40,553
I'm so happy for you, Elaine, he's adorable.

815
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:15,053
<i>I'm not in love.</i>

816
01:28:15,153 --> 01:28:18,756
<i>It's not that I don't have sentiment,
it's just that love is soft.</i>

817
01:28:18,856 --> 01:28:20,925
<i>You need guts in this business.</i>

818
01:28:21,025 --> 01:28:25,662
<i>I've seen guys get shot to death because
they fell in love and got soft inside.</i>

819
01:28:25,762 --> 01:28:29,033
<i>I want an heir some day and then
I would need to have a wife...</i>

820
01:28:29,133 --> 01:28:31,436
<i>...but love is something else.</i>

821
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:33,971
<i>A man can get destroyed by things like that.</i>

822
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:36,441
<i>It's like he's not even a man anymore.</i>

823
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,715
<i>I never wanna get that way.</i>

824
01:28:39,876 --> 01:28:42,180
<i>When you really love him...</i>

825
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:46,851
<i>...it's like fireworks
and nothing else matters.</i>

826
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,454
<i>You love all the little quirks about him.</i>

827
01:28:49,854 --> 01:28:52,262
<i>The way he slurps his cereal.</i>

828
01:28:52,623 --> 01:28:54,826
<i>The way his mouth is a little crooked.</i>

829
01:28:54,926 --> 01:28:58,997
<i>Those details about him
become your whole life.</i>

830
01:28:59,097 --> 01:29:03,400
<i>Something inside you
opens up like a flower...</i>

831
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,971
<i>...and you realize that you
have more love to give...</i>

832
01:29:07,071 --> 01:29:10,040
<i>...than you ever thought was possible.</i>

833
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,849
<i>'Cause the more you know him...</i>

834
01:29:13,944 --> 01:29:16,186
<i>...the more you love him.</i>

835
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:21,019
<i>The more you get to know a woman,
the less you can feel about her.</i>

836
01:29:21,619 --> 01:29:23,721
<i>At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery...</i>

837
01:29:23,821 --> 01:29:26,658
<i>...who fulfills all you're wildest fantasies.</i>

838
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:30,328
<i>Then she starts to reveal little flaws...</i>

839
01:29:30,728 --> 01:29:34,265
<i>...and after a while,
just gets pretty hard to care.</i>

840
01:29:35,165 --> 01:29:38,441
<i>Feminine ideal only exists in a man's mind.</i>

841
01:29:38,969 --> 01:29:41,235
<i>No woman could ever fulfill it.</i>

842
01:29:41,673 --> 01:29:45,217
<i>And sometimes,
when she tries to love you more...</i>

843
01:29:45,317 --> 01:29:47,285
<i>...give you more...</i>

844
01:29:47,885 --> 01:29:50,168
<i>...you feel like you're suffocating...</i>

845
01:29:50,268 --> 01:29:52,455
<i>...drowning in estrogen.</i>

846
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:55,459
<i>The most awful feeling.</i>

847
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,669
Dinner tonight, Griff?

848
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,105
Can't tonight, Connie.

849
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,008
Some other time.

850
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:20,145
Hey, Griff, I got more information
on that Elaine Parks girl.

851
01:30:20,245 --> 01:30:22,380
You leave it on my desk.

852
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,032
- Don't you wanna hear it?
- Steve...

853
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:28,868
- Captain wants us to lay off the case.
- Are you serious?

854
01:30:29,268 --> 01:30:32,223
He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

855
01:30:32,323 --> 01:30:34,659
He says they've lived
in this town a long time...

856
01:30:34,759 --> 01:30:38,435
- ...and he doesn't like to mess with them.
- Even if they murder.

857
01:30:39,629 --> 01:30:42,483
He says he's satisfied that Wayne's
death was a heart attack.

858
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:45,074
I think so too.

859
01:30:48,205 --> 01:30:50,642
Has everyone gone crazy around here?

860
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:53,417
Let me at least tell you what I found.

861
01:30:58,849 --> 01:31:01,619
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store...

862
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:03,754
...in Berkeley with her husband, Jerry.

863
01:31:03,854 --> 01:31:06,991
Two years later they were divorced
and Elaine moved to San Francisco...

864
01:31:07,091 --> 01:31:11,577
...to start dancing at a burlesque club
where she got involved with a witch coven.

865
01:31:20,103 --> 01:31:24,876
The coven broke up after police questioning
when some of it's members died mysteriously.

866
01:31:24,976 --> 01:31:29,714
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose...

867
01:31:29,814 --> 01:31:32,796
...shortly before he was planning to remarry.

868
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:37,332
The police questioned Elaine but they
couldn't find enough to hold her.

869
01:31:37,755 --> 01:31:40,558
Well, if the San Francisco police
couldn't find anything...

870
01:31:40,658 --> 01:31:42,527
...what happened there
is none of our business.

871
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:47,112
Are you serious? I'd say this woman
is a dangerous character...

872
01:31:47,212 --> 01:31:49,275
...and you better watch her.

873
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:53,004
You mean because she's a witch?
That doesn't mean anything.

874
01:31:53,104 --> 01:31:57,306
No, her husband died of a drug
he'd never taken before.

875
01:31:57,406 --> 01:32:00,750
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters got the devil's weed?

876
01:32:01,512 --> 01:32:03,881
I questioned Ms. Curtis about that.

877
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,751
There was devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

878
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:09,267
Apparently, he experimented often with drugs.

879
01:32:09,367 --> 01:32:11,589
Come on, Griff, can't you connect the dots?

880
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:15,527
We have a possible murder here
and Elaine is our only suspect.

881
01:32:15,627 --> 01:32:18,146
I told you, we're laying off her.

882
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:20,648
Because of orders
or because you're in love with her?

883
01:32:20,748 --> 01:32:23,917
Who says I'm in love with her?
Get the hell off my back.

884
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:32,509
You're out of line, Griff, way out of line.

885
01:33:07,645 --> 01:33:09,285
Richard.

886
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:12,905
Richard!

887
01:33:13,618 --> 01:33:15,185
Richard!

888
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:16,926
Richard!

889
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,370
Thank you for meeting me, Elaine.

890
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:07,872
It's not good for me to be alone too much.

891
01:34:08,472 --> 01:34:12,983
- I know you're busy.
- Of course. I wanted to come.

892
01:34:15,178 --> 01:34:18,369
I can't help but blaming myself
for what happened.

893
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:21,518
You can't blame yourself.

894
01:34:21,618 --> 01:34:25,029
You were a good wife to Richard.

895
01:34:25,889 --> 01:34:27,730
I tried to be.

896
01:34:29,693 --> 01:34:32,102
I tried so hard to please him...

897
01:34:32,863 --> 01:34:35,132
...but I should have tried harder.

898
01:34:35,232 --> 01:34:37,761
He wanted a certain type of woman...

899
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:40,456
...someone I could never be.

900
01:34:41,905 --> 01:34:43,947
Maybe you were right.

901
01:34:44,574 --> 01:34:47,417
Maybe you should give a man his fantasy.

902
01:34:49,212 --> 01:34:52,297
I thought that was so awful
when you said that.

903
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,920
Maybe I was being naive...

904
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:59,142
...but I really thought he loved me for me.

905
01:35:00,757 --> 01:35:02,588
But now...

906
01:35:03,623 --> 01:35:05,884
...now I wish...

907
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:10,234
You have to stop torturing yourself.

908
01:35:10,934 --> 01:35:12,981
You have to let go.

909
01:35:13,381 --> 01:35:16,441
Remember how he changed after my Dallas trip?

910
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:20,116
I think that's when he started
having that affair.

911
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:23,296
Whoever she was she drove him crazy.

912
01:35:24,915 --> 01:35:27,951
I hated him so much for that.

913
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:30,324
I wanted to kill them both.

914
01:35:31,188 --> 01:35:35,163
If I ever found out who she was,
I would rip her to pieces.

915
01:35:35,826 --> 01:35:38,569
But now I see I should have helped him.

916
01:35:39,797 --> 01:35:42,675
I didn't know that he was going to...

917
01:35:43,294 --> 01:35:45,535
...take his own life.

918
01:35:51,407 --> 01:35:53,216
Enough about me.

919
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,796
What's going on with you?

920
01:35:56,146 --> 01:35:57,791
Trish...

921
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:00,569
I'm in love.

922
01:36:01,317 --> 01:36:04,449
- Who is he?
- He's a detective...

923
01:36:04,549 --> 01:36:08,598
...and he's everything
a woman could ever want.

924
01:36:09,192 --> 01:36:12,372
He's strong and handsome...

925
01:36:12,472 --> 01:36:14,635
...smart and kind.

926
01:36:15,298 --> 01:36:17,707
I just know that he's the one.

927
01:36:18,802 --> 01:36:21,071
He even gave me this ring.

928
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:23,391
I call it my magic ring.

929
01:36:24,107 --> 01:36:26,571
It's not an engagement ring but...

930
01:36:26,671 --> 01:36:31,086
...I just know that he's gonna
pop the question soon.

931
01:36:44,995 --> 01:36:48,778
When we first came here I showed you
my engagement ring, remember?

932
01:36:51,868 --> 01:36:55,478
I can barely stand to look
at it anymore. It's too painful.

933
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:59,711
I'm sure he's going to ask you soon.

934
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:02,614
You're going to make a beautiful bride.

935
01:37:03,914 --> 01:37:06,122
The first day we met...

936
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:11,755
...you were envious of me because
I had a man and you were all alone.

937
01:37:12,655 --> 01:37:14,731
Now it's the reverse.

938
01:37:16,242 --> 01:37:18,171
Life is funny, isn't it?

939
01:37:20,764 --> 01:37:23,140
Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

940
01:37:23,567 --> 01:37:25,529
Would you like to walk out with me?

941
01:37:27,037 --> 01:37:29,874
No, I'd like to stay and finish my tea.

942
01:37:30,174 --> 01:37:31,781
All right.

943
01:37:34,477 --> 01:37:36,319
Take care, love.

944
01:38:16,586 --> 01:38:20,291
Hi, Elaine, it's me.
Yeah, you left your ring here.

945
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:23,661
You're probably driving
but I'll drop it by on my way home.

946
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:25,635
See you in a minute.

947
01:43:48,518 --> 01:43:50,374
You bitch.

948
01:43:51,788 --> 01:43:53,749
You killed my husband.

949
01:43:57,993 --> 01:44:02,099
Bitch, skank, whore.

950
01:44:13,977 --> 01:44:16,018
You'll burn for this.

951
01:44:25,622 --> 01:44:28,764
Crash, crash, crash.

952
01:44:29,358 --> 01:44:33,621
Die, die, die.

953
01:45:22,245 --> 01:45:25,431
Habondia, bind these two...

954
01:45:25,531 --> 01:45:27,668
...with a heady lovers' brew.

955
01:45:28,418 --> 01:45:31,121
Even should they strive to flee...

956
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:34,229
...they'll cling for all eternity.

957
01:45:45,535 --> 01:45:47,175
Scotch.

958
01:46:03,402 --> 01:46:05,244
Bottle o' beer, Sam.

959
01:46:12,095 --> 01:46:14,130
Who are those new girls?

960
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:16,606
They can't dance at all.

961
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,707
And they're weird.

962
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:26,492
I don't know,
but the customers really like 'em.

963
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:31,682
They're friends of the witches.
I seen them come in together before.

964
01:46:31,782 --> 01:46:34,856
Yeah, the witches.

965
01:46:35,784 --> 01:46:37,259
They're everywhere.

966
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:40,321
- One gin and tonic, Sam.
- Gin and tonic coming up.

967
01:46:41,357 --> 01:46:44,862
Did you read about the teacher
buried in the back yard of his cabin?

968
01:46:44,962 --> 01:46:46,931
They said it was dug by the witches.

969
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:51,735
Yeah, I read about that. They found all
sorts of witchcraft things on the grave.

970
01:46:51,835 --> 01:46:53,954
Yeah, I heard about that, too.

971
01:46:54,404 --> 01:46:56,044
Creepy.

972
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:15,064
Sit down, Elaine.

973
01:47:22,331 --> 01:47:26,374
Elaine, the DNA came back from the lab.

974
01:47:27,837 --> 01:47:30,058
It connects you with Wayne Peters.

975
01:47:33,143 --> 01:47:37,453
Patricia Manning came by the station.
Some things of yours.

976
01:47:39,515 --> 01:47:41,356
Including this.

977
01:47:42,918 --> 01:47:46,129
She said you drove her husband to suicide.

978
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,228
So I was a bad girl.

979
01:47:52,528 --> 01:47:54,604
Are you going to punish me?

980
01:47:56,732 --> 01:47:59,009
What sort of person are you, Elaine?

981
01:47:59,803 --> 01:48:03,407
What sort of sick mind would do such things?

982
01:48:03,507 --> 01:48:05,809
Why are you so negative?

983
01:48:05,909 --> 01:48:07,911
I didn't kill anyone.

984
01:48:08,311 --> 01:48:10,947
Wayne died of heart failure...

985
01:48:11,047 --> 01:48:13,984
...after a beautiful night of lovemaking.

986
01:48:14,684 --> 01:48:18,555
And Richard died
because he loved me too much.

987
01:48:18,655 --> 01:48:21,364
These men weren't used
to the deep feelings of love...

988
01:48:21,464 --> 01:48:23,584
...that they were experiencing with me.

989
01:48:23,684 --> 01:48:26,496
Are you saying these men died of love?

990
01:48:26,596 --> 01:48:30,634
That's insane.
What about the spells and the drugs?

991
01:48:31,402 --> 01:48:34,104
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

992
01:48:34,204 --> 01:48:38,041
Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

993
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:40,918
It can only work with what's already there.

994
01:48:41,218 --> 01:48:44,381
I just use sex magic to create love magic.

995
01:48:44,481 --> 01:48:47,340
I didn't know how strong the spells would be.

996
01:48:48,285 --> 01:48:51,172
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

997
01:48:51,421 --> 01:48:53,061
Love?

998
01:48:54,122 --> 01:48:56,165
What do you know about love?

999
01:48:56,593 --> 01:49:00,764
What you call love is a borderline
personality disorder.

1000
01:49:01,564 --> 01:49:03,099
Or worse.

1001
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,074
Don't diagnose me.

1002
01:49:05,718 --> 01:49:08,895
Maybe you're a narcissist who can't love.

1003
01:49:10,206 --> 01:49:12,375
You think that I'm sick...

1004
01:49:12,475 --> 01:49:14,912
...because you've never loved like I have.

1005
01:49:16,012 --> 01:49:19,414
Well, I would do anything for love.

1006
01:49:20,483 --> 01:49:24,452
That's right, you'll never get enough love.

1007
01:49:25,354 --> 01:49:28,492
Even when a man loves you
so much it kills him...

1008
01:49:28,592 --> 01:49:32,396
...it's not enough for you.
You're like a bottomless hole.

1009
01:49:33,196 --> 01:49:36,928
You doll yourself up and do
the Stepford wife thing...

1010
01:49:37,028 --> 01:49:40,604
...thinking every man is going
to fall at your feet.

1011
01:49:40,704 --> 01:49:44,324
But your creepy little sexy act...

1012
01:49:44,424 --> 01:49:46,274
...doesn't work with me.

1013
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:49,418
I don't love you.

1014
01:49:55,317 --> 01:49:59,481
How can you stand there and boast
about being immune to love?

1015
01:50:00,023 --> 01:50:04,100
Why does the genuine love
of a woman scare you so much?

1016
01:50:04,728 --> 01:50:08,065
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1017
01:50:08,165 --> 01:50:10,767
I know a lot of women
who feel the way that I do.

1018
01:50:11,267 --> 01:50:15,655
Only men make us work so hard for your love.

1019
01:50:16,539 --> 01:50:18,599
If you would just...

1020
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:21,072
...love us for ourselves...

1021
01:50:23,078 --> 01:50:24,753
...but you won't.

1022
01:50:25,748 --> 01:50:28,649
My ex-husband was just like you.

1023
01:50:29,285 --> 01:50:32,462
He used to punish me
by withholding his love from me.

1024
01:50:33,957 --> 01:50:38,361
All my life I've been tossed
in the garbage...

1025
01:50:38,461 --> 01:50:41,889
...except when men wanted to use my body.

1026
01:50:43,165 --> 01:50:46,264
So, I decided to find my own power.

1027
01:50:46,936 --> 01:50:50,013
And I found that power through witchcraft.

1028
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:54,311
That means that I take
what I need from men...

1029
01:50:54,411 --> 01:50:56,688
...and not the other way around.

1030
01:50:59,615 --> 01:51:01,690
I'm sorry, Elaine.

1031
01:51:03,836 --> 01:51:05,845
It won't work this time.

1032
01:51:06,989 --> 01:51:09,759
I'm afraid I'm going to have to arrest you.

1033
01:51:09,859 --> 01:51:11,666
What for?

1034
01:51:12,395 --> 01:51:14,932
Marrying a lover according to my religion?

1035
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,590
Seducing a married man?

1036
01:51:18,567 --> 01:51:22,535
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned for a thing like that...

1037
01:51:22,635 --> 01:51:24,574
...but not today.

1038
01:51:26,942 --> 01:51:30,150
No, not burned...

1039
01:51:31,563 --> 01:51:34,948
...but you'll be booked for burying
Wayne Peters illegally.

1040
01:51:36,918 --> 01:51:39,077
And we'll find out more.

1041
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:43,799
That's the witch who killed the teacher.

1042
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,597
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

1043
01:51:52,736 --> 01:51:54,839
- Burn the witch.
- Burn the witch.

1044
01:51:54,939 --> 01:51:58,399
Burn the witch, burn the witch,
burn the witch.

1045
01:51:58,499 --> 01:52:03,008
Burn the witch, burn the witch,
burn the witch, burn the witch.

1046
01:52:49,793 --> 01:52:52,633
- Burn her!
- Burn.

1047
01:53:16,652 --> 01:53:18,228
Poor baby.

1048
01:53:18,954 --> 01:53:21,796
Poor, poor baby.

1049
01:53:26,295 --> 01:53:30,705
Don't worry, everything will be okay...

1050
01:53:31,667 --> 01:53:35,542
...because I love you so much.

1051
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:06,501
I love you, Elaine.

1052
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:09,671
I love you, Elaine.

1053
01:55:11,033 --> 01:55:12,874
I love you, Elaine.

1054
01:56:24,023 --> 01:56:25,898
I love you, Elaine.

1055
01:56:27,259 --> 01:56:29,689
I've never loved anyone but you.

1056
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:32,754
I want to marry you.

1057
01:56:33,305 --> 01:57:33,907
