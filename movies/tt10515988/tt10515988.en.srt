3
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,724
Can you see it?

4
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,627
Uh, yeah, a little,
but it looks good.

5
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,997
- All right, can you slate for me?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,267
All right,
whenever you're ready.

7
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,569
Mmm, okay.

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:58,975
Uh, we are here in the beautiful
Denny's in Scottsdale, Arizona,

9
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:04,180
and I am about to meet my first
biological relative, Samuel.

10
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,982
- Samuel.
- Samuel.

11
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,085
You gonna tell them about all the
drunken nights here at this booth?

12
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,056
- You do not... You keep your mouth shut.
- Grand Slam.

13
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:14,290
I think that's him.

14
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:17,593
- You think that's him?
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:24,067
Yeah, he's trying to pay the
Uber with cash. That's definitely him.

16
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,008
- Samuel?
- Yeah, it's me.

17
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,176
Margot.

18
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,378
Cool.

19
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,746
- Wow.
- Wow.

20
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,817
- Oh, this is crazy. Sorry.
- No, no, I'm...

21
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,986
uh, at a loss for words
myself.

22
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,790
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,593
Is that...

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,129
- Yeah, it's Chris.
- Hey. How you doing?

25
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,166
So, you said that
this is gonna be a documentary?

26
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:02,171
Yeah. It's weird. I never thought I
would ever do anything about myself.

27
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,807
Feels kind of
self-indulgent,

28
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,311
but Chris
pushed me to do it.

29
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,246
Her story's too good.

30
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:12,982
- Some waters for you.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,586
Thank you.

32
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,890
I've actually, uh,
never, uh, been...

33
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,894
in front of a camera before.

34
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,630
Any camera?

35
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,832
- Yeah.
- What?

36
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,637
Yeah, we're typically not supposed to
be, um... photographed,

37
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,573
'cause, you know,
uh, vanity is a sin.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,041
Ah. Right, right.

39
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,378
But there are exceptions,
if our elders condone it.

40
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,581
Yeah, you had said on the phone
that you left the community.

41
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,649
- Right?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,051
And how long ago
has it been?

43
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,521
About...

44
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,491
seven months, I think.

45
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,727
Is this weird
for your adopted parents?

46
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,631
It is, but could I have gone
on living the rest of my life

47
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,200
not finding out
who my real family was?

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,102
Yeah, it'd be fine,

49
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:12,775
but I think for a lot of us people who
have been given up by their parents,

50
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,744
there's always
something missing.

51
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:22,585
Anyway, to find out where I come
from would be really special for me.

52
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,353
Absolutely.

53
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,955
Hopefully I can help.

54
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,559
How do you even meet
an Amish dude on 23andMe?

55
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,628
- Isn't that against the rules?
- He's on his <i>Rumspringa.</i>

56
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,463
- What's that?
- It's basically like a year

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,066
where they get to see the
outside world for themselves.

58
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,136
So he was floating around,
you know, taking odd jobs.

59
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:43,706
Then he meets this woman
and builds her a pen...

60
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,841
Chicken coop.

61
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,676
Thank you. Chicken coop.
Correct.

62
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:50,613
- Basically, she becomes obsessed with him.
- More of a cat-lady type, yeah.

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,448
Do you wanna
tell the story?

64
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:55,218
- My bad, my bad. I'm sorry.
- 'Cause you can if you want.

65
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,821
Anyway, so basically
she's bragging to him

66
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,858
about how she's 25% Cherokee
or whatever

67
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,493
and tells him about
the online DNA test you can do.

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,364
So he gets one,
gets a match... it's me.

69
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:10,499
She's Amish.

70
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,668
- I am not Amish.
- You are Amish.

71
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,970
Not how that works.

72
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,373
You got this from the hospital?

73
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:22,512
I can't believe anyone would just
abandon their baby like that.

74
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,248
This must have been
so intense for you.

75
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:30,253
Yeah, I've probably watched
that video over a hundred times,

76
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,755
and I get a new question
every time I watch it.

77
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:35,758
Like, why did she do it?

78
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,263
Why did she drive so far
away just to abandon me?

79
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,568
Is she even still alive?
You know.

80
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:51,540
What I think is weird about it
is the way that she's holding me.

81
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:55,044
Like, looking around
like she's scared.

82
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:59,949
Maybe she was just worried
she was gonna get caught.

83
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:03,552
- Guilt, yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, that's what I think.

84
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,321
Maybe.

85
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,889
I don't know.

86
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,936
<i>Attention,
all passengers in the baggage claim area.</i>

87
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,939
<i>Delta would like to welcome you
to Buffalo, New York.</i>

88
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,345
- My signature shot.
- Spaz.

89
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,681
Here, I got it.

90
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,316
Damn. Kid is strong.

91
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:36,752
You know, farm labor.
You get used to moving heavy stuff.

92
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,989
- Thanks.
- What is this stuff?

93
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:40,990
Magic, baby.

94
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,326
Lipstick cam,
drone, LEDs.

95
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:47,163
- We're not fucking around over here.
- Yeah, clearly not. Okay.

96
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:51,500
Uh, our sound guy said
he'd be in a green van.

97
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:52,568
Oh. Right there.

98
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:53,703
Hey.

99
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,104
Yes.

100
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,579
- Hey.
- Hey... Oh.

101
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,881
Airport. Sorry, mask.
I got it. Sick.

102
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:11,654
- Hey.
- Are you Dale?

103
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,755
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm Margot.

104
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,358
- This is Chris, our DP.
- Hey.

105
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:16,892
- This is Sam.
- Hey. Dale, Sam.

106
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,961
- Thank you so much for picking up the van.
- Of course.

107
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,730
Let's get you guys
loaded up.

108
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,032
It was his first flight ever,
actually.

109
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,500
- First flight ever?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:25,634
- Yeah.
- No shit!

111
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,070
That's a great camera.

112
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,578
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- Yeah, thank you.

113
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:39,015
- We all got tested. Are you okay if we...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,584
I got COVID,
like, five times.

115
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,285
All good, baby.

116
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:44,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

117
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,990
I mean, it was diagnosed once,
but I think I kept getting it after that.

118
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:51,093
Yeah, I don't know.
My body is weird, but I'm alive.

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,396
Seriously, thank you so much
for getting us there.

120
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:56,165
Yeah, of course. I had nothing going
on, so this is great for me.

121
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,035
There's so
much more snow up here.

122
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,303
Oh, yeah.
Weather changes every day.

123
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,906
One day you got snow,
next it's slush.

124
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,941
That's why you gotta do
these zip off...

125
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,077
I do all my pants
with zip offs, so it's...

126
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,479
You got pants.
Oh, it's too hot out?

127
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,448
Now you got shorts, baby.

128
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,619
I'll show you when we get in.
I'll throw the legs on, dude. It rules.

129
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,222
And I gotta say, easy access for
the ladies, if you know what I mean.

130
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,192
- Okay.
- Hey, look at that.

131
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:25,428
What?

132
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,141
What's going
through your head?

133
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,645
I'm nervous, but excited.

134
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,400
Okay,
so just past the barn here.

135
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,734
The turnoff here.

136
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,871
- You have any service here?
- Uh, nope.

137
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,307
Yeah, me either.

138
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,775
Christ.

139
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,343
Slow, slow, slow.

140
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay,
and you can stop here.

141
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,884
- Okay.
- Wow, it's so cute.

142
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,420
Oh, um...

143
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,556
You guys, actually,
just give me a second here.

144
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,391
I'll be back
in one second.

145
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:00,789
Samuel!

146
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,992
Eli, go back
in the house.

147
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:05,961
Oh, God.

148
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,467
That doesn't look great.

149
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:17,406
Okay.

150
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,949
All right, guys, uh...

151
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:29,852
bad news.

152
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,527
So you didn't think to call ahead
and let them know we were coming?

153
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:42,398
They're fucking Amish, dude.
They don't have a phone.

154
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:43,599
Oh.

155
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,267
- Right.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,038
Two beds.

157
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,142
Okay, we're gonna
have to figure that out.

158
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,277
Goddamn.

159
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,279
You gotta teach me how you do this.
Do you have a system?

160
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,784
Yeah, just make a list, account for it,
make sure you put it in the right spot.

161
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,887
That blue one actually goes
right there in that corner.

162
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,121
- There you go.
- Awesome.

163
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,591
Yeah, you know,
it's pretty easy.

164
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:10,826
Man! GoPro.

165
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,695
These rule.
Love these.

166
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:16,098
You can get them filthy, you can toss
them around, you can get them wet.

167
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,668
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you can do...

168
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:22,972
Yeah, you can do a lot with the GoPros.
Yeah, you're right.

169
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:30,679
You missed it.

170
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:35,217
I mean, like, maybe this is
gonna be a process. You know?

171
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:40,289
Maybe Sam can go back tomorrow
and try again.

172
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,658
I mean, he left 'em.

173
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,793
- They probably don't even want him back.
- Shh.

174
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,262
- Stop.
- I'm just saying.

175
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,998
- Keep your voice down.
- We might have to adopt him.

176
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,166
He's right there.
Can you chill?

177
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,040
We'll figure it out.

178
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,483
What was that?

179
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:20,262
- Mm-mmm.
- Oh. Oh.

180
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:22,164
Gentlemen first, okay?

181
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,537
- Did you leave that open?
- No.

182
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,018
You're such a scaredy-cat.

183
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,486
It's adorable.

184
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:47,556
Oh, gosh.

185
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,264
Eli, what are you
doing here?

186
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,912
Here. I got it.

187
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,487
- Uh, may I?
- Oh, no, it's okay. Thank you.

188
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:22,858
Oh, hi, puppy.

189
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,196
Sorry.

190
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,564
This way.

191
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,875
All right, I'm this way.
So you guys sleep tight.

192
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,111
I'll be, uh, in there.

193
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,012
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

194
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,349
- Your room is over here.
- What the fuck?

195
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,156
Wow.

196
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,592
Oh, it's beautiful.

197
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:59,061
There's more wood
by the stove.

198
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,863
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Okay.

199
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,432
- Good night.
- It's perfect. Thank you so much.

200
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,803
Hey, Jacob, actually, um...

201
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:12,141
- Thank you. That means so much.
- Good night.

202
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:20,816
Okay.
So, what'd he say?

203
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,788
He said, "Thank you so much
for bringing Eli home,"

204
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:30,092
and he's really grateful,
so we can stay for a couple of days.

205
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,327
- With our cameras?
- He said, "Okay."

206
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,396
Hey! Yes!

207
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,733
It's so weird,
like, I was so...

208
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,704
I mean, it was the first people I've
ever seen who are related to me.

209
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,608
- Yeah, that's your family.
- I was wondering if we'd look alike.

210
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,978
Dale,
you don't fit on the bed.

211
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,713
Oh, yeah.

212
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,483
I'm used to it.
I sleep on a full at home.

213
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,619
Why do you sleep on a full?
You're, like, 6'7".

214
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,389
I share a room with my mom,
and she takes the queen.

215
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,925
- You sleep with your mom?
- Yeah, yeah.

216
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,626
She lives with me, so...

217
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:05,861
I don't... Yeah.

218
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,131
- What?
- That's sweet.

219
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,336
Chris?

220
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,871
- Chris?
- What?

221
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,172
Look.

222
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,443
What's up?

223
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:32,855
What the hell?
It's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

224
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,523
Are those people?

225
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,964
Yeah, I hope so.

226
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,699
I mean,
what else could it be?

227
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,435
It's like they're going
into the forest.

228
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,677
What the fuck?

229
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,884
That was weird.

230
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,868
I got some cool
B-roll this morning.

231
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,939
Froot Loops.

232
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,475
Did you know that
they could eat Froot Loops?

233
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,077
It's cereal,
dude, not a computer.

234
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:31,847
- Hey.
- You don't have to do this.

235
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:35,517
I love your dress. It's so pretty.
Did you make that?

236
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,120
No. It's from Walmart.

237
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:39,855
Do you have TikTok?

238
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:43,458
- Uh, no, not on my phone.
- I do. I gotta show you this video I made.

239
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,395
Mary, stop ruching around.

240
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,401
Sorry, Levina.
Sorry, sorry.

241
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,835
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

242
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,539
Sorry. Just trying to
give you some local flair.

243
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:58,941
It means, "How are you?"

244
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,176
- Hi!
- Hi, Eli.

245
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,578
What's up, dude?

246
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,046
Um...

247
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:06,315
Hey, Eli. Eli.

248
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:11,520
So do you all have any plans
for the day, or...

249
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,291
Um, we would love to see
the rest of your home.

250
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,026
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

251
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,597
I know the elders like Jacob
can feel kind of intense,

252
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,498
but as long as you stick with
me, you'll be fine.

253
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,168
Don't approach anybody in the community
without asking their permission.

254
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,771
Everybody's really nice,
but they can be a little shy.

255
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:34,042
Um... Oh, the woods, I would avoid those.
We get bears.

256
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,980
And I'll be with you, but they get
kind of violent during the winter.

257
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:41,617
Actually, we saw some people going
into the woods last night, super late.

258
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,353
Yeah, that was
probably a hunting party.

259
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,289
Somebody's cow
got attacked, so...

260
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,424
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,396
I feel like everyone
seems relatively young.

262
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,933
So how long
has the family been here?

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,903
A long time.
About 200 years, I think.

264
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,573
- 200 years?
- Yeah.

265
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,541
Watch the fire here.

266
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,577
So this is the workshop.

267
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:12,981
- Fix horseshoes, equipment, wheels.
- Wow.

268
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,450
Work 'em young.

269
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,686
Yeah,
everyone has a purpose.

270
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,055
He's not used to strangers.
Come on.

271
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,926
Where did my mom live
when she was here?

272
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,330
I think she was in the room above yours,
but we just use it as storage now.

273
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,598
Oh.

274
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,034
- You wanna see the barn?
- Yeah.

275
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,338
Oh, my gosh, there's so many cows.

276
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,909
- What's all the bags?
- Uh, it's salt.

277
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,111
You know, for the animals
and ice.

278
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,382
- Are those pigs? Stop.
- Also got some pigs.

279
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:49,918
Come on.

280
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,853
- There's pigs.
- Okay, come on over.

281
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,422
Guys, get in.

282
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,457
- They really like...
- Dale, get in.

283
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,025
No, you don't have to
get the shot.

284
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,594
Just, you have to
experience the pigs, okay?

285
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,531
You could put your boom mic...
Yeah.

286
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,633
Yeah, g-get his dialogue.

287
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,334
- Stop.
- Hey, what's the scoop?

288
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:09,971
- Sir, what's the scoop?
- I gotta get a shot of these guys too.

289
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,474
- It's too cute.
- Do they all have...

290
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,410
How do I say this?
Like, nice butts like that?

291
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:20,282
- You guys wanna see the loft?
- Yes.

292
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:25,020
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, my God, Sam.

293
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,255
- It's pretty cool, right?
- It's huge.

294
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:30,258
Well, we got a lot of animals to
feed, especially during the winter.

295
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,561
- It's beautiful.
- You're gonna do my job too?

296
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,263
- You're in the center of my frame.
- That's what we're doing?

297
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,034
- Shit, man.
- Okay.

298
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,669
Sorry. You okay?

299
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,437
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry. There's a bale drop there.

300
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,240
- You gotta be careful.
- That wouldn't have been too good.

301
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,742
Shish kebab, you know?

302
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,677
- I wasn't paying any attention.
- It's okay.

303
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,479
There's lots of holes
around here.

304
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:53,248
- Let's get you away from that.
- I'm a klutz. Thank you.

305
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,950
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

306
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,119
- Let's get down from this height.
- Is there a restroom?

307
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,554
I kind of peed a little when she...

308
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,498
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

309
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:11,333
I'm Margot.

310
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,535
I don't think I've met you guys
yet, but, yeah, we've met.

311
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,203
- That's Clara.
- Clara, hi.

312
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,239
- And Grace.
- A dog!

313
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,573
He's so cute.

314
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,641
How old are you guys?

315
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,643
- I'm 16.
- Sixteen?

316
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,112
Are you...
You're all 16?

317
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,582
Yeah, so you guys are way too
young to have known my mom.

318
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,786
But your parents,
do they ever talk about her?

319
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,755
My mom said Sarah hooked up
with an Englishman.

320
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,824
- Clara.
- Everyone knows it.

321
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,093
An Englishman?

322
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,529
Just means someone
outside the community.

323
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,966
Oh, so, like...
like, a local?

324
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,738
Um, does anybody know who he was?

325
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,812
So she got pregnant
with an outsider?

326
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:59,614
So I imagine that didn't
go over very well.

327
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:01,650
We have a lot of work to do.

328
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:05,687
We'll get in trouble if we don't get to it.
Right, Clara?

329
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:07,689
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Excuse us.

330
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,655
- Amen.
- Amen.

331
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:46,494
We have a saying.

332
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:51,233
"The storm may scatter a thousand
leaves, but the tree grows anew."

333
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,104
We are humbled and grateful to have
our sister, Margot, returned to us.

334
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,607
The Lord's will unfolds,

335
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:03,678
and we accept the obligations and
the sacrifices that he expects of us.

336
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,848
Eh.

337
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:10,418
Uh, thank you so much for
allowing us into your home.

338
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,754
I am so grateful.

339
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:14,723
Seriously. Um...

340
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,559
I've always hoped
that I could meet you all,

341
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:21,029
so this is a really
special moment for me.

342
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,931
So thank you.

343
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:26,534
Dude.

344
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,837
I thought it was
a clap moment.

345
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:32,774
Begin.

346
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,944
I'd have some, but...

347
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,983
Oh, right.
Right, right, right.

348
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,619
They tend to the chickens.

349
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,821
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

350
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,115
Jacob definitely
has a thing for you.

351
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,883
- What?
- He's always staring at you.

352
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,719
- Don't be gross.
- What's wrong with this thing?

353
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:52,320
Nothing's charging.

354
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:55,223
- It's old. Just wiggle it.
- That's what she said.

355
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,858
Stupid.

356
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:01,997
I actually thought it was really
sweet the way everyone was so present.

357
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,665
What, you wanna join 'em?

358
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:06,034
No, but I mean,
when is the last time

359
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:09,437
that you went to dinner
and didn't look at your phone?

360
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,474
Tonight.

361
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,942
Exactly.

362
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,148
Dude, close it.
It's freezing.

363
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,385
I don't hear the genny.

364
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,353
And it's snowing again.

365
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,958
I'd fix it,
but I'm already in my cammies.

366
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,263
It's dark dark.

367
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,734
"Cammies."

368
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:41,936
It's coming down.

369
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:04,759
Shit.

370
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:12,967
Oh, shit!

371
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,205
Bitch-ass scarecrow.

372
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,377
Ain't even no crows out here.

373
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:32,353
Fuck.

374
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,401
Come on, baby,
don't do this to me now.

375
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,758
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,293
Kid, you scared me.

377
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,435
Sleepwalker.

378
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,238
He does it from time to time.

379
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:25,707
Lucky you were out here.

380
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:27,108
Yeah.
Our generator died.

381
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:30,378
Come back inside.
The cold will bite you.

382
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,082
Weird.

383
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,687
My head is killing me.

384
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:44,025
- What's up with that?
- Barometric pressure.

385
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:48,663
It's like altitude sickness, only
your body's reacting to the clean air.

386
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,500
Dale, you are an encyclopedia
of random information.

387
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,902
Thank you.

388
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:00,441
Did you hear that sound again last
night, like someone walking in the attic?

389
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:03,244
- No, I was knocked out.
- Same.

390
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,290
Dale, you're completely insane.

391
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:18,493
Come on.
The makeover maketh the man.

392
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,595
- That's what she said, right?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,964
Yeah.

394
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,739
Yes, Dale!

395
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,909
Hee-hee! Oh?

396
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,244
What do we think?

397
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,446
You guys know that dance?
A little moonwalk.

398
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,982
Yeah, do the dance.
Come on, everybody!

399
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,617
Everybody, dance with me.

400
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,320
Hello, hello.

401
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,423
Suits you.

402
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,960
<i>♪ Yesterday birds away ♪</i>

403
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,095
<i>♪ Winter's come
Time to pray ♪</i>

404
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,265
- Let's go talk to 'em.
- Yeah.

405
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:00,034

407
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:09,110
See, that's slow motion. It's getting
a whole bunch of frames for one second.

408
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,279
A thousand pictures,
one second.

409
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:14,782
So it gets, like, the little
details, intricacies of you.

410
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:18,720
The water splashing up right there.
Stuff the human eye can't see.

411
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,021
Mmm.

412
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:27,061
I like your doll.

413
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:32,600
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

414
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,539
- That's a pretty name.
- Thanks.

415
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:43,378
You know,
that was my mom's name.

416
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,680
She used to live here
a long time ago.

417
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,548
She's still here.

418
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,887
- What did you say?
- She doesn't like you.

419
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,990
Who doesn't like me?

420
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,493
Wait, y...

421
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:03,264
She just left
her doll like that?

422
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:19,013
What is that?

423
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:42,036
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and somebody's up there again.

424
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:44,472
Third night in a row.

425
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:51,212
Oh, fuck.

426
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,147
Door's open.

427
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,104
Oh, fuck.

428
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,240
Creepy.

429
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,591
What the fuck?

430
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:33,875
What?

431
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,229
No fucking way.

432
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,632
What is that?

433
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:03,397
Hello?

434
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:13,574
Hello?

435
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,290
You gotta be kidding me.

436
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:10,791
Fuck.

437
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,428
How do I get out of here?

438
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay.

439
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,145
Fuck.

440
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,383
God.

441
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,560
This is gonna be interesting.

442
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,907
- What was it?
- I don't know.

443
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,676
I mean, it looks
like a face, right?

444
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,779
It's gotta be something else.

445
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:07,681
I mean, a lens distortion.

446
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,251
- A lens distortion?
- Mmm.

447
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:14,021
Fucking...
See, this is... No.

448
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,424
This is why I don't like creepy old farms.
They're always haunted.

449
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,326
Dale, keep your voice down.

450
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:22,429
I'm serious. Look at this place.
Tell me it's not fucking haunted.

451
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,231
Really.

452
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:27,902
My cousin Greg saw a ghost in the
walk-in freezer at a Cracker Barrel.

453
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:30,871
What was he going in
the walk-in freezer for?

454
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,908
- He worked there.
- Okay.

455
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:39,013
Are you really
buying this shit?

456
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,449
I mean, I felt
something up there with me.

457
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:45,553
Okay.

458
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,823
So, we're ghost hunters now.
Is that it?

459
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:51,392
'Cause I thought I signed up
for a prestige documentary,

460
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,427
not a fringy
ghost-farm cable show.

461
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:55,262
It's not funny, Chris.
It's not.

462
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,301
I mean, like, the letter,
the creepy drawing.

463
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:04,338
And then the little girl saying, "She's still here."

464
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,974
I mean,
something is going on,

465
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:11,011
and it feels like it has
something to do with my mom.

466
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,881
Yeah, right over there.
That'd be great.

467
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:18,252
You're set. Sorry, just making sure that...
Doesn't matter if you can see it, right?

468
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,488
Dale,
two steps back.

469
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:23,390
Looks good.

470
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:25,826
Do I just start?

471
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,462
- Yeah, when you're ready.
- Mmm.

472
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:34,668
Sarah was, um...

473
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,706
Sarah was our wildflower.

474
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,009
A nonconformist

475
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:46,881
growing up in a community
whose bedrock is homogeneity.

476
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,282
And, uh...

477
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,619
Uh...

478
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,220
But the, uh...

479
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:57,291
I mean, what...

480
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,795
What we all saw as spunky
and free-spirited

481
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,231
when she was
a little girl, um...

482
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:11,805
i-it evolved into
something much darker.

483
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:15,976
There were several attempts
to take her own life.

484
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,144
What?

485
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,547
When that didn't work,
she got pregnant.

486
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:25,286
It was... It was a boy from town.
She wouldn't tell us who.

487
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:29,590
I...

488
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,095
I suspect she did it
purely out of spite,

489
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:40,567
as a way to...
to rail against our ways

490
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,136
and our rules.

491
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:44,972
And, uh, that worked.

492
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,608
She was shunned.

493
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:49,176
Shunned.

494
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,613
What, like, sent away?

495
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,682
No, no.

496
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:58,319
Shunning is being separated
from the flock.

497
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,258
You eat alone, you work alone,
you sleep alone.

498
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:08,963
And that's...
And that is painful, trust me.

499
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,004
I suppose it could be
what drove her away in the end.

500
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:27,047
I found this letter
in my mom's room.

501
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:40,294
You were in the attic
last night.

502
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,030
What did she mean
when she said,

503
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,366
"You can't have me
or my baby"?

504
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:54,508
We don't allow children
out of wedlock.

505
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:59,279
Sarah was required to give her baby to
another wedded couple in the community.

506
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:05,185
- She was forced to give me away?
- That's right.

507
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,825
That's horrible.

508
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:16,030
More horrible than leaving
a newborn on the ground,

509
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,832
on the sidewalk
like a piece of trash?

510
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,502
I loved Sarah.

511
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:25,039
She was my only daughter,
but she cared for nobody but herself.

512
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:28,742
That was her sickness.

513
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,881
I get it.

514
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:36,984
It's shitty
what they did to her.

515
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,386
Yeah.

516
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:52,433
But I mean, she did the
right thing though, right?

517
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,438
'Cause otherwise I would
have been stuck here forever.

518
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:00,741
For sure.

519
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,850
I ke...

520
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,119
I keep thinking
about that little girl.

521
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,123
What she said the other day.

522
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,932
I have this...

523
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,469
weird feeling
she's still here,

524
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:32,406
in the pit of my stomach,
ever since I got here.

525
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:36,009
I can't put my finger on it.

526
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,093
All right, not much further.

527
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,529
The drone made it seem
like it was right over here.

528
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:33,734
I think I would do, like,
a spaghetti with meatballs right now.

529
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,602
Are you that hungry?

530
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:38,172
Would you guys eat human?

531
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:40,374
No, I would never eat a human.

532
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,745
I would eat a person faster than
I'd like to admit, to be honest.

533
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,513
Well, that's noted.

534
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,316
Look up though.
Look at that.

535
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:50,817
Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh!

536
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:55,055
How far away
are we supposed to go?

537
00:42:56,823 --> 00:42:58,492
Whoa.

538
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,062
Right?
That's what I've been telling you about.

539
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,964
So it's a church.
Whoopee.

540
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:08,001
Yeah, but why would they
build a church all the way back here?

541
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,570
It's like a mile away.

542
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:12,005
Gotta be where they
were going the other night.

543
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,575
Bears, my ass.

544
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:17,978
That means a lot of
people walking through here.

545
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,480
- Be careful.
- Watch your step.

546
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:21,949
Yeah.

547
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:28,422
<i>"So weit nicht weiter."</i>

548
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:30,791
Anyone speak German?

549
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:32,793
Yeah, it says, um,

550
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,895
"Sweet, nice wiener."

551
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:39,399
Man.

552
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:45,372
- Can you pick a lock?
- Of course. I'm Black.

553
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:50,310
Move aside,
please.

554
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,347
No way.

555
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:57,084
Yeah, cousin Greg used to
boost stuff all the time.

556
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,219
- You know, TVs, cars, whatever.
- Sorry.

557
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,721
Cousin Greg's busy.

558
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:03,557
Cousin Greg
is in prison.

559
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,092
Voilà.

560
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:09,129
No, no, stop!

561
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:12,699
This is a house of worship.
It's off limits to you. No cameras!

562
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:14,468
Sorry. Yeah.

563
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:17,004
- Can we go inside without the cameras?
- No, I'm sorry.

564
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,639
It's not permitted.

565
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:23,010
Lunch is ready back at the house.
Come with me.

566
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,612
Yes. Thanks.

567
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,483
What are we doing?
Like a schnitzel thing, or a sausage?

568
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,186
Is that offensive?
I don't know if that's stereotyping.

569
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,663
Not for me, not for me.

570
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:45,299
Thank you so much.

571
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:47,934
There seems to be
a little more.

572
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,470
Dale, save some
for everyone else.

573
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:52,739
Oh, yeah, sorry.

574
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:54,308
Dude.

575
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,097
Hey,
mind if I film you for a moment?

576
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,841
Fuck.

577
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:29,176
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, my gosh.

578
00:45:29,242 --> 00:45:31,478
Fetch me the first-aid kit.

579
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:04,945
What is that?

580
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:10,584
No way.

581
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,041
Shh-shh-shh.

582
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:37,077
- What's wrong?
- Shh. Listen.

583
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:38,512
What?

584
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:43,216
What is that?

585
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,186
I don't know.

586
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,160
What is that?

587
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:57,697
Turn the light off.

588
00:46:57,764 --> 00:47:00,434
- They're gonna see it. Turn it off.
- Okay, right.

589
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:15,315
What?

590
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:36,803
Hey, let's just go back.

591
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:41,341
Or get closer.

592
00:47:49,683 --> 00:47:52,118
I can't see shit.

593
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:54,387
Go upstairs.

594
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:05,332
Hold her down.

595
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,238
What are they doing?

596
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:12,806
What?

597
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:22,482
What? No.

598
00:48:30,557 --> 00:48:32,459
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

599
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:44,271
It's starting
to spread.

600
00:48:44,337 --> 00:48:46,106
I know, sister.

601
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:49,142
First the children,
and then the old.

602
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:51,978
We have to do it now.

603
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:54,614
What is she talking about?

604
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,818
We should follow them.

605
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:22,576
Fuck.

606
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,451
What are they doing?

607
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:34,421
Something fucked up.

608
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:47,867
- Why would they put it in a church?
- Definitely not to bless it.

609
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:57,711
We hear this insane screaming,
dying noise in the middle of the night,

610
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:01,147
and then we go and there's,
like, a goat sacrifice.

611
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:03,450
Look, animals
get sick, right?

612
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:05,785
Some have birth defects.

613
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,088
We can't feed them, take care of them.
We do what we have to.

614
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:11,257
Okay, then why did they bring
the goats into your church?

615
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:13,326
I told you
not to go in the church.

616
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:16,529
- We didn't go in the church, we saw them...
- Hey, what's going on here?

617
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,431
What do you mean?

618
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:20,800
Thought this was supposed to be a
documentary about where you're from.

619
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,036
And now you're
sneaking out at night,

620
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,140
and you're filming all kinds of stuff
that's not really your business.

621
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:30,844
I'm trying to help you.
Don't make me regret it.

622
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,750
I don't know
what happened to my mom,

623
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:39,219
but I feel like the answers
are in that church.

624
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:42,622
Well, they obviously
left Sam behind to babysit us.

625
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,826
So we'll have to find a way
to distract him.

626
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:50,430
All right, who's first?

627
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:52,198
You got it.

628
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:54,934
Let's go, Dale.

629
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,536
Okay.

630
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:59,973
So you're gonna take both of these
reins in your left hand. Good.

631
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,375
Right hand's gonna
go around that pommel.

632
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:04,811
Your left foot's
gonna go in the stirrup.

633
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:06,312
And then...

634
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:07,681
Hold that tight.

635
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:08,648
Whoa!

636
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:10,483
- You're okay.
- Hey! Look at you.

637
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,720
- I told you he likes you.
- Both hands on the reins.

638
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:15,755
Good, good.
Both hands, both hands.

639
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,557
Okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

640
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,159
Have fun.

641
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:20,894
- No, no, no.
- Hey!

642
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,995
Oh!

643
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:24,130
- Hey, stop!
- You wrong for that.

644
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:27,300
- Just pull back on the reins!
- Go, Dale.

645
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:28,935
I'm squeezing!

646
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,372
Stop! Tell him to stop!

647
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:45,518
All right.

648
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:50,824
Voilà.

649
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:04,404
What?

650
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:07,974
Where are the pews?

651
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,543
I thought this
was supposed to be a church.

652
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:16,049
Chris.

653
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:19,185
There's paintings
on the ground.

654
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:20,653
Oh, yeah.

655
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,224
Kind of looks like a drawing
that I saw in the attic.

656
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,760
"Asmodeus."

657
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:36,469
Shit.

658
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:41,474
What the fuck, man?

659
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:50,583
"The young and the weak
will suffer first"?

660
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,690
"Lest sacrifices be made."

661
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,059
Okay.

662
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,998
What is that?

663
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,637
Okay...

664
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:16,843
Is that some, like,
Cirque du Soleil stuff?

665
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:28,588
Saw those in the barn.

666
00:53:31,191 --> 00:53:32,826
That's a big bell.

667
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,829
Yo, Margot.

668
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:37,764
- Margot?
- Here.

669
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:38,998
Oh.

670
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:40,233
Look.

671
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,603
- What is that?
- I think it's blood.

672
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,579
Okay, hold on one second.

673
00:53:52,645 --> 00:53:54,214
Just one second.

674
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:57,483
What?

675
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:11,331
- This thing slides.
- Don't break it.

676
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:13,566
- Help me push it over.
- Why?

677
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:15,969
One, two...

678
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,006
That's it.

679
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,609
No way.

680
00:54:28,948 --> 00:54:30,083
Fuck.

681
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:32,785
Holy fuck.

682
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:34,854
Holy fuck.

683
00:54:41,694 --> 00:54:44,330
- Whoa.
- Okay, so what?

684
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:45,665
They just...

685
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,502
threw the dead goats
down there?

686
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:51,037
But why?

687
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:54,173
I don't know,
some sort of...

688
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:57,043
religious custom?

689
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,178
Fuck.

690
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:02,248
Hey, hey, be careful.

691
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:15,695
Whoa, dude, that's...

692
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,664
that's fucking far, yo.

693
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,304
What?

694
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,308
- Fuck it.
- Fuck what?

695
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:29,676
Fuck what?

696
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:31,411
What? Mm-mmm!

697
00:55:31,477 --> 00:55:34,180
Hard no this time.
We don't even know if this thing is safe.

698
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,883
It's here. I mean,
they're using it for a reason.

699
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:40,687
Okay, Margot, I can't just stand here
and let you do this. Come on, now.

700
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:44,290
Chris, we get one shot, one chance.
I'm not messing it up.

701
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:45,892
It's too important.

702
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:48,361
Just give me the camera.
Man the pulley. We got this.

703
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,630
The fuck we got this.

704
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,468
You sure about this?

705
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:57,103
Yes.

706
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,371
It's good.

707
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:07,280
Do I look cool?

708
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:08,915
No, you look crazy.

709
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,318
Don't move.

710
00:56:12,685 --> 00:56:14,120
Thank you.

711
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:19,258
Okay.

712
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:25,665
Okay, just...
let it out real slow.

713
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,400
Slow.

714
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:31,371
Okay.

715
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,375
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

716
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:37,877
Yeah, I'm good. Keep going.

717
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:53,259
You good?

718
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,360
Yep.

719
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:57,130
What am I doing?

720
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,906
Jesus, what is that?

721
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:08,741
What?

722
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,045
There's a smell.

723
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:13,212
Fuck.

724
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,314
It's pretty bad.

725
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:19,919
You okay?

726
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,654
Yeah.

727
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:23,056
I-I'm good.

728
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:33,900
What the fuck? What?

729
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:43,443
There's crosses everywhere.

730
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,011
What?

731
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,046
There's crosses everywhere.

732
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,316
Do you wanna keep going?

733
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,952
Yeah.

734
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:54,821
Yeah, keep going.

735
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:07,066
Ohh.

736
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:16,909
Okay.

737
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:21,380
I can see the bottom!

738
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:31,457
Chr... Chris?

739
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,928
Chris?

740
00:58:37,396 --> 00:58:39,031
Hey, what's wrong?

741
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,438
It's stuck.

742
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:49,342
Hold on. Hold on.
Something's stuck.

743
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:57,416
So fucking close.

744
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:02,555
I think I can reach it
if I lean.

745
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,095
H... Hey, there's something
down here!

746
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,365
A room!

747
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:19,138
Right.

748
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:39,091
Okay. Who was that?

749
00:59:40,393 --> 00:59:41,527
Wait, go back.

750
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:44,163
Go back.

751
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,099
Who is it? Who...

752
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:50,836
Hey, Chris, I'm done.
Pull me up.

753
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,442
Hey, please. I'm serious.
Pull me up.

754
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:01,514
Chris?

755
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,816
Hey, pull me up!

756
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:14,393
Look, if you just listen to
it, then you'll understand.

757
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,029
You could've hurt yourself.
You scared the shit out of me.

758
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:18,731
That's all I'm saying.

759
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:21,567
It's gotta be known,
like, acknowledged at least.

760
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:24,203
- I'll listen to it, but it's like...
- Okay.

761
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,471
Come on.

762
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:27,873
I'm listening to it.

763
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,577
Dale, is that booze?

764
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:34,513
Whiskey, man.
I just fell off a fucking horse.

765
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:38,484
<i>Chris.</i>

766
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,685
- <i>Chris!</i>
- Okay.

767
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:41,988
<i>Pull me up!</i>

768
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:43,289
<i>Chris, pull me up!</i>

769
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,224
- <i>Pull me up!</i>
- Go back.

770
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,033
You hear that?

771
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,935
There's something
down there.

772
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,272
An animal?

773
01:01:00,706 --> 01:01:03,743
Shit, they're throwing goats
down a mine shaft

774
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:06,078
to feed an animal...

775
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:08,581
in a cave a hundred
feet underground?

776
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:11,951
Fuck those guys.

777
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,312
Um, Jacob?

778
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,771
What?

779
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:30,389
Fuck.

780
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:32,691
What?

781
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:49,375
Whoa, whoa.

782
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:51,310
Battery? Totally fucking dead.

783
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:53,913
- They've been watching me.
- What?

784
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:57,483
Sam didn't leave the community to
find himself. He left to find me.

785
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:02,154
- This whole thing's like a fucking setup.
- Okay, just slow down. Slow down.

786
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:07,560
Is everything all right?

787
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,695
Yeah, I'm good.

788
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:13,332
I was feeling a little under the weather
earlier, but I'm much better now.

789
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,635
Good.

790
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:18,537
- Thank you.
- It's good to hear.

791
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,644
Okay, wait.
I thought they couldn't have computers.

792
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:28,247
Chris, the emails went back
for over a year.

793
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:30,449
Way before Sam contacted me.

794
01:04:30,516 --> 01:04:33,118
I mean, they knew where I live.
They have my address.

795
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:34,687
They fucking
have pictures of me.

796
01:04:34,753 --> 01:04:37,089
- They had my class schedule.
- What the fuck?

797
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:41,327
They were watching me.
They clearly brought us here for a reason.

798
01:04:41,393 --> 01:04:43,596
- Why would they do that?
- I don't fucking know.

799
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:45,931
I don't fucking know,
but it's freaking me out.

800
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:47,800
I wanna go home.

801
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:51,470
- I wanna go.
- Okay. Okay, okay. But how?

802
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:54,540
We have no car,
we have no phone,

803
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,909
and there's no one around
for 30 miles.

804
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,744
Fuck.

805
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,479
This is so fucked.

806
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,851
Hey.

807
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:08,120
Tomorrow.

808
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:10,189
Okay? It's all good.

809
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:12,691
First thing in the morning, we'll head
into town and get a battery for the van.

810
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:19,532
Okay?

811
01:05:53,465 --> 01:05:55,200
Dale, wake up.

812
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:00,673
Wake up.

813
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:02,041
Wake up.

814
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,244
Fuck.

815
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:08,914
Wake up.

816
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:15,287
What?

817
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:27,366
Chris, wake up.

818
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,336
Please, wake up!

819
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:35,674
Who the fuck is that?

820
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,805
Margot?

821
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:44,777
Chris.

822
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:52,317
Oh, Jesus Christ.

823
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,953
Hey, Margot. Margot?

824
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,321
Are you okay?

825
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,631
She's resting again.

826
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,269
What was wrong with her?

827
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:14,773
I'd say it's exhaustion coupled with
an unusually severe menstrual cycle.

828
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,643
She lost a fair amount of blood,
but she's going to be fine.

829
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,745
Well, shouldn't we
take her to a hospital?

830
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:21,914
No, she doesn't need a hospital.
She needs rest.

831
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,517
Okay, no offense,
but are you even a real doctor?

832
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:27,286
Listen,
let her get some rest.

833
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:31,356
If her condition worsens,
we'll get her to a hospital.

834
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:39,798
Unusually
strong menstrual cycle?

835
01:08:40,466 --> 01:08:41,967
Do you believe that?

836
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:48,073
Man, this is so stupid.
Nobody's coming.

837
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,742
You got a better idea?

838
01:08:49,808 --> 01:08:52,511
I don't see any Amish auto
part stores around here.

839
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,248
Look.

840
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,683
- Oh!
- Ah!

841
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,918
- Thank God.
- Oh, fuck, man. Yes.

842
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:01,520
Oh, thank God.

843
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,522
I think it's a mail truck.
Hey!

844
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,092
- Hey, man.
- Hey there.

845
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:09,495
Will you give us a ride into town?
Our battery died.

846
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:11,196
- Yeah. That's all right.
- Hop in?

847
01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:13,198
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

848
01:09:13,265 --> 01:09:14,366
Thank you so much.

849
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,368
That's a nice camera
you got.

850
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,570
Yeah, we're shooting a
documentary up at the Beiler farm.

851
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:21,640
Oh, yeah?
What's y'alls documentary about?

852
01:09:21,707 --> 01:09:23,375
Amish people.

853
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:25,210
- Amish people?
- Yeah.

854
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,447
You guys staying
at the Beiler farm?

855
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:32,084
Yeah. Actually, we've been
there for about a week now filming.

856
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:36,722
Yeah, all right.
Well, you know the Beilers ain't Amish.

857
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:39,525
Uh, what?
Of course they are.

858
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:41,326
Think they are? Right.

859
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:44,897
Hey, I've been working this
route for over 40 years

860
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:48,500
and I know every family
within a 50-square-mile area,

861
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,436
and most of them are Amish.

862
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:53,472
Now, they all will tell you...

863
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,875
the Beilers ain't Amish.

864
01:09:58,677 --> 01:10:00,579
- Can I help you?
- Car battery?

865
01:10:00,646 --> 01:10:02,548
- Size?
- 31C.

866
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:04,316
Let me go check for you.
Be right back.

867
01:10:04,383 --> 01:10:06,351
Fuck, man.

868
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:09,955
Maybe we shouldn't have left Margot, man.
Why would they pretend to be Amish?

869
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:12,558
I don't know. Maybe hiding
in plain sight, right?

870
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:14,459
It's like... I don't know.

871
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:18,197
They look like them, they blend
in, they're off the grid.

872
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:19,898
It's kind of a genius idea.

873
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,067
Why would they need to be Amish?
What's the point in that?

874
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,603
- What size battery was it again?
- Thirty-one C.

875
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,973
Yeah, I'm not seeing it here.
I'm gonna go check in the back for you.

876
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,909
Hey, you mind if we
use your Internet for a second?

877
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,544
- Not at all. Have at it.
- Cool.

878
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:34,947
Just don't look up
anything weird.

879
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:36,281
Fuck, Dale.

880
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:39,318
What do you want me to look up?
"Fake Amish people"?

881
01:10:39,384 --> 01:10:40,686
No, search "Asmodeus."

882
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:42,054
- Asmodeus?
- Yeah.

883
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,523
That's the name
we found at the church.

884
01:10:50,395 --> 01:10:53,098
"The demonic prince of lust,
suffering and wrath.

885
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:56,969
Asmodeus, or Asmodaios,
is the overlord of the Nine Hells.

886
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,804
He is the prince of demons..."

887
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:01,406
I fucking knew it, man.
These people are devil worshippers.

888
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:03,509
Click that right there
at the top.

889
01:11:05,677 --> 01:11:09,481
"The Norwegian village of Beskytter
was beset by a pestilence.

890
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,451
Crops and livestock perished,
neighbor turned against neighbor

891
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:14,419
in abhorrent acts
of violence."

892
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:15,921
The same stuff
you saw in the church.

893
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:19,424
"It was believed to be
the work of the demon, Asmodeus.

894
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:23,462
In their desperation, the village
turned to the White Witch for help.

895
01:11:23,528 --> 01:11:26,331
It is said the witch trapped the
demon inside a chosen woman of God,

896
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:30,068
her body a holy vessel
to ensnare the powerful entity.

897
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,239
Through her bloodline,
from daughter to daughter,

898
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:38,777
the demon, Asmodeus, be passed,
lest it be unleashed upon the world."

899
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,780
Fuck, man.

900
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:43,682
They trapped them
inside these women's bodies?

901
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:45,150
Okay, come on.

902
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,820
Like, witches, demons?
Like, th-that's not real.

903
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:51,657
Even if it's not real,
they could still...

904
01:11:51,723 --> 01:11:53,859
If they believe it,
then think about it.

905
01:11:53,926 --> 01:11:55,727
Margot's mom runs off,
right?

906
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:59,564
And she hides her baby to keep her
away from these cultish motherfuckers,

907
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:01,233
but they still
find her somehow

908
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,169
and they lure her back to do
whatever this shit is to her.

909
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:06,038
All right, you guys.

910
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:07,906
Got the last 31C
right here.

911
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:10,542
Shit, dude.
You're a lifesaver, man.

912
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:11,610
All right.

913
01:12:14,146 --> 01:12:15,647
Fuck.

914
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:20,519
All right. I'm gonna go deal with
this battery. Meet me at the house.

915
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:23,555
- You sure you don't need help?
- No, man. Just get Margot and our shit.

916
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:27,559
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah. Fuck this place.

917
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,665
Hello?

918
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:35,467
Sam?

919
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:36,935
Jacob?

920
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:40,906
Fuck. Mary.

921
01:12:40,973 --> 01:12:43,575
Hey, hey. Mary.
Wait, wait, wait. No.

922
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:44,776
Mary.

923
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:46,678
Where's your dad?

924
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:48,947
Mary, open up.

925
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:50,215
Fuck.

926
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:55,354
Margot, it is time to go.

927
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:59,224
What the fuck? Our shit.
Where the fuck is our shit?

928
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:05,063
Sam?

929
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,403
What the fuck
is going on, Sam?

930
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,205
Where's Margot?

931
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:16,475
Sam?

932
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:18,844
Where the fuck
is Margot, man?

933
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:24,416
Women are the most powerful
creatures on Earth.

934
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,484
What?

935
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,252
Givers of life.

936
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:31,857
That is why our sisters
bear this burden.

937
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:35,827
They're the only ones strong
enough to hold him back.

938
01:13:35,894 --> 01:13:38,296
What are you talking about, man?

939
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:41,700
It's time.

940
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:43,869
Stay behind locked doors.

941
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,338
Don't come out until
the bell stops ringing.

942
01:13:46,405 --> 01:13:48,473
What? Sam.

943
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,109
Dude, where are you going?
Sam!

944
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:34,119
Margot?

945
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:38,190
Margot?

946
01:14:41,493 --> 01:14:42,928
Okay. Easy, man.

947
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:45,497
- Don't try to stop this.
- Just put the gun down.

948
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,767
Her body is the only thing
that can hold the demon.

949
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:52,471
If you set him free,
he'll be able to possess anyone,

950
01:14:52,537 --> 01:14:53,972
jumping from body to body.

951
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:55,841
- What are you doing to her?
- He'll kill us all.

952
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,977
- He'll kill every last one of us.
- Wait.

953
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:02,714
Just put the gun down, man.

954
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:05,016
Please, man.
You don't want to do this.

955
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:41,987
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

956
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:02,174
Hold on, Margot. I'm coming.

957
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:19,558
Oh... Oh, God.

958
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,666
Margot? Fuck.

959
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:29,267
