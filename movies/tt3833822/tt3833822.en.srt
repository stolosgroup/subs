2
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,159
We're always trying

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,119
new things.

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,959
We are so used

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,839
to having crappy products.

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,679
Daft Punk thought about
their music before they made it.

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,919
That makes a real difference.
And weirdly enough,

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,279
creating those robot personas
let them stay human,

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,079
grounded and completely free.

10
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,079
They bought their freedom
by sending the robots

11
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,479
to do their dirty work.

12
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,199
They were proud to release an EP
on the same label as Stereolab.

13
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,039
That's how it all started.

14
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,679
Guy-Manuel and Thomas
were 17 or 18 back then.

15
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,759
They thought everything
had been set in motion.

16
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,279
But a critic from Melody Maker
called them "daft punky thrash".

17
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,839
That made them stop and wonder.

18
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,239
It changed the optimistic view
they had on their music.

19
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,039
It took them six or seven months
to send me two other tracks.

20
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,959
I think they just
did not want to go that way.

21
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,759
They would say "you'll have
the new tracks next week",

22
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,319
but what they really meant was
"we don't care.

23
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,679
We have
other things to think about."

24
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,079
We were 18
when we went to our first rave

25
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,759
on the roof of Beaubourg.

26
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,439
We discovered a new kind
of music and energy

27
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,439
with people dancing to music
they had never heard before.

28
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,839
Something new
was happening on that scene

29
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,519
and it was still alternative
and underground at the time.

30
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,079
Not the kind of music
you heard on the radio.

31
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,879
We thought there was
something to be done

32
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,279
with electronic music.

33
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,879
Thomas,
Guy-Manuel and I met there

34
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,919
and the closer we got, the more
we could feel the vibrations.

35
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,399
There's a track from Chicago
with a dark voice

36
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,119
singing
Can You Feel The Bass...

37
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,039
It was the last major revolution
in recent decades.

38
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,239
Electronic music and hip-hop
were the last great revolutions.

39
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,879
Everything since then
ultimately comes from

40
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,679
one of those two movements.

41
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,119
There were people
discovering drugs as well.

42
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,319
I remember Thomas saying
he did not like it

43
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,799
because using ecstasy made you

44
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,039
lose your critical faculties.

45
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,359
And that was it.

46
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,959
He hates nothing more
than losing control.

47
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,079
I called and asked them to come

48
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,399
and to bring their demo.

49
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,999
When they arrived,

50
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,799
they were wondering
what was going on.

51
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,799
They come in, their eyes
wide open. Guy-Man is blushing.

52
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,359
I introduce
the people from Slam.

53
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,279
We didn't have a name.

54
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,759
We decided to use
the name from that bad review.

55
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,679
They called us "daft punk".

56
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,599
They have a very clear vision
of their careers

57
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,959
because they get advice from
Thomas's Bangalter father.

58
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,079
He produced disco music in the 70s
under the name Daniel Vangarde.

59
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,679
He helped them work out
the deals they were offered.

60
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,359
He was the ideal advisor
for a band

61
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,319
making dance music
produced in France

62
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,279
with lyrics in English
and aimed at the whole world.

63
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,839
We've received faxes

64
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,319
from Denmark, Sweden,

65
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,999
Spain, Japan, New York...

66
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,399
although
we've only sold 15,000 records.

67
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,399
It shows
that there is an audience

68
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,759
for that kind of music
all around the world.

69
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,439
When I met them
in 1995,

70
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,239
between the Scottish label,
and their energy and talent,

71
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,519
Daft Punk were already
in demand

72
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,399
for a live set.

73
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,119
I would say that they were
recording their first album

74
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,879
and a live set
wasn't possible yet.

75
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,479
Technically, it was stunning.

76
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,359
That music
was made in a bedroom...

77
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,319
this big.

78
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,359
There were electric cords
all over this child's bedroom.

79
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,239
Child's. Not teenager's.

80
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,919
It was full of cables,
keyboards and stuff.

81
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,679
The two albums which changed the face
of electronic music were made there.

82
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,599
The specificity of our music
and our work is that

83
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,279
there is a real interaction
between music and technology.

84
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,679
In a way, we consider technology
to be a part of the band.

85
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,119
Thomas
is a genius with machines.

86
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,919
When he was working on
their debut album,

87
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,239
he read his instruction manuals
once a month.

88
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,119
He was one of the first
to have a Macintosh in France

89
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,559
so he had a very early approach
to computer-aided

90
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,599
music and images.

91
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,199
But artistically
there's more to him than that.

92
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,679
He creates wonderful melodies.

93
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,159
He has a real feeling
for what makes a hit.

94
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,159
Guy-Man is the mystical one.

95
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,119
There's just one thing
that works for him

96
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,079
and as long as he hasn't
found it, the rest is junk.

97
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,999
The contract we signed with
the label is 100% good for us

98
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,279
so we've avoided problems
that others artists have had

99
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,399
with their record companies.

100
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,759
The deal they signed with Virgin
was a break with the norm.

101
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,919
Artists usually signed for
4 or 5 albums for a percentage.

102
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,039
They said "no,
we own our recordings and

103
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,399
we'll give you the rights for 10 years."

104
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,279
This showed me something.

105
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,839
What I learnt was

106
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,679
that success
is built on solid foundations.

107
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,879
Guy-Man and Thomas
were already thinking

108
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,559
about an international deal.

109
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,359
They already had quite
a clear vision of their career.

110
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,039
Their album was almost ready,
they were finishing it off.

111
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,639
From the start, they already
understand the business.

112
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,119
The business model is in place.

113
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,439
They know they need complete
artistic freedom and control

114
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,719
of their image
and everything else.

115
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,319
They were able
to impose their own rules

116
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,119
because
they were OK financially.

117
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,239
They were not starving.

118
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,399
They even became an example
for hip-hop bands

119
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,359
who were influenced

120
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,359
by their business model

121
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,199
which was said to be
the greatest hold-up ever.

122
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,439
They invited us to listen
to the album in Thomas's flat.

123
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,439
We went with the London Virgin team
and some of the French team.

124
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,039
It was fantastic, a small studio,
with not much equipment.

125
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,159
We listened on a ghetto blaster,

126
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,319
which impressed us all.

127
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,039
It was a revelation.

128
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,359
We listened
to one hit after the other.

129
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,599
Spike Jonze's video
had a huge impact.

130
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,879
When Michel Gondry hears about
Daft Punk, he has the great idea

131
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,959
for the music video
of Around The World.

132
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,199
Where's
that stupid little black box?

133
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,559
I'm looking
for the remote control.

134
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,359
It's crazy.

135
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,439
Why would I have
put it somewhere else?

136
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,919
It has only one use.

137
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,519
That's the story of my life.

138
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,639
Alright.

139
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,279
I met them in a hotel room

140
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,479
in London.

141
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,479
I was sitting on the bed
and they were on chairs.

142
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,559
I don't like having an idea
before talking to the group.

143
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,079
I don't want to get on the wrong track.

144
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,039
I always talk to the band first

145
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,319
before I propose anything at all.

146
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,759
I think it was Guy-Manuel

147
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
who came up with the idea
of a choreography.

148
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,639
Choreo-

149
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,359
graphy.

150
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,199
I asked
my designer Florence Fontaine,

151
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,999
although
we did not have much money,

152
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,719
to make robots.

153
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,519
She used motorbike helmets.

154
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,879
She added two antennas.

155
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,879
Then we decided to cover

156
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,839
the visors
with semi-transparent tape.

157
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,559
I think it's the first time
they wore helmets.

158
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,119
Maybe it was their idea
and I just worked around it,

159
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,119
but I think I wanted them
to look like Robocop.

160
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,639
One question,

161
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,719
techno music is supposed to be
underground, anti-star system.

162
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,999
Yet you're becoming stars.

163
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,759
How do you feel about that?

164
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,839
I still believe
it's anti-star system.

165
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,639
We try not to expose
ourselves too much.

166
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,719
The music is the only thing
that really matters.

167
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,159
Then people
decide for themselves.

168
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,879
But we're not really trying
to show ourselves off.

169
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,399
The choice
not to show their faces anymore

170
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,519
was made when they decided

171
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,599
to go to the top
by signing with Virgin

172
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,719
with the aim to sell records
and to conquer pop culture.

173
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,639
Before that, they released EPs
with a small Scottish label.

174
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,639
The movement was underground

175
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,959
so there was no reason
to protect their identities.

176
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,159
Hiding one's face
is part of techno culture.

177
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,559
The founders of techno
like Underground Resistance did it.

178
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,079
When techno emerged,
it was a faceless music.

179
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,599
Back then, people even danced

180
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,559
backs turned to the DJ.

181
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,199
Americans had done it before.
Kraftwerk did it and Kiss.

182
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,479
All pop stars invent
and reinvent themselves.

183
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,999
They aren't born that way.

184
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,879
When I talk to David Bowie,

185
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,559
I'm talking
to one of his thousand avatars.

186
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,519
Not to the Bowie
born in London in 1947.

187
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,679
Those bands influenced them
by using make-up and costumes.

188
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,919
They did photoshoots

189
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,959
at the beginning
but they probably thought

190
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,079
they looked like kids.

191
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,079
What could be smarter?

192
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,839
That was
part of the process as well.

193
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,719
How to still make music
when you're 40?

194
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,919
When Homework is released,
they are what shakes up the 90s,

195
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,519
they bring a new energy
with their electronic music.

196
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,479
It soon becomes clear

197
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,879
that all the major pop stars
want to get in touch

198
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,719
to produce them
or to work with them.

199
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,999
People from all around the world
want to work with them.

200
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,119
Janet Jackson,
Madonna, George Michael...

201
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,319
They all tried
to collaborate with them.

202
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,399
Thomas and Guy-Man
always answered politely

203
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,359
but there was no collaboration.

204
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,159
I can't see a thing.

205
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,119
We have to walk slowly.

206
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,519
They would send me to buy masks
at the last minute like the time

207
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,639
they did the NME cover.

208
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,279
I would buy cheap masks
from joke shops.

209
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,039
It wasn't very well prepared.

210
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,199
Once in Japan,

211
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,239
they went to the shop an hour
before their meeting with EMl.

212
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,439
They bought crazy costumes
to disguise themselves.

213
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,559
They did not
want to play the game.

214
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,439
There's a good story about
meeting Virgin in New York.

215
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,479
We were all
going to a restaurant.

216
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,479
A huge limo was waiting for us.

217
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,679
Thomas and Guy-Man see that.

218
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,119
They don't like it at all.

219
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,759
So they decide to run away.

220
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,679
I'm left alone in this limo
with the people from Virgin.

221
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,199
Thomas and Guy-Man
took the subway

222
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,919
and I got there in the limo
with Virgin.

223
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,839
It's a rejection,
a philosophical position...

224
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,079
They don't partake
in the charade.

225
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,479
Do you use your anonymity
to get closer to your public?

226
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,399
We do live
a lot of exceptional things

227
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,559
but we still have
a very normal everyday life.

228
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,719
We live more like our audience
than the artists

229
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,199
who have
the same kind of fame as ours

230
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,119
but who are attached

231
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,199
to physical recognition
by the public.

232
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,199
The band, and especially Thomas,

233
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,759
had a fascination
for the Millennium bug.

234
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,999
How to explain that in 1999
these two guys wear masks

235
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,399
and on the 1st of January 2000,
they become robots?

236
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,319
That's the Millennium bug.

237
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,919
We told the journalists
that they were in the studio

238
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,399
and at midnight
something happened.

239
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,439
Thomas and Guy-Man
became robots.

240
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,679
WE ARE NOT DEAD

241
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,559
BUT WE'VE BECOME ROBOTS.

242
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,279
I remember very well
the first tests at Alterian.

243
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,799
We'd been driving a long time
to get to Los Angeles.

244
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,639
I was hoping
it would be worth the trip.

245
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,439
We arrive there
and meet Tony Gardner

246
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,719
who was
kind of a nerd, with glasses

247
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,759
surrounded
by monster heads and dolls.

248
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,999
From 2001on, they're
no longer two regular guys.

249
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,319
We're talking to robots.

250
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,159
Last time I interviewed them,
we talked for three hours

251
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,159
and Thomas
never used the word "I".

252
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,399
It's crazy. The first person
singular no longer exists.

253
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,719
It is totally erased.
They are Daft Punk.

254
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,599
It's still playful.
But they control everything.

255
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,759
They're still kids.

256
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,719
One More Time

257
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,159
is THE song that opens up
the USA for them.

258
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,079
It's crazy to think

259
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,599
that it took two French
white guys from Paris

260
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,039
for Americans to discover

261
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,439
house music when it was invented
by African-Americans.

262
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,799
They were lucky
because they started out

263
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,879
at the same time
as home studios.

264
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,199
Albums needn't be recorded
in a limited time anymore.

265
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,759
They can spend
four or five years on an album.

266
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,519
This album
is important for pop music.

267
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,879
It's one
of the first post-sample albums

268
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,839
which builds music
out of other sounds.

269
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,799
Sampling means

270
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,919
taking parts of a song,
looping it over and over

271
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,639
until it becomes music.

272
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,239
But they changed them so much
that samples became unrecognizable.

273
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,119
They had colossal ambitions

274
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,239
for their work.

275
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,239
They recorded their second album
while making Interstella 5555.

276
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,559
It was a silent anime

277
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,319
which came alive with music.

278
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,119
Their original idea
just took off.

279
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,999
The music video
turned into a feature film.

280
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,559
They got into debt
because they were the producers.

281
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,079
No record company
would have produced it.

282
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,959
Daft Punk is not
just about making music.

283
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,159
It means controlling a universe

284
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,599
and protecting it
from any outside intervention.

285
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,519
They answer to no one.
It's punk and rebellious.

286
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,119
Interstella was ten years
ahead of its time,

287
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,879
before the big TV shows
featuring lots of bands

288
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,239
who are then
tied to the network for life.

289
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,479
They made a wishlist of people

290
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,639
they wanted to work with.

291
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,039
Leiji Matsumoto was number 1.

292
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,599
He's the man
behind Captain Harlock.

293
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,239
People born
between 1975 and 1980

294
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,719
were fascinated by

295
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,359
Japanese animes.

296
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,399
Captain Harlock was
quite different from the others

297
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,359
that were childish and colorful.

298
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,279
Captain Harlock
has a huge scar on his face.

299
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,479
He's a pirate.

300
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,359
If not a rebel,
he's definitely marginal.

301
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,639
The way I see it,

302
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,319
the robot has a human heart.

303
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,839
He is
a calm and non-violent being.

304
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,719
If necessary,

305
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,319
he protects people.

306
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,039
He becomes their shield

307
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,919
in order to do so.

308
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,439
This vision come from the traditional

309
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,479
representation of ghosts

310
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,559
and other supernatural beings.

311
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,679
In the Japanese tradition,

312
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,159
they are not evil monsters

313
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,839
but beings who have hearts

314
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,439
and a free spirit.

315
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,919
My hero

316
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,319
Captain Harlock often says

317
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,239
"I live freely under my banner!

318
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,119
But I also accept
all my responsabilities."

319
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,119
All creativity should be
based on this principle.

320
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,519
There was
a kind of reaction after

321
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,399
the huge ambition
of the Discovery album.

322
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,719
We wanted to go back
to something raw.

323
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,799
Since we are Human After All
we'll record it in two weeks.

324
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,519
This is the music
we want to make.

325
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,759
When this album came out,

326
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,959
it disconcerted a lot of people.

327
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,439
Even the media

328
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,919
and people from the label.

329
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,039
It was more difficult
for us to promote

330
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,599
this album.

331
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,719
There was no single to play

332
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,999
on the radio
so we had to find ways

333
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,639
for people
to talk about the album.

334
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,399
I think
the public did not understand.

335
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,319
People are used to saying

336
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,999
debut albums are underground,
the second's a success,

337
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,639
and the third one
even more successful.

338
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,319
But they were not
running after success.

339
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,199
I think
they just wanted to express

340
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
what they had inside.

341
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,399
People tend to say

342
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,279
this album is not as good.

343
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,599
People expected
something else from them.

344
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,479
In any case, that's what you hear.

345
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,719
It's interesting to see that
years later, those same critics

346
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,199
reevaluate the album...

347
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,279
and realise the impact it had.

348
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,719
It attracted
a wave of French producers,

349
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,199
the French Touch 2.0,

350
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,959
inspired by Daft Punk's energy

351
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,119
and a return
to the raw energy of techno.

352
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,039
Bands such as Justice

353
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,319
and the new generation
come out of Human After All.

354
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,959
The robots dress up as humans
and eventually kill themselves.

355
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,439
Maybe they were trying
to tell us something.

356
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,879
Is Daft Punk over?

357
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,959
That crossed my mind.

358
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,199
I figured they were done with
the masks and had a new idea:

359
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,279
showing their faces.

360
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,959
They probably thought about it.

361
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,119
They had the great idea

362
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,919
of simplified robots
dressed in black leather.

363
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,999
It was Mad Max meets Tron.

364
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,839
300,000 dollars
for a Daft Punk concert.

365
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,119
I say the band is not touring

366
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,399
but it's a big offer,
so I'll talk to them.

367
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,559
Coachella 2006 was a big risk.

368
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,159
The band
is going through a rough patch.

369
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,319
People think they are
outdated and maybe uncool,

370
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,399
that they didn't reinvent themselves
with Human After All,

371
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,559
which is essential

372
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,159
when you are a major band
of the electronic scene.

373
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,559
They are almost over.

374
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,839
They call me back
a few hours or days later

375
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,639
to ask me to say
they might be interested.

376
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,359
I go to the rehearsal studio
ten days before Coachella.

377
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,799
I see everything, the set-up,
the pyramid, the LEDs...

378
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,599
Now everyone uses LEDs,
even nightclubs.

379
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,199
But back then,

380
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,279
to cover the pyramid with LEDs,
we had to go through

381
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,039
all the suppliers in the USA.
It was no easy task.

382
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,959
Thomas and Guy-Man

383
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,279
ask me to sit down while
they play me what they have prepared.

384
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,159
It was just the audio part.

385
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,959
They don't let me see
the pyramid yet.

386
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,599
It's a mix of their three albums
and it's amazing.

387
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,999
It's Daft Punk's turn to go on
and we're backstage with them.

388
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,279
We're dressing the duo,
checking the last details.

389
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,879
The tent gets so packed
it's overflowing with people.

390
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,599
We realise
Daft Punk's return is awaited.

391
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,079
We start to get the numbers.

392
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,839
There's 40,000 people
when the tent can only host 10,000.

393
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,279
Everyone took out their phones.

394
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,439
It was the time people started
filming with cell phones

395
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,919
and the beginning of YouTube.

396
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,519
It was crazy.

397
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,879
Everybody was so stunned
by the power of the show

398
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,279
that they filmed it
and posted it on YouTube.

399
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,359
I'm not ashamed
to admit I cried.

400
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,319
I was moved by the show
and people's incredible reaction.

401
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,519
It was completely unreal.

402
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,039
A spaceship had landed
in the middle of the desert

403
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,159
and there's 40,000 of us happy,
stunned by the light and sound.

404
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,239
The pyramid was
the start of a gigantic tour

405
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,039
and of a movement
in the United States

406
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,519
called Electronic Dance Music.

407
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,399
The starting point
was the pyramid at Coachella.

408
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,399
A whole generation of musicians
was in the audience.

409
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,359
They discovered it
and they were blown away.

410
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,519
Bass players, drummers,

411
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,999
all those musicians are
part of the history of music.

412
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,439
They are the rhythm sections

413
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,439
of Quincy Jones,
George Benson, Michael Jackson.

414
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,199
It's not easy to sum up
as just a studio musician's thing.

415
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,359
The dream of house music was

416
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,119
to revive the spirit
of dance and disco

417
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,639
which no longer existed.

418
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,039
I think that with Tron,

419
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,399
they got to be students again,
people who wanted to learn.

420
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,799
And God knows how hard
it was for them.

421
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,199
They'd built Daft Punk not to have
to answer to anyone and yet

422
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,639
they're ready to take orders from
one of the largest corporations.

423
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,999
It was like
walking into the lion's den.

424
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,919
When I met Thomas,
I was 12 or 13.

425
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,319
Phantom of the Paradise was
the film that covered it all.

426
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,919
It was like a Warhol trip,

427
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,879
not just the music,
but the film, the cover design.

428
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,479
This film had it all.

429
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:14,279
I wanted a mix of the two
to forget that they are robots.

430
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,159
I think that works well.

431
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,719
They didn't take their helmets off,
not for a second.

432
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:31,719
That obviously created
a surrealist atmosphere.

433
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:37,119
We expected them to take
their helmets off between shots.

434
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,079
But they didn't.
That was very powerful.

435
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,159
I imagine it hasn't always been
easy for them to work together.

436
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,239
There are a lot of pitfalls
in a career like that.

437
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,999
Some people may even
have issues with their ego.

438
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:01,679
But those two always tried
to stay on the right path,

439
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,159
almost like
a model of human behaviour.

440
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,319
That's very rare.

441
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,839
I've been working
in music for 30 years

442
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,479
and less successful people
don't even say hello.

443
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,919
But not them. They pay
the same attention

444
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,679
whether talking
to a nightclub bouncer

445
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,479
or to the boss
of a record company.

446
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,879
To keep these qualities
throughout your life,

447
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,039
you have
to win battles with yourself.

448
