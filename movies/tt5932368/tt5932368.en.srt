00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,361
<i>Damon Hickey,
America's top cop,</i>

4
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,573
<i>was gunned down on the front steps
of his home this morning.</i>

5
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,702
<i>Authorities believe it might be
retribution from a drug cartel.</i>

6
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,372
<i>He is listed
in extremely critical condition.</i>

7
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,990
<i>Damon Hickey, America's
police commissioner, was released today</i>

8
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,327
<i>after making a miraculous recovery
from a gunshot wound.</i>

9
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,375
<i>Unfortunately, Hickey will be confined
to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</i>

10
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,962
<i>He spoke to reporters as he was released
and seemed in good spirits.</i>

11
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,526
<i>Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.</i>

12
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:48,576
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

13
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,370
Proceed.

14
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,417
You already know my sins, Tom.

15
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,918
I do.

16
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,461
And also already know

17
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,756
that I've stepped off the righteous path.

18
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,261
Well, we all have.

19
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,930
A million six from the South side.

20
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,184
Drug money was a little light this month,

21
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,981
and prostitution was down a little too,
under 800,000.

22
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,485
<i>Gambling's up. The skim was
a million one last month.</i>

23
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,241
Is there any way to come back to the path?

24
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,785
Are you serious?

25
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,875
I'm not sure.

26
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,378
But it feels good to contemplate it.

27
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,796
I am a friend,

28
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,508
and I do not have the spiritual answer

29
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,802
you're looking for.

30
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,641
There's a woman...

31
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,103
- <i>Your caretaker?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

32
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,108
- Are you having impure thoughts?
- No, no, no.

33
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,862
She's in a tough spot with her daughter.

34
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,241
And you want to help.

35
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,703
It would help me to help her.

36
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,627
- How about the pickups?
- Same spots.

37
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,339
I hear there's a problem.

38
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,510
- Same problem?
- Yes.

39
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,680
Ahem. That rumor's been around forever.

40
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:37,935
Yeah, but I understand this time
they're taking it very seriously.

41
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,271
So let them.

42
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,777
All these things going on
and you can sleep at night?

43
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,822
I keep everyone else awake.

44
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,033
I sleep just fine.

45
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,025
You hit him too hard.

46
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,572
I don't believe
we hit him hard enough.

47
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,449
Don't be nodding out on us.

48
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,580
Wake up! Wake up!

49
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,210
What if we're wrong
about this guy?

50
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,757
If we're wrong, we're just wrong.

51
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,468
If he comes out of his coma,
he's gonna lawyer up.

52
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,179
He's gonna go after all of us.

53
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,185
I don't think he's coming out of anything.

54
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,936
Shit.

55
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,441
Fuck! What did you do?

56
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,651
What did <i>I</i> do?

57
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,904
You mean what did <i>we</i> do.

58
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,114
Don't start that shit, boy.

59
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,824
We're in this thing together.

60
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:20,162
You... you need to remember
who your friends are.

61
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,539
Don't get soft on us now.

62
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,958
Remember, you begged us
to let you in on this.

63
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,253
- Hey, guys.
- Not now.

64
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,005
- Fuck!
- Guys...

65
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,548
Not now, B.J.

66
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,384
He's got to have
hidden it on him somewhere.

67
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,637
Check his pants. Check his pants.

68
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,555
I'm not doing that.

69
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,354
Kehoe!

70
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,522
Shut up!

71
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,358
Guys...

72
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,567
I said, "shut up!"

73
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,155
Kehoe!

74
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,577
Fuck! It ain't here!

75
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,746
Maybe you should fish around
down there a little bit more.

76
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,956
Fuck you!

77
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,666
Hey!

78
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,459
Looking for this?

79
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,212
Son of a bitch.

80
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,505
Where did you find that?

81
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,840
In his locker.

82
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,429
Nice fucking timing, B.J.

83
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,764
It's a good find.

84
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,266
Thank you.

85
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,892
You were right.

86
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,229
Son of a bitch was gonna rat us out.

87
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,357
I'm always right.
That's why I'm in charge.

88
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,317
This ain't over, you know?

89
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,027
There has to be other tapes.

90
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,863
We don't know who else
he's been talking to.

91
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,740
Why don't you leave that to me

92
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,910
and people above your pay grade,
Stevens?

93
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,165
Now get his ass out of here.

94
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,417
Got it.

95
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,457
Hello?

96
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,876
<i>Hey, it's Kehoe.</i>

97
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,294
Go ahead.

98
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,423
Well, it ain't good.
He was wearing a wire.

99
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,133
Fuck.

100
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,386
All right, well, you better get over
to his house.

101
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,056
Won't be long before some other agency
gets wind of this,

102
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,599
if they haven't already.

103
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,893
<i>You bet.</i>

104
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,104
What are we going to do about the pickups?

105
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,940
<i>I just have to figure something out.</i>

106
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,399
<i>Send one of us.</i>

107
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,027
No, no, absolutely not.
Don't know who's watching.

108
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,655
<i>Who the hell can we trust?</i>

109
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,033
Let me handle it.

110
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,500
Hey, Damon.

111
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,669
I'm sorry we're late.

112
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,212
No worries.

113
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,508
How's my sweet little angel?

114
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,847
Something wrong, honey?

115
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,853
Let's make you some dinner, huh?

116
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,648
Okay.

117
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,276
Come on, baby.

118
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,648
<i>Hey, baby...</i>

119
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,401
Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.

120
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,361
- Okay.
- All right, so how about Mom

121
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,030
does some cooking tonight and you watch?

122
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,448
- Yeah!
- You like that?

123
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,199
- Yup!
- All right.

124
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,454
See what we got!

125
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,382
Thank you.

126
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,064
- Yeah.
- So I sent B.J. to Rick's place.

127
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,650
It was covered in Feds.

128
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,860
All right, get lost.

129
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,321
<i>I'm just worried
they're gonna find something.</i>

130
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,408
You forget who you're talking to?

131
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,495
I've got a long reach. Stop worrying.

132
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,538
All right. You're the boss.

133
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,792
Son of a bitch.

134
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,566
Vicky!

135
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,946
Vicky?

136
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,616
Can we talk for a minute?

137
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,701
Yeah, of course.

138
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,538
I'll be right back, okay?

139
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,718
What's going on?

140
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,431
Tell me.

141
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,560
Did you get bad news?

142
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,811
Yeah.

143
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,398
Let me help you.

144
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,277
Damon... I hope you realize

145
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,488
how appreciative we are
of everything you've done for us.

146
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,117
Truly. Thank you.

147
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,913
Unfortunately, this is just one thing
you can't help us with.

148
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,707
Yes, I can.

149
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,419
It's bad.

150
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,089
And no one even knows
for sure what it really is.

151
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,926
It's just test after test
and doctor after doctor.

152
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,137
We'll figure it out.

153
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,847
Together.

154
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,018
You know that she's the first thing
that I ever did right?

155
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,854
And she's perfect!

156
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,816
It's just unfair.

157
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,153
No, it isn't.

158
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,866
Sometimes I wonder if...

159
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:17,162
God is just punishing me for all the
terrible things that I've done in my life.

160
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,456
It's not a nice feeling.

161
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,167
I don't think God works that way.

162
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,171
Maybe not, but...

163
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,674
if He did, I just...

164
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,011
I wish He would make me suffer.

165
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,264
That, I could handle.

166
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,350
That would actually make sense.

167
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,229
But not her.

168
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,064
Let me pay for it.

169
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,445
You two are about all I have left.

170
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,821
Damon...

171
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,994
I would need something in return.

172
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,830
Of course!

173
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,208
Damon, I would do anything
for you, regardless.

174
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,085
Just name it.

175
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,215
It would involve...

176
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,593
using some of your old skills.

177
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,598
I need you tonight.

178
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,686
Five stops. Five pickups.

179
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,895
Pickups?

180
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,772
What kind of pickups?

181
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,566
Money. Lots of it.

182
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,030
I don't think I understand
where this conversation is going.

183
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,365
You don't?

184
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,867
Or you don't want to?

185
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,453
Oh, come on!

186
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,871
You didn't think for one minute

187
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:46,042
that I got all of this from my injury.

188
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,128
I never questioned it.

189
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,714
You never wanted to.

190
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,884
I'm sure you heard things about me.

191
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,095
Of course!

192
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,724
But the difference is, I know you,
so I never believed any of it.

193
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,142
Believe it.

194
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,519
All of it.

195
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,526
You are the only person I know

196
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,778
I can completely trust.

197
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,030
I need you to stop.

198
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,326
I can't even be having this conversation.

199
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,079
I can't do that for you.

200
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,916
I will take care of you and Lily.

201
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,004
I made myself a promise
that I would never do this again.

202
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,799
I don't see that you have much choice.

203
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,011
You're right, I don't have a choice.

204
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,557
I have Lily, and it is
not safe for me out there.

205
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,351
There are too many people
that are waiting for me

206
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,603
to make this exact mistake.

207
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,647
I'll find another way.

208
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,858
Because if something
were to happen to me...

209
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,526
See that it doesn't.

210
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,574
Victoria, I know I needn't remind you

211
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,619
that you have your daughter
because of me.

212
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,748
You would be in jail,

213
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,000
she would be in a state facility.

214
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,590
Take a minute. Think about it.

215
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,859
Of all the nights for this to happen...

216
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,153
Maybe we dodged a bullet.

217
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,158
This money goes all the way
to the Governor tonight.

218
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,451
And if she got implicated...

219
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,786
Oh, Lord, don't go there!

220
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,206
You know, you may be right.

221
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,502
Hell, we may all get lucky.

222
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,803
Well?

223
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,972
I can't.

224
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,598
I have a daughter now.

225
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh, and Damon?
Cook your own damn dinner.

226
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,730
Lily!

227
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,608
Lillian?

228
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,455
Where is she?

229
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,625
Where is she?

230
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,335
She's safe.

231
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,920
I will cut out your heart.

232
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,215
Now, Vicky.

233
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,926
There's no need for any of this.

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,721
See?

235
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,433
Now think about it.

236
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,561
If you kill me,
you'll never be able to find her.

237
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,398
You do what I tell you to do,

238
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,775
and everything will be just fine.

239
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,445
I promise.

240
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,113
Well...

241
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,161
Good.

242
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,039
Let's get you suited up, shall we?

243
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,173
Help yourself.

244
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,772
There's a bodycam there. Take it.

245
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,358
And there's a camera on your helmet.

246
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,321
I'll give you each stop, one at a time.

247
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,991
You bring the money back,
I give you the next stop.

248
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,077
That's how it goes. Okay?

249
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,831
Okay.

250
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,002
Just in case it wasn't clear...

251
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,130
when this is over, so are we.

252
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,216
I know.

253
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,914
All right, your first stop
is 751 Keller St.

254
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,666
German night club.

255
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,001
Do you speak German?

256
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:43,381
A little bit. My German
isn't perfect but I understand everything.

257
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,592
I'm sure you'll get by.

258
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,563
Evening, Detectives.

259
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,398
B.J.

260
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,865
So you're telling me that Rick's place
was covered in Feds.

261
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,992
- Yeah.
- You know one of them?

262
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,370
- Yes, I do.
- Which one?

263
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,289
The one running the show.

264
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,333
And?

265
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,211
And what? Will he play ball?

266
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,005
I don't know.

267
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,383
Maybe. Maybe not.

268
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,801
You're so helpful.

269
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,345
I can't speak for him, can I?

270
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,305
Listen, Damon ain't worried.

271
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,431
He never worries.

272
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,601
It only takes one fuckin' Boy Scout
to take down that enterprise.

273
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,186
That can't happen.

274
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,356
They won't allow it.
Too many people'd get hurt.

275
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,733
Use your head!

276
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,527
So you're telling me
that you know one of these guys.

277
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:47,528
Yeah.

278
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,490
If you want, I can talk to him for you.

279
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,576
I want him on our team.

280
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,914
All right.

281
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:12,303
<i>I made myself a promise
that I would never do this again.</i>

282
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,222
<i>Mom?</i>

283
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,475
<i>I don't see
that you have much choice.</i>

284
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,648
<i>Five stops. Five pickups.</i>

285
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,941
<i>What kind of pickups?</i>

286
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,527
<i>Money. Lots of it.</i>

287
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,028
<i>Mom?</i>

288
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,240
<i>Help me!</i>

289
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:37,870
<i>Kill me,
and you'll never be able to find her.</i>

290
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,415
<i>You do what I tell you to do...</i>

291
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:44,043
<i>...and everything will be just fine.
I promise.</i>

292
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,714
<i>I'll cut out your heart.</i>

293
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,431
<i>When this is over, so are we.</i>

294
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,102
I know.

295
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,397
Turn your helmet
so that it faces the door.

296
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,816
Let's keep everybody honest.

297
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,988
Did you have trouble here?

298
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,698
There's trouble everywhere.

299
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,284
Rival gangs, sticky fingers...

300
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,535
Plus you're a woman.

301
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,829
Ha. Funny.

302
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,000
All right. What do I say?

303
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,877
You're there to see Erik.

304
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,426
Erik.

305
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,721
- <i>What about him?</i>
- <i>Don't waste my fucking time.</i>

306
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:05,393
For me, there should be a little
less of that dress. <i>Ja?</i>

307
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,689
That'll cost you

308
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,732
Okay.

309
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,278
Meet Damon's new errand boy!

310
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,865
Girl, asshole!

311
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,289
Everything.

312
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,075
I know you.

313
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,375
Your brother.

314
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,088
Yes, and what?

315
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,552
You used to have long flowing locks
of chestnut hair.

316
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,350
Didn't you?

317
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,606
What the hell was that?

318
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,824
Answer me! What the hell was that?

319
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,215
Get me out of here, please!

320
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,634
Uh...

321
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,678
- Tell me there's a back way out.
- No.

322
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,804
The doors are chained.

323
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,305
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,515
That was worth a try.

325
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,517
You ready?

326
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,811
Let's do this.

327
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,110
We're just gonna go out there
and act like we're talking.

328
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,486
- Okay?
- Yeah.

329
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,364
You know what? Can you pretend
that I'm really funny?

330
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,700
- I'm a prostitute.
- <i>Touché.</i>

331
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:29,578
And I'm gonna get you to carry this
just in case I need both my hands.

332
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,539
- You ready? Let's do it.
- Mm.

333
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,127
Shit... Max!

334
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,064
- Hello.
- <i>Who is this crazy bitch</i>

335
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,775
<i>shooting up my cousin's club?</i>

336
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,111
- A late replacement.
- I'll kill her.

337
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:46,322
Calm down.

338
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,532
<i>My cousin is dead!</i>

339
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:49,909
Condolences.

340
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,286
Are you making a joke?

341
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,622
No, no, not at all.

342
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,917
But it seems that the club
now belongs to you.

343
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,631
Who is she?

344
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,010
You know who she is.

345
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,389
The deal was,

346
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:16,393
no harm comes to her
as long as you keep her in her cage.

347
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,064
She got out.

348
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,943
Well, then it's open season!

349
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,861
Just stay out of her way.

350
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,574
You know I'm not the only one
that would like to see her dead.

351
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,451
Yeah...

352
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:36,080
A long, undistinguished list.

353
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,474
Let me help you. Please.

354
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,019
Yeah.

355
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:46,817
Don't make this more complicated
than it needs to be.

356
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,446
What can I say? She needed help.

357
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,240
This is no time for personal wars,
Victoria.

358
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:56,952
Wow! That is rich coming from you.

359
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,455
Let's not forget
who made this personal, hmm?

360
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,666
He said he knew you. How?

361
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,710
What's it to you, anyway?

362
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,796
Well, they're gonna
be out all night looking for you.

363
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,632
Sooner or later, they'll come here.

364
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,092
Pity!

365
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,303
How does he know you?

366
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,765
That's what happens
when you put me in a room

367
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,184
with the piece of shit
that killed my brother. We good?

368
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,273
1000 East End.

369
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,977
That's the place.

370
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,772
Be careful in there.

371
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,243
<i>What the hell is this place?</i>

372
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,997
It's like a bad dream, isn't it?

373
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,832
This whole thing is like a bad dream.

374
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,151
You're running a little... late.

375
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,802
Seriously?

376
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,162
They're stalling.

377
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,791
Something's not right.

378
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,170
- <i>Get out of there.</i>
- Ahem.

379
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,338
Get out of there.

380
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,223
All right, time's up.

381
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,599
Stop the machine.

382
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,986
Hm. Stop the fucking machines.
Fill the bag.

383
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,739
Hey... baby...

384
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,783
It's cool.

385
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,536
<i>All right, this creepy ass
place you have?</i>

386
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,870
<i>It makes me nauseous.</i>

387
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,747
And so does your calling me "baby."

388
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,793
Now fill the bag.

389
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,052
<i>What's your boy's name?</i>

390
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,554
The one with the Jenny Craig.

391
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,185
Billy Smalls.

392
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,688
<i>Wait, really?</i>

393
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,065
Mr. Smalls?

394
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,985
You gotta admit, it kind of lends itself

395
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,861
<i>to, like, a dozen inappropriate jokes.</i>

396
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,030
Am I right, fellas? Huh?

397
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,788
All right, it's a tough crowd.

398
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,998
You win some, you lose some.

399
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,041
Get the fuck up.

400
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,092
Can he go any slower?

401
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,136
Because if he can,
I will have to kill him.

402
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,276
It's not personal.

403
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,406
Fill the bag.

404
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,037
Do it.

405
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,583
Do it!

406
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,845
Now zip it up.

407
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:18,143
Be a gentleman and hand it to Mr. Smalls.

408
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,567
He's got a gun.

409
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,820
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

410
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,238
I'm a really good shot

411
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,991
and, uh, your boy here is a...
he's a pretty big target.

412
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,035
Hey, it's cool.

413
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,330
No one here needs to die.

414
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,957
Yeah. We agree on something.

415
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,918
Pleasure, boys.

416
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,760
Vic...

417
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:54,888
Victoria...

418
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:59,017
It looks like this is your stop.
Hand me the bag.

419
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,243
<i>Vicky...</i>

420
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,081
Fuck.

421
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,502
So, we meet again.

422
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,424
I don't know whether I should kill you...

423
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,760
or hire you.

424
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,518
This is Damon's money.

425
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,653
Hello, Damon!

426
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,699
<i>Damon!</i>

427
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,619
Hey, buddy.

428
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:02,372
<i>Ready for my closeup.</i>

429
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,709
As fun as that was to watch,

430
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,003
you, uh, might want me
to turn it on first.

431
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,592
Hello, Damon!

432
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,094
I'm ready for my closeup!

433
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:25,145
<i>Get out of there.</i>

434
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,646
Get out of there!

435
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:29,900
<i>Victoria?</i>

436
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:33,612
Vicky?

437
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,129
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

438
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,048
These German fuckers are after me.

439
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,217
<i>Listen to me.</i>

440
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,843
You're good. You're good.

441
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:02,974
Make a left here!

442
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,730
One is gone.

443
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,232
Left, left.

444
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,204
Up ahead, hard right, hard right.

445
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,331
<i>Cut her off!</i>

446
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,959
Cut her off!

447
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:29,876
Look out.

448
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:46,977
Take a left.

449
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,623
Hello?

450
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

451
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,586
You know
what's going on out there.

452
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,964
I know she took out Erik and his crew.

453
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,092
Well, it turns out
that he killed her brother.

454
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,635
And you didn't know that?

455
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,805
Well, I wasn't as sure as I am now.

456
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,807
Well...

457
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,977
I think these federal agents
are wanting to meet.

458
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,939
Told you, everybody has a price.

459
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:34,983
She done made another mess
on the East side.

460
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,820
Now that was Max. He controls them.

461
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,281
He must have called ahead.

462
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,867
Well, tell your girl no more fireworks.

463
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,744
Tell Max to butt out.

464
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,705
<i>Like he gonna listen to me?</i>

465
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:49,998
Make him.

466
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:27,160
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

467
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,536
<i>I just got off the phone with Damon.</i>

468
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,121
<i>You've got to let her go.</i>

469
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:33,458
No! I'm gonna kill this bitch right now.

470
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,180
You need to get yourself turned around.

471
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,462
You're trapped.

472
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,568
Fuck.

473
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,308
Get the truck and block the exit.

474
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:23,902
Okay, up ahead.

475
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,084
All right, the exit's just ahead.

476
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,512
Shit.

477
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,158
Oh, shit.

478
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,796
No!

479
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,180
All right.

480
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,062
How do you feel?

481
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,193
I'm tired.

482
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,362
I'm always tired.

483
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,073
Me too.

484
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:39,287
Well, your mother will be back soon.

485
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:42,498
Get some sleep.

486
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,813
My, my, my.

487
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,483
That was quite a show.

488
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,737
Where's Lily?

489
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,072
Still safe.

490
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,450
I need to know where she is.

491
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,035
You've got three more stops.

492
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,704
Fuck this!

493
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,289
Just tell me where she is.

494
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,750
Three more stops.

495
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,002
I can't believe that I actually thought
for the first time in my life

496
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,879
that someone gave a damn about us.

497
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:33,258
So if you're not going to tell me
where she is, then tell me why.

498
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,009
Why, Damon?

499
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,595
You ran drugs for the Russians.

500
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,765
You were a courier in and out of Moscow.

501
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:45,520
You and your brother are suspected
of even more, including murder.

502
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,774
So stop with the babe
in the woods routine, okay?

503
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,152
You've got three more stops.

504
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,238
Why did I have you on a pedestal?

505
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,533
Three more stops.

506
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:03,454
America's police commissioner. Wow.

507
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,459
Three. More. Stops.

508
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,047
If anything happens to her,

509
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:16,092
if there's a single scratch on her body,
I swear to God...

510
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,780
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

511
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:21,199
Is this a crooked cop convention?

512
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,371
Oof!

513
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,206
So how much we talking about here?

514
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,544
That would depend on what's on them tapes.

515
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,631
Well, they're not good.

516
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,217
Big mess for everyone involved.

517
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,135
Even the little we've heard.

518
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,222
Oh, yeah?

519
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,101
So what have you heard?
How detailed is it?

520
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,607
I would say that they are detailed enough.

521
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,318
You got names?

522
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,697
Oh, we certainly do, Detective Kehoe.

523
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,866
The problem is, is that, uh,

524
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,952
he wasn't just wearing a wire.

525
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,913
He was taping phone calls.

526
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:13,751
Phone calls and wires
going back two years.

527
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,670
We're talking the Governor on down.

528
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,091
- And?
- And?

529
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:25,096
Well, "and" is that I just don't know.

530
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:29,600
I mean, this could be
the biggest case of my career, man.

531
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:32,603
Cush job in Washington.

532
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,981
A talking head on T.V., I mean...

533
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,775
Just look at this face, huh?

534
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,404
I belong on television, don't I?

535
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,201
Yeah. I suppose.

536
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,744
Well, ahem...

537
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,748
taking that into consideration...

538
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:58,504
the deal that we might strike would have
to make a whole hell lot of sense.

539
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,346
Oh, it makes sense.

540
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,814
I'm gonna make a call.

541
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,016
What kind of a priest are you?

542
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,147
I stopped being a priest a long time ago.

543
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:56,038
Don't go back the way you came.

544
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,834
<i>They're over at your bike.</i>

545
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,002
Be safe.

546
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,845
I know Damon cares about you.

547
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,849
- Bullshit.
- And your daughter.

548
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,867
Hey, baby.

549
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,663
That was easy.

550
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,050
<i>This Nazi won't let it go.</i>

551
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,139
Any suggestions, Damon?

552
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,516
Left, two blocks.

553
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:40,893
<i>There's a back alley.</i>

554
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,438
<i>Now he won't be able to follow you there.</i>

555
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,283
Where the fuck is it?

556
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,618
Take a left!

557
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,079
How many times can I turn left?

558
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,789
<i>As many times as needed.</i>

559
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,877
I'm gonna be back at square one.

560
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,087
Left, left.

561
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,256
Fuck you and your left.

562
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,360
Nicely done.

563
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,741
Fucking shit!

564
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:17,490
Hey!

565
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,871
Who the hell is this guy?

566
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,748
What does it matter?

567
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,672
He's a cop.

568
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:35,049
Dirty cop.

569
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,428
Is there any other kind in this city?

570
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:42,348
He was particularly bad.

571
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,560
Well, what the fuck are you?

572
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,562
Again, what does it matter?

573
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,774
It matters because the only person
that's allowed to kill you is me,

574
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,651
after I get my daughter back.

575
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,027
It's none of your concern.

576
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,613
Everything is my concern.

577
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,240
You've got two more stops.

578
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,493
All right, I can play this game.

579
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,204
Hmm.

580
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,082
I put money on him being your partner.

581
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,669
So there's only two options...
greed or double-cross.

582
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,505
Which one was it?

583
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,966
It doesn't concern you.

584
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,467
I need to get my daughter back!

585
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,598
He probably thought his youth
and strength would help him.

586
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,934
It's no match
for age and cunning, is it?

587
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:32,773
In a couple of hours,
you'll be totally free of all of this.

588
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:34,900
Are you insane?

589
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,527
We will never be free of this!

590
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,821
You're making damn sure of that!

591
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,072
Trust me.

592
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,366
All right?

593
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,701
Two more stops.

594
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,419
And get rid of that for me.

595
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,728
<i>Mom!</i>

596
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,034
Help me!

597
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:21,256
Well, hot damn!

598
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,927
You must be the infamous runner <i>du jour.</i>

599
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,138
How you doin', honey?

600
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,266
My name is Rayo.

601
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,686
It's not that hard to say-o. Okay-o?

602
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,064
Is that Damon?

603
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,526
Hisies!

604
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,111
<i>How ya doin', tiger?</i>

605
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,072
<i>Wish you were here and all that shit.</i>

606
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:49,326
Well, you've had quite an evening.

607
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,747
I heard you killed more people
than Quentin Tarantino.

608
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,043
Fancy a mint julep?

609
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,630
No.

610
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,800
Oh, come on. Let your hair down.

611
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,095
Metaphorically,
'cause you ain't got much there.

612
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,183
After all that murder and mayhem,

613
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,602
I mean, you'd think that you'd be parched.

614
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,566
C'mon, have a little sippy sip.

615
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,526
Mommy don't like to drink alone.

616
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,821
<i>Oh, hush.</i>

617
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:29,408
What, you don't trust little old me?

618
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,035
I don't trust anybody.

619
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,413
But I'll take a water.

620
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:37,583
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'll take that then.

621
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,876
Cheers.

622
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:42,838
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

623
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,465
He's a snake.

624
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,133
<i>These are my boys.</i>

625
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:53,557
This is Boy Cock, Man Cock, Robo Cock.

626
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,935
<i>Money!</i>

627
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,730
<i>Oh, boys, not that you ain't money,</i>

628
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,607
but you ain't.

629
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,277
Ah, boys, hello.

630
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,321
This here, is Miss...

631
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,865
I'm not here to socialize. Ahem.

632
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,658
I'm here to get this.

633
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,994
<i>Okay.</i>

634
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:16,455
You are strong.

635
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:18,499
<i>You are strong...</i>

636
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:19,917
<i>You are strong...</i>

637
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,836
- Shit.
- <i>You should be.</i>

638
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,091
- <i>You are strong...</i>
- Kicking in right about...

639
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,926
- <i>Kicking in...</i>
- Now...

640
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,886
- <i>You're strong...</i>
- <i>Right about...</i>

641
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,184
Vicky?

642
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,354
<i>Vicky?</i>

643
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,816
I told you!
It was the best in town.

644
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:47,069
<i>Vicky, don't pass out.</i>

645
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:50,239
Stay awake. Stay awake.

646
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:51,949
- <i>Don't pass out.</i>
- It's the best in town.

647
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,867
<i>...in town...</i>

648
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:59,414
I can't believe you don't remember me.

649
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:02,292
I knew your brother quite well.

650
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,920
Don't pass out, Vicky.
Don't pass out.

651
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,298
He worked for me multiple times
and even ripped me off...

652
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:10,926
<i>...ripped me off...</i>

653
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,973
<i>This was before he worked for Damon.</i>

654
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,016
Listen to my voice.

655
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,768
Stay with me.

656
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:23,897
Now before you tell me
you don't know anything about this...

657
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,774
- <i>Don't pass out, Vicky.</i>
- ...I went to your brother's place...

658
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,776
and you were there.

659
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:31,405
I questioned him and questioned him.

660
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,657
He claimed that he knew
nothing about anything.

661
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,367
<i>Don't pass out.</i>

662
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,202
- But you and I both know...
- <i>Stay awake.</i>

663
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:39,621
...that is bull-fucking-shit.

664
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:42,082
Damn it, Vicky, don't... don't pass out.

665
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:45,043
My friend had an arms deal...

666
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,254
a million dollars that I helped broker.

667
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,173
- <i>Fight it! Fight it, Vicky!</i>
- The last thing I heard from him

668
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:54,011
is that he met a beautiful Australian
woman in a bar in Berlin.

669
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:55,429
<i>...in Berlin.</i>

670
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,181
Damn it, Vic, don't pass out.

671
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,265
- <i>Stay with me.</i>
- Sound familiar?

672
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,311
The description matches you to a T.

673
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,478
<i>Fight it, Vic.</i>

674
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,397
I never saw my friend again.

675
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,901
Nor the money.

676
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,570
Later I learned that that was
what you and brother did.

677
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:16,366
You guys stole cash from couriers
that were moving it back and forth.

678
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,036
You seduced He-Rod.

679
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,496
Imagine how happy I was

680
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,874
when I heard
you were going to be here tonight.

681
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,668
Vicky. Vicky.

682
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:27,836
The coke.

683
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,215
The coke!

684
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:32,507
Oh, are you trying to talk??

685
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,844
Ooh, I can't hear you.

686
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,139
No!

687
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:09,002
<i>Vicky.</i>

688
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,357
They say that shit will kill you.

689
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:12,899
So?

690
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,529
You have no idea how lucky you are.

691
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,782
Okay, why is that?

692
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:23,368
Well, the officer that bit it tonight?

693
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:26,830
You're lucky you took him out
when you did.

694
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,165
And, uh...

695
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,919
you're lucky to have the FBI
as your new partners.

696
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:40,510
All right, so what's this gonna cost?

697
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:43,722
Well, you know, peace of mind
don't come cheap.

698
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,186
I didn't think it would.

699
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,982
They were just about to go to the DEA.

700
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,317
They?

701
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,945
Homeland Security,
the whole nine yards.

702
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,406
No, no, no, now you said they.
Who's they?

703
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,659
Well, before we get into that,

704
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:07,162
you and I are gonna have
to have an understanding.

705
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,250
All right, let's talk.

706
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,170
We want half.

707
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,507
- Yeah.
- Half?

708
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,800
He wants half.

709
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,513
Half the whole operation.

710
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:29,893
You know what?

711
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,482
If I was a bettin' man, which I am...

712
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,445
I'd bet that's not gonna happen.

713
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:49,204
Well, if I was you,
I would make it happen.

714
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,543
If I was you, I'd be worried
about all the scumbags

715
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,586
that might get their feelings hurt

716
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,338
when they find out
what you allowed to go down

717
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,841
right under your goddamn
crooked cop nose.

718
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,851
Do we have a deal?

719
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,482
It ain't entirely up to me.

720
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,234
Well, then, you know,

721
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,945
I guess I'll just send the tapes on
up the chain, right?

722
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,545
Time is not your friend, friend.

723
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,982
Hello.

724
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,192
Damon?

725
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:03,028
That's right.

726
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:06,865
What are you doing
answering Childs' phone?

727
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,200
<i>Well, he's dead.</i>

728
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:10,035
He's what?!

729
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,412
Yeah. I shot him.

730
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:14,915
And he's dead?

731
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,043
<i>I'm pretty sure.</i>

732
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,589
<i>You're kidding me! What happened?</i>

733
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,841
Well, you'd have to ask him.

734
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:27,886
So you're not gonna elaborate?

735
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,014
<i>He came into my home,</i>

736
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:34,100
didn't say a word, pulled a gun on me,
so I shot him.

737
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,188
<i>And you had no idea?</i>

738
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:41,358
I'm sure he had a good reason.
We just didn't have time to talk.

739
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:49,366
Well, the Feds said Rick has a partner.

740
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,911
Hmm... Maybe Childs.

741
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,746
I never liked him.

742
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,540
<i>Trusted him even less.</i>

743
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:59,251
Okay, well, they want half of everything.

744
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:03,213
<i>Well, they could have asked for more.</i>

745
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:06,383
And you're good with that?

746
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,010
You've got my vote.

747
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,100
Well, okay.

748
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,272
So I guess everybody
is gonna have to weigh in.

749
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:25,318
Hmm. Well, get the tapes, start listening.

750
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:27,070
We'll figure it all out.

751
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,221
Almost done.

752
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,682
One more stop.

753
01:13:57,976 --> 01:13:59,519
Where?

754
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,063
The convention Center.

755
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,442
Marcel Gauthier.

756
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:11,906
The union boss?

757
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:13,825
Hmm.

758
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,453
You saved the best for last, huh?

759
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,956
When you get back,
I'll tell you how to find Lillian.

760
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:45,500
Park and leave your bike there.

761
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,510
<i>Vicky...</i>

762
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,224
It's been a while, Vicky!

763
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:05,562
What's that?

764
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,397
Cocaine?

765
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:10,191
Just arriving from a party.

766
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,736
Nice.

767
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,654
Where's the money?

768
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:20,076
That's Damon, right?

769
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:26,499
The money is in the truck.

770
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,676
You remember
I speak French. Interesting.

771
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:40,305
I actually remember
a lot of things.

772
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:42,557
I remember your brother.

773
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,601
He could speak lots of languages,
like you.

774
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,854
Like he could say
"Fuck off" like in, I don't know,

775
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,397
dozens of languages.

776
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:55,653
<i>Cool story.</i>

777
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,074
See where it took him.

778
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,368
He was a funny guy!

779
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,455
Very charming.

780
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,665
Very crooked too.

781
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:11,252
You were a good team.

782
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:15,673
Eh, you talk too much.

783
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:20,303
Do you remember
that delivery in Morocco?

784
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:24,516
Yeah, you know, I don't remember that.

785
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:25,975
Really?

786
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,189
Nope.

787
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,607
It didn't go too well.

788
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:37,779
You know you're only alive
because of your friend, Damon.

789
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:44,244
<i>And I'm gonna say that
to the both of you.</i>

790
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,411
<i>I could kill you right now.</i>

791
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:46,746
It's a trap.

792
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,581
Your remains disappear.

793
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:49,999
<i>Get out of there.</i>

794
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,584
And what could he do about it?

795
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:54,712
How much time does he
have left to protect you?

796
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:56,256
You and your daughter.

797
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,390
Get the hell out of there.

798
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:12,981
Get out.

799
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:23,575
Keep going.

800
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,853
You really fucked up my night.

801
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:42,695
We're good.

802
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:43,780
Get up.

803
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,207
Sit down.

804
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:59,253
- Anything else, Governor?
- Thanks.

805
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:31,536
Here, it's just water. Drink it.

806
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:53,141
I need to figure out whether you and Damon
are in on this together.

807
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,773
In on what?

808
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,359
Well, nearly every enemy
that you've ever had,

809
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,737
you've managed to eliminate in one night.

810
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,532
Yeah, well, ahem,
I'm a good at my job and I'm a good shot.

811
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,243
- What's your... what's your point?
- Come on, Victoria.

812
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,954
That's not an accident.
That's been designed.

813
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,040
Ah, designed.

814
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,377
Clearly, yes, by Damon.

815
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,130
Why tonight?

816
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:27,717
- I-I don't know.
- Bullshit.

817
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:31,929
He's never asked for your help before,

818
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:35,516
and then tonight, of all nights,
he chooses to clean house?

819
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,728
What's so special about this evening?

820
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,651
Do you know that Damon's been recording

821
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,570
everything with his partners
Rick and Childs?

822
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,199
No, no, no, no...

823
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:54,660
Ahem, that doesn't make any sense
because Childs tr-tried to kill Damon.

824
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,746
Of course. He got cold feet,

825
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,831
and tried to come over to our side.

826
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:03,044
Damon was planning to turn
the tapes over to the FBI.

827
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:05,379
But we've taken care of that.

828
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:06,839
And we'll be taking care of Damon too.

829
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:12,053
You can't hurt Damon.

830
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:15,264
Uh, I'd be more concerned
about myself if I were you.

831
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,351
I <i>am</i> thinking of myself!

832
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,687
Look, Damon has my daughter.

833
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,774
And if something happens to him,
I will not know what he did with her.

834
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:27,944
Hmm.

835
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,871
I have a lucrative proposition
to offer you.

836
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,334
We want you to come over to our side.

837
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:46,796
Find out where your daughter is
and then go get rid of Damon.

838
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:51,384
We'll also give your daughter
all the medical attention she needs.

839
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:55,388
The best doctors in the world.
The ones you can't afford.

840
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,642
Yeah, we know all about that too.

841
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:06,524
This is for you, not Damon.

842
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,734
He's not gonna be able to spend it
where he's going.

843
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,490
Take care of us, we'll take care of you.

844
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:22,915
I need to know right now.
Are you in or are you out?

845
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:28,004
What are you asking me to do?

846
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,924
I want you to kill the motherfucker.

847
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,349
Shit.

848
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,394
I'm gonna need a car.

849
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,564
Oh, and, uh, my... my guns back

850
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,859
and that sweet whiskey
that you had before.

851
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:53,696
Very smart.

852
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,719
So?

853
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,306
So what, baby boy?

854
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:37,698
Governor Driscoll?

855
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:43,329
Oh, shit!

856
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,280
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

857
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,699
Get ready, honey, we're leaving.

858
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,915
They're coming for you.

859
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:11,167
Hmm.

860
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:15,004
That's the idea.

861
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:19,592
This is all behind you now.

862
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:24,096
The money is yours. All of it.

863
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,806
What do you mean?

864
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:32,521
You're coming with me.

865
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:35,316
No, no, I have to stay here.

866
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,693
A few loose ends I have to wrap up.

867
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:40,946
- I can do that.
- No, no.

868
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,907
This is something I have to do...

869
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,950
for myself.

870
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:46,327
Why?

871
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,332
I've had enough.

872
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:02,343
Now go.

873
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,643
You have to make her well.

874
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:15,106
I liked my plan better.

875
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:27,284
Thank you.

876
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,592
Wow, cool car, mom!

877
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,485
Where the hell is he?

878
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,499
Hail, hail.

879
01:29:40,668 --> 01:29:43,212
The gang's all here.
