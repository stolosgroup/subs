00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:01,442
Good evening.

3
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,483
My niece would like a bike for
Christmas.

4
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:19,192
It's nice, but I don't like red. Do
you have it in blue?

5
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:24,483
- Do I have to order one of these?
- Can I have one, please?

6
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,525
Nothing in life is shown.

7
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:32,567
Christmas is a long time. Maybe I'll
give you one. Maybe you don't.

8
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:37,650
- I think I'll get it.
- God willing.

9
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,400
We'll see.

10
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:43,317
(the car will not start)

11
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:49,733
(your phone is buzzing)

12
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,233
It's Dad.

13
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:01,400
- Hey, baby. Is everything OK?
- Everything okay. Mathilde left?

14
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,525
No. She's had her bike stolen at the
station, so I'm going to take her.

15
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:09,233
- But now the car won't start.
- Oh, it.

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,483
- Do you want me to call you a little
later?
- <i>She's missing the first hour
anyway.</i>

17
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,525
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Well, they've asked me to stay.

18
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,442
How long?

19
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,275
Three months.

20
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,108
Isn't he coming home?

21
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,733
Then.

22
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,442
Well.

23
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:56,025
That way we won't have him sitting in
the barn staring.

24
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:05,358
Came. Let's go down to the train. Put
the phone away.

25
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:08,733
Came. We're going to take a truancy
day.

26
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,150
The algorithm concluded unequivocally
that

27
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:19,692
- that lowest income group drove Kia,
Fiat and Hyundai.

28
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,400
The middle income group drove larger
Toyotas, Ford and Volvo.

29
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:30,317
- while the top group predominantly
chose Mercedes, Tesla and Audi.

30
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:34,233
- And how did it do that? The.
- Otto, I'm going to stop you right
here.

31
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,442
How long have you and your team spent
on this algorithm?

32
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,983
Uha. It's hard to tell.

33
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,775
- 46 weeks.
- A lot was going on in the evening
hours.

34
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:49,983
One year and four million on an
algorithm that shows

35
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,067
- that the poor drive Kia, and the
rich Mercedes?

36
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:57,275
What's interesting is that the
algorithm itself found and juxtaposed
-

37
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:01,608
- 82,504 registration certificates
with tax returns in 46 municipalities
-

38
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:05,067
- to form the statistical basis.

39
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:08,275
Are there contexts that are
interesting to us?

40
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:12,317
Yes, yes, but that's not the goal.
You need to think bigger.

41
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:16,108
This algorithm will, when we get
enough processing power,

42
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,317
- be able to predict events.

43
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,775
Can you explain it? Incidents such as?

44
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:25,900
All events are the product of a
series of prior events.

45
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:30,900
We most often have insufficient data
and categorize it as coincidences.

46
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,650
But it's not. If a drunk driver
crashes in a snowstorm,

47
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:40,442
- we don't call it a coincidence as
we have data to conclude.

48
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:45,483
But imagine that the error was
discovered before it happened.

49
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,942
What is macrodaktyli?

50
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:54,775
That means club foot. My father's
sister in Horsens suffers from it.

51
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:59,650
The algorithm has examined links
between club foot and hearing?

52
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,483
- It's one of my big.
- Let me do the talking.

53
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,983
Here, the algorithm collected 41,534
patient records from 1912 to 2020.

54
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,192
The earliest it found was...

55
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:18,858
Was there a connection between being
lump-footed and hearing badly?

56
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:23,275
Context? No. No, not at all.

57
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,817
- I thought it was nice.
- Well, that's nice.

58
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,525
Don't you want to sit here? There's a
single seat.

59
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,983
No, I don't have to. I'm fine.

60
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,233
No, at last. I need to stretch my
legs so that it...

61
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:48,108
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

62
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,817
(panicked breathing)

63
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,733
(screams and crying in the background)

64
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,900
Mother?

65
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,567
Mother?

66
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,275
Good work, boys.

67
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:22,942
I'll meet you in the tent for debrief
in 05.

68
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,150
<i>Police are still carrying out
inquiries.</i>

69
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:03,067
<i>All train traffic on the line has
been suspended.</i>

70
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:06,358
<i>The police ruled out the
possibility of terrorism.</i>

71
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:10,067
- <i>And right now, there's no
indication that this is anything
other than an accident.</i>

72
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,483
<i>The accident happened at 3:31
p.m.</i>

73
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,192
- <i>when part of a parked freight
train collided with the S train.</i>

74
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:22,317
<i>There is mainly damage to the
right side of the train in the front
three carriages.</i>

75
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:26,025
<i>The death toll now stands at 11,
and it's confirmed-</i>

76
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:31,108
- <i>that the rocker Johan "The
Eagle" Ulrichsen and his lawyer are
dead.</i>

77
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:35,525
<i>The eagle was to testify against
his old brethren in the Riders of
Justice.</i>

78
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:38,733
- <i>among them the group's
president, Kurt "Tandem" Olesen.</i>

79
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,442
<i>The case he was supposed to
testify in is the murder case from
Kaalundsgade.</i>

80
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:48,275
- <i>where four Turkish men were
liquidated.</i>

81
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,275
(mumbles)

82
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,775
Are we going home now?

83
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,025
I don't know, I don't know. Not yet,
I think.

84
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:35,858
We are talking about four phases. The
shock phase you're in now. The
reaction phase ...

85
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:40,442
- I'd like to see my wife.
- I strongly advise against that.

86
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:43,192
I'd like to see her.

87
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:51,275
- You are perfectly entitled to...
- I'd like to see my wife.

88
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:52,317
I've been dealing with probability
calculation for 26 years.

89
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:58,358
- and there is too much to suggest
that it is not an accident.

90
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,567
Such as?

91
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:05,192
The likelihood of a crown witness in
a biker-related homicide case-

92
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:09,942
- and his lawyer are killed in a
train accident before he has to
testify.

93
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:13,525
- is according to my calculations ...
What does it say?

94
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:18,525
1:234.287.121.

95
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,442
Too large a number to ignore.

96
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,983
It's extremely unfortunate, but
there's no indication that

97
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,025
- that it is more than an accident.

98
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,733
The numbers never lie.

99
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,150
It would require someone from riders
of justice to know-

100
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:38,442
- in exactly which wagon and where in
the compartment the Eagle sat.

101
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,900
It doesn't make any sense.

102
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:45,317
That's your job. I'm just saying,
it's too big a number.

103
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:49,483
We are very grateful for that. We'll
take a look at it.

104
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,317
We thank you for today.

105
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:58,483
The problem is, I saw an extremely
suspicious man get off the train.

106
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,567
- just before the accident happened.

107
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:07,442
Yes? What was suspicious about him?

108
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,567
He boarded a Joe &amp; the Juice
sandwich and a big juice.

109
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,942
- but he ate only a small bite and
did not drink at all from the juice.

110
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:21,608
All of a sudden, he gets up, throws
out the whole sandwich and the juice,

111
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:25,025
- and get off the train.

112
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,858
Okay. Yes.

113
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,650
A Joe &amp; the Juice sandwich costs
$5.99.

114
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:35,317
65 if it is with extra filling, and a
large juice costs 54.

115
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:41,192
Nobody throws out $11.99 juice and
sandwiches like that.

116
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,400
- We'll take a look at it.
- Thank you for your help.

117
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,233
(text message audio)

118
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:35,442
- I'll be in in a minute, baby.
- It's okay. I want to go to school.

119
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:40,942
I don't think you should. If you want
to get out, we can go for a run
together.

120
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,900
I want to go to school.

121
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,192
Have you stopped running?

122
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:52,608
- No.
- When was the last time you ran?

123
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,608
I don't know, I don't know.

124
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:59,358
Then you don't run the three times a
week we agreed.

125
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:04,358
- It's for your own good.
- You're such a jerk.

126
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,192
Mathilde! Why don't I drive you then?

127
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:27,567
It wasn't an accident, it was an
assassination, but I can't prove
anything.

128
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:31,192
If you can hack us into Fitness
World's servers, there is a
possibility.

129
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,817
- Fitness World? The fitness chain?
- No, the stonemason, Lennart.

130
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:41,233
- Speak nicely, or I won't help.
- Sorry. But would you be able to?

131
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,942
A blind child can do that with his
feet.

132
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:48,608
I have hacked Fitness Worlds servers
plenty of times.

133
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,317
Have you hacked Fitness World's
servers?

134
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:55,857
- So Emmenthaler can go to pilates.
- Do Emmenthaler grow pilates?

135
00:17:56,025 --> 00:18:00,400
Not. See how little you know about
your team.

136
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:04,941
Emmenthaler has had back problems for
three years. I can't believe it!

137
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:09,317
- What do you think you can find
there?
- Eagle.

138
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:14,525
The eagle trained every day. He was
methodical.

139
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:18,275
Can we prove that he used the same
treadmill?

140
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,150
- He probably chose the same train
seat every time.

141
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,775
- And then they would have known
where he was sitting.

142
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:27,317
- Okay.
- Thank you, Lennart.

143
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:31,567
I still need to renew my crossfit
card.

144
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,483
When miracles happen, we often
attribute a divine character to them.

145
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,900
Conversely, when lightning strikes,
when tragedy is a reality,

146
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,650
- Then we'll have a hard time putting
a sender on.

147
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:49,733
- and we therefore call it
coincidences.

148
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,150
How can a merciful God share in such
a cruel tragedy?

149
00:18:55,317 --> 00:19:00,067
- like the one who tore away your
beloved mother and wife, Emma?

150
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:04,358
But if it's all coincidence, isn't it
obvious to feel...

151
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:07,025
- that everything doesn't matter?

152
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:10,108
Where do we go with all our grief?

153
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,900
- all our anger, all our fear and
loneliness?

154
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,108
(door goes)

155
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,483
- What's up, baby?
- I can't sleep.

156
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,817
Just try to close your eyes and count
down from 500, okay?

157
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:50,442
- Why do you think Mom died?
- There's no point talking about that.

158
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,900
- You think it was just a coincidence?
- Yes. Came. I'm going in.

159
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,775
- What if it wasn't a coincidence?
- What else would it be?

160
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,858
I don't know, I don't know.

161
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,983
- God?
- Stop.

162
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,067
The priest didn't get half his own
nonsense.

163
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,483
So. Now you're just trying to close
your eyes and sleep, baby.

164
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:18,442
- Grandpa believed in God.
- Yes. He wasn't too smart either.

165
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:24,900
Didn't you do that when you were
little?

166
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:29,025
I believed in Santa Claus, too, but
when you grow up,

167
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:33,233
- one must be able to distinguish
between reality and fantasy.

168
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,567
The priest was sure that God had a
reason for mom to die.

169
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:45,525
Look how crazy that sounds. That's
what insanity says.

170
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,442
Sorry.

171
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:56,817
It's just that I miss her so much.

172
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:02,817
I can't bear to think she's all alone.

173
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:10,108
I understand that.

174
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,608
But she's not alone.

175
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,567
She's nothing now. She's gone.

176
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,233
- It's so unfair.
- Yes.

177
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:33,067
When people die, they're gone
forever, baby.

178
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:38,525
And you might as well learn that now.
Because unless you die early,

179
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:41,483
- You're going to put most of the
people you love in your grave.

180
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,858
If you have to torment yourself every
time with false hope,

181
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:49,733
- About souls and angels up in
heaven, you're going to go crazy up
in your head.

182
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,400
Not?

183
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,233
So.

184
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,775
Now try to close those eyes and
sleep. Count down from 500, baby. It
helps.

185
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:23,025
(a car is approaching)

186
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:46,233
- Yes?
- Markus Hansen?

187
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:53,192
Good evening. My name is Otto
Hoffmann, and it's Lennart.

188
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:57,567
I was on the same train as your wife
and daughter.

189
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:03,442
Is your daughter okay?

190
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:06,817
- How did you find my address?
- It wasn't hard.

191
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:09,817
I told you to call first.

192
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:14,817
It's just that I was standing next to
your wife and your daughter on the
train.

193
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,483
What do you want from me?

194
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,108
I think you have a right to know that
it wasn't an accident.

195
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:29,233
Are you aware of who the rocker Johan
"The Eagle" Ulrichsen is?

196
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,233
- Can I...?
- Here you go.

197
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,192
- Just... I'm going to take these.
- That was quite a barn.

198
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:46,733
It is disproportionally large
compared to the main house.

199
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,233
- Do you know what year it's built?
- What? No. What's all that?

200
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,608
These are status certificates from
the Eagle's doctor.

201
00:23:55,775 --> 00:24:00,567
His records, criminal record, bank
details,

202
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:04,525
- telephone lists and text messages.

203
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:09,900
- Where did you get that?
- Lennart is good at finding things.

204
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:14,567
Yes. And it's not illegal. Or it's
illegal, but not much.

205
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:19,067
This is the same penalty as building
a bathing jetty without permission.

206
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,858
Why do you say it wasn't an accident?

207
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:23,983
The surveillance footage shows-

208
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,192
- that he was not only habitual, but
suffered from OCD,

209
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:29,775
- which his medicine card confirms.

210
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:33,525
He was given citalopram and diazepam,
which are given to OCD patients.

211
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:39,525
In addition, on his criminal record
there are six cases of hand-wringing
on trains.

212
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,733
At the end of November of this year,

213
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,942
- Where he kicks a retired landscaper
in the face,

214
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,983
- when he refused to give him his
seat.

215
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,817
We have the statistical abnormality.
We know riders of justice knew-

216
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:58,442
- that the eagle, due to its OCD,
always sat in the second carriage,
row two.

217
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:02,108
And then we have him here.

218
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,067
- Who is he?
- We don't know yet.

219
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:09,067
He rushed off where your family was
standing just before the accident.

220
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,650
- I guess a lot of people did.
- Yes.

221
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,233
But this guy threw out a whole
sandwich and a full juice.

222
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,483
The night before, the same man was at
Østerport Station at 10:14 p.m.

223
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,858
- where there was free passage to the
freight wagons that later hit the
train.

224
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:36,983
- Did you tell the police about this?
- We can't show them this.

225
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,400
But we've been to the police three
times. They don't give a.

226
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:46,025
They just think we're over-gifted
charlatans.

227
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:49,858
But this one's the key. We just need
to find out who he is.

228
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:52,650
We're on it, but it's not easy.

229
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:57,483
We have fierce disagreements with our
face recognition expert.

230
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,317
Are these any disagreements you can
resolve and try to find him here?

231
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:07,442
We need to bring Emmenthaler. We need
him.

232
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:11,442
Never in life! That was a great barn,
don't you think?

233
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:14,692
It was the kind of one we had in
Horsens.

234
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:19,942
- Are you sure you should back down
here?
- Yes. There's a lot of room.

235
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:35,067
Stone. There's a rock there. Be
careful.

236
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,983
The shock phase is individual. Some
want care, contact and conversation.

237
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,650
Others just want to be alone. Both
are perfectly okay.

238
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:52,317
We offer you cognitive therapy,
individually or together.

239
00:26:52,483 --> 00:26:56,317
Thanks. I'll let you know if I have
to.

240
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:02,358
We can offer a child and an adult
psychologist who will visit you.

241
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,317
- That's a great idea.
- I don't want that.

242
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:08,983
- Why not?
- Often you're not yourself...

243
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:15,317
We're trying to get our lives back,
so we're not going to have people
running around. Came.

244
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,192
yes, it's Dad again. It's 4:00,
Mathilde.

245
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:37,192
If you don't call me in five minutes,
I'm going to go look for you.

246
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:51,400
- Buster and Gustav were annoying.
- They've never spoken to me before.

247
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:56,358
Mathilde! It's 7:30. Why don't you
answer the phone?

248
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,775
- Sorry. We were at the movies.
- You have to tell me something like
that!

249
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:07,067
- Don't be out at 11:00.
- Mom and I agreed at 11:00.

250
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:12,150
- Go home with you. Into.
- No need to raise your voice.

251
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,983
- What did you say?
- I'll drive.

252
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,192
But the tone towards Mathilde may not
be what she needs.

253
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:26,525
What the fuck are you doing, man?
You're sick in the head!

254
00:28:28,692 --> 00:28:31,358
(moped starts)

255
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:48,275
- Honey, open the door.
- No!

256
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:53,317
You can just kick it in, you fucking
mugging psycho!

257
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,692
Mathilde, I didn't mean to hit that
hard.

258
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:02,900
I shouldn't have hit.

259
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:08,775
Who was he?

260
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:12,567
Are you dating?

261
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,900
I don't know when you just him up!

262
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,775
Yes, it was also ...

263
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:20,817
I didn't know he was your girlfriend.

264
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:23,858
You don't know anything. You haven't
been here. You don't know anything
about me.

265
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:26,858
You don't know me at all!

266
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,733
Would you please open?

267
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,358
I've gone to bed.

268
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,275
Okay.

269
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:43,150
Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow,
won't you?

270
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,025
- What do you want from me?
- This is Otto and Lennart.

271
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:24,317
I can see that. Go away.

272
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:29,358
Come on, Emmenthaler. We need you.
We're unraveling a murder case.

273
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,692
<i>We brought pizza.</i>

274
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:55,317
I've got him. Aharon Nahas Shadid, 38.

275
00:30:55,483 --> 00:31:01,150
Works as a clinical dental
technician. Nazlet al-Seman al-Kebli
21.

276
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:05,150
- Nazlet el-Semman, al-Haram, Cairo,
Egypt.

277
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,567
- Then it's not him.
- The.

278
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,442
He is the only match above 99.12% on
the biometric markers.

279
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:14,525
Stick to matches at Danish addresses.

280
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:20,067
Have you followed me? There is no
nossefucking match in Pisdanmark.

281
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:23,525
What is the highest match of one in
Denmark?

282
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:28,983
I haven't looked at that. There's
nothing above the 99.12% limit.

283
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,567
No, but I'm thinking, for example, if
you lowered the limit,

284
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,942
- to, for example, 95%?

285
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:39,608
We can do that, but it doesn't make
any sense.

286
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:44,067
When you need to qualify for the
Olympics in high jump, there is a
requirement ...

287
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:47,108
I don't know if I want to hear that
Olympics story for the third time!

288
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:50,650
We get it, but now we're asking you
to change it.

289
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:54,775
- so we don't just find people in
fucking South America and Africa.

290
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:57,567
I think we're just fucking shitty
stuffing here.

291
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,942
I'm not going to put up with that
dick. Take the pizza and leave the
apartment.

292
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:06,358
- You ate that, you fat pig.
- So. So. Relax, both of you.

293
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,650
Emmenthaler, try listening sometime.

294
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:15,900
The two surveillance footage we have
was taken from high angles.

295
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:21,358
- so any match will still be subject
to some uncertainty, right?

296
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,942
The. We don't have enough biometric
data for a 100-% match.

297
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:31,317
No, so now we're asking you to show
us what you found in Denmark, right?

298
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:35,233
Okay, but it just doesn't make any
sense.

299
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:46,400
There's a 95.84% there. Can we see
him? Please?

300
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,692
It's him. It's him.

301
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,608
I know him from the train.

302
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:08,483
Palle Olesen. Look at that.

303
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,233
Fuck.

304
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,400
Good morning, baby. Are you hungry?

305
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:29,317
- I bought eggs and rye bread.
- I don't eat eggs.

306
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,025
Spend less time saving empty cans.

307
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:34,733
- and empty the ashtray. It's
disgusting.

308
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,067
What do I have to do to make it up to
you?

309
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,483
Do you want me to call him? Talk to
his parents and apologize?

310
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,150
He's said he fell because he doesn't
believe in revenge.

311
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:50,192
He could have turned you in to the
police. You gave him a black eye.

312
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:52,900
What if I make spaghetti meat sauce?

313
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:56,150
Then we can eat here, and then I can
say I'm sorry.

314
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,483
Spaghetti meat sauce? You think we're
three years old?

315
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,192
Then takeaway. Just tell me what you
want.

316
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:06,525
Come on, Mathilde. I'm doing the best
I can.

317
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,733
I'll ask him.

318
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,358
There's the barn, Emmenthaler.

319
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:34,608
- Hi.
- Hi.

320
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:37,108
It's Emmenthaler.

321
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:42,275
Have you found out who he is?

322
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:47,983
Everyone's been looking forward to
seeing the barn, so why don't we go
over there and talk?

323
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:52,192
His name is Palle Olesen.

324
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:58,525
He is a trained electrical technician
specializing in train components.

325
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:03,358
And he's the one who got off before
the accident and hung out by the
freight wagons?

326
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:06,067
It's getting better. He's a brother.

327
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:11,358
- to Kurt "Tandem" Olesen, president
of riders of justice.

328
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:23,483
- The one the Eagle was supposed to
testify against.
- Shut up. He knows that.

329
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,650
So they are simply brothers.

330
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:34,192
Everybody's in on the fact that we're
on our way to a psychopathic biker,
right?

331
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,608
No. He's an electrical mechanic
specializing in train components.

332
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:42,942
"Possession of drugs, violence,
aggravated assault,

333
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,442
- theft, complicity in manslaughter,
illegal possession of weapons,

334
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,983
- horse theft, drug possession,
possession of weapons..."

335
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,066
Then he's an electrical mechanic who
moves in an inflamed environment.

336
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:58,942
- And who stole a horse.
- Who at one point stole a horse.

337
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:02,857
- That still doesn't make him a
rocker.
- Let's talk to him.

338
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:06,150
See how he reacts, and then we go to
the police.

339
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,317
- Take a ride. He's not ready yet.
- Dav. My name is Markus.

340
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,567
It could be. He's not ready. Take a
ride.

341
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:40,983
- My wife was on the train.
- He was there, too.

342
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,442
- We know you were on the train, too.
- What the fuck is going on?

343
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:47,483
- We would like to ask you ...
- You have to get out of here now.

344
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,025
- If I may...
- All you have to do is shut your ass
right now.

345
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:54,400
Are you going to have a bullet
between your eyes? Get out of here.

346
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:59,442
Bring your three little pigs. Get out
of here, I'll tell you!

347
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,983
At least we got it sorted out.

348
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,275
Markus. No, no, no. Markus.

349
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:21,775
Fucking...

350
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:50,608
Is he dead?

351
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:58,358
- Yes. Do you want me to call the
police?
- No, we can't.

352
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:02,692
- It was in self-defense.
- No police. Let's get out of here.

353
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:07,025
If we don't report it, we'll at least
have to remove the body.

354
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:11,400
Forensic evidence traps the
perpetrator in 87.4% of all homicides.

355
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:16,275
Markus' DNA is all over him.
Emmenthaler, come in here and help.

356
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:19,567
- Now! Before anyone sees you.
- We can't take him with us.

357
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:23,942
It's overly illegal. I don't want to
be a part of that.

358
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:28,358
It was a mistake.

359
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:33,567
I shouldn't have done that. I made a
mistake.

360
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:37,275
- We're leaving now.
- He deserved it.

361
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,692
He deserved it.

362
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:44,067
If you knew how many times these have
been after me.

363
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,525
You're not so cool anymore, are you?

364
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:50,858
See if you can bully now, you.

365
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:56,358
Who's a little pig now, you fucking
pussy dick?

366
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,525
- Emmenthaler. So, then.
- Cock!

367
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:03,983
- Pussy!
- So, Emmenthaler. Okay?

368
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,400
- Well. Let's go.
- What about him?

369
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:10,192
We can't bring a dead man.

370
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:13,858
Let me see if there's a DNA-degrading
cleaner.

371
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:17,900
Find something that contains sodium
hydroxide or hydrogen nitride.

372
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:21,275
- Benzylsulfamide is the best.
- Stop chemistry class.

373
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,358
Thanks! Get in the car and wait, and
I'll take care of it.

374
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,067
Have you killed anyone before?

375
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:19,108
At least it looked like it wasn't the
first time.

376
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:23,900
I'm sure you've always worn a uniform
when you've done it.

377
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:27,067
Let's just be quiet, Emmenthaler.

378
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:30,358
I understand how you feel, Markus.

379
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:34,900
When I was little, I loved playing
horns.

380
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:41,983
- How does that correspond to...?
- Let me speak out. .

381
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,608
I played in tivoligarden in red
uniform and black bearskin hat, -

382
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:51,067
- But when I turned 17, you couldn't
be in it anymore.

383
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:54,067
Yes, then you were alone.

384
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:57,150
I tried to play a couple of times.

385
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:01,358
- But it was as if me and the uniform
had played together.

386
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,233
- And I couldn't do it alone.

387
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:09,150
Why don't we put some music on?

388
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,483
Yes. That's it.

389
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:53,650
- I'm not going all the way up.
- You want him to take a cab home?

390
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:57,108
I don't want to back out. Last time I
bumped into the fence.

391
00:41:57,275 --> 00:42:02,900
- Go all the way up to the house,.
- Are you paying for the record work?

392
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:27,025
- Hi. Sirius is here.
- Yep.

393
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,233
- Hey, Sirius.
- Hi.

394
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,358
- And I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize for that.

395
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:38,692
This is a difficult time for you.

396
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:42,817
Yep. Okay. Fine.

397
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:50,358
There is a link between people's
professions and crisis management.

398
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:53,775
A yoga teacher meditates on his
problems.

399
00:42:53,942 --> 00:43:00,567
An athlete will add an element of
competition and so on.

400
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:04,983
And violence is a big part of your
work and your everyday life.

401
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,067
It's a part of you, Dad, and it's
probably been for so long.

402
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:13,025
- that it is the only option you know
about.

403
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:16,150
Do you understand what we're saying
to you?

404
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:18,442
Yes, I think so.

405
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:22,442
What if you're a baker?

406
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:27,900
How do you resolve conflicts if
you're a baker?

407
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:31,483
You cannot use the model in all
professions.

408
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,942
Well, it's such a model.

409
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:40,900
- So, what else have you been up to
today?
- You need help.

410
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,400
Have you talked to anyone?

411
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,942
- Yes.
- With whom?

412
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:52,525
With you. We'll talk.

413
00:43:52,692 --> 00:43:55,817
Sirius meant a professional. And no,
we don't.

414
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,858
I think so.

415
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:02,233
My mother is a psychologist and is
available if it finally is.

416
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,942
Come on, Mathilde.

417
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:23,067
- What do you want me to do?
- You need help, Dad.

418
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:29,650
Let the crisis psychologists come
here. That would be good for both of
us.

419
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:44,067
I can't, baby. Not right now. I can't
figure that out.

420
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:53,442
(door slams)

421
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,817
<i>Today, a verdict was reached in
the case of the Kaalundsgade
killings.</i>

422
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:11,233
<i>Two riders of justice members were
sentenced to 16 years in prison.</i>

423
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,442
- <i>while Kurt "Tandem" Olesen, who
is seen here leaving the courtroom
-</i>

424
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:20,608
- <i>with Kenneth "Turbot" Jensen,
was acquitted on all counts.</i>

425
00:45:20,775 --> 00:45:24,317
<i>Of course we're disappointed, but
without the Eagle's testimony,</i>

426
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:27,942
- <i>We were standing on the
ground.</i>

427
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:30,108
<i>A brief statement?</i>

428
00:45:30,275 --> 00:45:34,317
<i>It's a great day for my brothers
and I and for the legal
consciousness.</i>

429
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:39,233
<i>There's not much to celebrate, is
there? Now I'm thinking about your
brother's death.</i>

430
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,025
<i>He wanted us to celebrate the
victory of justice.</i>

431
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:50,108
<i>So we do. Today we're going to
party, drink and.</i>

432
00:45:56,858 --> 00:46:00,525
- Thank you for coming.
- What are we going to do?

433
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:05,025
I'm going to ask you to find
everything you can on riders of
justice.

434
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:08,775
How many members they have, what they
are punished and suspected of.

435
00:46:08,942 --> 00:46:11,858
Names, addresses, family
relationships, everything.

436
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:15,525
Is that something you can do without
it being traceable?

437
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:28,108
- We understand it's easy for you.
- It's easy for me.

438
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:32,025
- What are you going to do with it?
- I want to avenge my wife.

439
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:34,358
Are you going to kill them?

440
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,733
- I'm in.
- No. Make sure I get close.

441
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,900
- I'll take care of the rest.
- We want to do it all.

442
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:46,150
In fact, we have talked about
something similar. I'd like to help.

443
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:49,108
We haven't talked about killing
people.

444
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:53,817
No, but you'd empty their accounts
and join associations.

445
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:56,817
There's a leap from that to killing.

446
00:46:56,983 --> 00:47:02,067
We want to avenge it. If you deal
with this deal,

447
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:06,358
- It will be Markus who is
responsible for the very illegal part
of it.

448
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:10,692
Otto, they're bikers. We're not going
to bomb a crèche. We're in.

449
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:15,525
We collect information on them, but
we don't kill anyone.

450
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:18,358
- I knew it.
- You're a bad leader.

451
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:23,108
That's how we do it. You get
information, and I'll take care of
the rest.

452
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:27,150
- You just call me if it is, right?
- Yes.

453
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,775
I'll see you.

454
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:52,025
- Hi.
- Why are you home so early?

455
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:56,192
It's Wednesday. We're off at 2:00.
What's going on?

456
00:47:57,442 --> 00:48:01,942
The one who was on the train. Him and
Mom, they talked.

457
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,567
That's right. It's Otto. He was on
the train, yes.

458
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:21,067
- What's going on, Dad?
- Yes, it's because he...

459
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:27,150
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

460
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:31,025
We've had a confrontation between
your father and Otto.

461
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:34,483
Otto feels guilty that he gave your
mother his place.

462
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,900
- It's been very rewarding.
- Really rewarding.

463
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:41,692
Yes. That's what we're doing,
Mathilde.

464
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,525
No, Dad. Thanks!

465
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:51,192
I was hoping you'd let them come. I'd
like to talk to them, too.

466
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,942
Yes. Who do you want to talk to?

467
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:59,608
With the crisis psychologists. You're
psychologists, aren't you?

468
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:01,983
You have to say we are.

469
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,483
- Are you a child or adult
psychologist?
- Adult.

470
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,858
Dr.med., PhD Lennart Horsens...
Horsensbygård.

471
00:49:10,025 --> 00:49:14,775
Mr Davs, Member of the Commission.
And that's my colleague, child
psychologist Ulf Emmenthaler.

472
00:49:14,942 --> 00:49:18,650
Ulf Emmenthaler, crisis child
psychologist.

473
00:49:18,817 --> 00:49:23,233
Hi. I'm kind of in between. What
would you advise me to do?

474
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,483
Therapeutically, you're an adult. I'm
the one you need to talk to.

475
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,358
- You can wait, too.
- No. That's what we're here for.

476
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:35,358
It's good to break down the first
barriers right now.

477
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,858
Come on, Mathilde.

478
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:43,192
Lennart's capable.

479
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,483
He's been with over 25 psychologists
in the last 40 years.

480
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,900
He is personally in contact with
virtually all diagnoses.

481
00:49:55,525 --> 00:50:01,192
The other day, Sirius and I saw a dog
get hit by a car. It screamed and
bled.

482
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,567
- You're afraid of being run over.
- No.

483
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:09,483
I felt no pity. I didn't feel
anything when I saw it.

484
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:14,108
Maybe it's because you lost your
mother.

485
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:18,233
I'm not buying it because my mother's
dead, and I'm in mourning.

486
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,775
- so I can't feel anything for anyone
else.

487
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:27,525
That's not what I was going to say,
but it doesn't matter now.

488
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,983
I'm afraid I look like my father.

489
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:37,983
I'm sorry every morning and I don't
care about everything.

490
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,317
Of course you look like him. You
carry his genes.

491
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:44,650
If I have children, they'll have
those genes, too.

492
00:50:44,817 --> 00:50:48,608
- and becomes indifferent to others
and violent and cold in the ass.

493
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:52,275
- You can't say that.
- Statistically, they will.

494
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:55,233
Statistically, you can drown in a
puddle.

495
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,108
But you don't walk around and you're
afraid of that.

496
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:04,150
So much shit has happened that it's
unlikely that more will happen.

497
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:09,983
That's not how statistics work. A lot
of terrible things can happen.

498
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,942
There will most likely be. But there
will also be some good ones.

499
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:17,192
- and we should try to focus on them
now.

500
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:23,358
Remember the first time you saw
something terrible on TV?

501
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:29,733
Yes. Yes, we once saw footage from
Auschwitz at school.

502
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,442
- There were dead people in piles.
- Yes, yes.

503
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:38,233
- Did you get so upset about that?
- Yes.

504
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,692
Or I got more scared, I guess. But I
wasn't that big back then.

505
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:50,067
Yes, I was big.

506
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:54,400
- But I wasn't very old, I mean.

507
00:51:56,775 --> 00:52:01,025
Quiet. If there was one thing I
learned in Horsens, it's-

508
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:04,567
- that people lose feelings about
repetition.

509
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:07,317
We're not laughing at the same joke
for the third time.

510
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:11,025
You stop crying when you're abused.

511
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:17,358
- time and time again by his father
or by all his uncles -

512
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:20,275
- out in a barn for example.

513
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:31,733
My point is that emotions arise when
we are surprised or stimulated.

514
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,525
There's death and mutilation on
YouTube or on TV.

515
00:52:35,692 --> 00:52:38,192
- and therefore you do not feel
anything.

516
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:43,983
- You think that's just it?
- 100 %. You're not callous.

517
00:52:45,192 --> 00:52:48,317
But you're fat.

518
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:52,442
- What?
- Yes. You're a little fat salge
sausage.

519
00:53:05,817 --> 00:53:08,692
Does he speak Danish, that one?

520
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:13,025
Do you speak Danish? What did you
tell the police?

521
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:16,400
Nothing. I don't see anything. I
don't hear anything.

522
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:20,775
- I'm like a little potato.
- You see this?

523
00:53:20,942 --> 00:53:25,525
Maybe you remember a little better,
too. Do you remember your name?

524
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:28,733
Bodashka Litvinenko.

525
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,358
No, it's not going to work.

526
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:35,150
Your name is Jens-Ole. It's easier
for us to remember.

527
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:39,108
Yes. It's a lot easier. Thanks. Thank
you very much for your new name.

528
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:44,983
Bon appétit. If you don't remember
now, I'm going to break your little
fingers.

529
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,567
And the last thing you hear, this is
the one saying bang!

530
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:57,358
- Let me hear it.
- I only saw one man.

531
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,317
He was well dressed. Handsome man.

532
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:05,275
He kind of looks a bit like the guy
with the guitar in Queen. Rockband.

533
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:09,275
But I hear them shouting a name.

534
00:54:09,442 --> 00:54:12,067
One name. Rectums.

535
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:18,650
- End of the world?
- No, no. Rectums.

536
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:23,067
Like the cheese sandwich. They shout
it many times.

537
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:29,150
- Ellemtaner?
- Or emmentaler.

538
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,733
Emmentaler.

539
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:46,233
Okay. It's the last of them.

540
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:57,150
- Do you want me to help with the
wires?
- No. Get off the wires!

541
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,400
Go away. Away.

542
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:08,483
Yes, I'm sorry, Markus. I'm going to
be furious about bad resolution.

543
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:12,608
Look at a solution Lennart's driving.
We're going to have a sore eye.

544
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:17,275
You're very close to the wires.
Please step away.

545
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,942
Get off the wires.

546
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:31,150
All right, one more. A proper sip.
And one more.

547
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:33,900
You can take more.

548
00:55:35,608 --> 00:55:40,483
- What are you guys doing?
- Drinking coke upside down.
Impossible.

549
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,150
- Lennart, Otto, come with me.
- Not in the middle of a session.

550
00:55:44,317 --> 00:55:48,400
And then it's the ice. Just go to the
ice. And eat. Eat. Lots of ice cream.

551
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:52,817
- Don't eat all that shit.
- Don't listen to him. Eat.

552
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:56,025
- Lennart, come with me.
- Don't give orders.

553
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:59,233
- Lennart knows what he's doing.
- Spit that shit out.

554
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,233
This is where you're speaking out.
Came.

555
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:06,775
Dad, I'm not afraid to be fat.

556
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:10,525
I'm not going to look like a starved
sled dog.

557
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:13,525
- because you're afraid of having an
overweight daughter.

558
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:18,442
It's cognitive therapy. Not graduated
exposure, but flooding.

559
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:23,108
- Mathilde faces his demons.
- Lennart!

560
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:26,858
- Working on a Core i9?
- Yes.

561
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:33,150
Are you a pisidiot? How am I supposed
to track something on a processor?

562
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:38,358
Somebody's got to drive in and get my
servers and my monitors right now.

563
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:42,358
- Otherwise, I'm not going to get
started on this. computer.

564
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:47,775
God, if you don't mind listening to
that prima donna! You fat pig!

565
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:52,858
As if your equipment is better! I'm
not going out driving that trailer!

566
00:56:53,025 --> 00:56:55,192
Pee-wife screens!

567
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,900
- What's going on, Dad?
- Yes...

568
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:04,317
MBT, right?

569
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:09,067
That's exactly what I'm talking
about. That's a good look, Sirius.
It's exactly MBT.

570
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:13,525
- What is MBT?
- We'll have to take that later.

571
00:57:13,692 --> 00:57:18,983
- We're going to Emmenthaler's.
- Mentalization-based therapy.

572
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,692
You use role-playing to get an
emotional response.

573
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:27,275
- That's a simplistic explanation.
- Lennart!

574
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:31,442
- I'll tell you something.
- Fuck you!

575
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:33,942
(they argue further)

576
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:37,192
Something's wrong.

577
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:43,650
It works, Mathilde. View.

578
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:49,025
Your father interacts. The most
important thing is the result.

579
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:52,483
He's acting weirder than ever.

580
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:56,983
What are they doing with that
computer in the barn?

581
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:01,192
Don't say anything more to her or do
anything else. Understood?

582
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:03,983
She's afraid to gain because you're
after her.

583
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,942
- We're just helping.
- She doesn't need any help.

584
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:13,150
I've had over 4,000 psychology
classes. I know a little more about
it than you do.

585
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:16,358
And you think those 4,000 hours have
helped?

586
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:20,525
Says the guy who breaks people's
necks but is afraid of coke and ice
cream.

587
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:22,525
Be careful.

588
00:58:22,692 --> 00:58:26,942
You need help, too, and there's
nothing embarrassing about that.

589
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:31,192
The important thing is that you also
start working with yourself.

590
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:35,108
- Why can't she believe in God?
- Stop.

591
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:38,692
- She's just trying to understand.
- I said stop.

592
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:44,192
Well, that's not how it works. Once
you've agreed to therapy,

593
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,692
- Then you can't say stop when it
snarps.

594
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:53,067
I'm going to you both up if you don't
shut up.

595
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:56,442
One more word ...

596
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:02,192
No, I'll tell you what...

597
00:59:13,692 --> 00:59:16,442
(pain outbreak)

598
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,400
- No! No, I'm sorry!
- What the hell are you doing?

599
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:30,775
- No, no, no!
- Hey, don't do that.

600
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,358
- Would you please not?
- Hey! Don't do that!

601
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:38,358
I'll be nice. I'll be nice! No, no,
no.

602
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:41,775
Don't do this! Don't do this! No, no,
I'm sorry!

603
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:45,025
Sorry! Sorry!

604
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:49,650
- No! No!
- Oh, it.

605
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:42,150
- I...
- We don't have to talk about it.

606
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:50,733
- I'm not from Horsens.
- I don't want to hear any more.

607
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,525
I've been lying all the time.

608
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:04,275
I'm from Randers.

609
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,733
- Is that them?
- Yes.

610
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,025
Let me see. Could it be this one?

611
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:33,192
- Look at them. Is that them?
- Yes. yes, it's him. It's him.

612
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,025
Down!

613
01:02:12,817 --> 01:02:15,233
Down, down, down.

614
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:34,567
(shot)

615
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:46,275
No! No, don't kill him!

616
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,192
Don't kill him.

617
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,608
He's seen us. We'll just take him
with us.

618
01:03:30,233 --> 01:03:34,067
- Are you going to kill me?
- No, nobody kills anyone here.

619
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:38,525
Well? Easy does it. What's your name?

620
01:03:38,692 --> 01:03:41,442
Bodashka Litvinenko.

621
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:46,900
But a lot of people call me Jens-Ole.
You'll have to, too, many times.

622
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:51,692
No, why would we? We call you... the
first one there.

623
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:54,275
Do you have a cell phone?

624
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:06,233
If they know who I am, I can't go
home.

625
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,483
Then you'll have to stay here and
sleep. For now.

626
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,608
- Isn't it safest for everyone to
stay?
- The.

627
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:18,942
We need to get guns now so we can
defend ourselves.

628
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:25,025
- Can you work on Lennart's equipment?
- Yes, but not light-beneled.

629
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:28,483
It would be the happy madness not to
give us weapons.

630
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,442
I don't want you to have guns.

631
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:34,150
It's one thing for me to smash my
eyes in a cold barn.

632
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:37,567
- and find a massive amount of data
on a little computer,

633
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:40,817
- But if I can't even take revenge
myself,

634
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:45,942
- Then I don't know if I want to be a
part of it. This is crying out for
revenge.

635
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,733
I'm not going to touch a finger if we
don't get gun training right now.

636
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:58,150
Okay. Get the equipment up and
running, and I'll train you.

637
01:04:58,317 --> 01:05:02,400
But find everything you can on every
member and focus on Kurt.

638
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:06,525
Okay. And we can just shoot some
birds in the first place.

639
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:09,900
Or a fox. Can't we shoot one each and
then no more?

640
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:14,275
- The. Just get on with it.
- What about Bodashka?

641
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:32,942
My mother gave our au pair extra
because she thought the pay was too
low.

642
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:36,150
But it depends on how much Bodashka
has to work.

643
01:05:36,317 --> 01:05:40,483
I guess just the normal. 37 hours,
right, Markus?

644
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:45,525
- 30 hours is max. for an au pair.
- 37 hours is really good for me.

645
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:49,525
How much did you work in the last
place?

646
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:52,817
- 10-12 hours every day.
- People are pigs.

647
01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:57,525
- And how much did they pay you?
- So...

648
01:05:57,692 --> 01:06:01,983
I make about $135,000 a month.

649
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:05,650
- but I only keep 2000.

650
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:10,775
Shall we say 30 hours a week? If you
work more, we'll pay extra.

651
01:06:10,942 --> 01:06:14,150
- Don't you want to stay, Dad?
- Let him go, Mathilde.

652
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:18,025
It is important that he is allowed to
resign.

653
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:23,192
- Do you play chess, Mathilde?
- No.

654
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:27,025
No...

655
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:32,108
But we can play the Star of Africa.
We've played that a lot.

656
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:35,692
I had a colleague called the Star of
Africa.

657
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:42,400
He was strangled on New Year's Eve by
a core customer.

658
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,942
(shouting from the inside)

659
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:16,233
- Lennart?
- Yes?

660
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:22,108
You want to fuck my ass before you
sleep so you can sleep rough and well?

661
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:26,192
No.

662
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:28,483
No, thank you.

663
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:33,900
No, we have a really long day ahead
of us. Otherwise, thank you.

664
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:37,733
Ok. Goodnight.

665
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,150
Goodnight.

666
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:50,150
Lennart? Thank you for saving me.

667
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,733
And thank you for not fucking my ass.

668
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:58,900
You're welcome. Sleep well, my friend.

669
01:08:12,233 --> 01:08:14,483
- Good night, Emmenthaler.
- Good night, Otto.

670
01:08:44,442 --> 01:08:46,650
Hi. Where's my dad?

671
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:49,442
- He went to morning therapy.
- In the barn?

672
01:08:49,608 --> 01:08:56,025
- Yes.
- Okay. But then say hello and good
day.

673
01:08:56,192 --> 01:08:58,900
You need a little button here.

674
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:03,150
I'll sew that tonight.

675
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:06,900
Wait a minute.

676
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:20,442
That's it. You're very, very
beautiful.

677
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:28,525
- Remember the packed lunch. Have a
good school day.
- Yes. Thanks. Hey, hey.

678
01:09:28,692 --> 01:09:34,067
Kurt "Tandem" Olesen. Death sentence.
Kenneth "Turbot" Jensen. Death
sentence.

679
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:35,983
Noah "Abe" Frandsen. Death sentence.

680
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:40,525
Isn't it easier to say those who
aren't doomed?

681
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:45,525
Anker Trier, Tim "Tonser" Petersen
and Vitus "Pork" Clausen walk free.

682
01:09:45,692 --> 01:09:48,900
- They have children.
- Aren't those harsh punishments?

683
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:52,317
- That's 22 homicides.
- They tried to kill us.

684
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:56,192
They know who we are and don't stop
unless we kill them first.

685
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:01,400
- So now we're going to do what we
agreed.
- So far, we've defended ourselves.

686
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:05,233
When they find out it's an attack,
it's going to be harder to reach Kurt.

687
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,608
It already is. He always has 10 men
around him.

688
01:10:09,775 --> 01:10:13,317
Why don't you kill one of them like
it was an accident?

689
01:10:13,483 --> 01:10:16,192
- And then kill them all at the
funeral?

690
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:19,483
There are women and children at a
funeral. We can't do that.

691
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:22,483
- What about their clubhouse?
- Lennart?

692
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,483
Get out of here! Away!

693
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:28,483
Even though the resolution is poor on
these monitors,

694
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,233
- then you can faintly see how the
clubhouse is monitored -

695
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,192
- 24 hours by the police and PET.
That's impossible.

696
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:41,317
But I have a handle on where they are
and have track on their mobiles and
emails.

697
01:10:41,483 --> 01:10:45,692
Then we'll have to wait for me to get
a group where Kurt's in.

698
01:10:45,858 --> 01:10:50,317
- Five or six people max.
- If the group is bigger, we can help.

699
01:10:50,483 --> 01:10:55,942
Especially when we soon get the
massive weapons training we've agreed
upon.

700
01:10:56,108 --> 01:10:58,900
The M10 is an old model.

701
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:02,650
It consists of a trigger housing, a
flask, buffer, spring,

702
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:08,525
- steering frame, a pipe, optical
sieve, bottom piece, impact bolt,

703
01:11:08,692 --> 01:11:15,608
- charging handle and magazine. We
start by placing buffer in spring.

704
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:19,067
- I can't get it in.
- I don't think it's easy for you.

705
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:24,192
- Put the spring into the flask.
- Finished.

706
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:27,649
Where did you serve military service?

707
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:31,857
I don't have that anywhere. Look at
me.

708
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:35,233
- How can you do it so fast?
- There are few components.

709
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,692
- It kind of gave itself up.
- It's crazy.

710
01:11:39,692 --> 01:11:42,191
Can you do it again?

711
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:55,691
- I like to collect things.
- Such. Finished. Second.

712
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,982
I don't understand this. When are we
going to need to collect a gun?

713
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:10,357
Our lives may depend on it. But
handsome, Lennart. What's it called?

714
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:13,316
It's called Fuck You, Emmenthaler.

715
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:17,566
If I wanted to collect things, I'd
probably have gone to IKEA.

716
01:12:31,733 --> 01:12:36,817
They found the Ukrainian bush's cell
phone at exit 51.

717
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:40,900
We need to focus our energy around
exit 51.

718
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:46,816
- Focus?
- Find the Ukrainian and we'll find
them.

719
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:50,857
Ulf Emmenthaler, he has two friends.

720
01:12:52,817 --> 01:12:55,983
They were all fired two weeks ago.

721
01:12:56,150 --> 01:13:01,858
These. Lennart Gerner Nielsen and
this one, Otto Hoffmann.

722
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:05,317
Otto Hoffmann has a schmuck arm.

723
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:10,233
Don't you think it's a little easier
to find them?

724
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,775
- than sitting at exit 51 and waiting
for a Ukrainian gay?

725
01:13:14,942 --> 01:13:15,858
Yes, yes.

726
01:13:17,483 --> 01:13:20,942
- Then find me that schmuck arm.
- Yes, yes.

727
01:13:21,108 --> 01:13:23,942
Look at that.

728
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:28,900
It's like pizza and yet it's not. Is
that too much?

729
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:32,108
- Still a little too much.
- I just thought...

730
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:35,983
- The Queen is the strongest, isn't
she?
- Numerically, she is.

731
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:40,567
But strategically, it's the farmer.
It changes from party to party.

732
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:43,858
All pieces may turn out to be
strongest.

733
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:48,567
Chess is a game in which chance and
luck are not a factor.

734
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:54,275
No dice, no jokers, no hidden items.
Everything's in front of us.

735
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:57,983
- and it is only your own actions
that determine the outcome.

736
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,192
Then there's snacks.

737
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:05,150
- Can't you take a picture of us?
- Obviously. Move to the couch.

738
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,650
- Can it be a video?
- Like this?

739
01:14:07,817 --> 01:14:13,400
- We're at it.
- I'm just going to get him here...

740
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:19,025
Noller and a group of seven are
meeting tonight at antorini
restaurant.

741
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:24,025
It's down in the harbor area.

742
01:14:25,275 --> 01:14:30,233
Turbot confirms kurt's going to be
here tonight at 7:00. Noller gives.

743
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,317
They'll be 12.

744
01:14:32,483 --> 01:14:36,525
Can you take that many? Otherwise, I
can come with you.

745
01:14:36,692 --> 01:14:40,275
And Lennart and Otto hit a lot in the
woods, too.

746
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:47,150
We could take them when they get out.
Catch them in a crossfire here and
there.

747
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:53,067
We're not going to get a better
chance, Markus.

748
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:58,775
You're coming with me.

749
01:15:03,942 --> 01:15:06,733
Neutrons are a bit heavier than
protons.

750
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:13,150
If it were the other way around,
atoms couldn't exist. And without
atoms no life.

751
01:15:13,317 --> 01:15:15,525
- We have to go.
- Okay. What are we going to do?

752
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:18,983
- I'll explain that in the car.
- We're doing our homework.

753
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:23,858
- Emmenthaler, this is it.
- There's therapy for everyone. Come
with me.

754
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:27,650
- What the hell are you saying?
- Don't grab him.

755
01:15:27,817 --> 01:15:30,567
- Why do you always have to...?
- Shut up!

756
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:33,483
Don't interfere. Let's go.

757
01:15:38,358 --> 01:15:42,108
You can't talk to your daughter like
that. What's that?

758
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:47,650
- Weapons? What are you doing?
- Markus explains in the car.

759
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:50,942
What are we going to do with the
guns? Isn't that too dark?

760
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:54,317
- Don't shoot anything.
- All we have to do is crossfire.

761
01:15:54,483 --> 01:16:00,150
You're not going to get anything out
of it other than getting shot or
going to jail.

762
01:16:00,317 --> 01:16:03,400
- What about Mathilde? Don't you care?
- Shut up.

763
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:06,983
- Otto, I wouldn't.
- You're not going to get your wife
back.

764
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,192
I'm going to break your nose.

765
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:13,275
Why don't we just get this over with
and come home and get banana cake?

766
01:16:13,442 --> 01:16:16,692
I'm just saying she's dead.

767
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:45,358
- Don't we need crossfire now?
- What's his problem?

768
01:16:45,525 --> 01:16:51,108
He's got a lot of people. But right
now, he's lying unconscious on a bike
path.

769
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,608
His daughter died in a traffic
accident.

770
01:16:56,775 --> 01:17:02,442
- so he can be touchy on behalf of
other father-daughter relationships.

771
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:07,442
But don't feel bad. That was many
years ago. He crashed into a tree.

772
01:17:07,608 --> 01:17:12,192
That's how he got the withered arm.
It was January 12, 2002.

773
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:16,275
He had a blood alcohol level of 0.92
and was disqualified from driving
conditionally.

774
01:17:16,442 --> 01:17:19,817
Was fined DKK 28,342.

775
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:24,525
- Are you hacking your own friends,
too?
- No, no, no.

776
01:17:24,692 --> 01:17:27,608
Otto told us.

777
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:30,900
Or at least he's mentioned it a few
times.

778
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:35,067
And then we've just read up on the
details.

779
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:39,525
He has a picture of his wife and
daughter standing up.

780
01:17:39,692 --> 01:17:44,358
Then you ask for it yourself when you
flash your privacy like that.

781
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:08,692
Get ready.

782
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:17,483
- On the right. Lennart, you stay
here.
- Isn't Lennart going?

783
01:18:21,817 --> 01:18:26,275
What kind of girls are these girls?

784
01:18:26,442 --> 01:18:30,567
It's just a lie. Didn't you tell me
they were alone?

785
01:18:30,733 --> 01:18:34,400
That's what they wrote. Then someone
must have brought ladies.

786
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:37,067
So let's go home and have banana cake.

787
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:39,692
We'll wait a while.

788
01:18:56,983 --> 01:19:01,317
- You stay here.
- What's he doing?

789
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:35,317
What the hell are you doing, man?
Ouch for ... Fuck, man!

790
01:20:03,442 --> 01:20:05,942
Sorry...

791
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:14,942
Sorry. I couldn't. I'm not good at it.

792
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:19,442
- You're good at it. I'm not.
- It's okay.

793
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:22,025
No, it's not.

794
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:25,400
They're dead now. He's dead.

795
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:31,608
It's not easy to kill a human being.
Especially the first time.

796
01:20:31,775 --> 01:20:34,525
No, no, I can't...

797
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:39,608
I don't want to be a part of this
anymore. I don't want to be a part of
this anymore. Never again.

798
01:20:39,775 --> 01:20:45,567
You're not going to either. But try
to remember why we do it.

799
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:52,192
Why are we doing this? What if he
hadn't been with...?

800
01:20:52,358 --> 01:20:57,358
He has! Shut up, he has! They all
have.

801
01:21:00,525 --> 01:21:03,692
Try to think about what they've done.

802
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:08,358
Think about how many lives they've
destroyed.

803
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:10,858
Oh, my God.

804
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:17,608
Emmenthaler? Do you want me to put
some radio on?

805
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:22,025
Would you like that? To hear a little
quiet radio?

806
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:25,858
Such.

807
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:34,733
- Father?
- Not right now, baby. We're working.

808
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:39,400
Okay. That's just what you said with
that Otto guy with a schmuck arm.

809
01:22:43,233 --> 01:22:45,900
- <i>I'm going to...</i>
- Yes.

810
01:22:49,108 --> 01:22:53,233
- Who is Sirius Zen?
- Some homo I follow.

811
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,275
I don't know him. He makes great
recipes.

812
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:06,067
- Reporter: Good morning.
- Good morning, baby.

813
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:09,608
Reporter: Good morning.

814
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:14,817
What happened, Otto?

815
01:23:23,817 --> 01:23:28,567
You're the one who did that? You're
sick.

816
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:32,858
You're the fucking one who should be
dead, not Mom!

817
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:34,567
(door slams)

818
01:23:39,775 --> 01:23:47,108
I just want to say that it wasn't
your father who did it. I fell.

819
01:23:47,275 --> 01:23:51,608
Don't lie to me. You're about it.

820
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:55,525
- You all are.
- Don't get mad at your father.

821
01:23:55,692 --> 01:23:59,233
He may not be doing the right thing
all the time, but he's really trying.

822
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,650
Then he's bad at trying.

823
01:24:02,817 --> 01:24:07,442
We can agree on that. But he's not
doing so well.

824
01:24:07,608 --> 01:24:10,192
No. I know, I know.

825
01:24:16,192 --> 01:24:20,567
Are all the incidents leading up to
the accident?

826
01:24:24,067 --> 01:24:27,983
And it started with your bike being
stolen?

827
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:33,858
Yes. If my bike hadn't been stolen,
it wouldn't have happened.

828
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:37,275
Then my mom wouldn't have to drive
me, and then it didn't matter.

829
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:40,608
- that the car could not start, and
then we would not have taken the
train.

830
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,150
How does it matter that your father
calls?

831
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:45,317
He said he wasn't coming home.

832
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:49,317
My mother was so disappointed that
she suggested we take a truancy day.

833
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:51,983
- and drove into town.

834
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:57,358
All these incidents have their own
individual course.

835
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,525
What do you mean, you don't know?

836
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:04,817
I got fired that day, so I took an
earlier train than usual.

837
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:09,650
But you have to go back to when I
learned you give the seat to a woman.

838
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:14,483
The man who taught me, he wants his
very own course.

839
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:20,817
Everything has threads that weave
themselves into other events and life
into one...

840
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:23,650
Not infinity. In a very large
equation.

841
01:25:23,817 --> 01:25:27,608
Not even the world's largest
computers will be able to

842
01:25:27,775 --> 01:25:32,067
- to process all the data, and even
if you're a smart girl,

843
01:25:32,233 --> 01:25:37,192
- your human brain will never be able
to process a fraction of what

844
01:25:37,358 --> 01:25:41,108
- and you will therefore never be
able to draw a useful conclusion.

845
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:44,442
It's never going to make sense.

846
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:50,525
So...

847
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:53,275
It's a waste of time.

848
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:03,233
I know that, too.

849
01:26:07,775 --> 01:26:13,150
I've rewinded everything a million
times to find a reason.

850
01:26:13,317 --> 01:26:17,983
- But there isn't one.
- Yes, that's it.

851
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:21,150
There are centillions.

852
01:26:21,317 --> 01:26:24,900
But you can't use any of them for
anything.

853
01:26:31,483 --> 01:26:35,733
I sometimes dream of finding the guy
who stole my bike.

854
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:40,442
I see him cycling off on my bike, and
then I run after him.

855
01:26:40,608 --> 01:26:43,650
- and catch him.

856
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:51,233
But I also know it's not his fault.
It's nobody's fault.

857
01:26:52,817 --> 01:26:58,442
It just makes a little more sense if
you have someone you can...

858
01:26:58,608 --> 01:27:01,442
... get mad at.

859
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:08,775
Yes.

860
01:27:11,317 --> 01:27:15,817
My mother had seven children, but the
little ones were hungry.

861
01:27:15,983 --> 01:27:20,733
And thin as matches. And we froze,
and winter came on the way.

862
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:27,025
- So my mom's selling a baby. And
then Palle came and took me to
Germany.

863
01:27:28,483 --> 01:27:31,567
He rents me out...

864
01:27:33,692 --> 01:27:37,067
I'm like a city bike.

865
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:39,733
- that anyone can just come and ride.

866
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:48,192
But then we go home on vacation, and
I meet you.

867
01:27:48,358 --> 01:27:53,525
We'll be here just three days before
you kill him and save me.

868
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:58,317
No, it can't be. No, Palle was on the
train the week before.

869
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:03,817
No. No, no, no trains. We're flying
home.

870
01:28:03,983 --> 01:28:08,108
But not three days before. You must
have come back from Germany earlier.

871
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:11,358
No. Well, we landed Monday.

872
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:14,608
- And you're going to kill him
Thursday.

873
01:28:14,775 --> 01:28:18,525
There's something I need to check.

874
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:21,192
Did I say something wrong?

875
01:28:33,358 --> 01:28:34,942
No.

876
01:28:38,442 --> 01:28:43,525
No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no.

877
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:54,233
<i>As-salaamu-alaikum.</i>

878
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,275
My lovely children.

879
01:28:59,525 --> 01:29:04,608
It's a beautiful country. Green and
flat as flatbread.

880
01:29:04,775 --> 01:29:08,442
But the food was the biggest
disappointment.

881
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,525
- Dad had the worst sandwich in the
world.
- Worse than Grandma's?

882
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:17,983
The tuna was old and wet. The bread
was dry as desert sand.

883
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:22,775
- and I got a juice that tasted like
camel.

884
01:29:22,942 --> 01:29:27,233
I threw it in the trash and went to
McDonald's.

885
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,192
3.28% was missing.

886
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:35,983
It's unlikely that anyone looks so
much like Kurt Olesen's brother.

887
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:40,108
I told you. The biometric limit value
was not met.

888
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:43,108
You wanted it to be true.

889
01:29:43,275 --> 01:29:46,692
No. He is a qualified electrical
engineer specializing in train
components.

890
01:29:46,858 --> 01:29:50,233
- It's close to impossible.
- It was a coincidence.

891
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,317
There's no connection. You created
it, Otto.

892
01:29:54,483 --> 01:29:58,150
You said you recognized him from the
train.

893
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:01,483
That's what I thought I could do.

894
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:05,233
I must have looked blind.

895
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,942
So it was just an accident.

896
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:14,400
- I'm so sorry, Markus.
- Then who is it?

897
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:16,317
What?

898
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:21,400
If it's not him, who is it?

899
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,317
Then who is it?

900
01:30:26,858 --> 01:30:30,400
You told me it wasn't an accident.

901
01:30:34,775 --> 01:30:37,983
But it's him.

902
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:45,525
It's him. It's him.

903
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,150
- Markus. Markus.
- It...

904
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:27,400
(bang and shout)

905
01:31:58,525 --> 01:32:00,108
Markus.

906
01:32:00,275 --> 01:32:04,275
Markus, Markus. Markus.

907
01:32:04,442 --> 01:32:09,567
- Breathe quietly.
- What's going on? What's going on?

908
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:14,275
- Don't worry about it. yes, that's
it.
- I'm scared.

909
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:21,067
- What do you say?
- I'm scared.

910
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:24,775
I understand that. I understand that.

911
01:32:24,942 --> 01:32:27,400
I understand that very well.

912
01:32:28,692 --> 01:32:32,108
Look me in the eye. Look me in the
eye.

913
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:37,067
She's dead. She's gone.

914
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:43,067
Yes. She's dead. Take a breath. So.

915
01:32:43,233 --> 01:32:48,067
Come on, here. Came. Come here. yes,
that's so good.

916
01:32:48,233 --> 01:32:51,817
It doesn't matter.

917
01:33:25,942 --> 01:33:31,608
There is an old Ukrainian legend of
chance.

918
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:38,525
It's about Ljubaba Vasilkovna from
Vitebsk.

919
01:33:38,692 --> 01:33:41,192
A beautiful princess.

920
01:33:41,358 --> 01:33:47,942
- which goes bear hunting the morning
after the first full moon of spring.

921
01:33:48,108 --> 01:33:53,025
A giant bear comes and attacks her
and bites her finger off-

922
01:33:53,192 --> 01:33:57,650
- with her beloved diamond ring on.

923
01:33:57,817 --> 01:34:03,317
Very sad for her. But then, exactly
10 years later,

924
01:34:03,483 --> 01:34:07,192
- the morning after the first full
moon of spring,

925
01:34:07,358 --> 01:34:11,900
- in the same thick forests in the
same precise place,

926
01:34:12,067 --> 01:34:14,025
- She goes hunting again.

927
01:34:14,192 --> 01:34:17,733
And this time, she shoots a big old
bear.

928
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,067
And when they open its belly,

929
01:34:21,233 --> 01:34:24,317
- There wasn't a ring in there.

930
01:34:25,983 --> 01:34:28,067
Nothing.

931
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,567
Okay.

932
01:34:47,358 --> 01:34:52,983
Well. Now it will be really exciting
to see if the water boils soon.

933
01:35:01,817 --> 01:35:04,983
Why did you come here anyway, Otto?

934
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,400
Because the police wouldn't help.

935
01:35:17,483 --> 01:35:21,317
Or I came because we switched seats,
I think.

936
01:35:22,733 --> 01:35:26,233
Because I was the one who should have
died.

937
01:35:29,358 --> 01:35:34,192
Then I saw Mathilde in the hospital,
and she looked so helpless.

938
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:42,025
And Lennart and Emmenthaler, did they
just follow?

939
01:35:42,192 --> 01:35:46,025
They don't have many friends.

940
01:35:46,192 --> 01:35:50,692
I think people with problems tend to
get together.

941
01:35:50,858 --> 01:35:53,400
Like fat people,

942
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:56,567
- so they look less thick when they
are together.

943
01:35:56,733 --> 01:35:59,275
Then it's all a little easier to live
with.

944
01:36:01,192 --> 01:36:05,233
You also have some things you need to
learn to live with.

945
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,942
I don't know if I have anything to
learn to live with.

946
01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:12,817
You have to learn to live with the
death of your wife.

947
01:36:15,942 --> 01:36:18,358
Why do I have to?

948
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:22,483
You're going to have to get some real
help.

949
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,733
Nothing's going to help.

950
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:30,108
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, but...

951
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:36,775
- You have Mathilde.
- We should never have had her.

952
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:41,567
Before she got here, at least I was
hoping that she'd be able to do it.

953
01:36:41,733 --> 01:36:46,108
- That once we have kids, it all
makes sense.

954
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,483
Well, you have a responsibility to
your daughter.

955
01:36:55,317 --> 01:36:58,858
Yes. You were so fucking responsible
to your daughter yourself.

956
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:18,567
No.

957
01:37:20,817 --> 01:37:23,483
I wasn't.

958
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:26,650
Because I was an idiot.

959
01:37:28,358 --> 01:37:31,067
I didn't think of anyone but myself.

960
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:40,775
But not a day goes by when I wouldn't
want...

961
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:48,442
... that I just once more ...

962
01:37:50,608 --> 01:37:54,233
... be allowed to find her hairbrush
for her-

963
01:37:54,400 --> 01:38:00,025
- or discuss with her if she could
have a dog.

964
01:38:00,192 --> 01:38:05,192
Or get tired of her not figuring out
how to put the milk in place.

965
01:38:22,858 --> 01:38:26,108
I don't have anything to be proud of.

966
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:30,233
But you have.

967
01:38:32,067 --> 01:38:38,150
And I look at you and Mathilde, and I
wish I were you.

968
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,567
Then it may not all matter.

969
01:38:43,733 --> 01:38:46,858
- but that's all you don't have a
relationship with.

970
01:38:47,025 --> 01:38:50,858
You don't know Mathilde. That's why
you can't understand her.

971
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:57,025
But you have to understand that it
takes time for it to make sense.

972
01:38:57,192 --> 01:39:00,108
It costs time.

973
01:39:00,275 --> 01:39:02,733
But you have it.

974
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:06,900
Then use it.

975
01:39:22,233 --> 01:39:25,650
I'm sorry if I got angry and raised
my voice.

976
01:39:25,817 --> 01:39:27,900
It's okay.

977
01:39:29,692 --> 01:39:32,942
I'm sorry about the nose thing, too.

978
01:39:58,067 --> 01:40:00,525
- Hi.
- Sirius.

979
01:40:01,817 --> 01:40:04,650
- Is that you?
- Yes.

980
01:40:09,275 --> 01:40:11,942
<i>No, it means "we'll be called."</i>

981
01:40:12,108 --> 01:40:14,567
- Give me your hand.
- What? No!

982
01:40:16,067 --> 01:40:19,067
Listen to me. I'm going to break your
finger.

983
01:40:19,233 --> 01:40:23,233
- And then you tell me where you took
that video of Otto Hoffmann.

984
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,400
Where, when...

985
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:29,275
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Don't break my finger.

986
01:40:29,442 --> 01:40:34,650
- I'm going to break two because you
broke off.
- I'll tell you what I know.

987
01:40:34,817 --> 01:40:38,108
I'm going to break three because
you're a little gossip.

988
01:40:38,275 --> 01:40:41,525
There it was four because you're a
crying prince.

989
01:40:41,692 --> 01:40:44,067
It's just a finger.

990
01:41:02,483 --> 01:41:06,108
That sounds great. Very precise. It's
a really good job.

991
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:08,567
Maybe you could break it up a little
bit.

992
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,858
Get in the room. Hide under your bed.

993
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:32,858
No matter what, you stay there. Is
that clear? Get on your stomach.

994
01:41:42,692 --> 01:41:45,233
- Is anyone hit?
- In the foot, I think.

995
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,692
- Shoulder. Since.
- I'm unstricken.

996
01:41:51,192 --> 01:41:55,400
- I'm unstricken, too.
- Emmenthaler, down. Down, down!

997
01:41:55,567 --> 01:41:58,233
I just had time to duck.

998
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,942
Lennart, I need help. Come here.

999
01:42:04,108 --> 01:42:08,233
The bag with M10s is at the end of
the stairs. You're faster than me.

1000
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:14,233
Do you see it?

1001
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:18,233
- Why the hell did you take them
apart?
- It doesn't matter. Throw them up.

1002
01:43:00,775 --> 01:43:02,400
Oh, hello.

1003
01:43:45,192 --> 01:43:47,275
Soldier boy!

1004
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,067
Come out into the light.

1005
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:56,442
Soldier boy, come out into the light!

1006
01:44:03,567 --> 01:44:08,067
Come all the way out into the light,
or I'm going to fucking blow her head
off.

1007
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:17,358
Get down on your knees and throw that
shit away from you.

1008
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:27,525
That one on the panty line, too.

1009
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,775
Then we're going to kill that fool.

1010
01:45:19,442 --> 01:45:23,692
Oh, my God, this is aummer, man. What
the hell did we do to you?

1011
01:45:30,858 --> 01:45:35,067
Don't be afraid, darling. It's going
to be okay.

1012
01:45:35,233 --> 01:45:38,233
We'll take care of you. Came.

1013
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,400
I'll call you with an ambulance.

1014
01:45:49,275 --> 01:45:51,525
Don't be afraid.

1015
01:46:28,483 --> 01:46:30,483
Are you in pain?

1016
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:32,275
No.

1017
01:46:35,192 --> 01:46:38,108
I'm just freezing a lot.

1018
01:46:38,275 --> 01:46:40,108
(sirens)

1019
01:46:40,275 --> 01:46:44,358
They're coming, Dad. They're coming.

1020
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:54,900
I should have just listened to you.

1021
01:46:57,317 --> 01:47:00,317
I think I need help.

1022
01:47:05,692 --> 01:47:07,358
Sorry.

1023
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:15,733
Father...

1024
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:22,608
I want you to... They'll be here in a
minute. You just have to keep talking.

1025
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,067
Sorry. Sorry.

1026
01:47:35,275 --> 01:47:37,358
Father.

1027
01:47:38,608 --> 01:47:40,358
Father!

1028
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:44,775
Father...

1029
01:48:02,567 --> 01:48:05,025
What's this?

1030
01:48:06,733 --> 01:48:11,108
- It's chess. Thank you so much,
Mathilde.
- You're welcome.

1031
01:48:12,108 --> 01:48:16,567
- I'm glad you did.
- Otto's turn to find a gift.

1032
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:21,233
Let's see what's here. It's this one.
Uha.

1033
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:25,608
"To Emmenthaler from Markus and
Mathilde."

1034
01:48:33,692 --> 01:48:37,483
- Team...
- What the hell is that?

1035
01:48:38,525 --> 01:48:40,983
It's a horn.

1036
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,150
Can you conjure it, Emmenthaler?

1037
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:56,192
No, I don't think I can. What am I
supposed to play?

1038
01:48:56,358 --> 01:49:00,442
It's awesome. Play something!

1039
01:49:02,192 --> 01:49:05,108
But what?

1040
01:49:05,275 --> 01:49:09,067
yes, just play something random.

1041
01:49:17,358 --> 01:49:18,150
(false tones)

1042
01:49:18,317 --> 01:49:24,067
Hell, if I can sit and listen to it
on Christmas Eve.

1043
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:27,858
So, then. Take a breath. Take a
breath.

1044
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,025
- You're wearing a uniform. We're in
Tivoli.
- Yes.

1045
01:49:36,192 --> 01:49:38,775
- We're standing on the Lawn.
- Yes.

1046
01:49:39,692 --> 01:49:42,067
So. I know you can.

1047
01:49:51,108 --> 01:49:54,317
(plays "Little Drummer Boy")
