01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,333
If we start now, maybe…

1749
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:50,333
Maybe we could put it together by morning.

So good to have you back.

1756

I'm gonna need something…

1758
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,416
[Jessica] Thanks, Dad.

[crowd chattering]

1760
01:42:39,541 --> 01:42:43,625
[Jessica] Make sure to open the heart.
I forgot about that.

[chuckles] Grandpa J, you did it!

1768
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:04,083

01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,625
Come on. Come on, Buddy.

Well, hello, young lady.

1795
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:45,708
- What is the meaning of this?
- Please!

1796
01:44:45,791 --> 01:44:48,083
The robot that you stole from me.

1797
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:50,541
To the dungeon with him!

1798
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:54,291
- Yes, you.
- I demand that you arrest him at once.

1799
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:55,541
- Right now.
- For what?

1800
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:56,833
You're the real thief.

1801
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,541
A thief couldn't have these.

1802

The designs
for the robot that I slaved over.

Restless days and sleepless nights.

1804
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:11,250
I wanted to give up
so many times, but I didn't.

1805
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,416
- I…
- [Don Juan] We.

1806

- I…
- We.

- It's an easy explanation...
- I can explain.

1816
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,541
After I ran into Mr. Gustafson,

1817
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:47,250
I was afraid he would try
to steal The Buddy 3000,

1818
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:49,166
so I marked the design.

1819
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:53,041
For proof.

1820
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:54,958
Uh-oh.

1821
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:57,625
Just arrest Mr. Jangle.

1822
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:00,083
You told me those were your inventions.

1823
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:01,375
Did you lie?

1824
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:03,708
Are you a thief?

1825
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:05,125
Yes, you.

1826
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:08,416
Jeronicus, save me!

1827
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,958
[Jeronicus] I'll take the matador.

1828
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:13,500
He's my invention after all.

1829
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:14,750
I am home!

1830

- What?
- [Don Juan] <i>Mi rey…</i>

I've missed you!

I like your hair.
Did you do that yourself?

Finally…

- Reprogram? Reprogram what?

1837

Why are you here, sir?

1841

This doesn't make sense.

1842
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,458
You will take the word
of a ten-year-old child?

1843

I'm a respected member of the community!
Are you kidding?

1844
01:46:56,166 --> 01:46:57,500
Look at that child!

She has evil in her eyes! Don't you see?
