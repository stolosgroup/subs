8

<i>Mom told us a story.</i>

9
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,096
<i>A story about five men in a
tiny boat adrift on the sea.</i>

10
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:07,372
<i>But with only enough water
and food for three to survive.</i>

11
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,378
<i>How should they decide
who lives and who dies?</i>

12
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>I remember her answer, but
I still don't know why</i>

13
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,385
<i>she told us that story.</i>

14

17
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,481

18
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:11,616

Hi.

25
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,641
Why don't you get some rest, Si?

26
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,412
Hibernation's hard,
especially the first time.

27
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,845
You know, if you're struggling,

29

We all remember
our first flight.

30
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,188
Anyway...

31
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,532
What is it he does again?

32
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,868
He blogs.

33
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:15,500
Has a massive
following, like massive.

34
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,005
Oh.

35
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,754
He blogs, massive
following, right, useful.

36
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,140
Leave him alone, okay?

37
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:22,948
Okay?

38
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,017
Okay.

39
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:29,253
Si, can I get you anything?

40
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:31,255
No, I'm fine, thank you.

41
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,757
How are the blogs going?

42
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:34,955
Good.

43
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,864
There's a lot of
interest in the mission.

44

Cool.

45
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,694
Well let me know if you
need anything, all right?

46
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,466
I will, thank you.

47
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,203

it with our own eyes.

52

53
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,618
Yeah.

54
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:05,790
It's unremarkable.

55
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930

No.

71
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:23,598
So what do we do, Commander?

72
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,634
What we were sent to do.

73
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:26,568
We investigate the sphere.

74
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:27,670
This is bullshit!

00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,806
Okay, systems are restoring.

167
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,708
<i>On board data systems
are fully restored and online.</i>

168
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,086
What is it?

169
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,704
What is that?

170
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,306
<i>Data source
confirmed as the sphere.</i>

171
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:20,378
Miz, are these character
structures correct?

172
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,813
<i>The character
sequences are correct.</i>

173
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,547
Why are we set so easy?

174
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:27,483
Perhaps you will share with
us what you have found.

175
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:31,516
What?

176
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,390
The transmission is a message.

177
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,596
Saying what?

178
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:41,534
One word, repeated endlessly.

179
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,603
What word?

180
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:47,573
"Deus."

181
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:52,876
"God."

182
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,762
We have to turn back.

183
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,433
Don't you see?

184
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,300
Don't you see what is happening?

185
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:21,539
We have to turn back!

186
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:22,608
Si.

187
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,371
He's not wrong.

188
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,705
We have to speak to Vance

189
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,512
before we go anywhere
near that thing.

190
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:30,394
We lost connection with
Earth after the first impact.

191
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:32,881
So we stop the ship until
we get communication back.

192
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,420
Our orders are from Vance, I
see no reason to change them.

193
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:38,585
This is our first encounter

194
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,326
with an extraterrestrial
intelligence

195
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:43,427
in the known universe, let
alone, our solar system.

196
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,601
That thing came looking for us.

197
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,200
How do you know
it isn't hostile?

198
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:48,371
How do you know it's
now what it says it is?

199
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,567
What?

200
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:50,636
God.

201
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,734
So we're gonna take
its word for it?

202
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:56,770
No, we follow orders and
investigate the sphere.

203
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,710
We need time to know more, Sen.

204
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,310
How?

205
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,316
The scanners are blind to it.

206
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:23,236
Si?

207
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,312
We can't go there.

208
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,710
This is judgment.

209
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:38,812
Now we pay for our sins.

210
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,455
We don't know what
the sphere is, Si.

211
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:46,594
I do.

212
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,599
I do.

213
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:54,630
I hear voices.

214
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:56,867
Calling.

215
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:57,935
Screaming.

216
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,439
"Judgment."

217
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:03,644
Easy.

218
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,779
Si,

219
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,350
we're going to find out
what this sphere is, okay?

220
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,254
Just,

221
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,520
can you tell me,

222
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,722
what voices do you hear?

223
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,293
We can't go near it.

224
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:27,300
We have to turn back.

225
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:47,753
Wow.

226
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,555
My mother always said

227
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,557
God was gonna catch
up with me one day.

228
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,057
Big Catholic, my mother.

229
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,566
Always made me go to church.

230
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:06,932
I don't remember anything about

231
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,573
a big, black ball
in the sky though.

232
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,346
I must've missed that song.

233
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:20,452
We have to find
out what this is.

234
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,687
We're supposed to be
fearless explorers.

235
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:27,723
Why would God come now?

236
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,957
Maybe he's had enough
of your bullshit.

237
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:33,896
Or "she" has.

238
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,234
Ah.

239
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:37,535
My mother always
said "he" though.

240
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,635
Did she also say that

241
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,605
you always have to
have the last word?

242
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:51,384
<i>If this sphere is
God, we have nothing to fear.</i>

243
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,619
<i>That depends on what
you've been up to.</i>

244
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,683
God is our judge.

245
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,631
God fucking scares me.

246
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
This isn't God.

247
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,408
You don't know that.

248
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:18,506
He has a point.

249
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,380
You don't know what this is.

250
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,449
But I also have a point,

251
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,518
we have to find
out what this is.

252
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,720
There's a lot of
people watching us.

253
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:33,926
Yeah?

254
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:37,226
Yeah.

255
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,566
And if it isn't God,

256
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,504
we can always do something else.

257
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,567
Like what?

258
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:50,637
Blow the fucker up.

259
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:53,545
We're not a military vessel.

260
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:55,877
There's always a way
to blow something up.

261
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,444
Always.

262
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:02,686
<i>All crew report to
command deck immediately.</i>

263
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,557
Time to go, chaps.

264
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:29,713
Officer Ulph.

265
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:37,824
Sir?

266
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:45,058
That will be the last mention
of blowing anything up.

267
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,688
Okay, flight trajectory is good.

268
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,202
All good on my screen.

269
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,875
Proceed with final approach.

270
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,312
<i>Mom!</i>

271
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:06,611
<i>Mom!</i>

272
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,191
What is it?

273
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,257
It's okay, it's in my head.

274
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:23,503
Thanks.

275
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,674
So what happened?

276
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:33,777
I get these headaches.

277
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:36,780
Is that because of the accident?

278
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:40,480
Yeah.

279
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:42,522
Sorry to interrupt.

280
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,056
How're you feeling?

281
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,618
I'm good, thanks.

282
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,457
We need to find Si.

283
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,260
He's gone deep into the heel.

284
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:51,692
Fucking guy's a liability.

285
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:53,625
What's he doing down there?

286
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:54,728
I don't know.

287
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,067
I think he's really scared.

288
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:57,862
Okay.

289
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,267
I'll follow you down.

290
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,336
Sure.

291
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,538
I'll come too.

292
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,607
You need to rest.

293
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,711
Nope.

294
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,675
I'm fine.

295
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,750
Si, can you hear me?

296
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:05,330
Fuck, this thing is slow.

297
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,931
You said you heard something
before Tez interrupted us.

298
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,106
Did I?

299
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,839
I don't remember.

300
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,755
Si?

301
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:14,373
Split up, cover more ground.

302
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,071
You take three, I'll take four.

303
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:18,541
Sure.

304
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,666
Where are you?

305
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:45,698
Moving through three.

306
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:46,667
Anything?

307
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,433
Nothing yet.

308
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,834
It's okay.

309
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:22,137
We all need to be cleansed.

310
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,772
Did you hear that?

311
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:28,907
Yeah.

312
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,013
Sounded like Tez.

313
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,385
Sounded like it came
from the lower hold.

314
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,018
Okay, I'll meet you there.

315
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,937
I think I'm close.

316
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,274
Where?

317
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:57,936
I'm in the lower hold now.

318
00:28:58,005 --> 00:28:59,042
I'm a minute away.

319
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,044
Wait for me.

320
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:19,661
Karla!

321
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:25,765
Karla!

322
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:26,867
Where are you?

323
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:34,279
Karla?

324
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,010
Stop!

325
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,286
Stay the fuck away from me!

326
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:46,089
Take one fucking step and
I'm gonna cut her throat!

327
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,124
Easy, son.

328
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,496
No one's gonna hurt you.

329
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:53,223
We just need to talk.

330
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,065
We are beyond redemption.

331
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:59,102
Nothing can save
us from His wrath.

332
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,040
If we land on that sphere,

333
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,072
we're lambs to the slaughter.

334
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:08,380
We have to turn the ship around.

335
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:09,782
Si, Si, Si, Si, Si.

336
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,847
Let's go and talk
to the commander,

337
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,318
we can turn this ship around.

338
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:14,546
Right, Sen?

339
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:18,317
Don't fucking patronize me!

340
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,519
We have to take
charge of the ship.

341
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,395
We have to kill that
fucker, he knows something.

342
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:25,463
Okay, so,

343
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,132
let's ask him what he knows,

344
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,666
together.

345
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:32,997
You're lying.

346
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,104
Easy, Si.

347
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:39,039
It's okay.

348
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,111
It's over, you're safe now.

349
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,709
Officer Ulph,

350
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,714
you're gonna need a body bag
to get Rubbin to the hold.

351
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:47,783
Where's Tez?

352
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,153
She's in the hold.

353
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,222
I think she's dead.

354
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,094
That's two body bags
we're gonna need.

355
00:30:57,162 --> 00:31:00,091
This shouldn't have
been allowed to happen.

356
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,198
Officer Grey, follow me.

357
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,071
The sphere, Sen,
you know something.

358
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,007
If we knew what the sphere was,

359
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:48,145
Vance would've told you himself.

360
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:51,148
He wouldn't keep it away
from you, of all people.

361
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:53,617
We can't explain how it
appeared or its origin.

362
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,716
Only what it says it is.

363
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:58,322
God.

364
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:59,084
Yes.

365
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:00,052
I don't believe in God.

366
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,788
You are an explorer,

367
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:03,468
you have been journeyed into
the unknown all of your life,

368
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:06,861
but this mystery has
got you running scared.

369
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,196
I am not running.

370
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:11,300
That's exactly
what you are doing.

371
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,239
That's the last thing that
Vance would expect you to do.

372
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,371
People are trusting you,

373
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,377
as are billions back on Earth.

374
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:04,584
This is your time.

375
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:07,624
Embrace it.

376
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:09,261
I'm sorry,

377
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,307
before you launch into
another one of your speeches,

378
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,358
I'm sure millions of
people will enjoy watching,

379
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,762
could we just take second

380
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,303
to take in what has
happened on this mission?

381
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:23,234
The whole world is
watching, Karla Grey.

382
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,144
I don't give a fuck!

383
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,878
So we're just gonna ignore
what happened with Tez.

384
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:29,178
Si, who should have never been

385
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:30,711
on board this ship
to begin with.

386
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:34,216
Tell Vance that
you are too afraid.

387
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,681
I'm sure he'll tell
the rest of us,

388
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,885
once Miz reestablishes
contact with Earth.

389
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,491
Great.

390
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Hmmm.

391
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,297
You coming?

392
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,737
I'm gonna give myself permission

393
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,336
to go and clean up for a bit

394
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:56,333
and then go and
say goodbye to Tez.

395
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,670
You can't help her now.

396
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,838
Holy fuck.

397
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,149
Don't take too long.

398
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,467
Time for us
all to meet our maker.

399
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:29,499
Time for answers.

400
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,440
We owe her that, don't we?

401
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:40,617
Yeah.

402
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:41,686
Yeah.

403
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:04,304
<i>Flying time to
sphere, three hours,</i>

404
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:07,041
<i>17 minutes and 13 seconds.</i>

405
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,588
Ready to disengage Achilles.

406
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,023
Proceed.

407
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,723
Wait.

408
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,356
There's something down there.

409
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,694
A structure.

410
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,397
What is it?

411
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:20,637
<i>Communication
with Earth is restored.</i>

412
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,578
<i>CEO Vance is online.</i>

413
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,849
Sir.

414
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:30,558
<i>Here, we arrive at an
extraordinary moment</i>

415
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:34,590
<i>in our history. A moment
like no other.</i>

416
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:39,828
<i>Officers Grey and Ulph,</i>

417
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:42,829
<i>you carry with you the
blessings and good wishes</i>

418
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,900
<i>of all the peoples of the earth,</i>

419
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:48,373
<i>as do the entire crew
of the brave Achilles.</i>

420
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:50,401
Sir, we have new data
from the surface.

421
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,576
<i>I'm aware.</i>

422
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,149
<i>You should know that
some of the structures</i>

423
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:56,315
<i>have now appeared
all over the earth.</i>

424
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,685
What?

425
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,452
How many on Earth?

426
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:03,586
<i>In excess of ten thousand.</i>

427
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:05,724
Oh.

428
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:08,389
It's an invasion.

429
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,857
What are my peers saying, sir?

430
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:15,598
Members of the scientific
community on Earth,

431
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,386
what are they saying
about those structures?

432
00:38:17,438 --> 00:38:19,796
We're just four people
up here, going in blind.

433
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,266
What the fuck are they saying?

434
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:22,374
<i>Nothing.</i>

435
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,571
<i>The origin and purpose
of these structures</i>

436
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,139
<i>remains a mystery.</i>

437
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:31,943
They still have to be
considered a threat.

438
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,911
<i>We have concluded
that the sphere</i>

439
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,981
<i>is at the center
of this mystery.</i>

440
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,984
<i>It must be investigated.</i>

441
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,428
<i>And you must lead
this investigation.</i>

442
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:48,631
We have to find out
what the fuck this is.

443
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:50,802
Agreed.

444
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,441
Officer Ulph and Grey, I need
you to proceed to the airlock.

445
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,473
We have to go out there.

446
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,473
I'm going with you.

447
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,914
No, you're not.

448
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:04,983
Yeah, I am.

449
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,413
I'm the only other
scientist on board.

450
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:09,520
He's right.

451
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:11,852
And I want him out there.

452
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,120
We need as many eyes on
this thing as we can get.

453
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,922
We ready?

454
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:46,689
Getting there.

455
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:57,700
You're good, all set?

456
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:00,169
Let's go.

457
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:06,409
<i>Airlock compression is complete.</i>

458
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,579
<i>Crew are cleared to proceed.</i>

459
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,765
The inner airlock
door is secured.

460
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,474
<i>Decompression is initiated.</i>

461
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:42,206
<i>Outer airlock doors are open.</i>

462
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:44,780
Come.

463
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,047
<i>Crew are clear to proceed.</i>

464
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,737
<i>Outer airlock doors are secured.</i>

465
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,717
Are you getting anything?

466
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,818
Not a thing.

467
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:15,006
Well...

468
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:18,335
my guess is,

469
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,811
this is not on the
Periodic Table.

470
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:32,657
What about the structure?

471
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,808
Looks like a gate to me.

472
00:42:57,546 --> 00:42:58,716
Oh, come on.

473
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:04,887
What now?

474
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,385
"What now," indeed.

475
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,897
I hope Si was wrong.

476
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,035
'Cause we're at
the mercy out here.

477
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:20,104
Huh?

478
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:24,907
Let's move on.

479
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:09,285
Look.

480
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:10,447
Up at the top.

481
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,823
We know that symbol.

482
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:21,359
What is that?

483
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:24,131
The Event Horizon.

484
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:27,970
What does that mean?

485
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,973
The edge of existence.

486
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:43,722
These gates appear to be
made of the same material...

487
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:45,988
as the sphere.

488
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:47,990
If that is a gate,

489
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:50,795
where does it lead?

490
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:04,506
What the?

491
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:10,144
And how are we hearing
that in a vacuum?

492
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:11,975
Miz is receiving
this transmission

493
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,884
and relaying it to you.

494
00:45:14,854 --> 00:45:17,019
But it's a different
word to the last.

495
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,794
What word?

496
00:45:24,297 --> 00:45:25,797
<i>"Welcome."</i>

497
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:44,041
Miz?

498
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,015
Miz is translating.

499
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,385
This is incredible.

500
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,052
Miz, translation?

501
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:53,792
<i>"You have come."</i>

502
00:45:55,427 --> 00:45:56,427
Speak to it.

503
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,430
Say something.

504
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:03,065
<i>"I speak for the Creator."</i>

505
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:07,869
Who is the Creator?

506
00:46:07,938 --> 00:46:10,007
<i>"The beginning and end.</i>

507
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:14,307
<i>"The alpha and omega
of all existence."</i>

508
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,576
And why has the Creator come?

509
00:46:19,645 --> 00:46:22,579
<i>"As a warning
and to help."</i>

510
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Help, how?

511
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:28,486
<i>"Humankind
faces a choice."</i>

512
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,292
What choice?

513
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,790
<i>"Those who enter
the gates like this one</i>

514
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:37,996
<i>"will return to the
Creator in eternal peace.</i>

515
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,064
<i>"You must show the way."</i>

516
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,936
Who must show the way?

517
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:44,603
<i>"You are the one sent.</i>

518
00:46:44,672 --> 00:46:49,080
<i>"It is you who will see
the truth beyond the gate</i>

519
00:46:49,148 --> 00:46:54,116
<i>"and you will return to share
the truth with all humankind."</i>

520
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,419
Karla, you have
clearance to proceed.

521
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:05,127
What is beyond the gate?

522
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:08,257
<i>"The end of all suffering.</i>

523
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,462
<i>"The end of all pain."</i>

524
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:17,403
You said humankind
faced a choice.

525
00:47:19,677 --> 00:47:22,079
What is the alternative?

526
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:24,811
<i>"Those who do not
choose to enter the gate</i>

527
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,550
<i>"will perish."</i>

528
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,253
Perish, how?

529
00:47:30,322 --> 00:47:34,021
<i>"The sphere also
carries the Event Horizon.</i>

530
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,126
<i>"As the sphere reaches Earth,</i>

531
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:38,188
<i>"it will being the
most destructive force</i>

532
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:40,261
<i>"in the entire universe.</i>

533
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,163
<i>"In an instant, Earth
and all those left on it</i>

534
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:48,504
<i>"will cease to exist."</i>

535
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:50,471
A black hole.

536
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:53,070
<i>"Only those who
pass through the gates</i>

537
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:54,539
<i>"will be saved.</i>

538
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,346
<i>"Only they will find salvation.</i>

539
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:02,520
<i>"Only they will find the
ones they have lost."</i>

540
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:06,654
Mom?

541
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:13,932
Another waits for
you beyond the gate.

542
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:23,732
Jess?

543
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:35,777
Baby!

544
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:19,283
<i>Current heart rate tachycardia,</i>

545
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:21,323
<i>152 beats per minute.</i>

546
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:29,232
<i>Blood pressure, 143 over 94.</i>

547
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:32,997
<i>Respiratory rate, 28.</i>

548
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,130
Easy.

549
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,668
Easy.

550
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,507
<i>No physical trauma is detected.</i>

551
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,576
Karla?

552
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:42,545
You're okay.

553
00:50:42,614 --> 00:50:43,614
What?

554
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:51,617
How'd I get back here?

555
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:54,554
You came out of the gate.

556
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:57,590
You could barely stand.

557
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:02,727
I helped you back to the ship.

558
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:05,631
And what about Sean?

559
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:10,539
He didn't make it.

560
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:11,872
Mm-mmm.

561
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:13,104
No, what, no.

562
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:14,037
No, no, no, no.

563
00:51:14,106 --> 00:51:15,373
No.

564
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,542
Oh my god, what is going on?

565
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,382
We're all asking
the same question.

566
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,852
Where is Vance?

567
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
<i>I'm here.</i>

568
00:51:26,288 --> 00:51:27,819
I need to speak to you.

569
00:51:27,888 --> 00:51:31,493
<i>We need to know what
was beyond the gate.</i>

570
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:34,532
<i>The whole world is
waiting on your answer.</i>

571
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:45,671
I saw a golden landscape.

572
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,214
A beautiful...

573
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:53,184
golden landscape.

574
00:51:55,348 --> 00:51:57,188
And off in the distance,

575
00:51:57,955 --> 00:51:59,421
there was a city with

576
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,260
domes and towers

577
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:05,724
glinting in the sunlight.

578
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:09,299
Like a bloody

579
00:52:11,165 --> 00:52:12,434
new Jerusalem.

580
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:14,869
Like...

581
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:16,904
Heaven.

582
00:52:20,672 --> 00:52:22,444
<i>What happened next?</i>

583
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,279
I ran toward the city.

584
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:32,691
And then...

585
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:46,066
Um...

586
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,341
Then I was back here.

587
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,976
<i>I heard you whisper
your mother's name</i>

588
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,676
before you entered the gate.

589
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:55,745
Ugh.

590
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:01,012
Um...

591
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:02,081
I...

592
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:05,256
I don't remember.

593
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:06,923
Easy.

594
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:11,959
No.

595
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,563
There was no one else.

596
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,966
<i>Try to remember.</i>

597
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:19,468
There was nothing else.

598
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:21,772
Okay?

599
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:25,072
<i>You need to rest.</i>

600
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,093
What happened to Sean?

601
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,531
His suit ruptured.

602
00:53:50,696 --> 00:53:52,835
There was nothing we could do.

603
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:53,903
Ruptured?

604
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,770
Explorer suits don't rupture.

605
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:04,975
His glove wasn't
secured properly.

606
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,815
He decompressed.

607
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:13,120
There was nothing we could do.

608
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:15,827
It was quick.

609
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,023
I wanted him out there.

610
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,560
Sean was an
experienced explorer.

611
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,567
He knew how to fit a suit.

612
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:27,569
He made a mistake.

613
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:33,311
He was in too much of a
rush to get out there.

614
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:38,712
Vance is right,
you need to rest.

615
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,921
I have to get back
down to the sphere.

616
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:46,953
We need more answers.

617
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:47,890
Well...

618
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:48,958
You can't.

619
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:52,427
We're already prepping
to leave orbit, so...

620
00:54:52,495 --> 00:54:55,162
Why would we leave
without answers?

621
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,565
You do need to rest.

622
00:54:58,703 --> 00:55:01,405
You'd be more comfortable
in your own quarters.

623
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,503
Come.

624
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:21,524
I'm good from here.

625
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:23,255
Thanks.

626
00:55:26,063 --> 00:55:27,063
No cameras here.

627
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,640
Why do they think that
you held something back?

628
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:47,517
I don't know what
to trust anymore.

629
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:03,467
I saw something.

630
00:56:12,845 --> 00:56:13,845
What?

631
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,684
You know I lost them,

632
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:24,686
my family.

633
00:56:26,991 --> 00:56:27,991
Yeah.

634
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,561
I was in a coma for weeks,

635
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,061
head injuries, four
surgeries later,

636
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,030
I walked out of the hospital
but they didn't make it.

637
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,208
I saw them,

638
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:50,811
at the gate.

639
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:54,716
He knows what I saw.

640
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,882
I could see it in his eyes

641
00:56:57,951 --> 00:56:59,556
and I could hear
it in his questions

642
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,723
and he wanted me to
say it for the camera.

643
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:06,530
He knows something
about what this is.

644
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:13,504
So why isn't he telling us?

645
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:33,617
<i>Achilles will disengage
from the sphere's orbit</i>

646
00:57:33,686 --> 00:57:35,526
<i>in 30 minutes.</i>

647
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:54,243
How is she?

648
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:57,746
Exhausted.

649
00:57:58,712 --> 00:58:00,683
Did she say anything else?

650
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:03,921
No.

651
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:14,796
You went out of view.

652
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:17,832
She didn't say anything.

653
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:24,806
Prepare to leave orbit.

654
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:29,739
Confirmed.

655
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:48,566
We need her to tell us
everything about what she saw.

656
00:58:49,564 --> 00:58:50,832
She's holding back.

657
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,296
You heard what I heard.

658
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:55,837
You're getting way to
close to this woman.

659
00:58:56,974 --> 00:58:59,841
Remember your orders,
why you are on this ship.

660
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:03,046
I'm crystal clear.

661
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:04,648
Remain so.

662
00:59:14,553 --> 00:59:19,025
<i>Crew will assemble
in hibernation in one hour.</i>

663
01:00:03,535 --> 01:00:06,908
It appears Officer Grey has
broken into my quarters.

664
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:01,125
What the fuck are you doing?

665
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:03,228
What I told you I
was going to do.

666
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:05,466
Question.

667
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:09,069
And I got some great
answers about you.

668
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,937
Eight years Special Air Corps,

669
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,572
four years with the Elite Corps,

670
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:18,342
decorated more times than you
can probably even remember.

671
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:23,479
You weren't just good,
you were one of the best.

672
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:26,687
It was a different life.

673
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:27,996
What're you doing on this ship?

674
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:31,993
I was told to keep the peace.

675
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,059
That was it.

676
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:36,428
What do you know
about the sphere?

677
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:37,497
Nothing.

678
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:40,733
You know more than I do.

679
01:01:40,802 --> 01:01:42,102
You went through the gate.

680
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:44,269
I don't believe you.

681
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,904
There's nothing I
can do about that.

682
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:50,011
Okay, move.

683
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:53,116
Where are we going?

684
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:54,185
Move.

685
01:02:14,537 --> 01:02:15,969
This is mutiny.

686
01:02:16,038 --> 01:02:19,003
That's a death
sentence back on Earth.

687
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:22,044
Well, apparently, the sphere

688
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,310
is the death sentence
for an entire planet, so,

689
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:28,451
it's time for the truth.

690
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,587
Well you already have it.

691
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,949
You saw what was
beyond the gate.

692
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:34,484
Okay, I'll start, shall I?

693
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:37,227
Sean...

694
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,260
was murdered.

695
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:45,829
Oh yeah, I saw the suit,
there's nothing wrong with it.

696
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:46,936
He was shot.

697
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:51,039
You killed him.

698
01:02:53,972 --> 01:02:54,977
You're a hitman.

699
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,310
Hired to clean up any problems.

700
01:03:00,284 --> 01:03:01,284
But why?

701
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,651
I want the truth.

702
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,220
They all want the truth,

703
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:08,221
I'm pretty sure you'll
cut this part out though.

704
01:03:09,191 --> 01:03:11,058
Tell them what you
saw beyond the gate.

705
01:03:11,127 --> 01:03:14,095
You know what I saw
and so does Vance.

706
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,531
How?

707
01:03:24,504 --> 01:03:27,009
<i>We believe that what
you saw was real.</i>

708
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:30,111
<i>That you glimpsed Heaven.</i>

709
01:03:30,845 --> 01:03:32,548
That was not Heaven.

710
01:03:32,616 --> 01:03:34,183
<i>Then what was it?</i>

711
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:37,118
<i>Even a scientist must
believe her own eyes.</i>

712
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,989
<i>We're not your enemies.</i>

713
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:45,788
Your enforcer will kill me
the first chance he gets.

714
01:03:45,857 --> 01:03:49,161
<i>Why would I seek
to harm you, of all people?</i>

715
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,495
You stay away from me!

716
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,237
<i>This cannot be stopped.</i>

717
01:03:54,306 --> 01:03:56,801
<i>Besides,</i>

718
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,847
<i>people have already started
to make their own choice.</i>

719
01:03:58,871 --> 01:04:01,676
<i>...Have
appeared all over the world.</i>

720
01:04:01,744 --> 01:04:03,277
<i>It is estimated...</i>

721
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:05,021
<i>The earth has become
a living hell.</i>

722
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,312
<i>People want to escape.</i>

723
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:08,545
<i>Escape to paradise.</i>

724
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,850
Holy shit.

725
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,719
This has to be stopped.

726
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:24,500
You won't.

727
01:04:37,976 --> 01:04:39,180
Am I next?

728
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:42,190
What are you doing?

729
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:44,483
<i>I'm not doing anything, Karla.</i>

730
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:46,682
<i>Not even I can stop
what's happening.</i>

731
01:04:50,462 --> 01:04:51,462
You need help.

732
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:55,232
And then I'll take this
ship anywhere you wanna go.

733
01:04:55,301 --> 01:04:56,301
Sure.

734
01:04:57,635 --> 01:04:59,468
Why would you do that?

735
01:04:59,537 --> 01:05:01,337
You killed Sean.

736
01:05:01,406 --> 01:05:02,239
Yeah.

737
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:03,308
Yeah.

738
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,409
And now...

739
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,343
Now you're gonna kill me.

740
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:09,412
No.

741
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,214
You're not the only one
who wants the truth.

742
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:16,019
When I stepped on this ship,

743
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:17,988
I had no idea where
all this was going.

744
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,452
I don't know what the sphere is.

745
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,462
Okay.

746
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:41,236
You were lucky.

747
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,305
Just a flesh wound.

748
01:05:43,415 --> 01:05:44,415
Yeah.

749
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:45,449
Lucky.

750
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,253
I wanna go back to the sphere.

751
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:56,158
But Vance has control of Miz.

752
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:03,264
I have the code to override her.

753
01:06:05,903 --> 01:06:07,466
We would have to lose the heel.

754
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,568
She's too big to
control manually.

755
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:12,673
So,

756
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:15,573
we'd lose main propulsion

757
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:19,181
and...

758
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,415
our way back to Earth.

759
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:28,289
Achilles propulsion
should make it

760
01:06:30,928 --> 01:06:32,425
but it would take a long time.

761
01:06:33,597 --> 01:06:34,156
How long?

762
01:06:34,225 --> 01:06:36,132
Five, six years.

763
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:39,700
More,

764
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:41,368
I'm guessing.

765
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:44,272
We're not going to get
to go home, are we?

766
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:48,276
It's not looking good.

767
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,317
There is something
else we could do.

768
01:07:29,785 --> 01:07:30,785
<i>Karla.</i>

769
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,952
<i>You intend to return
to the sphere.</i>

770
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,021
I do.

771
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:40,496
Or destroy it if
you try to stop me.

772
01:07:40,565 --> 01:07:41,565
<i>Why?</i>

773
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:43,364
Because this whole
thing is a lie.

774
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:47,700
What are you doing?

775
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:50,334
<i>I gave the world a scientist
who would discover God.</i>

776
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:53,171
Cut the bullshit, what is this?

777
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,274
You did not discover God.

778
01:07:55,343 --> 01:07:57,510
<i>But you could now become God.</i>

779
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:00,244
And what does that mean?

780
01:08:00,312 --> 01:08:01,547
<i>Go to your screen.</i>

781
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:05,589
Okie-doke.

782
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:10,432
<i>Achilles files classified.</i>

783
01:08:10,456 --> 01:08:13,760
<i>Sphere schematics accessed.</i>

784
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:19,268
<i>A self replicating
material called Bio-Mech 34987,</i>

785
01:08:19,336 --> 01:08:21,832
<i>capable of building
huge structures</i>

786
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,834
<i>to a preconceived
design very quickly.</i>

787
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,207
<i>The patent of the
advanced Achilles program</i>

788
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:30,510
<i>which I am very proud.</i>

789
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,816
You built this?

790
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:52,833
Why?

791
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:58,571
<i>I'll tell you a story about
a once beautiful planet</i>

792
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:02,476
<i>that sits at the center
of the Milky Way.</i>

793
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,178
<i>The planet that was
the jewel in the crown</i>

794
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:07,514
of the known universe.

795
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:11,518
<i>The planet whose beauty
was beyond comparison</i>

796
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:15,488
<i>and then came human beings</i>

797
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:17,319
<i>and over tens of
thousands of years</i>

798
01:09:17,388 --> 01:09:21,364
<i>this planet was brought to
the very point of extinction.</i>

799
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:24,961
<i>21 billion people now
cram into the 15 percent</i>

800
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:28,833
<i>of the Earth's service
that is still habitable.</i>

801
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:32,605
<i>Scientists tell us
that within 30 years</i>

802
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:35,245
<i>this planet will die.</i>

803
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:38,776
<i>The human race must be culled.</i>

804
01:09:38,844 --> 01:09:41,581
<i>The many sacrificed
to save the few</i>

805
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:43,788
<i>or we all die.</i>

806
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:45,886
So,

807
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:49,490
people enter the gates on Earth

808
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:52,427
and go to their deaths

809
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,563
but you tell them that it's God?

810
01:09:58,032 --> 01:09:59,032
Well?

811
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:02,668
You got me to do that
for you for you.

812
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:06,243
<i>To save the few.</i>

813
01:10:07,606 --> 01:10:09,510
How many do you plan to kill?

814
01:10:11,213 --> 01:10:12,843
<i>In excess of 15 billion,</i>

815
01:10:14,183 --> 01:10:15,516
<i>saving six billion.</i>

816
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,947
So this...

817
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:22,622
is your final solution?

818
01:10:26,259 --> 01:10:27,429
How do they die?

819
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:32,335
<i>Each gate houses a
contained Event Horizon.</i>

820
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:36,405
<i>They step into oblivion.</i>

821
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:39,106
<i>It's quite painless.</i>

822
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:41,036
<i>Instant non-existence.</i>

823
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:44,545
Another Vance Achilles
patent, no doubt.

824
01:10:49,615 --> 01:10:51,519
The figure at the gate said

825
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:53,886
that the sphere would
destroy the earth.

826
01:10:53,954 --> 01:10:57,922
<i>The sphere has no
destructive capabilities.</i>

827
01:10:57,991 --> 01:11:00,561
<i>It was conceived to
appear as a threat.</i>

828
01:11:01,826 --> 01:11:05,031
<i>As a judgment.</i>

829
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,530
Well then,

830
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,104
people would discover the lie.

831
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:09,939
<i>Before it reaches the earth,</i>

832
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:12,538
<i>the sphere will self-destruct.</i>

833
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:14,471
<i>A coordinated military strike</i>

834
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,941
<i>credited with its destruction.</i>

835
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,009
<i>By then, billions
will already be dead.</i>

836
01:11:20,077 --> 01:11:22,446
<i>The sphere's secret
hidden forever.</i>

837
01:11:22,514 --> 01:11:23,914
<i>If we do nothing,</i>

838
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:26,587
<i>the planet will die.</i>

839
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,557
<i>There will be no one left.</i>

840
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,595
How did I see

841
01:11:37,101 --> 01:11:38,599
what was beyond the gate?

842
01:11:41,872 --> 01:11:42,872
My mother,

843
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:46,541
and then Jess.

844
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:51,408
<i>Listen.</i>

845
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:53,014
<i>Mom!</i>

846
01:11:53,082 --> 01:11:54,214
<i>Karla?</i>

847
01:11:54,283 --> 01:11:55,814
<i>After your accident,</i>

848
01:11:56,914 --> 01:12:00,589
<i>we placed a chip in your head</i>

849
01:12:00,657 --> 01:12:03,824
<i>which would be activated
for this mission.</i>

850
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:06,226
<i>Through which we could
get you to see or hear</i>

851
01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:08,028
<i>whatever we wanted.</i>

852
01:12:15,071 --> 01:12:16,071
And you woke me

853
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:20,641
before I could reach her.

854
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:29,584
You've been preparing me
for this trip for two years.

855
01:12:31,122 --> 01:12:33,786
You arranged the accident

856
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:36,624
so you could put this
thing in my head.

857
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:42,663
You murdered my family

858
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:45,600
to save the few?

859
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:49,169
<i>Yes.</i>

860
01:12:50,635 --> 01:12:53,806
Everything you are

861
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:57,045
for me...

862
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:00,648
is a lie.

863
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:29,204
I miss my mum.

864
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:32,878
And I wish she was here.

865
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:37,779
She would tell you a story.

866
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:39,115
<i>What story?</i>

867
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:41,255
It's a goodie.

868
01:13:44,889 --> 01:13:48,223
Five men adrift on the ocean

869
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:53,195
with only enough food and
water for three to survive,

870
01:13:54,303 --> 01:13:55,736
so two have to die.

871
01:13:57,205 --> 01:13:58,205
<i>Exactly.</i>

872
01:13:59,672 --> 01:14:01,071
<i>Your mother understood.</i>

873
01:14:01,947 --> 01:14:03,673
Yeah, well,

874
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:05,746
she was a very smart lady.

875
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:11,719
But that's not

876
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,525
how her story ends.

877
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,662
You see, she
understood something

878
01:14:23,694 --> 01:14:24,963
that you don't.

879
01:14:27,804 --> 01:14:31,701
They could find fish or
an island to sustain them

880
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,235
or even a ship could come.

881
01:14:34,744 --> 01:14:37,910
No one knows what
the ocean will bring.

882
01:14:39,447 --> 01:14:40,649
All of us deserve

883
01:14:41,713 --> 01:14:46,688
to find our own future.

884
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,859
<i>Is this your final solution?</i>

885
01:14:55,197 --> 01:14:56,197
You're...

886
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,798
a fucking...

887
01:15:00,036 --> 01:15:01,036
monster.

888
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:21,591
I armed the core.

889
01:15:23,922 --> 01:15:25,826
<i>Then you leave me no choice.</i>

890
01:15:26,558 --> 01:15:27,597
Ulph?

891
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,104
You need to get
back to the Achilles

892
01:15:30,128 --> 01:15:31,592
and bring the core with you now!

893
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:32,663
Why?

894
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:33,772
What's happening up there?

895
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:35,465
Just get back here.

896
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:39,939
But I can't detonate the core
remotely from the Achilles.

897
01:15:40,805 --> 01:15:42,007
I understand that.

898
01:15:43,212 --> 01:15:44,647
<i>Miz,</i>

899
01:15:44,716 --> 01:15:47,579
<i>begin the auto
destruct of the ship.</i>

900
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:51,218
<i>Sequence code 21397.</i>

901
01:15:53,024 --> 01:15:55,119
<i>Achilles self-destruct
sequence is initiated.</i>

902
01:15:56,895 --> 01:16:00,062
<i>Achilles will self-destruct
in three minutes.</i>

903
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,130
Holy shit.

904
01:16:02,132 --> 01:16:03,865
Fuck this.

905
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,133
<i>Ulph will not make
it back in time.</i>

906
01:16:06,202 --> 01:16:07,637
<i>Besides,</i>

907
01:16:07,705 --> 01:16:09,669
<i>Miz will prevent
you from disengaging</i>

908
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:12,136
<i>the Achilles from the heel.</i>

909
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:14,644
<i>I will ask you
this one more time.</i>

910
01:16:16,011 --> 01:16:18,241
<i>Will you help me in
this great cause?</i>

911
01:16:20,813 --> 01:16:22,883
No one gets to play Deus.

912
01:16:27,358 --> 01:16:28,889
<i>Goodbye, Karla Grey.</i>

913
01:16:29,955 --> 01:16:31,892
<i>My second greatest creation.</i>

914
01:16:49,047 --> 01:16:54,016
<i>Achilles will
self-destruct in two minutes.</i>

915
01:16:54,085 --> 01:16:55,249
Ulph,

916
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:56,318
where are you?

917
01:16:56,914 --> 01:16:58,585
I'm near transit.

918
01:16:58,654 --> 01:17:00,455
You have under two minutes!

919
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:02,791
Yeah, I heard that, thanks.

920
01:17:03,459 --> 01:17:05,159
Hey, listen to me.

921
01:17:05,228 --> 01:17:08,291
Go to my station and bring up
the ship's docking schematic.

922
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:10,760
Can you find that?

923
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:12,093
I'm on it!

924
01:17:12,162 --> 01:17:14,569
Bring up the manual override

925
01:17:14,637 --> 01:17:16,299
and it will ask you for a code.

926
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,877
Move, you fucker.

927
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:29,249
I'm in but I don't have a code.

928
01:17:29,318 --> 01:17:30,687
I do.

929
01:17:30,755 --> 01:17:31,760
<i>Achilles will self-destruct...</i>

930
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:32,717
- Ready?
- Yes.

931
01:17:32,785 --> 01:17:33,917
<i>...In one minute.</i>

932
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:35,922
Code is, zero, zero, seven,

933
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:40,160
six, five, seven,
eight, six, five,

934
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:41,326
89,

935
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:43,065
73.

936
01:17:43,134 --> 01:17:45,761
<i>Manual control
of the Achilles is confirmed.</i>

937
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,432
Okay, we're in.

938
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,569
Okay.

939
01:17:48,638 --> 01:17:49,970
We can separate the ship now.

940
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,170
You need to get back here.

941
01:17:53,308 --> 01:17:55,307
No shit!

942
01:17:55,376 --> 01:17:58,748
<i>Achilles will
self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

943
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:07,882
I'm not gonna make it back.

944
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:09,489
You have to go.

945
01:18:09,558 --> 01:18:10,859
I'm waiting for you.

946
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,161
You can't.

947
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,200
<i>Achilles will
self-destruct in ten,</i>

948
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:19,102
<i>nine,</i>

949
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,565
<i>eight,</i>

950
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:21,796
<i>seven,</i>

951
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,205
<i>six,</i>

952
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:24,273
<i>five,</i>

953
01:18:24,307 --> 01:18:25,438
<i>four,</i>

954
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:26,735
<i>three,</i>

955
01:18:26,804 --> 01:18:28,077
<i>two,</i>

956
01:18:28,146 --> 01:18:29,508
<i>one,</i>

957
01:18:29,576 --> 01:18:31,005
<i>zero.</i>

958
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:41,652
<i>Achilles self-destruct
sequence is initiated.</i>

959
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,270
Ulph!

960
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:35,537
<i>Life support
systems are re-calibrated</i>

961
01:20:35,606 --> 01:20:37,137
<i>for two crew members.</i>

962
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:45,113
<i>I have a special
delivery for Miss Karla Grey.</i>

963
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:47,877
<i>Could someone come down
and sign for it, please?</i>

964
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:55,155
Where do I sign?

965
01:21:35,165 --> 01:21:39,199
We have no way of remotely
detonating the core now.

966
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:44,941
It has to be done
manually from the surface.

967
01:21:45,808 --> 01:21:47,207
Then we'll do it together.

968
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:52,014
I had no idea...

969
01:21:55,113 --> 01:21:56,480
what Vance was planning.

970
01:22:01,324 --> 01:22:05,621
He only put me on board to
take care of any problems.

971
01:22:09,193 --> 01:22:11,231
I even fucked that up.

972
01:22:17,205 --> 01:22:20,372
But he didn't bargain
for you, did he?

973
01:22:25,076 --> 01:22:26,312
None of us did.

974
01:22:38,426 --> 01:22:40,829
<i>Airlock compression is complete.</i>

975
01:22:40,897 --> 01:22:42,563
<i>Crew are cleared to proceed.</i>

976
01:22:46,267 --> 01:22:48,536
Hold on a minute, will you?

977
01:22:48,605 --> 01:22:49,605
Okay.

978
01:23:00,312 --> 01:23:01,677
What are you doing?

979
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:03,984
<i>Inner airlock door is secured.</i>

980
01:23:04,052 --> 01:23:06,750
<i>Decompression is initiated.</i>

981
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:07,819
No.

982
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,361
No.

983
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:14,525
You have to get back.

984
01:23:15,728 --> 01:23:18,661
You have to tell the story
of what happened here.

985
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:23,199
Tell them the truth
about the sphere.

986
01:23:23,267 --> 01:23:25,173
That's more important.

987
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:30,611
Please.

988
01:23:36,115 --> 01:23:38,120
Please, don't do this.

989
01:23:41,318 --> 01:23:43,059
I'll never make it back.

990
01:23:44,288 --> 01:23:45,622
You'll make it back.

991
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,296
You know, I have a funny feeling

992
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:52,662
this is just the
beginning of your story,

993
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:55,832
Karla Grey.

994
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:58,107
No.

995
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:08,751
Just get home.

996
01:24:31,803 --> 01:24:33,835
<i>Outer airlock doors are secured.</i>

997
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:25,821
You fucking bastard.

998
01:26:04,295 --> 01:26:05,696
One fine day,

999
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:11,933
I'm gonna have a
proper drink with you,

1000
01:26:13,337 --> 01:26:14,474
Karla Grey.

1001
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:21,375
