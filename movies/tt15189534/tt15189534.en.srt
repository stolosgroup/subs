<i>Odile & Odette,</i>
the big new novel by Kloster.

3
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,330
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,502
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Here, here please.

5
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,922
- Kloster!
- Go back, please.

6
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,257
A moment, please.

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,841
Excuse me.

8
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:54,054
Kloster, Luciana is waiting for you
on the third floor mezzanine.

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,264
It's about Valentina.

10
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,307
If you don't want a scene, you better go.

11
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,019
All right.

12
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,605
- He'll sign in a moment.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,232
Organize this. I'll be right back.

14
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,315
An autograph?

15
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,609
All right.

16
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:12,489
We'll have a short break
and organize the book signing.

17
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,366
Kloster! Could you sign...?

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,952
- Kloster, a picture, please!
- Not now.

19
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,664
Kloster, one moment.
<i>El Metropolitano.</i> Just a picture.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,166
- Hey! Hands off! I'm working.
- No pictures.

21
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,118
Esteban! How are you?

22
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,077
How are you doing?

23
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,246
What about you? I thought you got fired.

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,707
No. I mean, yeah.
I'm here for another reason.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,001
Because Andrés told me
you had trouble with...

26
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,545
Kloster!

27
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,389
- Kloster!
- What happened?

28
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,841
- Excuse me!
- Kloster!

29
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,217
Kloster!

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,060
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE SLOW DEATH OF LUCIANA B

32
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,521
BY GUILLERMO MARTÍNEZ

33
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,219
12 YEARS EARLIER

34
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,722
"The old monk took comfort

35
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,851
from the conclusion that the murderer
must belong to a different species."

36
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,979
"An evil being,

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,231
rejected by the human race,

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,361
with a visage as horrifying
as the mutilated bodies of his victims."

39
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,572
"He was ruthless."

40
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,991
"His murders..."

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,660
Scratch that last part. Start over.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,830
"He was merciless."

43
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,502
"His actions stunned
like the headlights of a car on the road,

44
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,381
and, all too late, his victims realized

45
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,302
they had become a frightened hare,

46
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:26,475
incapable of anything other than waiting
for the fatal denouement."

47
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,196
"The old monk...

48
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,367
...recalled his tenure
as a prison chaplain,

49
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,163
where those sentenced to death..."

50
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,212
Luciana, where are the prisoners' letters?

51
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,091
Here.

52
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,303
I separated them from the other readers.

53
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,806
Are you done?

54
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,016
No, we still have
a while to go, princess.

55
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,520
I'll finish here
and go play with you, all right, Pauli?

56
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,687
All right.

57
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,771
Bye.

58
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,152
I looked up the poisonous mushrooms.

59
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,279
My mom is an expert.

60
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,741
Every year she makes a mushroom pie
for Dad on their anniversary.

61
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,327
He hates it, but she doesn't know that.

62
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,288
This one is edible,

63
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,666
and this one is poisonous.

64
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,543
This is the cap,

65
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,710
the ring,

66
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,794
the stem,

67
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,963
and the volva.

68
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,925
They're almost identical.
The only difference is the volva, here.

69
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,218
Here.

70
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,887
They look like button mushrooms,

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,849
so you have to look at the volva

72
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,227
because it could have detached
or fallen off.

73
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,187
Thank you very much.

74
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,027
- What's this one called?
- Tini.

75
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,153
And what are they?

76
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,947
- Sisters.
- They're sisters?

77
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,700
- I like that.
- Do you have siblings?

78
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,617
Yeah.

79
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,412
I've got a sister your age
named Valentina.

80
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,165
I've got an older brother, Ramiro,
and my eldest brother is Bruno.

81
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,459
- I don't have any!
- Chatterbox.

82
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,753
How about you let Luciana go home?

83
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,671
No!

84
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,882
- No?
- Can we play with my dolls again?

85
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,634
- Sure, anytime. Ciao, Pauli.
- I love it.

86
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,971
Sorry I took so long to rescue you.

87
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,975
- It's all right. I like being with Pauli.
- Don't feel obligated.

88
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,437
I'm always so embarrassed
when you have to stay late.

89
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,857
We should have a playdate
with my sister Valentina sometime.

90
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,150
They're alike.

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,694
Until next week.

92
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,156
Bye.

93
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,118
Doesn't it need a little more?

94
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,245
- Yeah.
- So we cover it.

95
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,705
- Like this?
- Right.

96
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,042
- Throw with both hands.
- Very good.

97
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,550
- There it is.
- There's a little hole.

98
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,796
That's better.

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,299
Now we put it in the oven,
so when you come out...

100
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,717
Your bath is ready, princess.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,928
Yeah!

102
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,554
Are you coming, Daddy?

103
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,639
I'll be right there.

104
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,445
Pauli! Dirty clothes go in the hamper.

105
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,072
Yep!

106
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>♪ Dive into the water
Then come back up ♪</i>

107
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,803
There we go!

108
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,888
Good, very good.

109
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,516
- Look at you fly!
- Daddy, look how high I can jump!

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,726
- You're gonna fly off.
- I can touch the sky.

111
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,021
Okay, keep doing that. Yeah.

112
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,607
- Let's see how you fly.
- Yea!

113
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,234
Almost like you've got wings.

114
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,151
Yeah.

115
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,237
You're beautiful. Give me a kiss.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,321
I love you.

117
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,531
I love you, Dad.

118
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,074
What? I didn't catch that.

119
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,451
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

120
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,836
PRESENT DAY

121
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,797
<i>Please, I ask that
you're careful with what you report</i>

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,049
<i>so as to keep the community calm.</i>

123

00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,850

126
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,935
<i>and we're investigating...</i>

127
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,443
Rey?

128
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,236
I'm almost done.

129
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,324
- What did Ramoneda say?
- We talked, he doesn't know anything.

130
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,911
Hurry up. Management got pissed off
after last week.

131
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,997
- You'll get it before nine.
- Okay.

132
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,834
It's tea.

133
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,587
Have it by nine.

134
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,769
PRIVATE NUMBER

135
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,939
Hello?

136
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>Esteban Rey?</i>

137
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,610
That's me. Who is this?

138
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>Luciana Blanco.
Do you remember me? I was your assistant.</i>

139
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,742
Yeah.

140
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,578
Yeah, like ten years ago. How are you?

141
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,704
<i>Twelve years.</i>

142
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,707
<i>I need to see you.
Urgently. It's about Kloster.</i>

143
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,126
About Kloster?

144
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,377
<i>You don't know, do you?</i>

145
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,462
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

146
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,464
But what happened with Kloster?

147
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,257
<i>Not over the phone.</i>

148
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>Can you come over and we'll talk?</i>

149
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,135
Now?

150
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,346
<i>Yes, now. Can you come?</i>

151
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,579
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- Esteban.

152
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:22,849
Hi.

153
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,933
Hi.

154
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,730
"He kissed her mouth...

155
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,691
...and felt her give in,

156
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,987
and her lips opened to answer his kiss."

157
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,950
"He held her tightly

158
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,663
and then felt her tongue seek his."

159
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,294
Is that the end?

160
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,508
Not really, but the next part
is a little explicit.

161
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,636
Kloster dictates worse things.

162
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,096
Worse, or better?

163
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,686
- You won't tell me what he's writing?
- I can't tell you.

164
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,730
Coffee?

165
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,813
Sure.

166
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,947
Come in.

167
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,250
Thanks for coming.

168
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,627
Sorry for showing up out of nowhere.

169
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
It's fine.

170
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,628
Sit down.

171
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,506
Do you want a drink?

172
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,592
- No, I'm good.
- Sit.

173
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,184
Kloster became famous
publishing a novel he dictated to me.

174
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,852
But you know that.

175
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,398
I wanna talk about something
no one else knows.

176
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,444
I thought the punishment had been enough,
but the deaths continued.

177
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,948
What deaths?

178
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,368
My family's.

179
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,289
Who is killing them?

180
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,081
Kloster.

181
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,461
I need your help.

182
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,758
Kloster is murdering your family?

183
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,386
One by one for more than ten years.

184
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,139
I haven't been able to stop him yet.

185
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,474
No one believed me,
but now it's different.

186
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,352
This time I can get ahead of him.
That's why I need your help.

187
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,314
Esteban,

188
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,441
I saw him again today.

189
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,320
He was right by the nursing home
where my mother is. She's next.

190
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,658
How do you know he's targeting her?
Couldn't it be a coincidence?

191
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,329
My mom being in a nursing home
at 58 with neurological damage

192
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,455
is because of him.

193
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,333
There are no coincidences around Kloster.

194
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,377
Mm hmm.

195
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,171
I need you to write my story.

196
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,631
Write it?

197
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,715
Yes.

198
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,301
And publish it.

199
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,138
When we met,

200
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,351
you told me that Kloster
was a mysterious, secretive writer.

201
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,144
- Yeah.
- Right.

202
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,356
After he started killing my family,
he's seen everywhere. Why?

203
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,649
I don't know.

204
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,944
It's the perfect alibi.

205
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,616
No one can fathom the idea
that a celebrity could be a murderer.

206
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,159
Of course.

207
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,452
Yes.

208
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,755
I can't just write anything
in the newspaper.

209
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,048
I can't help you.

210
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,343
I didn't call because you're
a famous journalist.

211
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,013
I called you because you've got
a score to settle with Kloster.

212
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,106
<i>Who is it?</i>

213
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,441
Mercedes, it's Luciana.

214
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,651
<i>Come in.</i>

215
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
Thanks.

216
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

217
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,574
- Hi, Pauli!
- Hi. I'll be right back!

218
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,993
Pauli, we're about to go.
Where are you going?

219
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,538
I'm coming! Just a minute!

220
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,999
It's our girls' day out.

221
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
Here!

222
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,003
- Is it for me?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,882
- That's nice.
- It's the four of us.

224
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,219
This is Mom, Dad, me, and you.

225
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,139
I love it. Thanks.

226
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,143
Now, Luciana has to work with Dad.

227
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,061
- Let's go.
- Bye.

228
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,145
Bye.

229
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,943
EXODUS

230
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,779
What an interesting edition.
Where did you get it?

231
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,199
- My Dad, he's a pastor.
- Uh huh.

232
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,995
I brought it because it might have
another take on the<i> lex talionis.</i>

233
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,663
It's basically the same thing.

234
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,582
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth

235
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,461
isn't about doing to the aggressor
what they did to the victim,

236
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,628
but instead seeks to...

237
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,425
generate a punishment equivalent
to the suffering inflicted.

238
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,468
Oh.

239
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,515
For example, my wife.

240
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,601
She was a ballet dancer

241
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,437
until a careless driver

242
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,858
fractured her tibia and ended her career.

243
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,611
To honor <i>lex talionis,</i>

244
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,405
it wouldn't be enough
to break the driver's tibia.

245
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,700
Because the suffering he caused Mercedes

246
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,745
by destroying her career
goes beyond the fracture itself.

247
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,456
I like your explanation.

248
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,794
Mercedes really was a ballet dancer?

249
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,883
She was part of the permanent company
of the national ballet.

250
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,719
My sister wants to be a dancer.

251
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,181
- I talked to Esteban.
- Esteban?

252
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,849
Esteban Rey, the other writer.

253
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,727
Esteban Rey hired you?
How did he find you?

254
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,895
I think it was Campari.

255
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,481
I don't think so, Campari's very reserved.

256
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,399
Then, someone from the publisher,

257
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,109
because he said he knew you.

258
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,445
I know who he is, but I haven't met him.

259
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
That's weird.

260
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,658
He sends material often.

261
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,534
Is it good?

262
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,912
I think I read one of his novels once.

263
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,330
I don't remember the name.

264
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,415
But he won't stop sending me things.

265
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,334
I don't know how he writes so much.

266
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,086
Esteban is quick.

267
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,881
But he doesn't have your talent.

268
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,802
Where were we?

269
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,305
"He pressed down on Elena's neck."

270
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,433
"He pressed down on Elena's neck..."

271
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
Semi-colon.

272
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:49,360
"...intending to prolong the magical
twilight between life and death,

273
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,657
then eased off enough
so that a lungful of oxygen

274
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,204
allowed her to continue
her futile struggle for survival.<i>"</i>

275
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,874
"His gaze was...

276
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,212
lost on the blemish on Elena's arm,

277
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,842
where the snake had left a deep scar

278
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,137
in the shape of a coin."

279
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,725
I've got a scar like that.

280
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,809
Here.

281
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
This one.

282
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,327
What are you doing?

283
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,620
What do you mean?

284
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,331
Did I misunderstand?
You kept giving me signals.

285
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,082
Signals?

286
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,917
- Yes, signals.
- What signals?

287
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,837
I can't believe it.

288
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,672
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

289
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,593
Luciana.

290
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,017
- Will you stop?
- That hurts.

291
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,378
Because you won't let me open...
Can you just stop moving?

292
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,629
Dad will take it off.

293
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,506
No, I will take it off.

294
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,676
You're mean.

295
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,844
Paula, please? Will you let go?

296
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,389
- No.
- Let go of my hand.

297
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,975
What's wrong?

298
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,769
Princess!

299
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,105
- Daddy.
- Yeah, come here.

300
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,314
Don't be scared.

301
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,232
It's Mom.

302
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,858
Take her to her room!

303
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,984
It's all right.

304
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,320
- She's unbearable!
- Wanna go to your room?

305
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,655
All day!

306
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,407
- Come on.
- I don't want Mommy.

307
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,283
How about you give her a bath?

308
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,369
<i>We thank you, Lord.</i>

309
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,413
Bless this family always

310
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,207
and any who might be suffering
in their home. Amen.

311
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,667
- Amen.
- Amen.

312
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,462
How was your first day
as a resident, Bruno?

313
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,797
Good.

314
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,925
We toured the hospital
and met the doctors.

315
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,303
- Great. Did they give you those scrubs?
- I bought these.

316
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,973
Honey!

317
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,683
You were coming later.

318
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,685
We finished early.

319
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,730
- I'll get you a plate.
- I'm not eating. Thanks, Mom.

320
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,273
At least sit down with us.

321
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,066
I have a stomachache.

322
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,656
What's wrong?

323
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Nothing.

324
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,951
Was it something at work?

325
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,162
No. I can't find my notes. Where are they?

326
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,665
- You had trouble with Kloster.
- No. I'll get through it. It's nothing.

327
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,208
I won't be working with him again.

328
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,337
But what happened, Lu? You were so happy.

329
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,841
It was nothing, really.

330
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,385
But I'm not going back.

331
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,197
I swear I'm trying.

332
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,366
But sometimes I can't control myself.

333
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,538
Calm down, darling.

334
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,792
I'm trying.

335
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,048
And then she looks so small
and I can't understand why I did it.

336
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,761
You did very well
to get back home right away.

337
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,681
These things take time,
that's what the psychiatrist said.

338
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,893
We'll go out tomorrow, all three,
have a good time,

339
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,353
and Pauli will forget it.

340
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,605
You've got work tomorrow,
and Luciana's coming.

341
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,900
No, Luciana won't be working here anymore.

342
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,402
Really? Why?

343
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,906
She did bad on her last exams,

344
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,951
and her parents want her
to focus on her studies.

345
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,746
That's weird,
she didn't even say bye to Pauli.

346
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,374
She probably didn't know how to.

347
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,336
It's not just about the severance.

348
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,673
The guy hired you under the table,
so you have to demand all of it,

349
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,133
social security, pensions, etc.

350
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,637
So, advance notice...

351
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,852
vacation days, bonus, Law 24013...

352
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,563
a fine for Article 80...

353
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,006
Lu, tell the counselor
he tried to kiss you.

354
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,901
Yeah, but it was nothing.

355
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,573
Sexual harassment in the workplace
is a serious issue.

356
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,118
Was it one time or several?

357
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,201
Just one time.

358
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,079
- Are you sure?
- Uh huh.

359
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,833
There weren't any malicious comments,
or any physical contact...

360
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,294
No, it was just a kiss. It wasn't violent.

361
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,631
Well, if it's like that
and there are no witnesses,

362
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,633
it's your word against his.

363
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,760
And it'd just be the workplace claim.

364
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,386
Let's see.

365
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,854
That's a lot of money.

366
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,773
It's not what he'll pay,
it's what we'll ask for.

367
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,819
Usually, after mediation
we'll reach a compromise,

368
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,822
but if we include
the sexual harassment lawsuit,

369
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,908
he'll want to settle quickly.

370
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,951
And that works in our favor.

371
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,414
Here, at the bottom...

372
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,792
signature, name, and ID number.

373
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:43,547
Don't worry, I'll prepare the claim later.

374
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,219
What happened to you was awful.

375
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,267
But I can't publish it.

376
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,021
I can't accuse him of murder
without proof.

377
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,648
Who'd believe me?

378
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,191
You're not listening.

379
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,610
Write that I'm accusing him.

380
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,904
I doesn't matter if they say I'm crazy,

381
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,614
doesn't matter if they believe me.

382
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,532
If they try me, I don't care.

383
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,244
I need people to talk about this,
to make it public.

384
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,582
Imagine the media scandal
if someone else in my family dies.

385
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,959
He wouldn't risk it.

386
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,753
He has much more to lose than me.

387
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,838
And you.

388
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,763
No, I'm sorry, but I can't.

389
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,058
What do I gain making enemies
with someone so powerful?

390
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,518
He's already your enemy.

391
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,520
What do you mean?

392
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,899
I don't think you became a journalist
because you wanted to, right?

393
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,858
Eh?

394
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,028
You think he didn't see your piece
after what happened to his family?

395
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,198
Why do you think
no publisher will answer your calls?

396
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,784
- Even Campari ignores you.
- That was a long time ago.

397
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,911
You care. Or you wouldn't be here.

398
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,289
- Hi.
- Valentina, my sister.

399
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,083
- Esteban, a friend.
- What's up?

400
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,751
I'll walk you out.

401
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,173
Valentina doesn't know anything.

402
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,217
She was young when this started.

403
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,094
I want to protect her.

404
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,638
She doesn't know what it's like
to be afraid.

405
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,977
Are you gonna help me?

406
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,272
I'll think about it.

407
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:11,153
THE SLOW DEATH OF LUCIANA B.

408
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,659
If he's not here in five minutes,

409
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,079
I'll consider the mediation finished.

410
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,579
Okay.

411
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,376
Either he's not taking us seriously
or he has bad counsel.

412
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,005
In any case,
this allows us to go straight to a trial.

413
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,147
How much do you want?

414
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:54,655
Including legal expenses, 1,862,000 pesos.

415
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,324
But that's just a reference figure.

416
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,326
You can wait for your lawyer to get here.

417
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,309
I never had
such a short mediation.

418
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,896
All right, girl,
go cash that check.

419
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,357
I've never seen him like that, Mom.

420
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,747
Probably because of what happened.

421
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,320
What happened to him?

422
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,407
His wife and daughter
passed recently.

423
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,616
It was tragic.

424
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,001
MOM - DAD - ME - LUCIANA

425
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,717
Here, Lu. She's a dancer.

426
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,843
Thanks.

427
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,178
Come here.

428
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,972
Don't cry.

429
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,110
Valen, go with Mom,

430
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,862
I have to talk to Lu.

431
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,945
Come on, go.

432
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,531
I'll be down soon.

433
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,615
Yeah, Dad.

434
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,997
Mom told me that you don't want to
go to the beach with us this summer.

435
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,418
I know it's not that you don't want
to share the family vacations.

436
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,756
There's something you have
to figure out first.

437
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,176
And I understand that that

438
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,303
is between you and God.

439
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,686
Come on, Val!

440
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,524
- Wait, I'm coming.
- Come on.

441
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,323
- Valentina, don't go too far, honey.
- I'll be back.

442
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,492
Did you register for your college classes?

443
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,577
Yeah, Dad. I start in March.

444
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,705
Honey, you can put in a catheter
but not a straw.

445
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,958
Fine...

446
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,167
You do it, Mom.

447
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,127
- Did you eat them all?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,545
So what's this?

449
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,755
Eveything okay, Rami?

450
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,090
All good, Dad.

451
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,425
There's just one dude
that's going in too far.

452
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,261
But I saw him get out.

453
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,055
I'm sure one of these days
I'll have to go in and save him.

454
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,765
What, no mate for me?

455
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,767
There's no water left. Who's going?

456
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,851
- Your turn.
- No.

457
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,935
I'll go.

458
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,687
Thanks, Lu.

459
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,563
Thanks.

460
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,940
You could've gone.

461
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,067
But she wanted to.

462
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,880
Lu, just stop with this guy, please?

463
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,506
Why would he be here?

464
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,800
A guy like that goes to the Caribbean.

465
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:44,718
It was him.

466
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,386
You're obsessed.

467
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,304
Get your foot off.

468
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,806
Luciana, don't you think
it's too big a coincidence

469
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,975
that he'd happen to come to this beach?

470
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,895
That's it, I don't think
it's a coincidence.

471
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,731
I told him we have a house here.

472
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,400
Why would he come here
just to mess with you?

473
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,235
You didn't even cash the check.

474
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,406
You let him get away with it out of pity.

475
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,868
I've been saving up
for a bike for years.

476
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,951
What about you?

477
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,207
- Ramiro, that's not funny.
- I didn't say anything.

478
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,666
She doesn't think it's funny.

479
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,419
- I didn't say anything.
- She doesn't think it's funny.

480
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:23,256
Fine, I get it, but it's not
my fault if she takes it the wrong way.

481
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,883
It's the truth.

482
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,430
Look how nice
I made this part.

483
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,474
Right. Look, the water's coming.

484
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,475
Does this look okay?

485
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,853
And we'll save the castle
like this.

486
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,782
I wanna go.

487
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,283
Carry me!

488
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,368
Come on.

489
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,539
- There's too much sand!
- Close your eyes.

490
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,667
- I'm scared.
- Don't worry.

491
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,339
- Hi!
- Rami!

492
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,507
Ramiro!

493
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,093
- Come here!
- I'm going.

494
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,803
Hold on tight, Val.

495
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,683
Calm down, Valen.
Calm down, honey. It's over now.

496
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
- Do you want to play with the kids?
- Yes, Mum.

497
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,812
Go, go on.

498
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,273
Where's Ramiro?

499
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,275
He was making sure nobody's in the water.

500
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,027
Nobody should be left.
Why hasn't he come?

501
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,405
Relax, he's doing his job.

502
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,293
Call an ambulance!

503
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,383
Did someone call an ambulance?

504
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,513
Did someone call an ambulance?

505
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,997
<i>Not long ago, I told my daughter</i>

506
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,459
<i>that true faith is not what we have
when everything is good.</i>

507
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:27,130
It's what we keep
even when terrible things happen.

508
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,009
And we keep that faith

509
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,886
with the conviction

510
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,347
that, though we may not understand it,

511
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,100
God always has a plan.

512
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,650
It was an accident, honey.

513
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,945
God will help us find peace.

514
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,355
Hell of a story.

515
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,065
So?

516
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,569
So, we publish it.

517
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,987
This is a bombshell.

518
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,947
You're nuts, Rey.

519
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,949
You can't publish something like this.

520
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,244
You have to double-check the facts first,
document everything,

521
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,746
corroborate the information,
verify the deaths...

522
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,164
All right. I'll do it.

523
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,125
And Kloster, of course.

524
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,334
I'll get him.

525
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,044
Oh, you don't say.

526
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,171
If I get Kloster, you'll publish it?

527
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,510
<i>Cultura's </i>writers have been after Kloster
for six months.

528
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,680
We offered him the cover,
a special, anything he wanted.

529
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,348
Nothing, no way.

530
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:04,311
If I get you a testimony
and Kloster's version, you'll publish?

531
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,354
If you get Kloster,

532
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,524
I'll fight the board
to get you the cover, Rey.

533
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,985
That's a promise.

LIFEGUARD DROWNS

535
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:04,746
Hello?

536
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,206
<i>Esteban Rey?</i>

537
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,207
Who is this?

538
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,291
<i>It's Campari.</i>

539
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,588
It's been a while, Campari, how are you?
Thanks for calling back.

540
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,216
<i>You drove my secretary crazy.
What do you want?</i>

541
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,512
I want to interview Kloster.
For the newspaper, of course.

542
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,263
<i>Forget it.</i>

543
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,226
<i>I'm in touch with </i>Cultura
<i>for after his book is out.</i>

544
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,731
Please, tell him
it's about Luciana Blanco.

545
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,441
He'll understand.

546
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,780
Campari, are you there?

547
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,951
We'll publish the story.

548
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,246
<i>I'll ask and call you back.</i>

549
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,206
Thank you.

550
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,793
Let's fucking go.

551
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,514
<i>What is, to you,
the essence of a thriller?</i>

552
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,560
<i>Not the events, of course,
not the succession of corpses,</i>

553
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,936
<i>but the conjectures,</i>

554
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,313
the possible explanations.

555
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,150
Reading between the lines.

556
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,487
The infernal calculations and hesitations
prior to every act.

557
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,159
<i>Day of the Dead </i>is radically different.

558
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,078
<i>It's brutal, it's crude
but at the same time beautiful.</i>

559
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,331
<i>It surprised all your readers.</i>

560
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,541
<i>Why the change?</i>

561
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,959
<i>How did Kloster change?</i>

562
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,256
<i>Let's say I found a different muse.</i>

563
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,885
<i>What does that mean?</i>

564
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,220
<i>Did you know
that Henry James biographers</i>

565
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,598
<i>point to a change in style</i>

566
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,601
<i>after he began to use an amanuensis?</i>

567
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,146
<i>In Henry James's writing...</i>

568
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,775
- Hello.
<i>- Do you know what day it is?</i>

569
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,151
Tuesday?

570
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,488
<i>It's Mom and Dad's anniversary.</i>

571
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,114
<i>Shall I put them on so you can talk?</i>

572
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,574
Thanks. I owe you one.

573
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,367
- Mom.
- Hm.

574
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,451
Phone.

575
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,121
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Mom.</i>

576
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,665
<i>- Happy anniversary.</i>
- Thanks, honey.

577
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,834
<i>That makes how many years?</i>

578
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,795
Well, 31 now.

579
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,962
<i>Wow.</i>

580
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,298
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- Good.

581
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,801
We went foraging for mushrooms with Valen,

582
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,803
and now I'm cooking.

583
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,054
Honey, I miss you.

584
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,015
<i>I miss you too. Put Dad on.</i>

585
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,100
All right, I'll put him on. Bye, honey.

586
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,393
It's Lu.

587
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,314
- Hello.
<i>- Dad.</i>

588
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,024
<i>Happy anniversary!</i>

589
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,109
Thanks, honey.
It's good to hear your voice.

590
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,028
<i>How are the exams going?</i>

591
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,783
Good. I read all the Methodology material.
I still have Analysis left, next week.

592
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,243
<i>We miss you over here.</i>

593
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,577
When are you coming?

594
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,455
<i>Eh... I don't know.
We'll talk about it.</i>

595
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,582
<i>Is there anniversary pie?</i>

596
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,125
Yes, seems like there will be,

597
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,671
but your siblings said
they're both fleeing.

598
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,839
The cowards...

599
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,008
<i>- Dad.
- I gotta go, your sister is calling.</i>

600
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,469
All right. I love you. Bye.

601
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,553
<i>Bye.</i>

602
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:13,434
<i>The essence is in the internal
psychological analysis of the characters.</i>

603
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,479
<i>"Fiction competes with life,"
Henry James said.</i>

604
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,189
<i>If fiction can create life,</i>

605
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,984
<i>it can also create death.</i>

606
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:36,791
Hi?

607
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,727
Luciana, Mom and Dad are ill.

608
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,586
<i>What happened?</i>

609
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,963
I don't know,
I'm in the ambulance to the hospital.

610
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,673
- Come right now.
<i>- Where?</i>

611
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,799
Central Hospital.

612
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,801
<i>- I'm going.</i>
- Okay.

613
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,261
- Bruno, right?
- Yeah.

614
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,346
Use it like this. Press every six seconds.

615
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,765
- I'll get an IV on your dad, okay?
- Yes.

616
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,767
Okay, keep the count.

617
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,540
Where are they? How are they?

618
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,335
They're treating Mom.
Her liver is shot.

619
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,419
What happened to them?

620
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,962
- Poisoning.
- And Dad?

621
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,631
No.

622
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,325
Was it...?

623
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
Was it the pie?

624
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,079
Yeah, maybe.

625
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,872
It might've been.

626
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,415
It was him.

627
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,294
It was Kloster.

628
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,838
No, Luciana, not right now.

629
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,050
It was Kloster. He knows about
Mom and Dad's anniversary pie.

630
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,177
Kloster knows about the beach house.

631
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,640
- He's taking revenge. He never forgave me.
- Luciana, calm down, please.

632
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,559
- Now's not the time. Calm down.
- It's never enough.

633
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,605
Calm down.

634
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,065
Nurse!

635
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,948
- Calm down, breathe.
- What happened?

636
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,320
- I need a psychiatrist now.
- What can I do?

637
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,530
- What can I do?
- Breathe.

638
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,154
FOR SALE

639
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,172
What is it?

640
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,049
I wanted to see the house.

641
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,134
You'll have to call
the real estate agency.

642
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,510
I'm a friend of the owners.

643
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,594
Yeah?

644
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,097
I'm a friend of Luciana's. Luciana Blanco.

645
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,432
Oh.

646
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,517
How's Luciana doing?

647
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,519
Rocco, easy!

648
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,688
Well, she's holding on...

649
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,775
Dealing with her baggage.

650
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,735
And what baggage, right? Hm.

651
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,987
And what happened to her parents...

652
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,697
It was weird, right?

653
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,281
Hm.

654
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,076
What do you think happened?

655
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,079
It's baffling.

656
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,083
I have a hard time believing
she messed up.

657
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,710
She knew a lot about mushrooms.

658
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,379
Maybe it was the girl.

659
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,465
I don't know.

660
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,259
Sometimes things go wrong.

661
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:23,809
Yes?

662
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,770
Registered letter for Mr. Kloster.

663
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,771
He's not home.

664
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,939
Can you receive it?

665
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,481
Yes, of course.

666
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,615
FROM LUCIANA BLANCO
SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT

667
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,159
Mommy!

668
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,744
Mom.

669
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,037
Can you hear me?

670
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,417
Mommy!

671
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,130
- What?
- Can I go take a bath?

672
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,341
- Go on, I'll be right there.
- Yeah!

673
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
Mommy.

674
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,650
Mommy!

675
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,236
I want to play dolls with Luciana.

676
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,529
She can't, Pauli.

677
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,488
Why?

678
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,990
She stopped working here.

679
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,783
No! She didn't stop.

680
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,869
I said she can't, Pauli.

681
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,163
- Will you let me wash your hair?
- No.

682
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,664
I want to see Luciana!

683
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,082
I said no.

684
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,084
- But why not?
- Because you can't.

685
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,296
Mom, I want to see Luciana!

686
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,899
I said no!

687
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,861
CONTEMPORARY BALLET
BUENOS AIRES NATIONAL THEATER

688
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,197
Hello!

689
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,376
Mercedes.

690
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,462
Mercedes.

691
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,173
Darling.

692
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,428
Mercedes...

693
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,195
Pauli.

694
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,493
Pauli.

695
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,577
Honey...

696
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:12,746
No.

697
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,414
Pauli.

698
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,419
No!

699
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,671
Honey.

700
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,755
What did you...?

701
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,162
I'm on duty tonight.

702
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,914
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- All right.

703
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,209
Hm, this is delicious, Lu.

704
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,543
- You like it?
- Hm.

705
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,798
- So? How's high school?
- Good.

706
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,966
- Did you make friends?
- No.

707
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,551
They think I'm dumb.

708
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,679
Luciana takes me,
waits for me after school...

709
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,184
I'm the only one who doesn't eat out.
How can I make any friends?

710
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,853
Valen, Lu worries about you.
She's protecting you.

711
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,105
From what?

712
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,815
I can't even go to ballet alone.

713
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,691
All my friends go on their own.

714
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,486
So how's practice going?

715
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,197
The recital should be soon.
What will it be?

716
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,199
<i>Swan Lake.</i>

717
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,282
That's great.

718
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,535
Let me know in advance

719
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,912
so it doesn't overlap
with one of my shifts.

720
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,455
Can I buy tickets already?

721
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,373
You don't have to.

722
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,541
This year,

723
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,876
dads and brothers are invited.

724
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,588
So you think you're romantic?

725
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,882
Huh?

726
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,220
Here you go, lover boy.

727
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,698
Have your letter back.

728
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,309
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

729
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,186
Yesi is mine, get it?

730
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,814
Yesi is mine, man!

731
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,694
Freeze! Stay there.

732
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,696
Police. Hey!

733
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,781
CENTRAL HOSPITAL

734
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,200
Get on the ground!

735
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,285
Move. Let me.

736
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,496
Don't move.

737
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,706
What a mess.

738
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,500
- All right, go.
- I'll take care of it.

739
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,967
- Help Benítez.
- Sure.

740
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,304
Did you call the judge?

741
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,264
No response. He must be asleep.

742
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,349
Jeez...

743
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,976
The family's over there.

744
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,065
All right, keep trying, wake him up.

745
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,148
Yeah.

746
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,824
- Could we have a moment, please?
- Yes.

747
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,163
I'm Prosecutor Ramoneda.
I'm in charge of the case.

748
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,498
Did you catch him?

749
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,581
Yeah.

750
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,834
Seems to be a crime of passion.

751
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:52,049
The suspect claims your brother
was having an affair with his wife.

752
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,387
My brother wasn't seeing anyone.

753
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,723
There are some letters
detailing the affair...

754
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,644
No. If my brother was going out
with someone, I'd know.

755
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,728
Who are they from?

756
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,938
They seem anonymous.

757
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,231
We'll look into it.

758
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,985
What we don't understand
is how he broke out of jail.

759
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,319
He was a prisoner?

760
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,403
Yes.

761
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,283
Serving a 25-year sentence for homicide.

762
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,494
Kloster.

763
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,372
What?

764
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,665
It was Kloster.

765
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,127
It was him. He wrote to prisoners.
He's been killing my family for years.

766
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,546
First it was my brother Ramiro,
then my Dad...

767
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,839
It was Kloster.

768
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,632
Kloster, the writer?

769
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,010
Yes, the writer. I was his assistant.

770
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,678
Promise me you'll look into him.

771
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,223
Yes. We're not ruling out anything.
Don't worry.

772
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,560
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Sorry.

773
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,353
Do you need anything?

774
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,440
Miss.

775
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,327
Let's go.

776
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,579
Let's go.

777
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,957
Stop.

778
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,683
- What's up, Esteban?
- What's up?

779
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,353
Your boss still breathing down your neck?

780
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:29,396
No, I got it under control.

781
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,398
No news about the fires.

782
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,983
I'll call as soon as I get anything.

783
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,693
No, I didn't come for that.

784
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,279
- What?
- Do you remember the Bruno Blanco case?

785
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,157
Bruno... Yeah, what a mess of a case.

786
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,826
It seemed simple and ended up complicated.

787
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,913
Yeah, because of the sister
accusing Kloster, the writer.

788
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,873
No. The sister? It wasn't that.

789
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,460
The murderer was in jail. He went out
to steal with help from the guards.

790
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,587
The entire Penitentiary Service board
came down.

791
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,589
- It was a mess.
- Counselor.

792
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,384
- Yeah? Thanks.
- You're welcome.

793
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,345
- Great.
- And what about Kloster?

794
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,307
Kloster? I went to see him.
Poor guy, really.

795
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,268
Lost his wife, lost his daughter,

796
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,438
and that crazy woman Luciana
wouldn't stop harassing him.

797
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,357
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

798
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,485
She came by constantly,
made all kinds of scenes.

799
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,697
She wanted me to arrest him
no matter what. Unbearable.

800
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,740
The case even turned political.

801
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,034
Me, dealing with the Minister of Justice,

802
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,329
and this woman who insisted
I arrest Kloster.

803
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,249
But wait, listen.

804
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,544
Then there was nothing
that linked Kloster to the murderer?

805
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,921
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

806
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:37,756
Nothing...

807
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,134
Actually, that crazy woman, Luciana.

808
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,677
I gotta go, Esteban.

809
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,732
LUCIANA

810
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,249
Do you have any news?

811
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,585
Sort of.

812
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,838
They say the Chinese mafia
might be behind the fires.

813
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,716
That they want to lower
the property prices to buy them.

814
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,010
But it's just a rumor for now.

815
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,219
Hm.

816
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,929
Ramoneda's also got nothing.

817
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,139
It's a mystery.

818
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,640
Rey!

819
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,350
Here.

820
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,147
I don't know how you did it.

821
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,109
Campari says Kloster is waiting for you
tonight at his home.

822
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,068
Let's go!

823
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,155
What did I say? Didn't I say I'd get him?

824
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,866
Good luck. Don't mess it up!

825
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,326
I have my charm!

826
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,869
Never doubted you.

827
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,686
<i>Who is it?</i>

828
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,771
Esteban Rey.

829
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,647
<i>Who?</i>

830
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,316
Esteban Rey.

831
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,184
So?

832
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,687
What do you think?

833
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,189
What do I think?

834
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,651
It would be a marvelous case report.

835
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:07,030
Who could've thought a woman so smart
could reach such heights of madness?

836
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,201
In any case, I'm not surprised.
She was always manipulative.

837
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,663
Why do you say that?

838
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,293
Shielded behind her innocence,
she enjoyed seducing.

839
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,548
Anyone would've paid with a divorce

840
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,633
the price of playing her game.

841
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,387
In my case, the price was higher.

842
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,974
So, you think she was responsible
for your tragedy?

843
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,582
That's what she believes.

844
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,544
Entirely too late,
a useless attempt to apologize

845
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,546
for her absurd accusations.

846
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,307
Do you really think she could predict
what would happen?

847
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,725
I can't be sure of that.

848
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,981
For years, I tried to imagine why
she'd make up these stories against me.

849
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,399
And why do you think that is?

850
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,318
One of three reasons,

851
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,818
madness...

852
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:30,488
cruelty...

853
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,449
or guilt.

854
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,532
Guilt?

855
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,368
Are you surprised?

856
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,997
The daughter of a pastor
attempts a seduction,

857
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,374
it goes wrong

858
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,209
and tears apart a family.

859
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,711
For someone as religious as her,

860
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,381
it sounds like it deserves
divine punishment.

861
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,590
Don't you think?

862
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,302
How do you explain the murders?

863
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,803
Murders?

864
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,850
I know only of one,
and the culprit's been caught.

865
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,852
What makes you think there were more?

866
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:05,065
Luciana says she saw you on the beach
when her brother Ramiro died.

867
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,609
Was it a coincidence you were there?

868
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,029
No, on the contrary,
there was a reason for that.

869
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,950
I knew Luciana
would spend the summer there.

870
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,828
I'd just lost my family

871
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,372
and it didn't seem fair
she would enjoy the summer

872
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,915
after what she did.

873
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,834
I wanted to remind her.

874
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,547
Ramiro died from a cramp
while trying to save a mysterious swimmer

875
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,173
that never turned up.

876
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,011
And Luciana wants to believe
that mysterious swimmer was me.

877
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,098
A precise, surprise hit on a person
in the middle of the sea,

878
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,182
no witnesses.

879
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,767
You flatter me.

880
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,854
A man my age,

881
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:44,855
in my condition,

882
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,400
against a trained lifeguard
in his twenties?

883
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:52,195
If I wrote that in my novels,
they'd laugh in my face.

884
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,908
So Ramiro dying the summer
you showed up on that beach

885
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,243
is a coincidence.

886
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,995
Or divine justice.

887
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,622
After all, he drowned,

888
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,499
just like my daughter.

889
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,423
Divine justice.

890
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,342
I thought you were agnostic.

891
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,470
Did you convert?

892
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,141
There are things beyond religion
that I had to learn to believe in.

893
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,731
What about her parents' poisoning?

894
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,068
You knew about the anniversary
mushroom pie.

895
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,236
You even used it in a novel.

896
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,488
Yes. At that point,

897
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,532
that novel had been read
by over 500,000 people.

898
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,370
So the similarities with your novel
are also a coincidence.

899
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,839
Bruno's murder...

900
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,634
has a perpetrator.

901
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,054
Luciana thinks you instigated it.

902
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,682
She says you wrote to the killer

903
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,602
so he would believe Bruno
was having an affair with his wife.

904
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:09,606
Luciana managed to have a prosecutor
investigate that hypothesis.

905
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,775
Do you know what he found?

906
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,901
Yes. Nothing.

907
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,445
But you wrote to prisoners.

908
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,116
I often write to my fans,

909
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,327
and I assure you they come
from many walks of life.

910
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,331
Another coincidence.

911
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,208
Hm.

912
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,765
Anyway, there's something
that does work against you.

913
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,938
The numbers.

914
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,567
While, taken separately,
the accusation is feeble,

915
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,652
if we look at all the deaths together...

916
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,488
it seems a little suspicious, right?

917
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,868
Because a tragic death in a family
can be bad luck,

918
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,453
but since she sent that registered letter,

919
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,164
her two brothers died,

920
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,291
and her father,
and her mother is bedridden.

921
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,334
And you...

922
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,504
even if it's indirectly,

923
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,007
have something to do
with all of those deaths.

924
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,177
I'm sorry, but those
are too many coincidences.

925
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,265
"The whole is more
than the sum of its parts."

926
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,060
You like numbers.

927
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,479
You sent me something.

928
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,024
You sent me a novel. What was it called?

929
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,694
<i>Randomness.</i>

930
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,321
<i>Randomness, </i>exactly,

931
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:43,116
where you write almost exclusively
about the topic of chance.

932
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,871
But you never bothered to toss a coin.

933
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:49,872
What do you mean?

934
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,544
You know very well
that if you toss a coin a hundred times,

935
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:59,591
the result tends to be an even split
between heads and tails.

936
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,176
Is that right?

937
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,596
That doesn't mean that every time
you toss a coin

938
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,433
it will alternate between
heads, tails, heads, tails...

939
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:13,396
In fact, most events happen
in imperfect streaks.

940
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,234
So all these deaths
were just a streak of bad luck.

941
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,194
I don't see why not.

942
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,948
After all, Luciana lost
three family members

943
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,491
over the course of ten years.

944
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,203
I lost two on the same day.

945
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,166
Which was very painful.

946
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,256
And the media coverage
did nothing but prolong that pain.

947
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,471
Do you want to completely understand

948
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,265
the damage Luciana caused?

949
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,226
Come with me.

950
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,026
When I met Mercedes,

951
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,947
she was a ballet dancer
with a bright future,

952
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,450
until a traffic accident ended her career.

953
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,289
It was awful, and it took a lot
for her to come out her depression.

954
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,000
Then she became pregnant with Pauli,

955
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,420
and she thought everything would change.

956
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,757
That she'd found something more important
than her own life to live for.

957
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,760
I thought so too.

958
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:26,844
But no.

959
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,180
After the birth,

960
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,975
she fell into a pit of depression again.

961
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,602
I had to institutionalize her.

962
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,232
And I took care of Pauli
until she was five years old.

963
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,737
When Luciana started working with me,

964
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,032
Mercedes had already recovered.

965
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,618
But her psychiatrist warned me...

966
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:57,042
that her psyche would always be
in a fragile balancing act.

967
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,422
"Cracked crystal" were his words.

968
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,300
As long as no one moved it,

969
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,968
it would stay in place.

970
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,182
But the subtlest movement

971
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,935
could send the whole thing crashing down.

972
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:24,818
<i>Dad!</i>

973
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,654
<i>Look how high I can jump!</i>

974
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,907
<i>I can touch the sky. Yeah!</i>

975
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,827
<i>I always have energy, I never run out.</i>

976
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,414
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

977
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,875
<i>Dad!</i>

978
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,961
<i>Look how high I can jump!</i>

979
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,214
<i>I can touch the sky. Yeah!</i>

980
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,592
<i>I always have energy, I never run out.</i>

981
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,261
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

982
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,183
- Luciana broke that crystal.
<i>- Dad.</i>

983
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,518
<i>Look how high I can jump!</i>

984
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,144
<i>I can touch the sky. Yeah!</i>

985
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:04,317
And she condemned Pauli
to this ten second prison forever.

986

<i>Dad!</i>

987
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,448

01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,617
<i>I can touch the sky. Yeah!</i>

989
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,581
I would've put this business with Luciana
behind me years ago.

990
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,336
But she insists on reminding me
over and over.

991
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:28,258
Did you know her brother
had to commit her to an asylum

992
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,801
due to her obsession with me?

993
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,686
And now Luciana sends you,

994
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:43,440
who attempted to get
my attention for years.

995
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,818
Sending your manuscripts,

996
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,405
harassing my publisher,

997
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:55,285
hiring a girl with no other merit
than just being my assistant.

998
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,414
I understand now, Rey.

999
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,585
Your admiration became envy.

1000
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,379
And that envy, resentment.

1001
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,176
Because you had to be full of resentment
to write what you wrote.

1002
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,019
Now if you'll excuse me...

1003
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,231
I have another important interview.

1004
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,111
For a school assignment.

1005
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,762
Very good.

1006
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,309
- What's up?
- Hi.

1007
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,228
You're coming tonight, right?

1008
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,395
I'm almost sure.

1009
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:07,648
Look who's here.

1010
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,279
Just make something up.

1011
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,492
I'm going. See you.

1012
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,452
- All right.
- Bye, girls.

1013
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,454
- Bye, Dani.
- Bye, Valen.

1014
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,666
- Hello.
- Hello.

1015
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,876
We're gonna go see Mom, remember?

1016
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,960
Yeah.

1017
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,838
Camila invited me over
to do a Literature assignment.

1018
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,800
- All right. I'll take you.
- Okay.

1019
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,636
Well done, Lali, good.

1020
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,890
NURSING HOME

1021
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:49,649
Here, Mom.

1022
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,778
Remember that Valentina
finishes high school this year?

1023
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,154
Did you ask her?

1024
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:59,659
Lu wants me to go to college,
but I want to be a dancer.

1025
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,995
It's a very competitive setting.

1026
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,038
Yeah, but I want to dance.

1027
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,165
You have to have options, Valentina.

1028
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,836
...the heart.

1029
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,087
Right.

1030
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,464
That's right, Mommy.

1031
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,300
Listen to my heart.

1032
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,389
Well, visiting hours are almost over.
She has to go have dinner now.

Bye, Mommy.

1035
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:32,984
Give me your hand.

1036
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:40,992
Oh, God.

1037
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,870
Will you walk me to Camila's?

1038
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,080
Or I can go alone. It's fine.

1039

Luciana.

Lu!

1041

I can go, it's fine.

1042
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,965
I'll go alone. Luciana.

1043

Lu.

1044
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,469

<i>Yeah, like ten years ago. How are you?</i>

1051
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,790
Twelve years.

1052
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,794
I need to see you.
Urgently. It's about Kloster.

Stop bringing stories no one cares about.

1057
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,313
It's not even good
for a neighborhood piece.

1058
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,401
- How did it go with Kloster?
- Good.

1059
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,069
When are you turning it in?

1060
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,781
Give me a couple of days
so I can format it better.

1061
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,324
You're quick, Rey.

1062
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,451
I talked to the board. They expect a lot.

1063

Bring me a draft tomorrow so...

1064

And it looks like they got him.

1066
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,124
Who?

1067
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,333
The Chinese arsonist.

1068
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,252
I'm on my way.

1069
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,964
Don't lose focus on the Kloster piece.

1070
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,137
Can I go through?
My grandmother's inside.

1071
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,139
Excuse me, press.

1072
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,724
- Go in.
- Thanks.

1073
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:28,910
What happened?

1074
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:32,121
It started downstairs.
Nursing home on the top floor.

1075
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,832
The old folks asphyxiated.

1076
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,752
They retrieved about 20.
There's still a lot more inside.

1077
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,922
It didn't have anything to do
with the Chinese mafia.

1078
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,509
Just a psycho on a bike
with a jerrycan full of gasoline.

1079
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,849
- Can I ask some questions? Just one.
- Not now.

1080
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:54,685
Did you start the other fires?

1081

Kloster was here?

No. You made me look like a fool

1141
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,126
<i>of his novels.</i>

1142
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,129

1143
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,588
<i>most gripping work.</i>

1144
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:04,842
<i>The launch is happening simultaneously

1145
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,593
<i>German, and English editions.</i>

1146
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,388
Odile & Odette<i> is on its way

1147
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,599
<i>We'll have the pleasure

1148
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,226
<i>narrate the first chapter.</i>

1149
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,281
I'm sorry.

1150
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,659
I tried to publish it,
but it didn't work, I couldn't.

1151
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,744
It doesn't matter.

1152
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,704
I need you to do me a favor.

1153
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,041
I can't do anything else, Luciana.

1154
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,918
I'm done. They crucified me
at the newspaper.

1155
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,506
I need to talk to Kloster. Today.
You know how to get to him.

1156
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,180
I can tell you exactly where he is.

1157
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,559
But I think he has a busy day today.

1158
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,031
I have to stop him, Esteban.

1159
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,284
Valentina is the next victim.

1160
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,421
I have a press pass.

1161
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,782
Excuse me, please.

1162
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,575
Excuse me, I have a pass. Yeah.

1163
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,619
No, I have a pass.

1164
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,287
- Press?
- Yeah.

1165
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:58,372
- Go in.
- Thanks.

1166
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,751
It's a private event.
Tickets and ID only.

1167
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:06,797
"...the code of Hammurabi...

1168
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,884
laws that, almost 4,000 years ago,

1169
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,805
the god Marduk handed the king of Babylon

1170
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:19,059
and that, since then,
dictate the life of men,

1171
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,603
are not enough."

1172
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,711
Eye for an eye,

1173
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,254
tooth for a tooth,

1174
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,840
life for a life.

1175
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,050
<i>Lex talionis</i>

1176
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,304
speaks about the human aspect

1177
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,932
of justice that seeks
the balancing of harm.

1178
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,685
In<i> Odile & Odette,</i>

1179
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,897
revenge is not in human terms,

1180
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,648
but in divine.

1181
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,321
In Genesis,
God warns us that whoever kills Cain

1182
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,741
will receive a sevenfold punishment.

1183
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:22,581
But the Bible does not refer
to a literal quantity.

1184
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,085
Or a scale
that might seem exaggerated. No.

1185
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:31,632
The biblical texts
refer to the wrath of God

1186
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,759
as the manifestation

1187
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,303
of divine justice.

1188
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,226
In this new novel,

1189
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,311
revenge...

1190
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,314
justice,

1191
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:48,398
is complete.

1192
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,444
And perfect.

1193
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,034
I need to talk to him.

1194
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,538
I'll get him up. Stay here.

1195
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:29,189
<i>Odile & Odette,</i>
the big new novel by Kloster.

1196
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:30,315
Thank you very much.

1197
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:31,525
Kloster.

1198
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:33,860
Excuse me.

1199
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,321
- Back, please.
- Kloster!

1200
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,407
- He'll sign soon.
- Kloster!

1201
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:40,450
Kloster!

1202
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,536
- God bless you.
- Kloster.

1203
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:46,206
Luciana is waiting on you
on the third floor mezzanine.

1204
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,416
It's about Valentina.

1205
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,960
If you don't want a scene, you better go.

1206
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,798
Kloster, over here, please.

1207
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,633
A picture.

1208
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,179
Just a step back, please.

1209
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,265
Thank you, you're very kind.

1210
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,102
We'll have a short break.

1211
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,729
Kloster! Could I get an autograph?

1212
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,230
A picture, please!

1213
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,482
Kloster,
from<i> El Metropolitano.</i>

1214
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:13,817
Just a picture.

1215
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,360
Hey! Hands off!

1216
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:54,857
I'm here.

1217
01:25:57,444 --> 01:25:59,196
You've had your perfect revenge.

1218
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:02,783
What more do you want?

1219
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,038
I have no more suffering to give.

1220
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,752
I already felt for myself
the suffering I caused you.

1221
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,881
Only I get to make that call.

1222
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:22,511
How much longer will you punish me?

1223
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,558
What do I have to do to end all this?

1224
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,979
That's in your hands,

1225
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,148
not in mine.

1226
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,734
It always was.

1227
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:42,072
The only one who can end this...

1228
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,367
is you.

1229
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:00,966
Esteban! How are you?

1230
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,049
How are you doing?

1231
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:04,052
What about you? I thought you got fired.

1232
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,680
No. I mean, yeah.
I'm here for another reason.

1233
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,099
And Valentina?

1234
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,021
How do I know
you won't do anything to her?

1235
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,025
I swear on the memory of my daughter

1236
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:21,445
that nothing bad will happen to Valentina.

1237
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,448
Kloster!

1238
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,743
Why are you here?

1239
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,619
No!

1240
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,502
Excuse me.

1241
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,586
Let me through, man.

1242
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,173
Excuse me.

1243
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,885
Dude, what happened?

1244
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:46,470
She's with me.

1245
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,125
I'm very sorry.

1246
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:43,961
Thank you.

1247
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:47,299
Could you wait outside?
I'll be right there.

1248
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:10,155
I still don't know
if this was a wicked, perfect plan

1249
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,238
like in your novels,

1250
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,158
or if it was just a streak of bad luck.

1251
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,205
A bit of both.

1252
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,293
She could be your daughter.

1253
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,502
She could.

1254
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,257
Pauli would be her age today.

1255
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,222
She's a minor.

1256
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:40,852
She'll be 18 next week.

1257
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:45,607
And she doesn't seem to mind
the age difference.

1258
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:51,571
We have something in common
that's stronger than prejudice.

1259
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:55,408
We both lost our families.

1260
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,295
You're a murderer,

1261
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,631
a monster.

1262
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,011
A murderer?

1263
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:16,596
A monster?

1264
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,265
You sound just like Luciana.

1265
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,227
I'd be careful if I was you.

1266
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,480
You could end up like her.

1267
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:57,186
