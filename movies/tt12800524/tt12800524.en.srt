00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,250
Okay, you're good.

4
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,750
...last night.

5
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,041
Here's more of that terrifying
video from our news crew.

6
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,333
Rioters
are storming parts of the city,

7
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,583
looting stores
and setting buildings on fire.

8
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,708
The National Guard fire into the crowd.

9
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,125
I mean, this violence is endemic.

10
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,250
It's like a disease that's
infecting a growing area...

11
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,958
Jay.

12
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,375
You can't stay inside all day.

13
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
It stinks out there.

14
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,833
Dylan's taking Bobby out on the tractor.

15
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,250
Dylan stinks.

16
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,458
I'm getting eaten alive today.

17
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,250
Wow.

18
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,166
These are amazing.

19
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,833
You want me to send this one to your dad?

20
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,250
Okay.

21
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,125
But you got to do
one thing for me.

22
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,583
Look. I'm not driving.

23
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,291
Oh, well, now, somebody's got to drive.

24
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,958
- Somebody's got to drive.
- I'll drive it.

25
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,583
- Careful.
- All right, where are we going now, Dylan?

26
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,375
This is Mission Control to Jay.

27
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,166
Sorry I haven't written to you
for a while.

28
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,291
I've been away from
civilization for a few weeks.

29
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,083
How's Bobby?
He still farting in his sleep?

30
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,041
Hope you two are getting along.

31
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Miss you both so much.

32
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't believe it's been
two years since I saw you last.

33
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,166
I want to come see you,
but I need to keep fighting.

34
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,458
I'm heading out on another secret mission,

35
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:46,083
but I promise, when it's over,
I'll come and visit.

36
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,291
I know it's hard not seeing
each other, but remember,

37
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,666
everything I do is to protect you.

38
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,791
Did you know that Bobby practically

39
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,541
drove the tractor all by himself today?

40
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,500
I was just staying on his lap,

41
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,583
and I was doing all the steering.

42
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,208
Oh, okay. And could you reach

43
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,250
the steering wheel from where you were?

44
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,666
Yeah.

45
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,833
- No joke.
- No joke?

46
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,000
I asked him if he had a
license, and he said he did.

47
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
Right?

48
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,875
I-I said I did not.

49
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,291
Oh, I didn't hear the "not" part.

50
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,083
Is Mom gonna be okay?

51
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,833
It's just a bug. Don't worry about it.

52
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,166
Wow, Jay.

53
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,166
That is an awesome picture.

54
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,166
We should try to frame that.

55
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,625
Frame it now.

56
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,958
Go to bed.

57
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,583
Now.

58
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,791
So, Dylan, want me to help you

59
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,333
get it back all together
so we can frame it?

60
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,291
Hey.

61
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,500
Wakey, wakey, Jay.

62
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
Dad?

63
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,333
You're back.

64
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
Come here. Come here.

65
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,416
I'm sorry it took so long.

66
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,333
I missed you so much.

67
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,208
I missed you, too.

68
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,541
I got to check something.

69
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,875
Keep your eyes open.

70
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,958
It's all good. Just relax.

71
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
Okay, you're good.

72
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,041
Hey. Jay.

73
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,916
I'm taking you on a road trip.
How's that sound?

74
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,291
- Now? Let's do it.
- Huh?

75
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,916
- You good to go?
- Yeah.

76
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,291
- Ready for action?
- Uh-huh.

77
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,333
- Bobby!
- Calm down. Calm down.

78
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,375
- Wake up, dumbass. Dad's back.
- Calm down.

79
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,625
Go get ready.

80
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,333
Little man.

81
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,000
Come give me a hug, little man.

82
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,375
- Daddy's back.
- Dad?

83
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,833
Yeah, it's me.

84
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,500
- Remember me?
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,958
You look different.

86
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,500
Yeah, I look a little different.

87
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,875
- Hey, you look different, too.
- Hmm.

88
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,666
Come on, come here, give me a hug.

89
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,291
Give me a hug. Huh?

90
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,083
Come on, give me a hug, give me a hug.

91
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,208
Give me a real hug. Come on.

92
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,625
Yeah, that's right.

93
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,166
Look over there. Okay.

94
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,208
Keep looking up. Don't blink.

95
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,291
Don't...
I said don't blink. Hey.

96
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,166
Hey, quit cheating.

97
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay. Who wants to play a game?

98
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,041
- I like playing games.
- Okay, the game is called

99
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,875
"get in the car as fast
as humanly possible."

100
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,250
You gonna let him beat you?

101
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,541
Okay, let's go. Let's get going.

102
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,083
You with me?

103
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,458
- Yeah.
- Then let's play.

104
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,041
- Okay, who's gonna win?
- Come on, slowpoke.

105
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,833
Three, two... Car's out this way.

106
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,416
One. One second, liftoff.

107
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,708
Let's go.

108
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,583
All good? Good job.

109
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,375
- Okay, so who won?
- I won.

110
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,000
- I got in the car first.
- But I leapt in first.

111
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,875
- Yeah?
- No, that's not fair.

112
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,541
- Shut up, fart breath.
- Oh, yeah? You shut up then.

113
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
Yo, seat belts on.

114
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,458
Listen, Dad, I got to the car first.

115
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,500
Dad?

116
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,416
Can you tell us a war story?

117
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,541
Like, all the battles you've been in?

118
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,416
And have you ever jumped out
of a helicopter?

119
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,250
You want to be a Marine, huh?

120
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,625
- Maybe.
- Okay.

121
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,541
Why didn't Mom tell us we were
going on this road trip?

122
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,125
Because she wanted it
to be a big surprise.

123
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,458
Where are we going?

124
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,541
Mm, it... it's a surprise.

125
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,958
Disneyland?

126
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,458
No, we're not going to Disneyland.

127
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,375
- Why?
- 'Cause it's, uh...

128
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,333
Dude, it's dangerous there.
You didn't hear what happened?

129
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,083
- No.
- Dude.

130
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,875
I mean, a-a ride broke down.
A bunch of kids died.

131
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,125
Jay, you hear about that?

132
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,250
Why aren't Mom and Dylan going?

133
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,458
Dude, they're going
on their own vacation.

134
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,083
They're going skiing.

135
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,416
In Canada.

136
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,833
I want to go skiing.

137
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,583
Oh, really? You want to go
freeze your ass off

138
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,833
on top of a mountain? Huh?

139
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,583
With Mr. Stick Up His Butt?

140
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,958
Hmm?

141
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,000
Or you want to go on
a road trip with your old man?

142
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,333
Number two, please.

143
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,958
Okay. Well, then here it goes.

144
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,791
Okay, we're going on
a Special Operations road trip.

145
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,000
Is y'all with me?

146
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,166
- Yeah.
- Well, check it out.

147
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,708
There's no bedtimes.

148
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,583
You can go to sleep whenever you want.

149
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,291
You get to eat candy whenever you want.

150
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
If you follow the rules,

151
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,666
I'll let you fire my gun.

152
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,958
- Sound like fun?
- Yeah.

153
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay. Rule number one: I don't want y'all

154
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,708
talking to anybody out here.

155
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,833
Lot of weirdos on the open road.

156
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,541
Okay? Okay, rule number two:

157
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,750
I want y'all to stay covered in this.

158
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,250
- Mine. Mine!
- It's mine.

159
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,125
J-Jay, use some, and then
give it to your brother, okay?

160
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,666
Yeah. What is it?

161
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,333
It's, uh, bug spray, okay?

162
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,750
Yeah, you dumbass. What'd you think?

163
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:41,041
Y'all get down. Get down now.

164
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,166
Okay, good job, everybody. Get up.

165
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,833
How about a team fist bump?

166
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,125
- Yeah.
- Come on.

167
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,291
- Boom.
- Yeah? Okay.

168
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,958
Okay. I'm gonna get
some supplies, fill up.

169
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,166
I'll be right back.

170
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,750
Can we come with you?

171
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,375
Yeah, please, please, please.

172
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,250
Please.

173
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,000
Well...

174
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,833
well, you could come with me, or...

175
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,416
you could stay here
and open your presents.

176
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,166
- Presents! We got presents!
- No way.

177
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,916
We got presents!

178
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,375
All right, all right. I love presents.

179
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,375
Okay, lock the doors.

180
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,833
Thanks, Dad.

181
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,125
Jay, what did you get?

182
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,750
- Pens. Cool.
- I got an action figure.

183
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,833
Better than your stupid pens, Jay.

184
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,458
My sketchbook.

185
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,250
"Hello. My name is Muscleman."

186
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm Bobby. "Hi, Bobby.

187
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, cool. Bobby is a cool name."

188
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,541
This is Mission Control to Jay.

189
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,583
Uh, we need a copilot up here.

190
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,791
Uh, okay.

191
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,333
Little man's out cold.

192
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,416
Yeah.

193
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,166
Hey, you kept all my letters, huh?

194
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,541
Yeah.

195
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,833
I kept all your drawings, too.

196
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,875
And some days, I thought
I'd never make it back,

197
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,458
that's what kept me going.

198
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,000
Dad?

199
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,375
Why do you have pictures of monsters?

200
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,416
You going through my stuff?

201
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,416
Huh? You're not supposed to do that.

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,041
Yeah, well, that wasn't a rule.

203
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Well, it's a rule now, okay?

204
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,958
Rule number three:
Don't go through my stuff.

205
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,250
Hey.

206
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,333
They're not monsters. They're parasites.

207
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,000
It's just a tiny organism that
lives inside another creature.

208
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,791
Inside humans?

209
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,625
Hey, don't worry about it.
Why don't you get some sleep?

210
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,000
We can talk in the morning, okay?

211
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,041
I just got to go pee.

212
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,625
Yeah, no peeing on this road trip.

213
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,250
I already told you.
That's-that's the next rule.

214
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,708
But that wasn't a rule, though.

215
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,750
No, that's it... you got to pee
your pants. That's all.

216
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,875
Come on, Dad. I need to go.

217
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,166
I can't hold it.

218
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,583
Okay, you covered in that spray?

219
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,791
Mm-hmm.

220
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,375
Just here. That's far enough.

221
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,250
So you got hair around your pecker yet?

222
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,875
Dad, shut up.

223
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,458
Dad.

224
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,083
Jay, get in the car.

225
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,041
It's okay.

226
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
All right.

227
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
Are we there yet?

228
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,250
Shut up.

229
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,833
Evening, Officer.

230
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,125
All right, that's enough right there.

231
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,500
Okay.

232
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,333
What's going on here?

233
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,375
On a road trip with my boys.

234
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,583
Little man needed to stop
for a toilet break.

235
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,958
Huh.

236
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,708
Didn't think to put your hazards on?

237
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,708
There was nobody on the road.

238
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,833
I was on the road.

239
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,958
You're right.

240
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,166
Yeah, my bad. I apologize.

241
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,083
So a little road trip, huh?

242
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
Uh-huh.

243
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,541
At 3:00 a.m.?

244
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
Yeah, you know, the early bird.

245
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,333
Sir, I want you to put your
hands on the back of that car.

246
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,708
Shit,
there ain't no need for that.

247
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,083
I got an "easy way or
a hard way" speech prepared,

248
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,666
if you really want to hear it.

249
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,208
Whoa.

250
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,333
Sir, do you have a permit
for this firearm?

251
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,958
Not on me.

252
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,625
That against the law?

253
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,125
It's a class A misdemeanor if it's loaded.

254
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,208
Sir, do you have any other
weapons in the vehicle?

255
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,666
No, sir.

256
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,125
Officer, I'm a Marine, special forces.

257
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,500
I just came back off deployment.

258
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,250
Just trying to see my kids, you know?

259
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,833
Going up camping in Tahoe.

260
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,458
I only got 'em for the weekend,

261
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,916
so that's why I'm driving at night.

262
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,250
Just trying to make up for time.

263
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,916
Turn around.

264
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,833
Real slow.

265
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,083
Let me get my I.D.
You can write me a ticket.

266
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,708
- I'll be on my way.
- Stop right now.

267
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,291
Put your hands behind your head
and get down on your knees.

268
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,500
Get your hands on your head
and get down on your knees now!

269
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,125
I don't want no trouble.

270
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,583
Stay down!

271
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,875
No, please, stop!

272
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,750
- You okay?
- Yeah.

273
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,666
Sorry you had to see that, boys.

274
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,916
- I want to go home.
- I know, kid.

275
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,041
- I know.
- I want to go right now!

276
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,708
We can't go home, Bobby.

277
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,833
Why can't we go home?

278
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,958
Just breathe with me for a second, okay?

279
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,333
Can you help me out? Jay, you, too.

280
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,250
In and out.

281
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,583
We can't go home.

282
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,541
This ain't a road trip.
This is a rescue mission.

283
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,041
What do you mean?

284
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,250
Something's come to our planet.

285
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,833
Aliens?

286
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,916
Non-terrestrial microorganisms.

287
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,958
I haven't seen any aliens.

288
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,125
You have. You just don't know it.

289
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,208
They live inside of us.

290
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,333
They use us as hosts.

291
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,208
And that happens through insects.

292
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,625
That's why we use the bug spray.

293
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,125
We got to go back and save Mom.

294
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,583
What's wrong with Mom?

295
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,208
She's got one inside her.

296
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,125
She's alive. She's just not in control.

297
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,083
Hey, but I'm gonna save her.

298
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,750
Boys... first, I've got to get you safe.

299
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,750
That's why right now
I'm taking you to a base

300
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,166
that's still operational.

301
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,875
It's one of the only ones.

302
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,166
It's full of scientists...
they're working on a cure.

303
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,375
Hey.

304
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,041
Hey, take my hand.

305
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,416
Come on, Jay.

306
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:50,291
Y'all ever heard of the Three Musketeers?

307
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,291
No, never.

308
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:57,458
They were the three toughest
soldiers there ever was.

309
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,083
And they could survive anything
'cause they stuck together.

310
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,708
Now, you're telling me,

311
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,166
if we don't stand by each other,

312
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,250
we can't get through anything?

313
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,750
Yes.

314
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,458
I know we can.

315
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,625
Hey.

316
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,166
How'd you sleep?

317
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,083
I had a nightmare.

318
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, come on up.

319
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,541
You okay?

320
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,916
Yeah. What you reading?

321
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,916
I'm trying to become
a neuroparasitology expert.

322
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,208
What's this one?

323
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,708
Oh, this one's a nasty little dude.

324
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,416
It burrows its way
inside a fish's eyeball,

325
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,666
manipulates its behavior
so it gets eaten by a bird.

326
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,041
And then it reproduces
inside the bird's guts.

327
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,916
Crazy, huh?

328
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,416
Are aliens reproducing inside Mom's guts?

329
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,833
No.

330
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,833
Your mom's got guts to spare.

331
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,333
Okay? Believe me.

332
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,416
Hey, let me show you something else.

333
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,125
This is where we're headed.
It's in Nevada.

334
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,958
We should be there about noon tomorrow.

335
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,750
And...

336
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,083
and we came from up here in Oregon, right?

337
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,458
Yeah. You've got
yourself a job navigating.

338
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are these muscles?

339
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,583
What you doing growing up on me, huh?

340
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,958
You've got muscles now?
Show me what you're packing.

341
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,166
Ooh.

342
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,541
Oh, my God, put it away.

343
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,083
You're gonna get in trouble.
It's dangerous.

344
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,416
Dude.

345
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,125
Look at you, huh?

346
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,916
You grew up.

347
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,500
And Bobby, too.

348
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,166
Bobby, rise and shine!

349
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,375
Pancake time!

350
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,083
How many people have been infected?

351
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,250
Could be as much
as half the population.

352
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,625
Folks look normal, but inside they're not.

353
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,875
If you use that spray,
it's like a force field.

354
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,041
You're gonna be safe.

355
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,791
What happens if you get infected?

356
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,291
I won't let that happen.

357
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,416
Jay. Weren't you gonna draw me a picture?

358
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,708
Oh. Yeah.

359
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,083
Hey, Bobby.

360
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,208
Nothing bad's gonna happen
to you while I'm around, okay?

361
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,000
And besides, if this ain't

362
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,958
a hell of an adventure,
I don't know what is, dude.

363
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,375
I would've killed to do
something like this

364
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,708
when I was a kid.

365
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,208
Hey. When you get back to school,

366
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,583
can you imagine the crazy
stories you're gonna have?

367
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,125
Uh, can I tell them about the gun firing?

368
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,625
I mean, I'm not sure
if you can tell them that.

369
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,375
It's top secret, dude.
That's just for the crew.

370
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,583
That's just for the Musketeers.

371
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,208
But you can tell them you went on

372
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,333
a crazy road trip
with your cool-ass dad, okay?

373
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
Yeah, just smile.

374
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,083
Smiling's the best disguise.

375
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,875
Okay, that's a little bit
too much. It's scary.

376
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,250
Dude, you're looking like
an alien yourself now.

377
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,375
- Just smile normally.
- What if the trooper finds us?

378
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:35,625
There's no way he's gonna find us.

379
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,208
What do you mean?

380
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,416
'Cause we drove halfway
across California last night.

381
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,208
Here you go.

382
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,916
All right.

383
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's a little hot. Just be careful.

384
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,166
Get some of that.

385
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,125
You don't like maple syrup?

386
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,583
I'm not allowed.

387
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, Dylan says sugar makes him hyper.

388
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,833
You know, for once, Dylan is right.

389
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,916
Sugar does make you hyper.

390
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That's why we like it.

391
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,583
Hey.

392
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,250
Don't run in the road.

393
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,375
You see that? You see what happened?

394
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,125
You got to stay close.

395
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,166
I got to go get some supplies.

396
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,833
You okay holding fort, watching Bobby?

397
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,541
Hey, it's a big responsibility.

398
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,208
It's kind of a promotion.

399
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,041
You up to it?

400
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,875
Yeah.

401
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,875
Okay. Here you go.

402
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,458
Stay in the car.
I'll be five minutes.

403
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,875
Okay.

404
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,500
Bobby.

405
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:40,291
You lay low, and I'll stand watch.

406
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,041
All right.

407
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,041
Hey, Jay, what do you think it's like

408
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,041
when there's an alien inside you?

409
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,208
I think it's like you can hear everything

410
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,333
and see everything,

411
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,708
but you just can't move
and you can't speak.

412
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,166
It's like being a prisoner
inside your own body.

413
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,666
You think the Red Sox are aliens?

414
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,375
- The Red Sox?
- Yeah.

415
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,000
Who cares?

416
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,541
Why do you even like them, anyway?

417
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, like, Dylan says

418
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,666
they're gonna be the winner of the season.

419
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,958
You know what? If Dylan likes them,

420
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,125
then they're definitely aliens.

421
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,041
I think she saw me.

422
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,458
Shh. Stay down.

423
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,291
There's no more spray.

424
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,708
Bobby, stop. Stop.

425
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,791
Hey. Kids, you got ten dollars?

426
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,791
Bobby. Bobby.

427
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,333
Bobby, get back here!

428
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,458
Bobby!

429
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,333
Dad. Dad.

430
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,916
- What?
- I lost Bobby.

431
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,125
- What?
- There was an alien, and then

432
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,375
- I couldn't do anything.
- Shh. Calm down.

433
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,750
- Calm down. Calm down.
- And I tried to find him.

434
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,125
I'm so sorry, Dad.

435
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,500
I lost him.

436
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,041
Okay. Come with me.

437
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,750
Stay close.

438
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,875
Bobby, Bobby. What you doing, man?

439
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,583
What you doing running off like that?

440
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,083
I got scared.

441
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:28,000
That's not a goddamn excuse, okay?

442
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,875
You want to draw attention to us?

443
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,291
- No. No.
- Look at me.

444
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,791
You want to draw attention to us?

445
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,208
No.

446
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,875
Hey.

447
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,041
We're behind enemy lines here.

448
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,916
Okay? So if you want us
to make it out in one piece,

449
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,625
you got to learn to follow orders.

450
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,583
- Oh, you-you want these, huh?
- Yes.

451
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,500
Take this.

452
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,833
It's not okay.

453
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,958
Okay? This happens again,
we got a problem.

454
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,250
I mean it.

455
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,541
Why are you angry at me

456
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,083
when he's the dumb shit that ran off?

457
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,500
- I'm not a dumb shit! You are!
- Hey.

458
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,750
- Yes, you are.
- He is a kid.

459
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,625
I'm a kid, too.

460
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,875
No, you're not. No.

461
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,625
You're not a kid anymore.

462
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:18,583
You can't be. I'm sorry. I need you.

463
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,333
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

464
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,875
Families take care of each other.

465
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,833
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

466
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,208
Damn.

467
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:32,791
Scaring the hell out of me.

468
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,250
Hey, can we just try
and enjoy this road trip?

469
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,375
- What kind of candy you want?
- Starburst or Skittles.

470
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,708
Don't go easy on me this time.

471
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,625
I'll start the count.

472
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,541
One, two, three, four,

473
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,291
I declare a thumb war.

474
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,375
- One, two, three, four, I...
- How do you keep doing that?

475
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,500
I just won a thumb war.

476
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,708
How come Bobby gets to sit in the front?

477
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:05,708
Poo-poo, poo-poo, poo-poo head.

478
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,291
This is so fun, Dad.

479
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,541
Hey, Jay, you think this thing
could hit a hundred?

480
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,166
Yeah!

481
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,625
Want to find out? Yeah?

482
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,083
Let's see what this hunk of junk can do.

483
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,583
Come on!

484
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,416
Come on, Dad!

485
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:36,333
- Three, two... one!
- Go, Dad!

486
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,958
Whoa.

487
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

488
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,166
Oh, I need a nap.

489
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,291
- I just need a nap, okay?
- Dad? No, no, no.

490
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,125
- Dad, wake up! Wake up.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

491
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,375
- Dad, Dad, wake up. Dad, wake up.
- Dad, wake up.

492
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,625
- Dad!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa.

493
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,791
What-what'd I miss?

494
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,291
Who was driving?

495
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,583
No one.

496
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,375
You were kind of driving.

497
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,750
You were about to pull over.

498
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,833
We all friends again now?

499
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,458
Yeah.

500
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,666
Whoo!

501
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,875
Okay.

502
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,625
This is dumb.

503
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,458
You don't like this?

504
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,916
Heavy metal, dude.

505
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,083
Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth?

506
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,833
Okay, what do you guys listen to?

507
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,833
K-pop.

508
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:33,291
That's why you're in the back.

509
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,041
Okay, what music do you like?

510
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,125
Barbra Streisand.

511
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,916
Well, it's official.

512
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,375
You're both infected.

513
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,083
Hey, boys, help me out.
Can I change this music now?

514
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,083
No way.

515
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,833
This is the best stuff.

516
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,958
Hey, Dad?

517
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,916
Yeah.

518
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,833
You think there was a part of
Mom that's still fighting it?

519
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:23,708
Yeah, that sounds like
your mom.

520
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,000
I think there was.

521
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,166
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

522
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,000
I mean, she'd been acting
all strange recently.

523
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,250
Like how?

524
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,625
Like barfing all the time.

525
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,166
You mean, like, in the mornings?

526
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,666
Yeah. And she's been eating
some weird stuff.

527
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,541
Like chocolate and mayonnaise.

528
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,291
And cottage cheese and onion.

529
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,458
What's up?

530
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,458
What's wrong?

531
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,083
One second. I need to think.

532
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,708
Dad, what's wrong?

533
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,041
Shh.

534
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,250
I got to call base.

535
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,666
Hello?

536
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,083
Hello, Hattie?

537
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,416
It's me, Malik.

538
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,916
Where the hell have you been?

539
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,125
- You didn't show up for work.
- Uh, I-I know.

540
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,208
You missed your psych eval.

541
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,416
Look, you want to go back to prison?

542
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,916
I thought we respected each other.

543
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,541
You gonna let me down like this?

544
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,083
Hattie, shut up and listen, okay?

545
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,250
I need you to go check on Piya.

546
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,625
Check on Piya?

547
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,250
I need you to tell me

548
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,250
exactly what's going on and where you are.

549
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,000
I went and got my kids.

550
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,458
What do you mean, got 'em?

551
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,791
I mean I went and got them.
They're with me now.

552
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,958
Christ, Malik. That's called kidnapping.

553
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,791
And if you... if you cross state lines,

554
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,541
it's a federal offense.

555
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,916
Hey, I did not... I did not kidnap them.

556
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,041
I saved them. Okay?

557
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,875
I can't explain it all right now,

558
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,916
but they're safe now...
they're safer here with me.

559
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,750
Okay, you need to stop talking.

560
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,458
Stop talking and tell me

561
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,875
exactly where you are right now.

562
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,958
I can't do that, Hattie.
Just go check on Piya.

563
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,041
Okay? She's in the garage with Dylan.

564
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,916
- Look, we can...
- Please, you're the only person I trust.

565
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,750
We can fix this, but you have to tell...

566
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,833
Ma-Malik? Malik? Malik?

567
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,416
Malik, please pick up.

568
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,000
You got me scared as hell.

569
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,250
If it's about visitation rights,

570
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,958
we can talk through it.

571
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,500
- Stop! Stop!
- You were showing

572
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,291
too much promise
to do something this stupid.

573
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,916
I'm not gonna give up on you.

574
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,500
I'm not gonna stop calling.

575
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:08,833
- You're on my side.
- Stop. No, get off.

576
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,083
You're on my side. You're on my side.

577
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,291
- Hey, stop!
- You are on my side.

578
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,041
Hey, quit it.

579
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,750
Are we there yet?

580
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,916
Bobby, I'm trying to think
right now, okay?

581
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,458
Just quietly let's enjoy the view.

582
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:25,833
♪ I'm going
all around the world, yeah ♪

583
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,666
Hey, can you pull your hand in?

584
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,541
- ♪ I'm off to save the world ♪
- You know, if you drop that,

585
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,416
we're not going back for it, okay?

586
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:37,250
- It slipped.
- You kidding me?

587
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,416
Well, I guess he's gonna
have to fend for himself now.

588
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,625
Turn around!

589
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,166
Welcome to the school of life, kid.

590
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,708
You fuck up, you pay the price.

591
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,000
- I want it back!
- Come on.

592
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,125
- What? No. Hey.
- Turn around!

593
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,750
Damn it! Hey!

594
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,041
Ah, get off me!

595
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,291
Bobby!

596
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,291
You okay?

597
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,708
What the hell is wrong with you, Bobby?

598
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,208
You almost got us killed.

599
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,333
When I tell you we're not
going back for a toy,

600
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,666
what do you think that means?

601
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,750
What do you think it means?

602
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,666
Huh?!

603
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:29,875
That we're not going back for the toy!

604
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,875
We've got people chasing us now!

605
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,583
You understand?

606
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,750
Jesus, Dad.

607
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,625
Leave him alone.

608
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,000
Hey.

609
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:11,583
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- I hate you. I hate you!

610
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,333
- I'm sorry.
- I hate you!

611
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

612
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,375
I want to go back to Mom!

613
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,875
I'm sorry.

614
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,708
I miss Mom!

615
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,375
He s-said he just wanted to talk,

616
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,208
so I let him in, and then
he started acting really weird.

617
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,791
He shined a-a penlight in my eye.

618
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,916
Then he said...

619
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,291
he knew I was one of them.

620
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,958
O-One of what?

621
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,291
- I don't know.
- We don't know.

622
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,625
I don't know what that means.

623
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,791
Said he was gonna save the boys.

624
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,166
Oh, my God.

625
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,416
Oh, God. Oh, God.

626
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,958
I know this is difficult.

627
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,625
I don't...
They could be anywhere.

628
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,125
Hi.

629
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,666
I'm Malik's parole officer.
I called this in.

630
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,000
Your office said he missed a psych eval.

631
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,416
Yeah, I've been trying to track him down.

632
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,583
And you waited 24 hours?

633
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:41,791
Well, Malik wasn't deemed a flight risk.

634
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:45,208
Ma'am, if you don't mind
waiting over there,

635
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,416
we can talk when we're done here.

636
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,375
Thank you.

637
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,208
So, what is this...

638
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,291
what is this about a psych evaluation?

639
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,583
I'm Special Agent Lance Dunn

640
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,625
from the FBI Child Abduction
Rapid Deployment team.

641
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,000
Hattie Hayes, Shasta County Parole.

642
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,416
I'm just plain old Shep.

643
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,333
What sort of cases do you work, Hattie?

644
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:26,250
Uh, mostly drug and thug.

645
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:31,166
And, uh, what can you tell us
about our kidnapper?

646
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,958
He grew up in foster care,
not all of it good.

647
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,375
Uh, staff sergeant
in the Marine Raider Unit.

648
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,041
Did about ten tours in all.

649
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,583
He was court-martialed
for beating up his captain.

650
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,625
Broke the guy's jaw
into five pieces.

651
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,208
Had to be put in a medically
induced coma for a week.

652
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,125
Malik did two years, Leavenworth.

653
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,375
That's right.

654
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,833
And your experience with him?

655
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,000
He was... uh, he was very polite.

656
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,791
Called me "ma'am."

657
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,791
Not everybody does that.

658
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,416
But he...

659
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,250
he seemed like a good guy.

660
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,416
That's your assessment?

661
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,458
That he seemed like a good guy?

662
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,500
Excuse me. I'm a good judge of character.

663
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,916
Everybody thinks they're
a good judge of character.

664
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,416
Well, I turn over
about 120 clients a year.

665
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,666
Been doing this for 18 years.

666
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,416
So that's...

667
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,833
Well, that's a lot of cases.

668
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,666
And I have to look each and
every one of them in the eye

669
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,708
to see if I can find the good in 'em,

670
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,791
'cause that's what I do... that's my job.

671
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,333
I think it's very sweet
that you're one of those

672
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,625
"benefit of the doubt" POs,

673
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,791
but by not putting out
an arrest warrant straightaway,

674
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,791
you exponentially increased the risk

675
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,416
of these boys being hurt or killed.

676
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,750
Malik is not gonna hurt anyone,
least of all his boys.

677
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,791
Lance, you do us a favor

678
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,666
and, uh, check and see
if the tech's finished up.

679
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,666
We're gonna head out in five.

680
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,500
Mm.

681
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,916
What's up with Johnny Utah?

682
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,375
Hattie, we have, uh...

683
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:25,250
...strong reasons to believe
that Malik might be

684
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,333
a family annihilator.

685
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,791
- That's...
- I know what it is.

686
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,333
But you don't buy it.

687
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:38,125
Unfortunately, he checks
a lot of these boxes.

688
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:43,416
Separated from wife, isolated from kids.

689
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,333
Dishonorably discharged

690
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,666
from the one thing that he was good at.

691
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,291
He's got no benefits,
no health care, no pension.

692
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,083
Nothing.

693
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:57,041
Then you put him on the inside
for a couple of years

694
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,333
to ferment.

695
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:04,291
Resentment, rage.

696
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:08,208
You add PTSD into the mix,
what do you got?

697
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,291
A ticking time bomb.

698
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,291
He packed no clothes.

699
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,125
No toys for the kids.

700
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,791
Not even a toothbrush.

701
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,000
But you know what he did have?

702
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,750
He had a gun.

703
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,625
Now, what's a convicted felon doing

704
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,208
purchasing a firearm?

705
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,833
You're a parole officer.

706
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,208
But he loves his boys.

707
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:41,125
Practically all annihilators
are considered loving fathers.

708
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:44,416
That's why nobody sees it coming.

709
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:51,666
If we don't stop Malik,
he's gonna execute those boys.

710
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,791
And then he's gonna turn
the gun on himself.

711
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:59,291
Because that's the ultimate revenge.

712
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,208
- Okay?
- Yeah.

713
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,041
Clip goes in.

714
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,125
Yep. Rack it.

715
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,875
Okay? It's ready to go.

716
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,708
Finger off the trigger.

717
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,250
You're gonna line up the target
between these two sights.

718
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,625
Squeeze.

719
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,541
How was that?

720
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,083
You're not scared of it.

721
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,041
You find something trying
to kill you, you kill it first.

722
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,791
Not that high.

723
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,375
Let it go.

724
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,125
Okay, Jay, let's go.

725
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,041
Spotted some aliens! Shoot! Get 'em!

726
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,583
This rescue operation

727
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:57,166
extends to all adjacent states.

728
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,666
You guys know what to do.

729
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,916
Make the calls.

730
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,166
Scan every pixel of CCTV

731
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,041
at every gas station and every ATM.

732
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:14,208
Now, it's likely that Malik
has manipulated his children

733
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,708
and they have no idea the kind
of danger that they're in.

734
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,916
In fact, they probably think

735
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,166
he's the greatest father in the world.

736
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,583
Now, we've put the Amber Alert out,

737
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:34,125
but Malik Khan has a 22-hour lead on us,

738
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,875
and that is a scary head start,

739
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,791
so we need to tighten the net real quick.

740
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,291
He is a desperate man,

741
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,916
and he's willing to take
desperate measures.

742
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:52,541
And he can turn on them at any moment.

743
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,583
Hey, baby.

744
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,791
Ma, you made it.

745
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,958
Sorry I'm late, baby. You winning?

746
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,916
- I got two strikes.
- Damn, girl.

747
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,916
Look at you, with your little
cute self. Go get 'em.

748
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

749
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,750
Don't worry, I've been
pretending to be you,

750
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,583
so we're actually doing pretty good.

751
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,541
Eh, you-you okay?

752
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,541
Who got on the wrong side of you today?

753
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,875
I'm the one on the wrong side.

754
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,750
I gave somebody the benefit of the doubt

755
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,708
that I shouldn't have.

756
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,291
Well, hey, you can't be right
all the time, baby.

757
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,583
Yeah, but...

758
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,291
this guy could be bad news.

759
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,166
Huh.

760
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,500
How bad?

761
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,375
As bad as they come.

762
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,666
Little dude is combustible,

763
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,375
just like me.

764
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,250
Not you, though. You're something else.

765
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,208
I'm not tough, if that's what you mean.

766
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,458
Yo.

767
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:35,541
Keeping a level head when
all hell's breaking loose...

768
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,125
that's a special kind of tough.

769
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,333
That's why we need you around.

770
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,083
I need you.

771
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,750
And you're humble, too.

772
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:49,333
And good-looking.

773
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,958
And the girls
are gonna love you.

774
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,875
Be chasing you around the playground.

775
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,875
Huh?

776
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,291
Dad?

777
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,958
Do you still love Mom?

778
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,791
Yeah.

779
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,750
Of course I do.

780
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,500
We had some good years
alongside those tough ones.

781
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:18,208
Hell...

782
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,583
I ever tell you first time we met?

783
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,208
No.

784
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,625
- Want to know?
- Yeah.

785
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,541
Okay, don't laugh at me.

786
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,000
Okay, I'll try not to.

787
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,625
Okay, screw it. You can laugh.

788
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,666
A buddy of mine wants
to take me to a dance.

789
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,083
Okay? I'd just come back off tour.

790
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,708
It's not gonna go well.

791
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,791
Uh...

792
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,625
- Dude, you suck at dancing.
- I know.

793
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,250
But I want to go, so I go

794
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,416
and I get all loaded up to loosen up.

795
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,375
Okay, but...

796
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,666
an hour later, I've sunk
about a dozen whiskeys.

797
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,500
And now I'm all in, dude.

798
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,083
I'm throwing all kinds of shapes.

799
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,833
I'm doing stuff you've never seen before.

800
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,500
Like what?

801
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,333
Well, they're brand-new.
They're copyrighted.

802
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,333
I can't tell you.

803
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:06,458
I get a little excited.
I decide to try a backflip.

804
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,000
I kick your mom in the head.

805
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,875
Dude, what?

806
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,958
I hit her right in the head,
dude, with my boot.

807
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,375
What is wrong with you?

808
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,958
I know.

809
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,625
Hey, hey, you see that?

810
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:19,916
What?

811
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,708
Meteors.

812
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,541
I don't see anything.

813
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,125
What, are you blind?
There must be a hundred of 'em.

814
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,333
It's beautiful.

815
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,666
Couple of hours, all that's
gonna be in the ecosystem.

816
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,166
Let's get back on the road.

817
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,666
You put that spray on, Jay.

818
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,208
You got to stay safe.

819
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:22,458
Yep. Let's get you inside.

820
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,625
- Dad.
- Yeah?

821
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,375
You kidding me?

822
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,208
You got a spare?

823
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:43,125
$500 cars don't come with spares.

824
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,791
Raúl?

825
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,125
Hattie.

826
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,125
Sorry I'm late.

827
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,875
You want something?
Th-They're about to close.

828
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,416
Whatever he's having.

829
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,000
- Thank you.
- Right.

830
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:07,833
Thanks for coming.

831
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,791
No problem.

832
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,625
So you said, uh...

833
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,208
Malik kidnapped his boys?

834
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,833
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

835
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,333
Thanks.

836
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:22,583
I'm just...

837
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:26,041
trying to figure out what triggered him.

838
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:29,875
You guys were close, right?

839
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,583
Yeah.

840
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,583
Very.

841
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,791
Been through hell and back together.

842
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,791
What kind of Marine was he?

843
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,958
Malik was a fucking badass.

844
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,375
But, uh, he also knew how to...

845
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,458
turn it on and off.

846
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,666
What about the assault?

847
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,791
That was completely out of character.

848
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,333
I mean, you got to take into account

849
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,666
what we were going through.

850
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,250
We'd been in three different
firefights that day.

851
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,000
We seen two of our buddies get ripped up.

852
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,083
It's 120 degrees out.

853
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:08,208
We're getting eaten alive by bugs.

854
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:10,416
The stress level's just...

855
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,083
Unimaginable.

856
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, it was.

857
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,083
We found some children in the wreckage.

858
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,625
Then his whole fucking world
came tumbling down.

859
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,333
Uh, you mentioned some letters.

860
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,416
Yeah, about a year ago...

861
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,208
I got these.

862
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,458
He sent me hundreds and hundreds of them.

863
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:40,333
Pretty out there stuff.

864
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,916
Obviously, I thought he was
having some kind of breakdown.

865
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,416
Oh, my God.

866
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,416
You got to look for a motel.

867
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,916
You got to look for a service station.

868
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,708
You got to look for someplace
we can pull off, okay?

869
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,916
We're still a long way from base.

870
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,875
- Dad?
- Yeah.

871
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,375
If half the world are aliens,
how come nothing's been on TV?

872
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:20,375
You kidding me? They're not
there to tell us the truth.

873
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,041
So the government knows?

874
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,958
The government probably got turned first.

875
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,541
Think about it.

876
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,583
Has anyone else seen one of these meteors?

877
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,500
Like, wouldn't there be
videos of them online?

878
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:37,250
Wouldn't NASA know about them?

879
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:39,458
They take all that stuff down.

880
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:41,625
Why would they take it down?

881
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,541
You think I'm making it up.

882
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:02,375
No.

883
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,541
You don't seem so sure.

884
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,583
It's just a lot to take in.

885
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,583
Yeah...

886
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:16,125
I know it's a lot.

887
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,958
Open your eyes.

888
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,708
- Dad, stop.
- Open your eyes. Huh?

889
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:26,708
- Ow. Ah.
- Can you hold still?

890
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:28,916
- I'm trying to protect you.
- Stop.

891
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,708
Stop!

892
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,708
Stop hurting my brother.

893
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,666
Stay in the car. Pack up all the gear.

894
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,833
Yeah.

895
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:08,416
Easy, now.

896
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,500
Two boys, eight and ten.

897
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:16,791
A 38-year-old male, armed and dangerous,

898
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:20,333
driving a blue Cherokee
with California plates.

899
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,666
Our car broke down.

900
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,625
So you were fixing to take mine?

901
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,583
Not trying to hurt anybody.

902
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,333
That gun in your back pocket loaded?

903
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,166
Yeah.

904
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:40,041
So there's that.

905
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,666
Were you in the military?

906
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,416
Not the one you're talking about.

907
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,791
I did ten tours.

908
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:53,541
Yeah? Whose side were you on?

909
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:56,541
Side that gave me a Bronze Star.

910
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:00,833
Yeah, well, you can put
whiskers on a snake

911
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,833
and call it a kitty.

912
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:04,958
Don't mean it ain't gonna bite.

913
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:09,375
I could just leave, go ahead
and walk to the next town.

914
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,750
You could've done that,

915
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:14,083
but you chose to come in here,

916
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,958
onto my property.

917
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,958
And that's a hell of a mistake

918
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:21,583
when you've got a $10,000
reward on your head.

919
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,083
But then I don't hold much esteem

920
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:24,791
for the federal government.

921
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,000
So why don't you take a seat
at the table there,

922
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,916
and maybe there's a way we both
can come out of this on top.

923
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,708
You think Dad shot an alien?

924
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:45,041
What are you doing?

925
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,333
I'm calling base.

926
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:59,458
Malik?

927
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,333
It's Jay, his son.

928
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,166
Is this base?

929
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,833
Base? Uh, no.

930
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:06,916
I'm Hattie Hayes.

931
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,500
I'm your father's parole officer.

932
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,958
My dad was in prison?

933
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:14,708
Jay, honey, I need to know
exactly where you are.

934
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:17,250
We entered Nevada a few miles back.

935
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,125
How many miles was that?

936
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,291
How do I know you're not an alien?

937
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,250
Alien?

938
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,416
Okay, Jay, honey, uh, listen.

939
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,583
You've been kidnapped,
and your mom is-is terribly...

940
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,208
Is my mom okay?

941
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:32,875
Yes, your mom is fine, honey. She...

942
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,750
Come on, let's get in the car.

943
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,500
Come on, let's get in the car!

944
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,333
Did you shoot an alien?

945
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,333
Yeah, a big mean one.

946
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,000
Dad, are you okay?

947
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,833
It's just a flesh wound.
I'll clean it up later.

948
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:28,125
Think it's about time
you learned how to drive.

949
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,583
You can't fuck it up. It's automatic.

950
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,500
Okay, right is accelerate.

951
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,375
Left is brake.

952
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,166
"D" is drive.

953
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

954
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,208
Whoa. Okay.

955
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,625
Now split the difference.

956
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,291
You're doing great, Jay.

957
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,583
Come on.

958
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,666
Jay, lay that down.

959
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,541
Dad, whose house is this?

960
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,291
I don't know, Jay. It's abandoned.

961
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:16,750
Lay down.

962
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,250
Go to sleep now.

963
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,666
Plain old Shep.

964
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,541
How you doing, Hattie?

965
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,166
How'd you get in the building?

966
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,875
I know people.

967
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,208
No need, really, to come all this way.

968
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,125
I mean, uh, thank you

969
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,416
for relaying the information, but...

970
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,708
I want to come with you.

971
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,333
Excuse me?

972
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,291
You can't come, Hattie.

973
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,458
Shep, please. I-I don't think

974
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:26,583
we're dealing with a family annihilator.

975
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,333
I think Malik might be suffering

976
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,750
from an undiagnosed psychotic disorder.

977
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,416
So you're a psychiatrist now.

978
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,916
No, but I spoke to his Marine buddy,

979
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,833
who was sent these.

980
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:43,666
Now, Malik's son asked me
if I was an alien.

981
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,541
Maybe Malik's not out to hurt his boys.

982
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,375
Maybe he thinks he's on some
sort of mission to save 'em.

983
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,250
Yeah, maybe, and maybe
makes him more dangerous.

984
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,250
I mean, what if Malik goes
into a 7-Eleven,

985
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,708
sees a cashier that's looking
at him a little funny,

986
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:59,416
shoots him 'cause he thinks he's an alien?

987
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,833
What if he thinks his boys
are aliens, shoots them?

988
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:05,833
It doesn't change what I have to do.

989
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:08,500
But, surely, it changes
how you engage him.

990
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,041
With all due respect, I've been
doing this for 20 years.

991
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,458
I know his profile.

992
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,583
I am not gonna antagonize the man.

993
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:20,166
Whoa, whoa. I'm not doubting
you know how to do your job,

994
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:24,458
but I am saying Malik called me
and his son called me,

995
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,375
so I'm an asset to you.

996
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,291
Why not bring me along just for the ride?

997
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,125
And if you need me, I'm there.

998
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,750
And if you don't,
I just sit in the back seat,

999
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,833
keep my mouth shut, learn from the best.

1000
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,583
Oh, shit.

1001
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,208
Whose piece-of-shit car
is that out front?

1002
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,000
I don't know.

1003
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,291
Dad?

1004
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,625
Hurry up, man. Let's go.

1005
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,708
Hey.

1006
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,291
Dad?

1007
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,250
Dad!

1008
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,750
Oh, fuck.

1009
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,250
Kurt, call an ambulance!

1010
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,875
What are you doing just sitting there?

1011
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,791
- Call an ambulance!
- Oh, my God.

1012
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,791
Oh, Dad, Dad, Dad.

1013
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,541
You okay?

1014
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,666
Someone did this to you?

1015
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,458
- Yeah.
- Who did it?

1016
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:38,375
Is he turning into an alien?

1017
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:40,458
It's just a flesh wound, Bobby.

1018
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,916
He needs to rest.

1019
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,833
Jay, where are we?

1020
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:06,250
Don't know.

1021
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,000
Come on.

1022
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:14,708
You think the aliens ate our food?

1023
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:16,625
Probably.

1024
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:22,125
Aliens like Pop-Tarts?

1025
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,625
Everyone likes Pop-Tarts, Bobby.

1026
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,250
- Hey.
- I'm hungry.

1027
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,500
I know.

1028
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,208
Let's see if we can find
something to eat, yeah?

1029
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:34,458
How?

1030
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,916
Nice one.

1031
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:50,208
Jay, do you think there was a war here?

1032
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,708
Yeah.

1033
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,250
I found a kitchen, Jay.

1034
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,708
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, what are you doing?

1035
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,291
Gonna win! Gonna win!

1036
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,875
Gonna win!

1037
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,666
Hah, I won.

1038
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:23,916
Ooh, you can go all the way up there?

1039
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,833
Look. What do you think that is?

1040
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,833
- That?
- Yeah.

1041
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,791
Looks like an elephant
that just swallowed a duck.

1042
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:37,458
Come on. Let's see
if there's a shop nearby.

1043
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:39,166
What should we get?

1044
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,541
Spaghetti and meatballs.
What do you think?

1045
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,333
Uh, ice cream.

1046
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:46,125
Salt and vinegar chips.

1047
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,791
What about marshmallows?

1048
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,166
You go buy us something to eat,

1049
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,250
and I'll get some medicine for Dad.

1050
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,666
You only got ten dollars, remember.

1051
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,583
Come on, at least five bucks more.

1052
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,833
Howdy.

1053
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,666
Hey.

1054
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,416
What can I do you for?

1055
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:04,750
Well, my dad got bit by a dog,

1056
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:07,083
and he has a tooth stuck in him.

1057
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,166
That sounds kind of serious.

1058
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,833
Do you want me to call you an ambulance?

1059
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:12,875
No, no, it's not that bad.

1060
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:15,083
Just...

1061
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,583
medium bad.

1062
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:19,083
He just needs something for the pain.

1063
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:20,916
Well, if you say so.

1064
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,000
$9.40.

1065
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:27,291
Keep the change.

1066
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,583
Well, I hope he feels...

1067
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,708
...kidnapped his two boys.

1068
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,583
A multiagency task force
is looking for them.

1069
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,791
Malik Khan assaulted two men,

1070
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,916
a state trooper in Northern California

1071
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,083
and a man in Vulture, Nevada.

1072
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:52,541
Both men are recovering in the hospital.

1073
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:54,583
Khan served two years in prison,

1074
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:57,541
and he is considered armed and dangerous.

1075
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:00,541
It is believed Malik...

1076
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,666
Hey.

1077
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,833
You're not driving this, are you, son?

1078
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,208
No. No, no way.

1079
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:10,916
Kids can't drive.

1080
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,791
I'm waiting on my brother.

1081
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:17,208
Um, you're not in any kind
of trouble, are you, son?

1082
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:21,083
No.

1083
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,250
'Cause you can tell me if you are.

1084
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,041
But I'm not.

1085
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,541
Nice chatting with you.

1086
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,583
Dex!

1087
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,750
911. What's your emergency?

1088
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:08,416
Hi. Uh, I've just had a child

1089
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,083
walk into my pharmacy.

1090
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,458
He, um... I think he's in danger.

1091
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:15,208
He handed me money
with blood splattered over it.

1092
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:18,208
Uh, he-he looked like
he wanted to say something

1093
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,000
but didn't know how.

1094
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:21,583
Okay.

1095
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,458
He was sitting in the driver seat

1096
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,666
of a burgundy car.

1097
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:07,500
It's not real. It's not real.

1098
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,375
It's not real.

1099
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:28,166
That's Dad's fucking car.

1100
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,875
Turn around!

1101
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,666
Drive slow. We don't want them to see us.

1102
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:06,750
You think Dad's gonna be okay?

1103
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,958
Jay.

1104
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:14,416
Listen, Bobby.

1105
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:17,375
I think we need to call Mom.

1106
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,875
But... but she's an alien.

1107
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,708
What if Dad made it all up?

1108
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:24,916
Think about it.

1109
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,458
Aliens taking over the world?

1110
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:29,208
You just said they ate our Pop-Tarts.

1111
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:30,958
Do you think aliens eat Pop-Tarts?

1112
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,458
Are you that stupid?

1113
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,250
Get off me!

1114
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,708
Ouch.

1115
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,250
You okay, Bobby?

1116
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,541
Bobby?

1117
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:54,083
Bobby!

1118
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,000
Bobby!

1119
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,500
I hate you!

1120
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:12,791
Bobby!

1121
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,250
Bobby, I'm heading back.

1122
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:17,333
I need to check on Dad.

1123
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:34,375
Hey, Jay.

1124
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,875
Where you been, buddy?

1125
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,958
Bobby okay?

1126
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,250
He's fine.

1127
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,541
I got some things for you.

1128
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:50,791
Look at you.

1129
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,958
Driving all by yourself, huh?

1130
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,625
You gonna be okay?

1131
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,875
The bleeding stopped. I'll live.

1132
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:01,458
Come here.

1133
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,250
Hey. Come here.

1134
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,916
I need to talk to you.

1135
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,708
What's wrong?

1136
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,916
I know you've been lying to us.

1137
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,583
You weren't on a secret mission
all those years.

1138
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,875
You were in prison.

1139
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:29,916
You've been lying
about aliens coming down.

1140
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,000
That's not the whole picture, okay?

1141
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,333
Stay away from me.

1142
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,291
Easy. Easy.

1143
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:40,666
Easy.

1144
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,916
I was in prison.

1145
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,875
I hid that from you.

1146
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,416
I was trying to make it easier on you.

1147
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:53,583
Maybe I was trying
to make it easier on me, too.

1148
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:00,791
I've been confused, Jay.

1149
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,208
Up here.

1150
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,708
You know?

1151
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,375
I'm seeing things that's not there.

1152
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,500
You're lying.

1153
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:15,458
You've been lying this whole time!

1154
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,958
Malik Khan!

1155
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:26,750
We're here to arrest you

1156
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:30,333
for the abduction of your two sons,

1157
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:33,125
the assault of Grant Healy

1158
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:35,791
and the theft of his motor vehicle!

1159
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:40,041
Now, come out with your hands
above your head!

1160
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,583
Down.

1161
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,083
Fucking asshole!

1162
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:02,083
You want to shoot a ten-year-old boy?

1163
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:04,250
Now, stay put and watch my six.

1164
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:13,166
Hey. Okay.

1165
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,250
Get away from the window. Stay low.

1166
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:22,333
Where's my gun?

1167
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:24,041
In the car.

1168
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,375
I want you to stay in here.
Stay low, okay?

1169
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:02,750
Dwight!

1170
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,875
Stop!

1171
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,541
Sit down.

1172
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,958
Okay. Wait here.

1173
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,625
- How high can you count?
- 300.

1174
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,583
Okay. I want you to count to 600.

1175
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:27,208
I'll be back.

1176
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,041
One, two, three,

1177
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,875
four, five, six,

1178
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:39,500
seven, eight, nine, ten,

1179
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:43,000
11, 12, 13,

1180
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:46,125
14, 15, 16,

1181
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,708
17, 18...

1182
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:50,500
Drop it.

1183
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:52,791
Drop it!

1184
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,500
Get back in the house.

1185
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,416
Step forward.

1186
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,041
Why are you coming after me?

1187
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,750
You attacked our dad.

1188
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,750
He shot at me.

1189
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,750
In his home.

1190
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,791
Is that water?

1191
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,666
Can I have some, please?

1192
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,541
Easy. Easy.

1193
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:49,583
I need you to take your shirt off.

1194
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:56,791
384, 385,

1195
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,625
386,

1196
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,958
387...

1197
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,125
388,

1198
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,041
389,

1199
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:12,250
390, 391, 392,

1200
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:16,000
393, 394...

1201
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:26,083
You okay?

1202
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,500
Yeah.

1203
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,250
I'm gonna make things right.

1204
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:52,166
How do you like
these new wheels, boys?

1205
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,083
Cool upgrade, huh?

1206
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:58,125
Were they aliens?

1207
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,916
Yeah, Bobby.

1208
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Mean, ugly ones.

1209
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,000
Let me speak to them now.

1210
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:26,000
Let me speak to my babies
to make sure they're...

1211
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:27,500
I can't, Piya.

1212
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,208
I can't. Not now.

1213
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,791
No, you put them on the phone.

1214
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,083
You got the address.
You'll see 'em soon.

1215
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:34,958
What, you're going to
leave them there and drive...

1216
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:37,583
I don't know, but I'm not
going back to prison.

1217
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:39,000
What does that mean?

1218
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,208
What does that even mean, Malik?

1219
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:42,958
Piya, I got to go.

1220
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:45,041
- I'm sorry.
- Do not hang up on me.

1221
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,625
Don't you dare hang up on me.

1222
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,375
Two buffalo burgers.

1223
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:02,083
Okay, I got good news and bad news.

1224
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,583
Want to hear the good news?

1225
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,333
Mom and Dylan are cured.

1226
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,125
They said they can't wait to see you

1227
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:13,125
and they love you more
than anything in the world.

1228
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:18,750
What's the bad news?

1229
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,458
Bad news is I got to keep fighting.

1230
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,166
Yeah.

1231
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,791
Don't worry about it.

1232
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,500
A buddy of mine works here.

1233
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,833
He's undercover.

1234
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:39,416
He's gonna keep an eye on y'all.

1235
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,291
You just got to stay here, and
somebody's gonna come get you.

1236
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:43,375
Can you do that?

1237
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:45,291
We can do that.

1238
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:48,916
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

1239
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,333
I'll miss you, too.

1240
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:54,458
Three Musketeers.

1241
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,375
Come on.

1242
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:01,333
Go, man.

1243
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:20,083
This is for ice cream.

1244
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:22,333
You can have as much as you goddamn want.

1245
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,416
- Do you really mean it, Dad?
- Yeah.

1246
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,541
You earned it.

1247
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,750
Hey.

1248
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:35,416
Take care of your brother.

1249
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,333
Yeah.

1250
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,666
Okay.

1251
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:05,750
Hey.

1252
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,500
Jay, I...

1253
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:09,458
I told you to take care of your brother.

1254
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:11,458
What the fuck, Jay?

1255
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:14,041
He's not the one that needs looking after.

1256
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,291
Oh, fuck.

1257
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:24,000
Jay, get up here.

1258
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:28,458
Does he have
the boy in the vehicle?

1259
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:31,583
Yeah, he's in the vehicle.

1260
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:33,750
Great. Keep that chopper close.

1261
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,291
If he thinks about making a move,

1262
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,875
I want to know about it.

1263
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:53,916
He's following us.

1264
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,291
Okay, hold on.

1265
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:07,583
- Fuck!
- Dad, we need to stop.

1266
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:12,291
I can't stop now, Jay.

1267
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:45,791
Come get it!

1268
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,833
Dad, stop!

1269
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:57,000
- Whose side are you on?
- Yours, Dad.

1270
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:04,416
Whoa!

1271
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:14,291
Yeah!

1272
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,708
Shep, do you need
a whole arsenal aimed at him?

1273
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:00,416
It's standard procedure, Hattie.

1274
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,958
He's an armed and dangerous individual.

1275
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:05,083
There's a ten-year-old boy in there.

1276
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:07,416
That's who I'm worried about.

1277
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:10,958
- Shep...
- Let Shepard do his thing.

1278
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,416
What?

1279
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,583
I'm Special Agent Shepard West.

1280
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:33,125
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1281
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,083
Nice to meet you, too.

1282
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:37,166
- What do you want?
- I just want you to know

1283
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,291
that I'm here to try to help you

1284
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:42,916
and get this situation resolved
as peacefully as possible.

1285
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,500
Now, there's no media here.

1286
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:46,083
It's not looking too peaceful

1287
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:47,708
pointing all that hardware at my boy.

1288
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:50,083
So how about you take a look
at that first?

1289
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:53,750
Okay, I'll do that.

1290
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:57,041
Everybody, guns down!

1291
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,083
- I said stand down! Weapons down!
- Weapons down.

1292
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:00,916
It's okay.

1293
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,916
I'm sorry about that, Malik,

1294
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,791
but I'm gonna need you
to do the same thing for me.

1295
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:07,583
If you could surrender your weapon and...

1296
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:08,791
Hey, hey, hey.

1297
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,958
You try and insult my intelligence again,

1298
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:12,875
I'm gonna do something real fucking stupid

1299
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,625
in your direction, you understand me?

1300
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:18,208
Trust me, I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1301
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,416
Why the fuck should I trust you, huh?

1302
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,833
We're done.

1303
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:23,208
Okay, who do you trust?

1304
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:24,583
Do you trust your PO?

1305
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,625
My... What, Hattie?

1306
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,208
Yeah. She's standing by.

1307
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,791
Well, then, asshole, put her on.

1308
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:32,875
Okay, I'm gonna do that now.

1309
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:43,208
Malik?

1310
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,875
Oh, Hattie.

1311
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,833
Came all this way for me, huh?

1312
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,708
I fucked up, Hattie.

1313
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,208
I dug myself in pretty deep.

1314
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,500
I, uh...

1315
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,500
I can see that.

1316
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:00,458
But there's still a way out.

1317
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,166
Ah, not for me.

1318
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,583
- I deserve what's coming.
- I have to disagree with you.

1319
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:10,916
Your mind has played
a horrible trick on you, Malik,

1320
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,250
and everybody's gonna take that
into account, okay?

1321
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:15,541
Everybody's gonna take that into account.

1322
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:18,250
See, there are some things
going on in your head

1323
01:38:18,333 --> 01:38:20,458
that you're not in control of.

1324
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,833
But, Malik, your boys need you
now more than ever, okay?

1325
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,875
If we do this thing right...

1326
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:28,833
Listen to me.

1327
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:30,583
If we do this thing right,

1328
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,250
you will always be a hero to your sons.

1329
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:35,208
- Move in, move in.
- No! No!

1330
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:37,250
Go, go!

1331
01:38:38,375 --> 01:38:39,750
You trying to fuck me, Hattie?

1332
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,291
- No, Malik...
- Huh? You trying to fuck me?!

1333
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,916
You're trying to fuck me.

1334
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,583
Hold your positions!

1335
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,791
Malik! Let Jay out of
the car so we can resolve this.

1336
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,750
You've got one more minute.

1337
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,875
Hey, Jay.

1338
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:18,750
Thank you for coming out here
to take care of me.

1339
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:21,333
You did a good job, okay?

1340
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:22,833
You did great.

1341
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,083
I need you to run off now.

1342
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:28,916
Hmm.

1343
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:32,250
Get out of the car.

1344
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:35,958
Get out of the car!

1345
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:38,333
I'm not going without you.

1346
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,416
Families take care of each other.

1347
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,833
I didn't take care of you.

1348
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:55,166
I put you in danger.

1349
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,875
You put your trust in me.

1350
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,333
And I lied to you.

1351
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,250
Look where I got us to.

1352
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:14,625
And it weren't you
that did those bad things.

1353
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:20,375
It was the demons inside of you.

1354
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
But you're a hero to me, Dad.

1355
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:46,250
Charlie
Six, you're green. Move in.

1356
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,833
Get back!

1357
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,125
Kid's got a gun.
Kid's got a gun. Put it down!

1358
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,333
Don't shoot.

1359
01:40:54,416 --> 01:40:56,458
- Do not fucking shoot.
- Hey!

1360
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:59,041
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, over here!

1361
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:01,791
Over here!

1362
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:02,875
Get back!

1363
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:04,333
Put it down! Get back!

1364
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:06,083
Over here! I'm over here!

1365
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:08,208
Put it down!

1366
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:09,708
Kid's armed.

1367
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:11,625
- Drop it.
- Get back!

1368
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:13,041
Back up! Put it down!

1369
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:15,208
- Jay!
- They're gonna shoot you!

1370
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:17,125
Not if you're here with me, they won't.

1371
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,916
Put it down, Jay.

1372
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,583
Look at me. Look at me.

1373
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:45,583
Come here.

1374
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:54,791
Come here, baby. Come here.

1374
01:41:55,305 --> 01:42:55,366
