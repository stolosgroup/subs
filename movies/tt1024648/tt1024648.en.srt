00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,007
<i>This is the Persian empire...</i>

3
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,377
<i>known today as Iran.</i>

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,343
<i>For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>

5
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,053
<i>known as shahs.</i>

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,726
<i>In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh...</i>

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,266
<i>a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,691
<i>He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...</i>

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,823
<i>returning Iran's oil to its people.</i>

10
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,781
<i>But in 1953...</i>

11
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,574
<i>the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'יtat that deposed Mosaddegh....</i>

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,743
<i>and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.</i>

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,505
<i>The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>

14
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,550
<i>His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,634
<i>while the shah had his lunches flown in
by Concorde from Paris.</i>

16
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,466
<i>The people starved.</i>

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,972
<i>The shah kept power
through his ruthless internal police:</i>

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,890
<i>The SAVAK.</i>

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>An era of torture and fear began.</i>

20
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...</i>

21
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,117
<i>enraging a mostly traditional
Shiite population.</i>

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,080
<i>In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.</i>

23
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,212
<i>The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.</i>

24
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:11,174
<i>It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>

25
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,147
<i>Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U.S.</i>

26
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,732
<i>The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...</i>

27
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,488
<i>demanding that the shah be returned...</i>

28
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,990
<i>tried...</i>

29
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,276
<i>and hanged.</i>

30
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,288
<i>Based on a true story.</i>

31
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,326
U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

32
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,481
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

33
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,939
Windows are supposed to be bulletproof, right?

34
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,150
Well, they've never been tested.

35
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,780
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

36
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,740
We can process your visa.

37
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,127
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

38
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,506
They're over the walls.

39
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,418
We should all split.
I'm gonna close up my office.

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,405
Oh, my God.

41
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,530
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

42
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,196
- Can anyone hear me? We need help.
- I need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

43
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,036
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

44
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,041
There was a breach.

45
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,873
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

46
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,789
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

47
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,852
Let's get a cart over here.
Burn it all. Come on.

48
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,893
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

49
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,107
<i>Don't fucking shoot anybody.</i>

50
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,993
<i>You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.</i>

51
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,949
<i>They need an hour to burn the classified.</i>

52
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,993
I need you to hold.

53
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,205
If you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

54
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,096
I'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

55
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,850
- Okay, we need to make a decision--
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

56
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,478
No, the police aren't coming.
It's been 45 minutes.

57
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,640
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

58
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,150
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

59
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,653
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

60
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,987
The prime minister may come tomorrow, but the Komiteh
are here today. So we have to evacuate.

61
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,243
Look at me. No one is coming.

62
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,447
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

63
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,958
Get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
Go, now!

64
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,039
Tear gas as a last resort only.

65
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,545
<i>I repeat: only if your life is under threat.</i>

66
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,124
In here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

67
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,846
- It's on American soil--
- I'm not going out into that.

68
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,208
They're not safe here.

69
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,344
If they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

70
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,426
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

71
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,341
- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.

72
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

73
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,062
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

74
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,693
To reason with them.

75
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,431
Open the door!

76
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,307
Open the fucking door!

77
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,020
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,273
Let me in! Let me in!

79
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,733
Burn it all. Come on.

80
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,652
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

81
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,583
All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.

82
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,544
Not gonna shred fast enough.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,258
Grab the visa plates!

84
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,887
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

85
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,839
When in doubt, just shred it!

86
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,969
We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

87
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,526
Get the shredder.

88
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,235
There are no police.

89
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,080
Jesus.

90
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,039
Leave the building, go now.

91
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,296
Iranians go first.

92
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,081
Now, hurry!

93
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:56,518
Who has made this?!

94
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,484
It's done. They're in.

95
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,133
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

96
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,846
This way. Up here to the left.

97
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,733
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

98
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,304
You think the Soviets would put up with this shit?
They'd fucking invade.
STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

99
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,057
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

100
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,435
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

101
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,642
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

102
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,965
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

103
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,228
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

104
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:27,069
- Come in.
- <i>It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.</i>

105
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,401
- <i>I was told five.</i>
- <i>No, sir, apparently it's six.</i>

106
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:33,059
- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped the embassy.
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

107
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,237
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.

108
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,124
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

109
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,080
Yes. Is White House joining?

110
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,835
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

111
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,452
We wish it was.

112
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,134
CI's got three people over there,
they don't see a revolution coming?

113
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,298
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

114
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,087
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

115
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,381
They're sticking.
No release till we expel the shah.

116
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,596
- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

117
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,181
We took him in. He's ours now.

118
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,813
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

119
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,532
No, just the pricks on our side.

120
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,231
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

121
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,567
they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

122
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,233
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

123
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,278
We've got 60 in the embassy
with guns to their heads right now.

124
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,243
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

125
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,578
Banisadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours.

126
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,664
We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.

127
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,085
All right, let's get to it.

128
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,756
<i>So far official comments about the incident
have been a model of restraint.</i>

129
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,901
69 DAYS LATER

130
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...</i>

131
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,123
<i>blamed for one murder of a
half-dozen followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

132
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,044
<i>It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.</i>

133
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,885
<i>This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.</i>

134
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,127
<i>There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

135
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,063
<i>In this country, George Meany died last night.
He was 85 years old.</i>

136
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,520
Yeah.

137
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,194
Yes.

138
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,647
What?

139
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,824
<i>To begin with, of course...</i>

140
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,658
<i>we wanted to learn about the hostages held
in the American embassy compound.</i>

141
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,199
<i>They may not understand what their ordeal
means to their countrymen.</i>

142
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,663
<i>But this nation, their nation, is outraged.</i>

143
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,817
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>

144
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,684
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

145
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,928
<i>Actions of Iran have shocked the civilized world.</i>

146
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,889
<i>Our embassy has been seized...</i>

147
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:05,054
<i>and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>

148
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,224
<i>The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>

149
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,610
<i>NBC's situation in Iran has changed, however.</i>

150
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,363
- Is he back there?
- Office.

151
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,285
What happened?

152
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,250
The six of them went out a back exit.

153
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,912
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

154
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,797
Canadians took them in.

155
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,003
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

156
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,295
They haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house
since it happened.

157
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,680
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

158
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,308
You got Revolutionary Guards going door-to-door
like Jehovah's Witnesses.

159
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,767
Half of them think that Khomeini's been too lenient
on the ones in the embassy.

160
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,397
What about the White House?

161
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,183
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

162
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,397
The Canadians are done.

163
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,234
They say they're bearing too much risk.
Their foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...

164
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,946
and told him she wants the six of them out.

165
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,657
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

166
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,538
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

167
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,575
- on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

168
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,914
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

169
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,127
But now the bastards are using sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

170
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,010
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

171
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,761
And they'll know what they look like.

172
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,298
Standing room only for beheadings in the square.

173
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,059
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

174
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,353
State?

175
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

176
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,442
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

177
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,648
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

178
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,532
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

179
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,692
State wants the blame,
we'll give it to them.

180
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,494
What does he want me here for?

181
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,452
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

182
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,464
Okay.

183
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,383
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

184
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,419
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

185
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,964
- Bob?
- Thank you.

186
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,802
All right.

187
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,850
Mark and Cora Lijek.

188
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,434
<i>Twenty-nine and 25.
He's a consular officer, she's an assistant.</i>

189
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

190
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,316
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

191
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,858
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attachי from Idaho.

192
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,822
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

193
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,204
<i>He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

194
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,952
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

195
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

196
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,251
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

197
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,254
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

198
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,713
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

199
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,424
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

200
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,180
<i>oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

201
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,218
They're in hiding at the
Canadian ambassador's residence.

202
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,183
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

203
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,442
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

204
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,230
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

205
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,739
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

206
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,195
to the crossing near Tabriz.

207
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,237
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

208
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,949
We wait till the weather clears up...

209
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,491
then deliver the six bikes,
provide them with maps to the Turkish border.

210
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,286
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

211
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,422
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

212
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,425
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

213
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,059
Tony.

214
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

215
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,810
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

216
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,351
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

217
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,894
State is handling the op.

218
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,312
I'm sorry, who is this?

219
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,904
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

220
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,660
Sir, if these people can read or add...

221
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,868
pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

222
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,035
It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till spring
so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

223
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,796
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

224
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,925
you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

225
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,927
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

226
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,635
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

227
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,958
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

228
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,601
visas for American journalists.

229
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

230
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,808
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

231
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,102
North American accents
gives us limited options.

232
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

233
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,860
What about English teachers
at the international school?

234
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,697
It's a good idea, but that school's
been closed for eight months.

235
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,486
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

236
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,791
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting crops,
making sure the kids get enough to eat.

237
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,498
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

238
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,796
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

239
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,628
Those kids are black.

240
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,504
Those are African kids.

241
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,887
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

242
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm sure there's some skinny kids in Iran, so....

243
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,726
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

244
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,932
Hold on.

245
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,644
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front of you?
Would you mind taking a look at it?

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,897
What's in this picture?

247
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,313
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

248
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,153
- Snow.
- Right.

249
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,570
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

250
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,333
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

251
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,165
You don't wanna need one...

252
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,171
but when you do,
you don't do it yourself.

253
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,761
You have a better plan?

254
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,176
No, sir.

255
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,350
<i>Whatever the conflicting signals
from Iran today...</i>

256
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,910
<i>and for that matter, every day...</i>

257
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,104
<i>about whether the hostages
will or will not be tried as spies...</i>

258
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,987
<i>the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:</i>

259
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,273
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

260
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,283
--claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

261
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,195
it violates them for all nations.

262
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,195
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

263
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,747
<i>of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the <i>United States' support...</i>
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

264
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,505
<i>has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>

265
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,385
<i>He said if the Americans
try military force to rescue the hostages...</i>

266
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,264
<i>the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>

267
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,389
<i>Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.</i>

268
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,551
<i>Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

269
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,306
<i>An Iranian flag was burned...</i>

270
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,318
<i>when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.</i>

271
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,730
<i>--also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians....</i>

272
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,775
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

273
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,444
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

274
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,204
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

275
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,741
I don't think that justice
is the worst thing.

276
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,706
<i>When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?</i>

277
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,794
<i>They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."</i>

278
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,711
<i>President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam--</i>

279
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,221
<i>Forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>

280
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,551
<i>--a lunatic.</i>

281
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,718
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

282
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,227
He would've been referred to
as a barbarian.

283
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,104
That's why they're saying
that their current regime....

284
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,824
The shah did more for women's rights--

285
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,019
I think you'd better--
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

286
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,414
<i>At one point, the mob
cornered one of the Iranians.</i>

287
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,005
<i>When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>

288
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,961
Just hit him again!</i>

289
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,631
<i>We're not gonna take it any more!
We're sick of it!</i>

290
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,058
<i>America!</i>

291
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,849
<i>Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>

292
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,061
<i>They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>

293
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,447
<i>Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>

294
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,776
<i>Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>

295
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,034
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

296
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:03,949
<i>I'm like the guy screaming on that movie program
in</i> Network, <i>you know? I've had it.</i>

297
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,709
<i>And if need be, I'll bear arms again.</i>

298
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,498
<i>And that's the way it is Wednesday,
January 16th, 1980.</i>

299
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,919
<i>The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

300
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,436
- Hello?
- <i>Buddy man.</i>

301
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,063
I'll get Mom.

302
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,724
I'm looking for you.

303
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,193
<i>Did you do your homework tonight?</i>

304
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,105
- Yeah, it was easy.
- <i>Excellent. What are we watching?</i>

305
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,366
<i>Battle for the Planet of the Apes.</i>

306
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,867
Tell me, what channel is it on?

307
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,281
Five.

308
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,369
All right.

309
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,545
- What'd you do at school today?
- <i>Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.</i>

310
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,963
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

311
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,968
<i>After school I got some baseball cards.</i>

312
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,549
<i>That was fun.</i>

313
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,027
<i>Okay, you know those science-fiction movies?</i>

314
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,817
<i>Star Trek, Star Wars.</i>
They need an exotic location to shoot.

315
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,453
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

316
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,909
Now, imagine this:

317
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,332
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

318
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,996
We put it out there--

319
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,960
The Canadian producers put it out there.

320
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,762
--that we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

321
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,429
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

322
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:47,139
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

323
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,517
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

324
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,728
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

325
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,394
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

326
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,279
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

327
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,281
We already have credentials for the teachers.

328
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,320
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

329
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,528
John Chambers. He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

330
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,665
He's got an Oscar, he did <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

331
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,453
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

332
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,642
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you give me a break?
I can't breathe in this house.

333
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,966
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

334
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,819
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

335
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,231
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

336
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,741
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

337
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,903
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

338
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,917
Some Americans are missing.

339
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,249
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

340
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,339
The numbers don't match.

341
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,422
Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.

342
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,133
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

343
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,047
Yes, sir, it will be done.

344
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,777
We want you to go to L.A.

345
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,406
If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

346
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,279
Don't fuck up.

347
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,907
The whole country is watching you.

348
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,163
They just don't know it.

349
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,587
<i>My creation.</i>

350
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,754
My creation.

351
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,098
What the fuck, Brian?

352
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,474
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

353
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,852
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

354
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,228
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,357
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

356
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,317
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

357
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,077
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

358
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,992
If he could act,
he wouldn't be playing the Minotaur.

359
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,587
Mr. Chambers?

360
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,669
Kevin Harkins.

361
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,972
Hey, Tony.

362
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,280
Watch your head.

363
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,370
What are you shooting?

364
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,417
Monster movie.

365
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,582
Yeah? Any good?

366
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,040
Target audience will hate it.

367
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,709
Who's the target audience?

368
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,464
People with eyes.

369
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,382
Talk to me.

370
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,718
It's an exfil.

371
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,056
From where?

372
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,642
Worst place you can think of.

373
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,182
Universal City.

374
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,732
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

375
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,240
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

376
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,241
They're hiding out in Tehran.

377
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,703
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

378
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,577
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

379
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:44,246
You came to the right place.

380
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,587
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

381
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,751
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

382
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,679
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

383
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,806
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

384
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,558
You'll fit right in.

385
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,940
Let's see.

386
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,983
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

387
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,069
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

388
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,949
Here's your director.

389
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,281
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

390
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,783
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

391
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,792
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

392
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,248
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

393
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,630
who sell prayer rugs and eight-tracks
on La Brea.

394
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,756
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

395
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,091
You need a script. You need a producer.

396
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,425
- Make me a producer.
- No.

397
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,933
You're an associate producer at best.

398
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,641
If you're gonna do a $20 million <i>Star Wars</i> rip-off...

399
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,649
you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

400
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,730
Somebody respectable.

401
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,153
With credits.

402
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,820
Who you can trust with classified information.

403
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,035
Who'll produce a fake movie.

404
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,075
For free.

405
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,175
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

406
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,731
<i>Mazel tov</i>, Lester.

407
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,593
I'd rather stay home
and count the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

408
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,848
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

409
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,689
all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

410
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,444
You want to set up a movie in a week.

411
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,028
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

412
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,693
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

413
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,363
into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal...

414
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,034
and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

415
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,953
Past about a hundred militia at the airport.
That's right.

416
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,873
Right.

417
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,376
Look, I gotta tell you.

418
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,514
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

419
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,140
Sir, the car is here.

420
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,813
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

421
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,025
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for--

422
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,830
We're gonna need a script.

423
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,929
Here, come on, come on, come on.

424
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,259
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

425
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,600
Okay.

426
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,865
I love you.

427
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,786
Sahar, how are you doing?

428
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,255
Fine, thank you.

429
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,712
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

430
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,550
All this time. They never go out.

431
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,652
Sahar knows.

432
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,445
How about <i>The Horses of Achilles?</i>

433
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,077
No good. Nobody does Westerns any more.

434
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,412
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

435
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,620
Hey, Kenny, please.

436
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,160
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

437
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,796
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

438
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,459
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

439
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,255
<i>The cardinal wants all cover options
on his desk Friday morning.</i>

440
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,675
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

441
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,141
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

442
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,853
Fine.

443
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,466
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

444
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,130
Yeah, I'll hold.

445
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,631
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

446
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,552
Women gather, offering ecstatic libations
to the sky gods.

447
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,184
<i>Argo.</i> A science-fantasy adventure."

448
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,566
- It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

449
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,365
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

450
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,025
Why do we need the option?

451
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:05,068
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

452
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,324
Just let me do the talking.

453
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,741
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

454
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,580
but I can handle him.

455
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,038
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

456
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,832
Up like a carny ride.

457
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,045
One month, yeah.

458
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,586
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

459
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,129
He's the money.

460
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:30,392
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

461
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,100
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

462
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,731
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

463
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,392
All right.

464
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,277
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

465
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,566
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

466
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,614
Thank you. Very respectful.

467
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,287
You're finished, Lester.

468
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,697
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

469
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,456
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

470
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,087
They're screaming for sci-fi.

471
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,458
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

472
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,429
Well, what can I say?

473
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,222
Congratulations.

474
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,935
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

475
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,850
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at Trader Vic's,
I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

476
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,733
when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

477
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,986
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

478
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,448
Seems he was attached to star in <i>Zulu Empire...</i>

479
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,825
which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

480
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,079
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

481
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,161
because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

482
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,917
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

483
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,373
so the movie's kaput.

484
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,756
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

485
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,758
and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

486
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,170
So the way it looks to me--

487
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,176
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

488
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,132
--is that you can either sign here...

489
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,303
and take $10,000 for your toilet paper script...

490
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,687
or you can go fuck yourself.

491
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,607
With all due respect.

492
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,443
You really know Warren Beatty?

493
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,362
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

494
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,325
Taco?

495
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,844
Got any kids, Lester?

496
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,052
Yeah. I have two daughters.

497
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,722
You see them much?

498
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,815
I talk to them once a year.

499
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,939
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

500
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,440
I was a terrible father.

501
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,533
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

502
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,995
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

503
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,251
You?

504
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah, I got a son.

505
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,459
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

506
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,047
You're divorced?

507
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,053
Taking time off.

508
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,270
He needs to be, you know...

509
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,475
where he is.

510
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,934
Kids need the mother.

511
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,527
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

512
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,453
<i>Listen.</i>

513
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,995
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

514
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,085
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

515
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,468
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

516
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,761
You don't have it.

517
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,802
We got an office.

518
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,893
We got business cards.

519
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,894
We got a poster.

520
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,104
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

521
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,230
Six people's lives depend on this.

522
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,649
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool these people,
it has to be big.

523
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,819
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

524
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,997
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

525
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,292
If you wanna sell a lie....

526
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,829
You get the press to sell it for you.

527
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,543
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

528
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,680
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

529
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,681
They have costumes and everything.

530
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,595
No, no, no, I can't.
<i>Variety</i> has an exclusive on that.

531
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,935
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

532
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,191
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

533
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,441
Iran.

534
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,196
Look, I can get you in, but you're gonna
have to promise me at least half a page.

535
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,483
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

536
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,174
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

537
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,432
You're doing the reading?

538
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,761
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

539
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,895
Great. I'll call you.

540
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,941
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

541
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,439
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

542
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,271
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

543
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,563
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

544
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,152
Iran with an N?

545
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,908
Yeah. We're very excited.

546
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,364
You ever watch the news?

547
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,279
What does the title refer to?

548
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,623
The <i>Argo.</i> You know, it's the thing.

549
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,534
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece, or what?

550
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,624
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

551
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,633
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

552
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,422
So it's the Argonaut.

553
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,090
No.

554
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,381
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

555
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,639
You don't know?

556
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,267
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

557
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,105
Excuse me. May I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

558
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:55,815
If our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

559
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,732
<i>Argo,</i> by Mary Ann Boyd.

560
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,117
"Fade in on starship landing.

561
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,822
Exterior, bazaar.

562
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,829
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

563
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,669
<i>The people working here
are not diplomats.</i>

564
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,301
<i>In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...</i>

565
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,340
<i>we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

566
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,011
<i>All evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>

567
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,852
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

568
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,642
our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

569
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,527
At this time we want to expose
the hateful acts....

570
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,859
Our world has changed.

571
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,284
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

572
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,528
The ship is turning around.

573
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,204
Fire the thrusters!

574
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,923
He says a gravitational field that strong
will kill anyone.

575
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,327
<i>--were completely unjustified.</i>

576
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,166
<i>They and all others must know...</i>

577
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,874
<i>that the United States of America
will not yield...</i>

578
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,759
<i>to international terrorism or to blackmail.</i>

579
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,639
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

580
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,892
--are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

581
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,554
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

582
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,567
but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

583
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.</i>

584
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,566
<i>Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body."</i>

585
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,575
<i>If we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>

586
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,368
Aboard the <i>Argo</i> lies my hope,
my hero, my husband.

587
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,910
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

588
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,954
<i>You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

589
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:39,003
<i>You wonder where
and how this seemingly</i>

590
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:39,053
<i>endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

591
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,713
<i>What do they want?
They say the question should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

592
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,550
<i>The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.</i>

593
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,993
<i>--Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>

594
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,346
Carter and his government have given asylum
to the worst criminal of all.

595
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,559
<i>For life?</i>

596
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,101
<i>They will remain until the shah is returned.</i>

597
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,896
<i>But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...</i>

598
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,236
<i>leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...</i>

599
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,618
<i>harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

600
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,535
<i>"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...</i>

601
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,545
<i>holding on a single red flower...</i>

602
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,129
as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

603
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,921
Fade to black." The end.

604
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,932
There is it. What'd I tell you?

605
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,055
First shot of the picture.

606
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,647
Argo fuck yourself.

607
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,229
Argo fuck yourself.

608
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,763
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE JANUARY 25, 1980

609
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:26,780
Brace yourself. It's like talking
to those two old fucks on <i>The Muppets.</i>

610
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,533
Aliens and robots?

611
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,449
Yes, sir.

612
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,332
You're telling me that there is
a movie company in Hollywood right now...

613
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,289
that is funded by the CIA?

614
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,082
Yes, sir.

615
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,007
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

616
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,794
You think this is more plausible than teachers?

617
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,340
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

618
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,725
And we think everybody knows Hollywood people.

619
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,431
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

620
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,891
There are only bad options.

621
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,559
It's about finding the best one.

622
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,562
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

623
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,481
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

624
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,695
By far.

625
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,996
The United States government has just sanctioned
your science-fiction movie.

626
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,168
Thank you, sir.

627
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:07,544
I'm required to remind you that if you are detained,
the agency will not claim you.

628
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,379
Barely claim me as it is.

629
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,303
Your "in case of's" good?

630
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,881
It's just Christine.

631
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,761
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

632
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:22,975
No.

633
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,640
They'll kill you long before prison.

634
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,814
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

635
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,158
Studio Six.

636
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,575
We got a green light. Keep the office running
until you hear otherwise.

637
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,167
Argo fuck yourself.

638
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,040
Argo fuck yourself.

639
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,519
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

640
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:11,186
<i>This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.</i>

641
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,224
<i>"We are a nation of 35 million.</i>

642
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,395
And many of these people
are looking forward to martyrdom."

643
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,905
- Hey.
- Hey.

644
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,982
Come to bed.

645
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,155
In five minutes.

646
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,374
You know, she pleaded with me.

647
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,386
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

648
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,923
she begged for us to leave.

649
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,931
She packed our bags, and I said:

650
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,267
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

651
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,693
And all I was thinking was:

652
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,400
"Stay.

653
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,195
This is good for me.

654
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,785
Stay.

655
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,448
Show Newsom you got the balls."

656
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,131
I can't believe I put Kathy in this position.

657
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,051
I think we're gonna die here.

658
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,132
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - JANUARY 27, 1980

659
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,985
"Iran is 100 percent not
in a prerevolutionary state."

660
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,196
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

661
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,360
Can't be right all the time.

662
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,033
Kevin.

663
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,746
When'd you get back?

664
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,167
The shah escaped in a 747...

665
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,712
so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

666
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,918
But you kept busy.

667
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,132
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

668
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,088
It's getting worse.

669
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,224
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

670
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,263
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

671
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,976
When you leave, they match them up...

672
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,517
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

673
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,654
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

674
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,148
If they look.

675
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:51,198
When you land, you should go straight to the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

676
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,827
to kiss the ring.

677
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,210
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

678
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,130
If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused
while they're torturing you.

679
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,055
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

680
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,976
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

681
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,480
Uh, film production. Business.

682
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,655
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

683
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,873
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

684
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:38,127
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

685
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,817
The <i>Times</i> and AP found out six escaped.

686
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,321
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

687
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,277
Somebody with one of the families talked.

688
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,824
Mother of God.

689
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,782
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

690
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,413
He thinks he can get them
to sit on it, for now.

691
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,374
Your guy better get them...

692
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,910
and get the hell out.

693
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,673
<i>The captain has informed us
that we have entered Iranian airspace.</i>

694
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:28,337
<i>We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>

695
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,208
This film crew is just yourself?

696
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,716
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

697
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,717
You like to film at the bazaar?

698
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,052
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

699
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,506
Landmark sites.

700
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,307
I see.

701
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,968
The exotic Orient.

702
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,764
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

703
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,560
You came to us at a complicated time.

704
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,731
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie theaters
in Tehran were showing pornography.

705
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,150
I understand.

706
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,490
The function of this office is purification...

707
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,948
as well as promotion for the arts.

708
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,834
I'll review this for the minister.

709
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,999
Okay. Thank you.

710
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,219
Lester, you're working late.

711
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,304
Till the dawn's early light.

712
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,347
You got stamina, Lester.
I wanna be you.

713
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,398
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

714
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,490
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

715
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,155
Thank you for what you're doing.

716
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,791
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

717
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,869
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

718
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,006
This way.

719
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,855
- These are blank, you know. Stamps....
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

720
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,183
How long?

721
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,191
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

722
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,696
And you'll fly out with them?

723
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,732
Yeah.

724
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,571
There's something you should know.

725
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,029
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

726
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:10,042
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

727
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,214
Hi.

728
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,253
My name's Kevin Harkins...

729
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,931
and I'm gonna get you home.

730
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,010
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

731
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,106
It's theater of the absurd.

732
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,858
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

733
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,146
"Good"? Well, what's the number value of "good"?

734
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,073
Thirty percent chance of being publicly executed?

735
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,781
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

736
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,185
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

737
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,868
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

738
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,706
They accused him of being an American at the airport.
They held him for an hour.

739
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,917
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

740
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,206
That's why I'm here.

741
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,877
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you the whole way.
This is what I do.

742
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,091
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

743
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,923
This would be a first.

744
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,019
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

745
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,681
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

746
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,608
just for having American names
in their phone books.

747
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,235
You've been here an hour.

748
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,817
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr...?

749
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,323
Harkins.

750
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,321
That's your real name?

751
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,156
No.

752
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,913
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

753
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,127
But it is time to go.

754
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,209
We've got orders to close the embassy and go back.
There's nowhere for them to stay.

755
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,432
We will never make it through immigration
at the airport. I'm serious.

756
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,514
No, no, no, this is what, the part when we say
this is so crazy it might actually work?

757
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,520
Joe, I saw it in Burma.
They get people out.

758
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,933
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

759
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,146
That's your opinion, Joe.

760
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,481
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

761
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:47,108
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

762
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,823
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

763
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,115
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

764
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,875
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

765
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,583
That man out there has got bad cards
and he is going to lose.

766
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,046
And if he loses, it's our lives.

767
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,335
And his life too.

768
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,677
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

769
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,056
We gotta go.

770
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,025
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

771
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,733
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

772
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,819
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

773
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,073
And then add to that.

774
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,657
Where do you vacation? What are your allergies?
Who'd you have an affair with?

775
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,991
The only way this works...

776
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:37,829
is if you believe that you're these people so much
that you dream like them.

777
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,502
Get started tonight.

778
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,207
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

779
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,513
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

780
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,048
What's your name?

781
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,555
Mike McEwan, eh?

782
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,057
That was convincing.

783
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,893
Kathy, what's your name?

784
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,094
The Love Boat <i>will be seen
15 minutes from now.</i>

785
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:35,053
<i>The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...</i>

786
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:39,311
<i>will not divert the attention of the United States
from the plight of the hostages.</i>

787
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,188
<i>--is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant....</i>

788
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,853
<i>Now the United States finds itself
in such bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...</i>

789
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,862
<i>over that country's invasion of Afghanistan....</i>

790
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,486
<i>The United States is now moving
toward a decision...</i>

791
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,697
<i>to boycott the Summer Olympics in Moscow....</i>

792
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,081
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

793
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,577
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

794
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,735
<i>"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.</i>

795
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,824
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

796
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,581
at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar
tomorrow at 3 p.m."

797
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,621
They called your bluff.

798
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,377
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- <i>Absolutely not.</i>

799
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,166
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

800
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,676
Seven Canadians, Jack.

801
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,963
<i>Never give them multiple shots at a cover.</i>

802
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,968
Are they even ready?

803
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,383
They're getting there.

804
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,096
There's no prize for "Most improved."

805
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,978
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

806
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,858
and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up...

807
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,012
when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

808
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,791
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

809
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,879
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

810
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,672
They suspect something?

811
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,591
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

812
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,183
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

813
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,686
We won't do it.

814
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,194
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

815
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,572
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

816
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,858
What else do we have to do, all right?

817
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,573
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...

818
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,410
- which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

819
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,700
Look, we don't have any other choice!

820
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,210
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

821
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,121
We're not in the CIA.

822
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,874
It's suicide.

823
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,134
I'm asking you to trust me.

824
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,716
I don't trust you.

825
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,805
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

826
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,597
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

827
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,857
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

828
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,277
Joe?

829
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,827
So we'll see you at 2.

830
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,772
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

831
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,484
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

832
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,363
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

833
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,691
Sorry. Okay.

834
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,787
Hello?

835
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,953
Hello?

836
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,784
Hello?

837
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,963
Who was that?

838
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,014
- Mark?
- Yeah?

839
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,893
I'm scared.

840
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,473
It's okay.

841
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,525
Where are they?

842
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,031
In the kitchen.

843
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,426
This is what I do. I get people out.

844
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,763
And I've never left anyone behind.

845
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,810
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

846
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,231
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

847
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,146
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

848
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,691
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

849
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,785
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

850
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,878
Fuck.

851
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,329
Shit.

852
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,858
Hang on.

853
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,658
You all right?

854
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,085
Okay. Tell me who you are.

855
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,043
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

856
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,804
Robert Baker, director.

857
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,256
Timothy Harris, location manager.

858
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,425
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

859
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,344
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

860
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,270
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

861
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,978
All right. Let's go make a movie.

862
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,280
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

863
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,825
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

864
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,618
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

865
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,004
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

866
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,664
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

867
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,582
- You are the director?
- Yes.

868
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,218
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

869
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,424
Sorry?

870
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,056
A film where a foreign bride
comes to Iran...

871
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,765
but she doesn't understand
the language or the customs...

872
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,476
and there is misunderstandings and laughs.

873
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,106
Oh, no.

874
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,784
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

875
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:00,535
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

876
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,918
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

877
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,621
precious metals, all right here.

878
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,004
Right this way, please.

879
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,754
This way.

880
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,149
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

881
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,487
If I was to say you're looking through the wrong end
of that viewfinder, would I be right?

882
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,369
Yup.

883
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,703
Just a little further.

884
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,945
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

885
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,505
He wants the photograph you took.

886
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,766
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

887
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,179
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

888
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,019
That's okay.
You can tell him he can have it.

889
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,401
Please, please, just take the photograph.

890
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,354
Peace be upon you.

891
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,780
And upon you, sir. Welcome.

892
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,199
I hope you are well.

893
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,038
Thank you very much. How are you?

894
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,620
I'm very well. What's your name?

895
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:12,958
Sahar.

896
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,139
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

897
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,189
No, no, no! No! Canada!

898
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,402
Canada!

899
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,863
I would like to suggest
that we end our visit.

900
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,293
You know, sister...

901
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,457
those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

902
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,170
But stern against the Kufar.

903
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,214
As God wills it.

904
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,057
But those who sit silently have sinned.

905
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,510
How else may I help, sir?

906
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,021
No, no, just one thing.

907
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,517
How long have they been here?

908
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,814
Pardon?

909
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,861
The guests of the Ambassador.

910
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:23,182
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

911
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,702
They arrived two days ago.

912
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,208
Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

913
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,371
Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

914
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,373
How'd it go?

915
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,618
What about tomorrow?

916
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,500
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

917
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,714
<i>For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...</i>

918
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,925
<i>one week after humiliation in Illinois.</i>

919
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,385
<i>I love New York.</i>

920
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,306
<i>And I love Connecticut too.</i>

921
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,096
<i>How did he win here?
Well, he had help.</i>

922
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,893
<i>I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.</i>

923
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:44,109
A man in Scranton is placing a flag in his lawn
for every day of captivity.

924
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:48,235
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

925
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,199
The six with the Canadians are coming out.

926
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,841
Who signed off on this?

927
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,799
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

928
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,258
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

929
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,423
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

930
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,012
Some Komiteh guard is actually gonna know that?

931
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,975
If you're detained for questioning,
they will bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

932
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,358
Mary, who were the last three
prime ministers of Canada?

933
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,311
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

934
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,150
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

935
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,064
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

936
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,484
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

937
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,402
What's your date of birth?

938
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,742
February 21st, 1952.

939
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,869
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

940
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,785
- Associate. Last movie you produced?
- <i>High and Dry.</i>

941
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,453
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

942
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,963
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

943
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,840
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

944
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,297
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

945
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,591
You have to know your rיsumי
back to front.

946
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:57,103
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

947
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:01,186
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

948
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,565
Okay.

949
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,745
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

950
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,375
You have a call.

951
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,349
What is it?

952
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,604
Go to black on green.

953
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,399
Go.

954
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,026
- <i>It all just changed.</i>
- What?

955
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,779
- <i>They're calling the game. You gotta come back.</i>
- What?

956
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,657
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

957
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,365
<i>Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.</i>

958
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,404
<i>So if the six of them...</i>

959
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,200
are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

960
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,754
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed them
if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

961
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,631
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

962
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:12,546
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

963
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,386
Six Americans get pulled out of a
Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

964
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,472
it's a world outrage.

965
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,604
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

966
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,436
with the CIA at the airport and executed?

967
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,479
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

968
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,279
We're responsible for these people.

969
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:38,075
What we are is required to follow orders.

970
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,323
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

971
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,084
Fuck!

972
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,970
Come in.

973
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,186
Ready to try again.

974
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,183
You're ready. You worked hard.

975
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,229
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

976
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,526
just to relax.

977
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,403
Okay.

978
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,409
You did good.

979
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,616
Thanks.

980
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,299
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

981
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,847
Nothing gets left.

982
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,393
So you know.

983
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,983
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

984
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,152
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

985
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,702
It was always a fucked mission.

986
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,663
You came closer than anybody else.

987
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:15,621
<i>If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break</i>

988
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:30,021
<i>When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay</i>

989
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,988
It's off. They want us to pack up the office.

990
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,816
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

991
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,056
He's late.

992
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,528
O'Donnell.

993
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:26,943
<i>Somebody's responsible...</i>

994
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,952
when things happen, Jack.

995
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,158
I'm responsible.

996
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,957
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

997
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:48,302
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm
those seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

998
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,762
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

999
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,677
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1000
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:56,848
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1001
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,813
Carter's gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

1002
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,827
It's time to go.

1003
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,210
All right.

1004
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,756
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1005
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,043
Pull him out.

1006
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,177
Pull him out!

1007
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,260
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

1008
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,432
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1009
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:37,517
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1010
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,101
Sahar will be fine.

1011
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1012
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,520
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1013
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,778
Good.

1014
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,575
<i>N.E. said no.</i>

1015
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:55,410
<i>This is not a long leasher, and it never has been,
and you don't decide if it goes!</i>

1016
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,789
It is going!

1017
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,951
Jack, you are this close.

1018
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,994
Am I? Am I really that close?

1019
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,129
You are this goddamn close to the line with me.

1020
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,838
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1021
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,470
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1022
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:20,188
Get to your plane, Claude.

1023
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,657
First time anyone's gonna ask you a question
is at the first checkpoint.

1024
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,819
<i>The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.</i>

1025
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,994
<i>Passports came straight from Ottawa last week.
They're clean.</i>

1026
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,250
Find the White House chief of staff.

1027
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,501
How would I find him?

1028
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,664
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1029
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,759
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1030
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,669
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1031
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,430
<i>It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.</i>

1032
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,016
<i>They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.</i>

1033
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,973
<i>You'll say you don't know what happened.</i>

1034
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,059
<i>And if you believe they lost the white slip...</i>

1035
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,398
<i>they'll believe it too.</i>

1036
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,361
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1037
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,356
Where are his kids?

1038
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,569
What?

1039
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,279
Where do his kids go to school?

1040
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,787
Thank you, thank you.

1041
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,203
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1042
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:28,628
White House.

1043
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,387
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1044
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,889
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1045
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,267
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1046
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,016
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1047
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,805
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1048
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,683
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1049
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,103
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1050
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:01,994
Hello?

1051
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,955
- <i>Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.</i>
- Wait, wait, who?

1052
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,917
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1053
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,174
<i>They are going to be captured.</i>

1054
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,458
David, pick up!

1055
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,650
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1056
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,494
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1057
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,957
Telex on flash.

1058
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,964
Would you mind checking again, please?

1059
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,384
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1060
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,490
My apologies. It just came through.

1061
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:26,875
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1062
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,707
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1063
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,998
We told them to shut that down.

1064
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,533
There you go.

1065
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,801
Not here.

1066
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,779
When did you come to Iran?

1067
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,119
Two days ago.

1068
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,955
What was the purpose of your visit?

1069
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,628
We are looking for locations for a film.

1070
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,511
We have a--

1071
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:48,551
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1072
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,720
If you want to take a look at that.
All right?

1073
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:13,955
You can go.

1074
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,174
Come on, come on.

1075
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:42,154
<i>Swissair Flight 363 is now boarding
Rows 18 to 35.</i>

1076
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,807
We're going to....

1077
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,056
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1078
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,643
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1079
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,303
They should have boarded already.

1080
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,062
Still no answer in L.A.

1081
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,293
Sir.

1082
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,803
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1083
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,687
Here you can see our notices.

1084
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,852
Of course I speak Farsi.

1085
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,238
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1086
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,466
No, I'm the writer.

1087
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,543
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1088
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,177
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1089
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,014
Alien villains have taken over
the hero's planet.

1090
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,350
They fight for their families
and take back the city.

1091
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:27,862
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1092
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,023
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1093
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:39,199
The people-- hold that-- the people are inspired to join him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1094
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,749
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1095
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:52,211
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1096
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,514
You don't go until we verify.

1097
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,107
I understand.

1098
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,443
Sir, you can call our office.

1099
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,948
They'll verify.

1100
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,095
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1101
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,098
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

1102
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,852
<i>Swissair announces final boarding
for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

1103
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,561
Reset! We're back to one.

1104
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,696
- <i>All right, reset.</i>
- We're going again!

1105
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,859
- We're just right at the Producers--
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1106
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,323
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

1107
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,617
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

1108
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,114
Sir!

1109
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,040
Studio Six Productions.

1110
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,381
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1111
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:43,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

1112
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,782
<i>Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

1113
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:14,253
We can go.

1114
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:25,636
You keep these. It's a gift.

1115
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,289
Miss.

1116
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,912
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1117
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,585
Swissair 363, you are number two for departure.

1118
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:18,772
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight deck,
we are number two for takeoff.</i>

1119
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:58,891
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

1120
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,851
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1121
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:11,213
We got wheels up.

1122
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:12,798
Wait.

1123
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,066
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...</i>

1124
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:34,949
<i>that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.</i>

1125
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,447
<i>I love you.</i>

1126
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:24,587
They're clear.

1127
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,452
Yes! Yes!

1128
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,455
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1129
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,793
Yeah, man.

1130
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,966
They're out!

1131
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:37,345
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

1132
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:41,799
They're out!

1133
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,805
Yes!

1134
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:50,145
Great work, boys.

1135
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,308
We did it!

1136
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,494
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

1137
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,878
<i>We made history tonight.</i>

1138
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:57,383
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1139
01:44:57,917 --> 01:44:59,544
Quote's the other way around.

1140
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:02,714
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1141
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:04,678
Groucho said that?

1142
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,723
Call the <i>Times,</i>
nail it to the goddamn door.

1143
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,607
CIA are the good guys.

1144
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,609
The Canadians are the good guys.

1145
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:17,486
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1146
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:22,735
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1147
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,410
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1148
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,155
No CIA.

1149
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:29,911
Is that right, Jack?

1150
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:33,794
Involved in what?

1151
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:37,290
We were as surprised as anybody.

1152
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,969
Thank you, Canada.

1153
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,843
<i>We knew that each day they stayed there...</i>

1154
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,679
<i>the danger was becoming greater.</i>

1155
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:51,933
<i>We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.</i>

1156
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,770
<i>Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.</i>

1157
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:58,732
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford...

1158
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:01,651
Kathy Stafford...

1159
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,658
Mark Lijek...

1160
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:10,498
<i>We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north...</i>

1161
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:14,911
<i>for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.</i>

1162
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:16,329
Bob Anders.

1163
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,214
<i>Here, or anywhere in the world...</i>

1164
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,966
<i>Canada will pay...</i>

1165
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:26,298
<i>for this violation of the sovereignty of Iran.</i>

1166
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,684
<i>Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.</i>

1167
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,234
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.

1168
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,486
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1169
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,023
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1170
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,658
And I said to her--
Do you know what I said?

1171
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
No, what?

1172
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,204
"Argo fuck yourself."

1173
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,021
All set.

1174
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,353
Thanks a lot.

1175
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:39,370
And I left my autograph book at home.

1176
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,718
His Eminence called me.

1177
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,094
He wants to see you.

1178
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,305
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1179
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,767
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1180
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,812
You're getting the highest award of merit...

1181
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,357
of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1182
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,231
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1183
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:06,568
If they push it a week, I can bring Ian.
That's his winter break.

1184
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:12,411
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1185
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,618
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1186
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,252
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1187
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:21,875
That's right.

1188
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,091
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1189
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,021
I thought we did.

1190
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,386
Carter said you were a great American.

1191
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,764
Great American what?

1192
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,769
He didn't say.

1193
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:52,360
What happened to your picture?

1194
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:55,203
It's in turnaround.

1195
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,081
Can I come in?

1196
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:30,017
<i>The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on January 20, 1981,
when all remaining hostages were released.</i>

1197

<i>They spent 444 days in captivity.</i>

<i>He and Mendez remained friends

<i>He lives in rural Maryland with his family.</i>

<i>But that it had a very high possibility of failure.</i>

1207
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:38,441
<i>And after it was successful, of course...</i>

1208
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,402
<i>it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...</i>

1209
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:44,990
<i>so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...</i>

1210
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:49,749
