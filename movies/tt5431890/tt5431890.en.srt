00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,010
How do you plead?

10
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:23,148
Guilty or not guilty?

11
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,532
- What?
- The neighbors will hear.

12
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,036
Let's move over.

13
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,544
- Better?
- Better.

14
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:04,320
<i>And what about the
situation of persuading the people?</i>

15
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:05,623
<i>Because it's very,
to put it mildly</i>

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,290
<i>uncomfortable to go to war
with 73% against.</i>

17
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,194
<i>If people are being
asked today do you support a war,</i>

18
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:14,497
<i>my answer to that
is we're not at war today.</i>

19
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:16,734
<i>I think especially,
obviously, if the UN pass</i>

20
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,367
<i>the second resolution,
as I believe they will</i>

21
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,837
<i>if the inspectors carry on
saying he's not cooperating,</i>

22
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,772
<i>I think public opinion
is in a different place.</i>

23
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:25,541
<i>When your correspondent
was saying</i>

24
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:28,145
the war is inevitable,
war is not inevitable.

25
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,913
It depends on Saddam.

26
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,316
If he cooperates
with the inspectors,

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,617
if he says
how much material he's got,

28
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,552
if he cooperates fully
with them,

29
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:37,654
<i>then the issue's over.</i>

30
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,289
<i>But he's not doing that
at the moment.</i>

31
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,091
Bloody liar.

32
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,925
They're all
bloody liars.

33
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,527
You know, actually,
I don't think they are.

34
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,163
I don't think the weapons
inspectors are lying.

35
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,531
<i>This and international
terrorism</i>

36
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,366
<i>are the two
big security threats.</i>

37
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:52,336
- Want coffee?
- No, thanks.

38
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,072
<i>We were told,
we were given to understand</i>

39
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,439
that what these inspectors
were gonna come up with was

40
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,245
evidence of weapons
of mass destruction,

41
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,878
chemical,
biological and nuclear.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,782
What we know is that
he has this material.

43
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,850
Oh, my God, we don't know that.
We don't know that.

44
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:10,320
I mean, he just keeps
repeating the lie.

45
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,656
You sure it's a lie?
Saddam's a psychopath.

46
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:13,956
Yeah, well, just because
you're the Prime Minister,

47
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,793
it doesn't mean you get
to make up your own facts.

48
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,593
<i>Do you think
you have the goods on him now?</i>

49
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:20,195
<i>I've got no doubt at all
that he's developing these weapons</i>

50
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:21,500
<i>and that he poses a threat.</i>

51
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,146
- Be at the cafe by 4:00.
- I can fetch you at 5:00.

52
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,515
No, no, no. I was gonna
get the bus. I love you.

53
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,719
Love you.

54
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,662
Yes.

55
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,997
You know he has a place
in Devon.

56
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,567
He wants to take me
surfing with his dog.

57
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,535
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, it's a great dog.

58
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:00,603
Okay.

59
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,937
When was the last time
you got away?

60
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,507
Oh, don't know,
three or four weeks ago.

61
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,908
We went hiking
in Yorkshire.

62
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,977
Oh. Shall we all
go hiking together?

63
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,079
Yeah, that would be lovely.
With the dog?

64
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,082
Mmm.

65
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,090
Oh!

66
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,362
Oh, thank you.

67
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:26,832
I'm starving.

68
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,634
I've been here
since 5:00,

69
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,435
listening to
a Russian embassy staffer

70
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:34,670
trying to bribe
a North Korean defector

71
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:36,506
who's been downloading
some kinky shit.

72
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:39,543
- Very arousing few hours.
- You're disgusting.

73
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,577
It's for
the Queen and country.

74
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,245
MI6 thought the Korean
was one of ours.

75
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,581
I just proved he's not.

76
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,716
GCHQ, 1. MI6, 0.

Katharine.

78
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,987
I need your Beijing report
for the Foreign Office.

79
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,023
They start trade talks
next week.

80
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,025
Yeah, on it.

Did you get this NSA e-mail?

93
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,552
Are the Yanks really asking
us to dig up personal shit

Powell's gonna
argue for war.

Excuse me.
Question.

Yeah.

107
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:08,858
Uh, this NSA memo,
our people approved it?

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,560
Yes, that's why
it's been forwarded.

109
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,730
The Americans want us to help
them get a UN resolution for war?

By next week?

111
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,736
It's a joint
UK/USA operation.

112
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,206
UKUSA. Right.
Got it.

113
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:30,949
Hey,
ours not to reason why.

114
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,617
Everything good today,
Mrs. Archer?

115
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,651
Yes, thank you. Very good.
Very, very good.

116
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,220
I'll see you again

117
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,224
Yes.

- Hey.

00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,767
You okay?

121
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,834
Yeah, it's been
a long day.

122
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:55,172
I need ten minutes.
Want something to eat?

123
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,208
No.

124

You working
this weekend?

125
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,410
Could we go somewhere,
get out of town?

126
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,480
Sorry, <i>janum,</i>
I'll get next weekend for sure.

127
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,548
<i>A question
for the President if I may.</i>

128
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,687
<i>What is the status, in your
view, of any second resolution?</i>

129
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,288
<i>Is it something
that you think is worth</i>

130
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,259
<i>spending time and energy
trying to assemble?</i>

131
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,994
<i>Just let me
reiterate what I just said.</i>

132
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,865
<i>This is a matter of weeks,
not months.</i>

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,067
<i>Any attempt to drag
the process on for months</i>

134
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,002
<i>will be resisted
by the United States.</i>

135
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,538
- Can we watch something else?
- No, no, this is important.

136
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,307
<i>Secretary
Powell will make a strong case</i>

137
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,546
<i>about the danger
of an armed Saddam Hussein</i>

138
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,682
<i>and he will also talk
about Al-Qaeda links.</i>

139
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,517
Come on, there are
no credible links

140
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,985
between Saddam
and Al-Qaeda.

141
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,820
<i>...really
do portend a danger...</i>

142
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,254
- I'll turn it off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

143
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,355
Please,
I need to watch this.

144
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,724
I need to know
what they're saying.

145
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,926
I mean, yes.
Yes, Saddam is a dictator,

146
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,394
but he is not
a religious nut.

147
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,730
I mean, why would
he risk arming Al-Qaeda

148
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,666
and have them turn against him?
It doesn't make any sense!

149
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,933
Fine, but yelling
at the TV

150
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:59,769
isn't going to make
any difference.

151
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:02,672
They can't bloody
hear you.

152
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,206
- Where you going?
- To read a book.

153
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,509
<i>You see,
my vision shifted dramatically</i>

154
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,010
<i>after September 11.</i>

155
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,379
<i>I realized
the world has changed.</i>

156
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,913
<i>My most important obligation

157
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,083
<i>the American people
from further harm.</i>

158
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,020
<i>And I will do that.</i>

159
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,289
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

160
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,432
- Love you.
- Love you.

161
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,403
Don't forget to check
in at the station.

162
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,236
What are you gonna do?

163
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,573
- I don't know.
- Read a book.

164
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,110
I'll be back
by 7:00 latest.

165
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,363
- Mr. Gun. Signing in?
- Yes, thank you.

166
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,600
When will you know
if you can stay?

167
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,936
They don't say.

168
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,504
Could be weeks.
Could be months.

169
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,505
You never know with
immigration, do you?

170
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,541
- I know.
- Thank you.

171
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,178
Hi, Jasmine, it's Kath.

172
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,312
Uh, are you around today?

173
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:18,349
<i>I'd love to come and see you.</i>

174
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,554
- Kath.
- Hi.

175
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,325
Oh, come here.

176
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:30,559
Hello.

177
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:32,562
Targeting who?

178
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,898
The UN Security Council.

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,265
Particularly
the non-permanent members

180
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,335
who could swing the vote
in favor of war.

181
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,338
Jesus.

182
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,940
Maybe it's time
to quit.

183
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,607
You know, they say
if you stay at GCHQ

184
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:48,277
for more than five years,
you never leave.

185
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,046
I've still got
two to go then.

186
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,880
So you've still
got a conscience.

187
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,220
Are you still organizing
against the war?

188
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,158
Does GCHQ have a problem
with that?

189
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,663
- What? No.
- Give me your phone.

190
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,832
I've already
taken the battery out.

191
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,073
- I called you from a payphone.
- Sorry.

192
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,577
Go on.

193
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,748
I just thought...

194
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,318
...if I could get you
a copy of the memo,

195
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,087
then maybe you could get
somebody to look it over.

196
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:33,355
I don't know,
a journalist,

197
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,325
someone
in the anti-war movement.

198
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,494
Look, if the press think
it's nothing, fine.

199
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,430
At least
my conscience is clear.

200
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,565
Your conscience?

201
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,235
Kat, you're asking me
to collude in a breach

202
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,473
of the Official Secrets Act.
Some call that treason.

203
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,309
I am not trying to overthrow
my government.

204
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:57,447
I just think if someone
in the press saw it,

205
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,916
they might ask more questions
about what the Americans

206
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,754
are asking
this country to do.

207
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,109
Hey, Kat,
they're sending me and Dan to London

208
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,346
to learn Farsi.

209
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,145
Wow, Farsi. Congrats.

210
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,313
- How many languages now?
- Eight.

211
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:33,917
She's a freakin'
super spy.

212
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,817
Andy, where's
my Pyongyang report?

213
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,122
- Ah, one more hour.
- Yeah, just get it done.

214
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,923
- When do you leave?
- Two weeks.

215
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,627
You'll have to
come visit me.

216
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,735
Is that
the Foreign Office report?

217
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,504
- Uh, it's a rough draft.
- Well, finish it.

218
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,139
Defense section
needs extra hands.

219
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,073
I said I'd send you
over there this afternoon.

220
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,277
Okay, will do.

221
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,958
<i>What we're giving you
our facts and conclusions</i>

222
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,762
<i>based on solid intelligence.</i>

223
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:03,633
<i>The issue before us
is not how much time</i>

224
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:06,602
<i>we are willing to give
the inspectors,</i>

225
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:10,005
<i>but how much longer
are we willing to put up</i>

226
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:15,144
<i>with Iraq's non-compliance
before we as a council,</i>

227
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:18,714
<i>we as United Nations
say enough.</i>

228
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:19,785
<i>Enough.</i>

229
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,485
<i>We have first-hand
descriptions</i>

230
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:27,856
<i>of biological weapons factories
on wheels and on rails.</i>

231
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,759
<i>The trucks and train cars
are easily moved</i>

232
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:34,364
<i>and are designed to evade
detection by inspectors.</i>

233
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,466
<i>Although Iraq's
mobile production program</i>

234
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,467
<i>began in mid-1990s,</i>

235
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:42,371
<i>UN inspectors at the time
only had vague hints</i>

236
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,206
<i>of such programs.</i>

237
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,476
<i>Confirmation came later
in the year 2000.</i>

238
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,145
<i>The source was an eyewitness.</i>

239
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,614
<i>An Iraqi chemical engineer</i>

240
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,883
<i>who supervised
one of these facilities.</i>

241
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:54,886
Hi.

242
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:56,887
Hi.

243
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,823
I'm gonna watch some football.
Do you mind?

244
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:01,826
No. Go for it.

245
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:58,548
<i>From the north,
the south, the east and the west,</i>

246
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,450
<i>from the left, the right</i>

247
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,751
<i>from the radical

248
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:04,052
<i>they came.</i>

249
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,090
<i>Well, we can argue forever about
the validity of opinion polls,</i>

250
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,459
<i>but what surely matters today</i>

251
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,028
<i>is that this proposed war
by Britain</i>

252
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,798
<i>is historically unpopular</i>

253
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,067
<i>and the mother of all
focus groups has descended.</i>

254
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,970
Hey, Martin.
We're now doing some real reporting.

255
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,506
It's huge.
Police are saying over 500,000.

256
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,574
Organizers are saying
over two million.

257
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,143
So it will be
a million then?

258
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,844
Well, it's everywhere.
Every country.

259
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,279
Biggest demonstration
in human history.

260
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:33,883
Roger, I filed this story
seven times.

261
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,819
And seven times I have told
you I'm not going to print it.

262
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,420
Ed, this paper
supports the war.

263
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:40,022
Our sources support
the war, Kamal.

264
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,525
All I'm asking is that
mine be given equal time.

265
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,625
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

266
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:44,794
Well,
what do they say, Ed?

267
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,695
That intelligence
is being manipulated

268
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:49,199
to support an invasion that
Bush Junior's been pushing for

269
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,700
ever since Saddam tried
to kill his daddy in '93.

270
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,536
Oh, come on,
your source is retired.

271
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,304
My source is ex-CIA!

272
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:56,771
He talks to agents
every day

273
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,540
and he's talking to me
on the record!

274
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:01,676
Named source! Christ!

275
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,779
If you're gonna encourage
a country to go to war,

276
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,780
perhaps you should spend some
time on the front lines yourself!

277
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,484
- That is a cheap shot, Ed.
- Is it?

278
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,719
We're the press,
for God's sake,

279
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,721
not a fucking PR agency
for Tony Blair.

280
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,625
- That's enough!
- All right!

281
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,659
You, go back
to the States.

282
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,126
I want you to find me
something from a source

283
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:19,728
who hasn't already retired

284
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,564
and then maybe
I'll rethink it.

285
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,165
You're doing a great job of it.
We just need some more.

286
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,969
Yes, Peter.
Fuck you very much.

287
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,237
And fewer words!

288
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,105
If I ask for 500,
don't send me 3,000!

289
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:32,974
This paper needs to take
its finger out of its arse

290
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,577
and stop taking
Tony Blair's press releases

291
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,146
at face fucking value!

292
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,013
- Hear, hear.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

293
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:40,851
- Christ!
- You're too bloody right.

294
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,122
Brighty,
where's my piece

295
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,958
comparing Saddam to Milosevic?
I need 400 words.

296
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,294
Yeah. It's not really
a 400-word topic, Rog.

297
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,329
Yeah, it is. We have a right
to intervene in the Balkans.

298
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,463
We should do
the same in Iraq.

299
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,865
Iraq's a little
more complicated.

300
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,501
- You've got Suni and Shia...
- Oh, fuck Sonny and Cher!

301
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,837
What is this?
"I got you babe?"

302
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,306
Just give me 400 words the
average reader will understand.

303
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,241
Milosevic bad.
Saddam bad.

304
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:09,412
Just write a fucking story.
Stop overthinking it.

305
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,615
All right.

306
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,884
That was helpful.

307
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,688
Just write the piece
as you see it, Martin,

308
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,190
and we'll cut it down later
if we need to, all right?

309
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,124
Okay. Thank you, Peter.

310
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:28,430
Sonny and Cher.

311
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:32,969
Martin Bright.

312
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,804
<i>I've got
something you need to see.</i>

313
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>It's big, Martin, really big.</i>

314
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,644
Yvonne?

315
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,482
Yvonne?

316
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:56,291
Martin. So good to see you.

317
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,426
In an underground
car park?

318
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:01,230
It's a little Deep Throat,
don't you think?

319
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,068
- There's no signal down here.
- Right.

320
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,571
Wait till you see this.

321
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,951
- Who gave you this?
- Can't say.

322
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,421
There's no info
saying who sent it.

323
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,125
This could have been
written by anyone.

324
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,928
- That's who wrote it.
- Well.

325
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,662
Frank Koza.

326
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:36,565
- Who the fuck is Frank Koza?
- NSA.

327
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,867
And this I know
because the letters NSA

328
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,970
have been written on the back
with a leaky ballpoint.

329
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:43,939
My source says
the header wasn't printed

330
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:46,678
to protect the recipients
at GCHQ.

331
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,711
When did you get it?

332
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,114
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

333
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,515
I gave it to <i>The Mirror</i> first.
Sorry.

334
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,785
Jesus. Why didn't
they run it?

335
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,020
- They thought it was fake.
- No shit.

336
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,056
- Is your source NSA?
- No. A friend of the recipient.

337
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:03,459
- A good friend.
- A friend of a friend?

338
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,429
A good friend
of a trusted friend.

339
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,696
I'm sure it's real.

340
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,365
Then why don't you
write the story?

341
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,932
Oh, come on, Martin.

342
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,905
I'm anti-war.
You're with <i>The Observer.</i>

343
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,907
Just check it out.

344
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:33,655
<i>NSA Press Office.
How may I assist you?</i>

345
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:34,923
Yes, hi, hello there.

346
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:37,593
This is Martin Bright
from <i>The Observer</i> in London.

347
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,362
Um, I'd like to arrange
an interview

348
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,029
with Mr. Frank Koza.

349
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,532
May I speak
to his office, please?

350
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:46,669
- <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Bright?</i>
- Martin Bright, yes.

351
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,170
<i>Yes. Who did you wanna get?</i>

352
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,906
Frank Koza, "Chief of Staff,
Regional Targets."

353
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:53,776
<i>Mr. Bright, I'm afraid
we can't confirm</i>

354
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,911
<i>the names of people
who work here.</i>

355
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,446
<i>Could you give me
a little more detail</i>

356
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,080
<i>about the story
you're working on?</i>

357
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:02,451
Uh, well, no. That's something
I need to talk to Mr. Koza

358
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:03,855
about directly, I'm afraid.

359
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:08,557
<i>Well, then I'm afraid
I'm not sure I can help you.</i>

360
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,825
<i>When you have a little
more detail</i>

361
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,394
<i>please feel free to call back.</i>

362
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:13,665
Yeah, well...

363
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,598
Hello?

364
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,402
- You rang the NSA Press Office?
- Yeah.

365
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,536
They have a press office.

366
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,971
I thought that was
a good place to start.

367
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,205
But you didn't
tell them anything?

368
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,607
No, Peter.
I just asked for Frank Koza.

369
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,076
Because if this is real,
you could go to jail

370
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,978
just for having it
in your possession.

371
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,814
I'm not letting this go.
It's too good a story.

372
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,215
I agree,
but if you get it wrong

373
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,417
it will sink you,
it will sink the paper.

374
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,586
I'd like to get a credible
intelligence expert

375
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,321
to offer a view
on the language.

376
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,289
- Yeah.
- And I thought you could run it by

377
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,793
your MI6 contact?

378
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,761
- I don't have a MI6 contact.
- Sorry.

379
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,831
I meant your
tennis club friend.

380
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:49,964
Sure.

381
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,799
I'll take it
to Admiral Wilkinson.

382
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,634
Be careful.
Before we risk

383
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,470
a D-notice
against publication

384
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:59,275
I'd actually like confirmation
that Frank Koza exists.

385
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,742
Do you think
it's authentic?

386
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,478
Well, certainly
the words he used,

387
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,180
"TOPI," for example,

388
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,981
few outside
of the security apparatus

389
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,249
would know
what that means.

390
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:08,384
What does it mean?

391
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,452
Target of
primary interest.

392
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:13,922
And this term,
"QRC surge effort,"

393
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:15,457
that's NSA military speak

394
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,228
for significant intensification
of surveillance operations.

395
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,196
And this, where they ask
for "valuable information

396
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:26,301
"from accesses
in your product lines..."

397
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:29,438
...product lines
are intelligence sources.

398
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,739
So it's been
written by someone

399
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,374
who's familiar
with security speak

400
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,409
but that doesn't mean
it's definitely NSA.

401
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:36,979
True, but there are no
obvious amateur mistakes.

402
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:39,751
- Have you heard of Frank Koza?
- No.

403
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,453
Paul, if we, if we wanted
to confirm that he exists...

404
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:47,789
Oh, sorry.
I couldn't help you do that.

405
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,090
Yeah, but if we wanted
to confirm that he...

406
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,862
Well, my own sources
wouldn't ever trust me again.

407
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,031
Understood.

408
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,665
Understood.

409
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,903
- What?
- <i>Ed, Martin Bright.</i>

410
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:04,173
Martin, Christ,
I just got back to DC.

411
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,807
Sorry, Peter and I
have something urgent

412
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:06,909
that we'd like to run by you.

413
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:08,943
Are you on speaker?

414
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,412
We are now. Hey...

415
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,414
Peter, you need to tell Roger
to publish what I'm filing.

416
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,419
This paper can't be seen
to be supporting a war

417
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,287
that we should be doing
everything in our power

418
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,521
to expose as a con.

419
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,891
<i>A neocon.
A giant fucking con!</i>

420
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,992
Ed, that's why we're phoning.
We need your help.

421
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:26,429
We have something
that might corroborate

422
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,266
these things,
you could say.

423
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:40,107
Hey. Sorry.

424
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,711
- Do you wanna get lunch?
- What?

425
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,578
Lunch. Eat.
Now. Yes.

426
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,281
Oh, no,
I'm fine, thanks.

427
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,551
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

428
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,053
It, um...

429
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,321
This new BBC poll,
it says that less than one in ten people

430
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:57,026
think it's right to attack
Iraq without a UN resolution.

431
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,862
Which is why that memo was sent.
They need to twist arms.

432
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,329
I don't think
it will make any difference.

433
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:03,266
Most of the world
is against them.

434
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:04,569
You wanna eat, eat.

435
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,307
<i>National Security
Agency. How may I direct your call?</i>

436
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,976
Hello, I'm returning
Frank Koza's call.

437
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,477
My secretary said
it was urgent.

438
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,613
<i>I'm sorry.
Who are you trying to reach?</i>

439
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:20,015
Frank Koza.
Mr. Frank Koza.

440
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,749
<i>Sir, I'm sorry,
there's no one</i>

441
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,919
<i>by that name
in the directory, sir.</i>

442
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,355
Oh, well, then that's odd.
He called me.

443
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:31,359
<i>I'm sorry, but I'll need
an extension number.</i>

444
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,228
<i>Do you have
an extension number?</i>

445
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,497
Ah...

446
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,365
Nah.

447
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,834
<i>Is there anything else
I can do for you?</i>

448
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:40,736
No. No.

449
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:41,903
Thank you. Thank you.

450
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,438
<i>You have a nice day, sir.</i>

451
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,442
You too.

452
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,375
Fuck off.

453
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:51,247
So I read the weapons
inspector's report.

454
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,115
Oh, congratulations.

455
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,284
That's more
than most MP's ever done.

456
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,185
- Well, shit, that's depressing.
- Mmm-hmm. It is.

457
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,422
Look, there are a few
pre-98 chemical weapons

458
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,391
we have yet to be accounted
for but inspectors said

459
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,058
they found absolutely
no evidence

460
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,394
of an active chemical
or biological program.

461
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:07,462
Correct.

462
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,529
And yet Colin Powell presented

463
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:10,164
clear evidence of mobile labs.

464
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,602
His evidence may be based
on poor human intel

465
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,237
from an Iraqi dissident.

466
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,105
Really?

467
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,205
The dissident
isn't our product

468
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:19,076
and should not be seen
as our product.

469
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,213
Whose product is he then?

470
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:27,415
Look, Peter,
I didn't say this,

471
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,951
but there is concern
in certain quarters

472
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:33,122
that intelligence
may be being manipulated

473
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,024
to take this country to war.

474
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,959
So why don't you tell
your journalists

475
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,161
to stop being so bloody loyal
to Downing Street

476
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,098
and start doing their job?

477
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,068
Okay.

478
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,705
Okay, what if I had
evidence that the NSA

479
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,742
requested GCHQ to help
monitor private communications

480
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,076
of the UN Security Council
delegates?

481
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:57,880
- To what end?
- Bluntly?

482
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,082
To blackmail them
into voting for war.

483
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,717
I'm not with GCHQ.

484
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,551
You're MI6,
you're on the same team.

485
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:04,618
How did you
hear about this?

486
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,421
A UN resolution for war

487
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,891
would cover everyone's arse,
wouldn't it?

488
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,792
No more asking your team
to sex up evidence of WMDs

489
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:14,930
or the back-dodgy claims that
Britain was about to be attacked

490
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,965
by Iraq within 45 minutes.

491
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,067
And no chance of anyone
being charged with a war crime

492
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,004
if it all goes tits up.

493
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:23,838
What are you
asking me, Peter?

494
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,909
I'm asking
if you can confirm

495
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,546
whether the NSA
instructed GCHQ

496
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,617
to assist in spying on
Security Council delegates?

497
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,318
You know I can't
answer that.

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,954
To do so would put me in breach
of the Official Secrets Act.

499
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,459
To deny it would not.

500
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:48,266
Well, I can neither confirm
nor deny.

501
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,471
Okay.

502
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,740
Let's play.

503
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,277
- Change ends, idiot.
- Yes.

504
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,611
Your serve.

505
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,614
So the head of the CIA
tells Bush it's a slam dunk

506
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:08,782
that Saddam has weapons
of mass destruction.

507
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,685
- A slam dunk.
- Yes.

508
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,654
- And that's not true?
- No.

509
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:15,289
Meaning Saddam definitely
does not have weapons

510
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,459
of mass destruction
or he may not.

511
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:21,028
Meaning the intelligence
is sketchy at best

512
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,798
and manufactured at worst.

513
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,999
And Tenet knows that?

514
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,702
I've no doubt he knows that.

515
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:29,871
I was with
the agency 24 years.

516
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:33,541
I can tell you, folks over there
are really angry about this.

517
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:35,277
Why?

518
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,510
Why?

519
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,513
Because the majority
of the analysts do not believe

520
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,618
it's a slam dunk,
but no one wants to hear that.

521
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,352
Not even the press.

522
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:47,088
- Sorry, Mel.
- I'm sorry.

523
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,658
I'm just mad as hell.

524
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,993
Listen, I wanted
to talk to you today

525
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:55,897
because I think I might finally
be onto something that...

526
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,968
...that really support what
you've been saying for months.

527
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,440
I need to talk to a man
called Frank Koza.

528
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,375
He's NSA.

529
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,280
Head of Regional Targets.

530
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,817
You know him?

531
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,085
I'm sorry, Ed.

532
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,589
I can't give out
that kind of information.

533
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,412
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

534
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,880
- I didn't wanna call.
- How long have you been here?

535
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,548
We're not supposed
to be meeting.

536
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,482
I know, I've just...

537
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:51,019
I've been following the news
and I haven't seen

538
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,688
or heard anything
for three weeks.

539
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,155
Okay, well,
I've given it to my contact

540
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,857
and apparently,
she's having a very hard time

541
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,463
getting the papers to
believe that it's not a fake.

542
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,233
Oh, uh...

543
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:05,800
Well, maybe that's okay.

544
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,001
You know, I...

545
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,170
Look, I mean,
all of the polls said

546
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,471
everyone's against
the war, anyway

547
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,874
and I, and I've
just been thinking...

548
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,109
Look, I think
that I acted too rashly

549
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:16,444
on impulse.
I didn't think...

550
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,113
Jesus, Katharine,
is it a fake?

551
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,615
Of course it's not a fake.
It's real.

552
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,083
Well, then just go home!

553
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,419
Okay, don't talk about this
to anyone, ever!

554
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:25,490
Just...

555
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:30,261
- Sorry.
- It's out of our hands now.

556
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,330
Sorry.

557
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,400
The truth is,
the whole document could be a fake.

558
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:41,135
But we're satisfied
the language used is real.

559
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,772
- It's fascinating.
- Yeah.

560
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,942
Is this document actually
in your possession?

561
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:50,211
Well, if it were, I'd be in
breach of the Official Secrets Act

562
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:51,645
wouldn't I?

563
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:55,049
So based on what might be
in this document...

564
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,652
- That you don't have.
- That I don't yet have.

565
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,319
But that you want
to print in your paper.

566
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,654
If you don't issue a
D-notice against publication.

567
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,156
Well, which I will
most certainly do

568
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:04,392
if I think the publication
might in any way

569
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,294
endanger the lives
of British people

570
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:08,096
or British forces.

571
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,897
- Understood.
- Good.

572
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:12,703
Go on.

573
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,003
Would you say
it were likely real

574
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,039
or a forgery?

575
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,241
What do you think?

576
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,176
I think it could be a fake

577
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,548
put out
by the anti-war movement...

578
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,584
...or by a foreign agency
to embarrass the US.

579
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,720
- Which agency?
- The Russians.

580
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,355
I mean, the French
oppose the war, too,

581
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:34,823
but I don't think
they'd do this.

582
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:37,491
I think you might be
overthinking it as usual, Martin.

583
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:40,530
- Meaning?
- You tell me.

584
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,868
Well, meaning it could be
exactly what it says it is.

585
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,505
You know, Martin,
I believe that all information

586
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:53,978
collected in the name of the
public should be made public.

587
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:58,113
The only question is, when.

588
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:02,151
But in this case,
I don't have the luxury of time, Admiral.

589
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,555
Powell just made
a very strong case for war.

590
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,656
Yes, I see.

591
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,561
I have also always believed

592
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,431
that censorship
when called for

593
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,605
should be based
on security issues alone...

594
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,570
...not on whether
a news report

595
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:25,508
might embarrass
a government.

596
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,348
Thank you, Admiral.

597
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:35,584
<i>Ed,
it's Edie from the London office.</i>

598
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,352
<i>I got a weird message for you</i>

599
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,121
<i>from someone
who wouldn't give his name.</i>

600
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,691
<i>He said you should call
extension 6727.</i>

601
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:45,759
<i>Makes no sense to me,
but maybe to you.</i>

602
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:48,529
<i>6727. Good luck.</i>

603
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,931
- 6727.
- <i>Bye-bye.</i>

604
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:53,971
6727. 6727. 6727.

605
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:01,309
6727.

606
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,614
<i>NSA.
How may I direct your call?</i>

607
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:10,285
Hello.
Extension 6727, please.

608
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,086
<i>6727?</i>

609
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:14,021
6727, yes.

610
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,025
<i>One moment.</i>

611
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:18,695
<i>Frank Koza's office.</i>

612
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:22,931
Hello, may I speak
to Mr. Frank Koza, please?

613
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:23,798
<i>Who shall I say is calling?</i>

614
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,334
I can't say.
Just put me through.

615
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,538
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

616
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:30,840
<i>Hello?</i>

617
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,243
Mr. Koza? Mr. Frank Koza?

618
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:37,612
<i>Yes. Who's calling?</i>

619
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,647
Mr. Koza,
my name is Ed Vulliamy.

620
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:42,451
I work for <i>The Observer</i>
newspaper in London.

621
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,990
I wanted to ask you about
a memo you sent to GCHQ.

622
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,095
Mr. Koza?

623
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:58,400
- Do you think this is real?
- <i>Yes, they put me through.</i>

624
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:00,001
- To Frank Koza?
- Yes.

625
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:02,104
And you spoke to him
directly, right, Ed?

626
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,838
<i>Well, we didn't exactly
have a conversation.</i>

627
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,241
Did you speak to him or not?
Yes or no, Ed? Jesus.

628
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:08,442
<i>Yes, but he cut me off</i>

629
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:09,810
<i>when I said I worked
for</i> The Observer.

630
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:12,814
But you're sure that he
exists, right, Ed?

631
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,082
<i>Hell yes, I'm sure!</i>

632
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:17,319
I said, "Mr. Koza?"
He said, "Yes, who's calling?"

633
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,852
All right. Thank you, Ed.

634
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:21,223
Try not to fuck
this one up, Roger.

635
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,091
- Fuck off.
- <i>You're welcome, anytime.</i>

636
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:27,696
- <i>Hitler Diaries.</i>
- What?

637
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,098
I'm just saying it smells of a
forgery like the <i>Hitler Diaries</i>

638
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,167
and, of course,
publishing those cost people their jobs.

639
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,634
Which is precisely
why we're doing

640
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,203
rigorous checking
on this, Kamal.

641
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:38,339
- Who brought you this?
- Friend.

642
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,341
- Someone from GCHQ?
- No.

643
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:41,811
Then who?

644
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,549
- Yvonne Ridley.
- Yvonne fucking Ridley!

645
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,651
The woman who fell off
a donkey in Afghanistan

646
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,319
at some Taliban checkpoint!

647
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:53,120
Her arse over a tit
with a camera up her burka

648
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,388
and then she
converted to Islam

649
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,823
after she was released
by her kidnapper.

650
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,459
None of which means
she's not right!

651
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:58,660
She's anti-war!

652
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:01,162
She probably typed
the fucking thing herself.

653
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:03,665
Martin, you realize the
legal risks we'll be taking?

654
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:04,799
Yes.

655
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:05,966
The last time we
published anything like this

656
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:07,669
you and Roger
almost went to prison.

657
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,238
Jan, the last time
our source claimed

658
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,973
MI6 had funded an attempted
assassination on Gaddafi.

659
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,642
This document
doesn't accuse anyone

660
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,576
of doing anything
remotely like that.

661
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:19,046
No, it merely suggests
that the US government,

662
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:22,616
with the help of Great Britain,
might try to twist arms

663
00:35:22,618 --> 00:35:25,653
and threaten UN delegates
into voting for a war in Iraq.

664
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,792
It's a hell
of a story.

665
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:33,627
Look, we know Koza exists.

666
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:35,830
Beaver says the language
used is authentic.

667
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:37,633
And Wilkinson says
that while publication

668
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,901
may embarrass
both governments,

669
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,701
he doesn't believe
that it poses a security risk

670
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,803
to the British people
or the armed forces.

671
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:44,138
Ironically,
publication may actually

672
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,107
prevent a war
and save lives.

673
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,176
- Well.
- MI6?

674
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:51,581
Would not confirm but did not deny.

675
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,915
Jan, where are we legally?

676
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,817
Wilkinson may not issue
a D-Notice

677
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,220
but that doesn't stop Special
Branch from coming after us.

678
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:02,423
- Thank you.
- Legally, we have a top secret document

679
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:03,693
in our possession.

680
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:09,430
Look, Rog, don't forget

681
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:11,098
we're getting
detailed information

682
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,868
directly
from Blair's office.

683
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,701
- Fuck off.
- Well, he's right.

684
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:17,339
Printing this kind of story
would kill that relationship.

685
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,975
Since when did this paper
prioritize political access

686
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,977
over its own
investigative reporting?

687
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,546
- Yes.
- We have taken a position on this, guys!

688
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,183
We support the war.

689
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,488
Yes. We do.

690
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,120
Fuck.

691
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:35,059
But Peter's right.

692
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,995
This is a fucking good story.

693
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:50,207
Thank you, Roger.

694
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,111
Here we go.

695
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:08,957
Wait, I'll come with you.

696
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,390
I'm just going to go
get some milk.

697
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:11,892
Go back to bed.
I'll bring you a coffee.

698
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:12,929
Okay.

699
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,043
- Hi.
- Morning.

700
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:45,095
Hey.

701
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,138
What's the matter, <i>janum?</i>

702
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:00,711
What's going on?

703
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,484
- Bravo, Martin.
- Ah, there he is.

704
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:11,886
Well done.

705
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,625
- Here he is!
- Nice one, Martin.

706
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,767
Brighty, congratulations.

707
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,270
Bloody brilliant.

708
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,203
- Thank you.
- What have you got for me next?

709
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,240
Every major
European paper is citing us

710
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,810
and we've had calls
in from CNN, NBC, and Fox.

711
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,544
They all want to interview you
for their morning shows

712
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:37,946
when they wake up in the US.

713
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,145
Any response
from Downing Street?

714
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:41,885
We got a call in,
but they're scrambling.

715
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,957
Martin, line 2.

716
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:49,792
Martin Bright.

717
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:53,262
Thank you. Thank you.

718
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:55,330
No.

719
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,701
Uh, no, the person who leaked
it hasn't been identified.

720
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,569
Why'd you do it?

721
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,205
I just thought
that they'd investigate.

722
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,240
I never expected them
to print the whole memo.

723
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:07,542
Why didn't you tell me?

724
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,147
Sorry, I didn't,
I didn't, I...

725
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:12,747
I thought that you would try
and talk me out of it

726
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:13,814
and I didn't want you to.

727
00:39:13,816 --> 00:39:15,482
- My God, <i>janum.</i>
- I'm so sorry.

728
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:16,854
They don't
mention your name?

729
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:22,126
- I haven't told anyone.
- Good. That's good.

730
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,830
That's very kind.
All right, thank you.

731
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:31,466
Why don't you get in touch
with your friend Tony, Kamal?

732
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:34,069
- Ask him if he has an opinion.
- That's not funny, Rog.

733
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,069
- Martin?
- Yes?

734
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:37,305
NBC just canceled
your interview.

735
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:38,375
What?

736
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:42,642
NBC no longer wished
to interview Martin.

737
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:44,979
Did they say why?

738
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,647
They just said sorry,
but they didn't think

739
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,281
they could
fit you in anymore.

740
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:49,417
Really?

741
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,654
Brighty, reporter
from Santiago.

742
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,692
Thank you. Martin Bright.

743
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,825
Ah, uh. No.

744
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,528
At this stage,
we have no idea what information

745
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,263
was gathered from Chile
or any of the other countries.

746
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,529
- Peter.
- Yeah?

747
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:04,732
Fox says that
they have to cancel.

748
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:05,933
What? Why?

749
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,602
Uh, yeah, Mexico
is furious too.

750
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:09,937
Okay.
Thank you.

751
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,404
- Martin?
- Yes?

752
00:40:11,406 --> 00:40:13,142
I've got a producer
from CNN.

753
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,447
Martin Bright.

754
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:20,250
I see.

755
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,454
No. No, no. No, no.
That's all right.

756
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,720
Ah...

757
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:28,024
May I ask why?

758
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,828
Yes, I stand by it.
Of course I stand by it.

759
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,064
<i>The Drudge Report?</i>

760
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,435
Yeah.

761
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,069
All right, okay.

762
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,470
What the fuck is going on?

763
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:01,221
It's fake.

764
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:03,057
We've printed
a fake fucking memo

765
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:05,261
from Yvonne
fucking Ridley!

766
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:13,634
Oh, you fucking idiot.
There. You see it?

767
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:15,303
Because the Americans did.

768
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:18,205
Favourable. F-A-V-O-U-R.

769
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:23,111
Some English cunt has tried
to fake an American NSA memo

770
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,580
and you fucking schmucks
fell for it.

771
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,818
Wait. Martin,
where's the original?

772
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:29,884
Where's the original document?

773
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:31,187
Jesus.

774
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,464
- American spelling.
- What?

775
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,235
The original
has American spelling.

776
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:50,537
And this is
what I filed, see?

777
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:52,173
Favorable. O-R.

778
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:53,908
Just like the original.
Not O-U-R.

779
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,914
And recognize with a Z,
not an S.

780
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:03,319
Who changed what I wrote?

781
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:08,055
Who...

782
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:09,189
Who changed
what I fucking wrote?

783
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,360
Come on, speak up!
Who did this?

784
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:26,309
Nicole,
what did you do?

785
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,512
I, um...

786
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:33,316
I ran it through spell check.

787
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,057
- Spell check?
- Jesus.

788
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,890
That's what I always do.
I'm so sorry.

789
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:45,660
Do not cry, Nicole.

790
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:48,131
Do not fucking cry.

791
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:54,935
Okay, well, we know
that it's not fake.

792
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:57,805
We go online, we explain what
happened, we call all of the networks.

793
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,173
Stop it, Martin.

794
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:01,843
Fuck, Rog, it was
an honest mistake.

795
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,011
Don't be so naive.

796
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:07,247
You're an American editor.
What story do you put out now?

797
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,319
That <i>The Observer</i> is
doubling down on a fake memo?

798
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,053
Or that the staff
of this newspaper

799
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:16,492
are really so
colossally stupid!

800
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:33,042
It's all right.
Would you like a cup of tea?

801
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,663
Someone in this building

802
00:43:55,665 --> 00:44:00,133
has betrayed their government
and their country.

803
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:03,037
Now I'm sure it wasn't
anyone in this division,

804
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,638
but starting today,

805
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,908
Internal Security will be
conducting interviews

806
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,712
with each
and every one of you.

807
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:14,214
If you know anything
or suspect anyone,

808
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:17,917
it is your sworn duty
to speak up.

809
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,388
If you do not
and you are found to have

810
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,790
withheld information
of any kind,

811
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:25,292
you will be charged
with a breach

812
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:28,197
of the Official Secrets Act.

813
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:19,580
You should see the file
that tosser's got on me.

814
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:21,417
- What did he ask you?
- Katharine!

815
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,629
Come in, Katharine.

816
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,966
- Katharine Gun?
- Yes?

817
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:42,671
I'm John from
Internal Security. Please.

818
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,055
Mandarin translator.

819
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,656
GCHQ for two years.

820
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,024
- Yes.
- And before that?

821
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:06,259
I taught English
to Japanese students.

822
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:08,231
- Hiroshima, right?
- Yes.

823
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,897
Interesting.

824
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:13,868
Did you visit the memorial?

825
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,035
The peace memorial?

826
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:17,274
To the people
killed by the atomic bomb?

827
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,808
Yes, actually, I did.

828
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:21,845
It's, uh...

829
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:24,745
It's something
you really have to see.

830
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:26,149
It's very moving.

831
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:31,718
Compels one to think
about the consequences of war,

832
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,888
doesn't it?

833
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,424
- Yes, I suppose it does.
- Are you anti-war, Katharine?

834
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:38,558
No.

835
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,765
Uh, I think
sometimes war is necessary.

836
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:49,002
I see you lived in Taiwan
as a child?

837
00:46:49,004 --> 00:46:51,205
- Yes.
- How long did you live there?

838
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,040
We moved over
when I was three.

839
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:55,308
I came back
to do my A-levels.

840
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,678
So for most
of your childhood then?

841
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,681
Yes.

842
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:00,781
You had
a religious upbringing?

843
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:02,015
No, not particularly.

844
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:03,149
But were you sent away

845
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,386
to a Christian missionary
school in Taiwan?

846
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,419
Yes.

847
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,388
Gave you a clear sense
of right and wrong, did it,

848
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,624
being in a mission school?

849
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,991
I think my parents
gave me that.

850
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,463
Did you leak
the Koza e-mail?

851
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,997
- No.
- No?

852
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,200
No.

853
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:20,700
- But you read it?
- Yes.

854
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:23,270
I mean, it was sent to me,
so I read it.

855
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:25,908
What were your immediate
thoughts after you read it?

856
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:28,709
Nothing much.
It didn't really bother me.

857
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,847
- It didn't?
- No.

858
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,651
Who do you think
might have leaked it?

859
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:42,122
- I have no idea.
- No?

860
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:44,024
- No.
- No?

861
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,227
No.

862
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:49,598
Thank you, Mrs. Gun.

863
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,468
That's all for now.

864
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:00,874
Eat a little.

865
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:01,877
Please.

866
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:07,716
They're bringing everyone in.
One by one.

867
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,756
You haven't said anything?

868
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:15,858
Okay. Just eat a little.

869
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:21,463
Everything
will be all right.

870
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:27,203
Eat.

871
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:37,211
Hi, Fiona, it's Katharine.

872
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,779
Um...

873
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:39,879
I'm so sorry

874
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,450
but I don't think I'm gonna
be able to come in today.

875
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,354
Yeah, I think
I've caught a tummy bug.

876
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:48,358
Yeah.

877
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:51,158
Thank you.

878
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,394
Thank you so much.

879
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:54,964
What'd she say?

880
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,765
She said
I should get some rest.

881
00:48:57,767 --> 00:48:59,265
Good.

882
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,370
- She was nice.
- That's good.

883
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:04,874
Try and sleep.

884
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:09,845
Sorry, I have to go.

885
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,158
<i>...ask you about a
report in</i> The Observer <i>newspaper</i>

886
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,160
<i>in London, a memo</i>

887
00:49:27,162 --> 00:49:30,698
<i>reported to be from a man
who actually works at the NSA</i>

888
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,634
<i>in which he describes
a "surge in surveillance</i>

889
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:37,370
<i>"of UN Security Council
members."</i>

890
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:38,506
<i>What's your response?</i>

891
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,241
Terry, as a matter
of long-standing policy

892
00:49:41,243 --> 00:49:43,509
the administration
never comments on anything

893
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:46,881
involving any people
involved in intelligence.

894
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,582
- No, of course, you don't.
- What the fuck?

895
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:51,651
<i>If you're
a Cameroonian diplomat</i>

896
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:54,087
<i>or a French diplomat
at the United Nations</i>

897
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:55,689
<i>then you're gonna have
to operate on the assumption</i>

898
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:56,857
<i>that the United States
is bugging you.</i>

899
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,493
<i>No, it's a blanket matter
of policy</i>

900
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:02,263
<i>that we do not answer
questions of that nature...</i>

901
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,863
- Hi.
- Hi.

902
00:50:03,865 --> 00:50:06,100
<i>...I'm not indicating to you
whether it's true or not true.</i>

903
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:07,500
Have you eaten?

904
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:10,970
<i>...of policy that predates
this administration.</i>

905
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:14,410
I brought soup. A bean salad.

906
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,912
I'm gonna say it was me.

907
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:21,182
The Americans are refusing to
admit that the memo was real.

908
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,250
- I have to tell the truth.
- No.

909
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:26,520
If I don't, then they'll get
away with saying it was a fake.

910
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:29,624
<i>Janum,</i> you did what you could.
Now leave it alone, please!

911
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,691
What am I supposed to do?

912
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:32,426
Am I supposed
to keep lying forever?

913
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:34,261
If you say nothing,
they can never prove anything.

914
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,129
They are questioning
everyone at work.

915
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:37,296
They're interrogating
my friends.

916
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:38,832
They're asking people
to name names.

917
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:42,201
- That will be over soon.
- And then what?

918
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:43,638
There will be a question mark

919
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,038
in hundreds of people's files
because of me.

920
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,341
They will put you in jail!

921
00:50:48,343 --> 00:50:49,676
I have to prove
it was real.

922
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:50,877
Everyone at work knows that

923
00:50:50,879 --> 00:50:53,113
what the NSA
asked us to do was illegal.

924
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,983
- Nobody cares!
- Well, I care!

925
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:59,185
If I don't say it was me,
then we'll go to war

926
00:50:59,187 --> 00:51:01,488
based on blackmail
and lies.

927
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,626
And I can't live
with that. I won't.

928
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:07,629
<i>Janum,</i> please listen to me.

929
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:09,930
I work at a cafe.

930
00:51:09,932 --> 00:51:11,832
I took the job
because I needed a job.

931
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,667
But it's just a job.

932
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:16,002
You did the same thing,
remember?

933
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,104
When you saw the advert,
you said you didn't even know

934
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:19,842
what the job really was.

935
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,580
It's just a job.

936
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:26,383
And you can get
another job.

937
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:31,984
You just need to keep your
head down for a few more weeks

938
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:33,455
until things calm down.

939
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:36,892
Then you resign,
you can get another job.

940
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:56,780
Hey.

941
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,618
On a diet?

942
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,823
- What?
- No cinnamon bun?

943
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:11,827
Who's in there now?

944
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:15,529
Nuri. Second time.

945
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:17,767
Had him take a lie detector
test yesterday.

946
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:23,772
Mi-Yung!

947
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:23,933
I did it.

948
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,736
It was me.

949
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,941
Oh, Katharine.

950
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,148
Leave us, please.

951
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:34,803
Handbag.

952
00:54:37,305 --> 00:54:38,307
Rings.

953
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:42,311
Necklace.

954
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:46,212
Watch. Belt.

955
00:54:46,214 --> 00:54:48,084
I don't have a belt.

956
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,821
Take her through cell 7.

957
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:11,874
I've found the
passports and a couple of foreign books.

958
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:15,644
Who are you?

959
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,781
Where's my wife?

960
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,683
I want to see her.
Where is she?

961
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:27,053
They can't keep me long.
They haven't charged me yet.

962
00:55:27,055 --> 00:55:28,691
No contact, please.

963
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,330
- Where are they holding you?
- Downstairs.

964
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,736
I'm okay.
I promise I'm okay.

965
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:49,812
I brought this.

966
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,816
It will get cold tonight.

967
00:55:58,287 --> 00:55:59,288
Thank you.

968
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,305
Lights out.

969
00:56:28,283 --> 00:56:30,884
- Katharine Gun?
- Yes.

970
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:34,057
We're from Scotland Yard.
Do you have a lawyer?

971
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:36,055
No.

972
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:38,424
There's a duty
solicitor on call.

973
00:56:38,426 --> 00:56:39,928
She'll sit in with you.

974
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,633
Your supervisor speaks
highly of your integrity.

975
00:56:47,635 --> 00:56:51,971
She says this breach
was a foolish one-off.

976
00:56:51,973 --> 00:56:53,006
Was it?

977
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:55,808
Do you mean if I leaked
anything else? No.

978
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,879
- Do you intend to?
- No.

979
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:01,714
I've always been very proud
to work at GCHQ.

980
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:02,919
Until now.

981
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,586
Yes. Until now.

982
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:08,356
What were you
employed to do?

983
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,761
Well, I can't be specific.

984
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,330
Be general then.

985
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:17,497
I translated signals
intelligence

986
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:18,964
and I reported anything

987
00:57:18,966 --> 00:57:20,935
I thought might be of
interest to my clients.

988
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,836
- Your clients?
- The Foreign Office.

989
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:24,037
The Ministry of Defense.

990
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,073
So, you work
for the British Government.

991
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,941
- No. Not really.
- No?

992
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:30,843
Governments change.

993
00:57:30,845 --> 00:57:32,779
I work for the British people.

994
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,314
I gather intelligence

995
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:38,419
so that the government can
protect the British people.

996
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,687
I do not gather intelligence
so that the government can lie

997
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:43,425
to the British people.

998
00:57:45,926 --> 00:57:48,662
With respect, Mrs. Gun,

999
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:50,332
you're a spy.

1000
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:51,999
Yes.

1001
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,066
You gather information

1002
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,834
from people's phones
and computers

1003
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:56,837
and you feed that
to your clients.

1004
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:00,506
- Yes.
- You eavesdrop on private conversations.

1005
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:02,676
And now you're upset
at being asked to do that

1006
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:04,544
to members
of the Security Council?

1007
00:58:04,546 --> 00:58:06,247
Detective...

1008
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:10,316
I don't object to being asked
to collect information

1009
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,486
that could help
prevent a terror attack.

1010
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:17,790
What I object to is being
asked to gather intelligence

1011
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:20,894
to help fix a vote at the UN

1012
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:23,932
and deceive the world
into going to war.

1013
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,169
- Who put you up to this?
- No one.

1014
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:31,805
But you gave the memo
to someone.

1015
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,241
Who did you give it to?
A journalist?

1016
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:37,211
Someone in the anti-war
movement?

1017
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,281
Your husband?

1018
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:40,647
You don't have
to answer that.

1019
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:41,948
No, I will answer that.

1020
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,984
My husband had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

1021
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:46,687
He was briefly detained
here, too, wasn't he?

1022
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,622
- Pending deportation?
- Yes, he was.

1023
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:52,359
- And then you married him.
- Yes.

1024
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,326
His paperwork
has been resubmitted.

1025
00:58:54,328 --> 00:58:56,566
- He signs in here once a week.
- He's a Muslim.

1026
00:58:58,566 --> 00:58:59,633
I'm sorry?

1027
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:01,368
He's a Kurdish Turk

1028
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,437
seeking permanent residence
in Britain.

1029
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:08,140
And given what Saddam Hussein
has done to the Kurdish people,

1030
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:12,379
murdering over 180,000 of
them with chemical weapons,

1031
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:13,814
I can assure you

1032
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,750
my husband has absolutely
no sympathy whatsoever

1033
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:17,884
with the Iraqi regime.

1034
00:59:17,886 --> 00:59:19,153
Then why did you
leak a memo

1035
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,388
intended to help
remove Saddam Hussein?

1036
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,490
'Cause by attacking Iraq,

1037
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:26,160
you don't simply attack
Saddam Hussein,

1038
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,395
you attack the country
of over 30 million people!

1039
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:31,964
And I cannot bear to think
of the pain and the suffering

1040
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:33,167
that that will cause.

1041
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,470
Frankly, I don't see
how anyone can bear it.

1042
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,238
Detective,
is she going to be formally charged?

1043
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,241
That's a decision
for the Attorney General.

1044
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:45,979
Lord Goldsmith will need time
to decide how to deal with you.

1045
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,781
The custody sergeant
will release you

1046
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:49,249
on police bail today.

1047
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,151
You'll be told
to return to the station

1048
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:53,153
in approximately
three months,

1049
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:55,555
by which time a decision
on whether to charge you

1050
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,126
will have been made.

1051
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,504
Are you all right,
<i>janum?</i>

1052
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,738
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, come on.

1053
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,540
Katharine?

1054
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:17,676
I'm sorry. I deal mostly
with petty criminals,

1055
01:00:17,678 --> 01:00:19,946
drunks and drug addicts.

1056
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:22,049
If you're charged,
you're gonna need someone

1057
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,250
with a lot more
experience than me.

1058
01:00:24,252 --> 01:00:27,220
- I see.
- Have you heard of Liberty?

1059
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:29,055
They handle
human rights cases,

1060
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:32,459
political cases,
often for free.

1061
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:36,531
Well... I just wanted
to be sure you knew that.

1062
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:38,698
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1063
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,935
Thank you.

1064

- Do you wanna come in?
- Oh, no, no, no.

1089

I just, um...

- You do?
- Yeah. A lot of us do.

1093
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:53,209
Really?

1094
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:56,544
Are they going
to charge you?

1101
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:47,294
<i>at this hour,
American and coalition forces</i>

1102
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,029
<i>are in the early stages
of military operations</i>

1103
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:53,165
to disarm Iraq,
to free its people

1104
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:56,069
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

1105
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:59,973
<i>Our nation enters
this conflict reluctantly,</i>

1106
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:02,709
<i>yet our purpose is sure.</i>

1107
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:05,245
<i>The people of the United States
and our friends and allies</i>

1108
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:08,682
<i>will not live at the mercy
of an outlaw regime</i>

1109
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:12,185
<i>that threatens the peace
with weapons of mass murder.</i>

1110
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:18,591
<i>We will meet that threat now.</i>

1111
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:21,528
We should have got
that memo out sooner.

1112
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,796
- We did what we could.
- We fucking failed.

1113
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:26,767
<i>So that we
do not have to meet it later</i>

1114
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,904
<i>with armies of firefighters
and police and doctors</i>

1115
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,439
<i>on the streets of our cities.</i>

1116
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:35,375
<i>Now that conflict has come,</i>

1117
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:37,243
<i>the only way
to limit its duration</i>

1118
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:39,712
<i>is to apply decisive force.</i>

1119
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,515
I'm so fucking naive.

1120
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,683
<i>This will not be a campaign
of half measures</i>

1121
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:48,020
<i>and we will accept
no outcome but victory.</i>

1122
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,775
I have to go.

1123
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:12,546
You want to come
to the cafe?

1124
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,781
Work with me?

1125
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,557
I'll call you later.

1126
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:26,629
If we use the phones,

1127
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,431
they'll be listening.

1128
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:33,066
Let them listen.

1129
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:34,803
We have nothing to hide.

1130
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:40,242
You should contact
those lawyers...

1131
01:04:42,243 --> 01:04:43,444
...today.

1132
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:45,647
Please.

1133
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:13,640
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. Uh, it's Katharine.

1134
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:15,207
Uh, Katharine Gun.
I phoned this morning.

1135
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:18,479
<i>Oh, yes, Katharine.
Please, um, come on up.</i>

1136
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,285
- Katharine?
- Hello.

1137
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:29,455
James.
Lovely to meet you.

1138
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,223
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Not at all.

1139
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:32,658
I'm sorry
about the decor.

1140
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,562
We like to say we focus
more on our clients.

1141
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,729
This is Shami Chakrabarti,
our director.

1142
01:05:37,731 --> 01:05:41,734
- Hello, Katharine.
- And this is Ben Emmerson.

1143
01:05:41,736 --> 01:05:42,801
Hi.

1144
01:05:42,803 --> 01:05:44,069
Hello.

1145
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:46,406
This was the only memo you took?

1146
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:48,875
- Yes.
- No one suggested you take it?

1147
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:51,877
- No.
- And you've never met Martin Bright?

1148
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:52,946
No.

1149
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:53,812
Martin called me
last week.

1150
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:55,515
He said he didn't know
who you were,

1151
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:58,919
but he wanted us to be aware
that you might need our help.

1152
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,854
Well, that was
very kind of him.

1153
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,256
He said he got the memo
from someone he knew

1154
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:05,223
but he wouldn't say who.

1155
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:08,263
Do you want to tell us
who you gave it to?

1156
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:13,200
Look,

1157
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:17,037
if you don't mind,
I would prefer not to say.

1158
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,640
I promised I wouldn't.

1159
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,375
Okay.

1160
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:24,310
When you met Yasar, he had
already applied for asylum.

1161
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:26,645
- Yes.
- Which was denied.

1162
01:06:26,647 --> 01:06:30,415
Yes, uh, they said that there
wasn't a significant enough risk

1163
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:32,386
of persecution
if he went back.

1164
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,087
And that's when
you married him?

1165
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:36,189
- Yes.
- And did he pay you?

1166
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,390
Absolutely not.

1167
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:38,524
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to upset you.

1168
01:06:38,526 --> 01:06:40,359
It's just that
your husband is Muslim

1169
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,328
and the prosecution
will be looking for motive.

1170
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:45,531
My motive was to stop a war

1171
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:49,968
and save lives. I failed.

1172
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,939
All I've managed to do is put
my husband's future at risk.

1173
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,707
And your own.

1174
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:56,375
In fact,
by leaking information

1175
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:58,145
to try and stop a war,
I'd argue

1176
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,312
that you chose loyalty
to your country

1177
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:04,618
over loyalty to your government,
your marriage and yourself.

1178
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,489
You had nothing to gain
and everything to lose.

1179
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,460
I think that speaks
rather highly of you.

1180
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:15,595
He's trying
to give you a compliment.

1181
01:07:15,597 --> 01:07:16,562
I see.

1182
01:07:16,564 --> 01:07:18,631
Part of our job
is to try and anticipate

1183
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:21,834
what the prosecution's
going to throw at you.

1184
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:24,638
Some of the people we meet
are looking for attention,

1185
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,939
a way to elevate
their humdrum lives.

1186
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:29,777
- Well, I'm not.
- No, I don't think you are.

1187
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,647
Sorry.

1188
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:36,917
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

1189
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,785
We're here to help.

1190
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:43,189
And we don't have duress.

1191
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:47,026
She's adamant no outside
agency put any pressure on her.

1192
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:48,761
Public interest?

1193
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,263
The public has a right to know
when their government is lying.

1194
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:53,232
We cite
the Falklands case

1195
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:54,901
when Thatcher lied
about why she ordered

1196
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:56,569
the sinking
of that Argentinian ship.

1197
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:57,870
- <i>Belgrano.</i>
- Yeah.

1198
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:00,372
- Who was the whistleblower?
- Clive Ponting.

1199
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:01,674
The jury acquitted him,
didn't they?

1200
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:02,942
Yes, and immediately
afterwards,

1201
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,910
Thatcher had the Official
Secrets Act amended

1202
01:08:04,912 --> 01:08:06,745
to avoid being caught
in a lie in the future.

1203
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:09,015
So since '89,
the public interest is

1204
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:11,919
effectively whatever the
government says that it is.

1205
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:14,620
We've got nothing.

1206
01:08:14,622 --> 01:08:16,523
I have to
think about it.

1207
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,825
Sorry, I have to go.

1208
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,029
I promised Anne
a weekend away.

1209
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:25,264
If they charge her,
we might have to plead guilty

1210
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:26,765
and ask for
a reduced sentence.

1211
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:29,035
But she's young
and principled.

1212
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,636
A judge might even think that
what she did was morally right.

1213
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:34,042
Or crucify her
as a traitor.

1214
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,111
Bye.

1215
01:09:04,672 --> 01:09:07,674
- You sure he was following you?
- He was staring at me.

1216
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:08,741
Sometimes men stare...

1217
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:09,843
Yeah, it wasn't
that kind of a stare.

1218
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,309
What kind
of a stare was it?

1219
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:14,412
Yas, please,
I'm scared. Okay?

1220
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:15,751
I'm scared.

1221
01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:19,786
You know, for years,
I've tried to be legal here.

1222
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,353
- I know.
- Then why'd you do it?

1223
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:23,590
These arseholes got
their war, anyway.

1224
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,425
Saddam's over.
And you know what?

1225
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,560
- I'm glad he's over!
- War is not over.

1226
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:29,094
Ousting Saddam
is just the beginning.

1227
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:31,764
- What do you know about war?
- I work at GCHQ.

1228
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,933
All you do is listen
to people talking!

1229
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,702
You've never seen war!
You've never smelled it!

1230
01:09:36,704 --> 01:09:37,902
Never even
come close to it!

1231
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,240
Yas, I understand
why you are angry.

1232
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,474
It is my fault
and I'm sorry.

1233
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:44,376
I am so sorry.

1234
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:49,349
But I watched Blair
with his smug smile

1235
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,117
and his sterile speeches
that tell us nothing

1236
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:56,154
of what it must feel like to
be a child in Iraq right now.

1237
01:09:56,156 --> 01:09:58,791
I know I'm not sorry
that I tried to stop him.

1238
01:09:58,793 --> 01:09:59,928
I'm not.

1239
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:03,129
I'm only sorry
that I failed.

1240
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:14,139
Thank you
for inviting us in.

1241
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:15,407
What is it
you came to say?

1242
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:19,178
Well, there's been
a development.

1243
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,848
- Am I going to be charged?
- That I don't know.

1244
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,685
Then why
are you here?

1245
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:27,419
I gather you went to see
a lawyer today.

1246
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,755
- Did you follow me?
- No.

1247
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:29,889
Because somebody did.

1248
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,657
Well, you must know
that after what you did,

1249
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:33,492
GCHQ is concerned.

1250
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:36,062
I have a right
to legal advice.

1251
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:39,965
Unfortunately,
it's not as simple as that.

1252
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,734
When you signed on
to work for GCHQ,

1253
01:10:42,736 --> 01:10:45,737
you agreed to be bound
by the Official Secrets Act

1254
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:47,840
for the rest of your life.

1255
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,809
I know what I signed,
detective.

1256
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:54,546
Mm, then you know
that it says here

1257
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:56,948
in Section 1-1

1258
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,518
that "a person is
guilty of an offense

1259
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,855
"if he or she

1260
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:04,956
"discloses any information

1261
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:08,760
"relating to security
or intelligence."

1262
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:12,398
This means that you cannot
discuss anything

1263
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,402
with anyone outside of GCHQ

1264
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,006
relating to
the document you leaked.

1265
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,941
Are you saying
I can't talk to a lawyer?

1266
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,977
Oh, you have the right
to talk to a lawyer.

1267
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,911
It's just that
you cannot discuss

1268
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,448
anything to do with
your work at GCHQ,

1269
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,416
or the contents
of the memo you leaked,

1270
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,620
or how it came
into your possession

1271
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,222
or who wrote it.

1272
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,625
All of this information
is top secret.

1273
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:42,728
So disclosing it
to anyone outside of GCHQ,

1274
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,863
even a lawyer,

1275
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:48,667
would be a further violation
of the Official Secrets Act,

1276
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:51,970
which could result
in further prosecution

1277
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:55,077
and a much longer
prison sentence.

1278
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,649
We just wanted
you to be aware of that.

1279
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:06,818
So if I may not talk to a
lawyer, who may I talk to?

1280
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,587
You should talk to
your superiors at GCHQ.

1281
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:13,158
- Are you fucking joking?
- Yas, please. Please.

1282
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,894
We should hear what
the detectives have to say.

1283
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,966
They're just
doing their job.

1284
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:25,871
Simply put, if you wish
to tell anything to a lawyer

1285
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:28,744
or the press or anyone else...

1286
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:32,847
...you first need to
clear it with GCHQ.

1287
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:37,852
Detective...

1288
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,853
I leaked only one memo.

1289
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:43,188
I had good reason to do so

1290
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,492
and I intend to make
those reasons public

1291
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:48,863
if I am charged.

1292
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,197
I will not talk
to my lawyers again

1293
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:54,669
unless I am charged.

1294
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:58,106
Tell that to GCHQ.

1295
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:05,344
Are you grilling
or smoking that fish?

1296
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:08,447
I am smoking.
I've soaked the wood chips in water.

1297
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:09,549
I've got charcoal.

1298
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,518
I'm... I'm trying
something new.

1299
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,188
- Hi.
- Ken?

1300
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,621
- Hi.
- Hi, Ken.

1301
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:19,591
- Guess you're down here for the weekend.
- Yes. Just for the night.

1302
01:13:19,593 --> 01:13:21,126
Yeah, me too.
It's been a while.

1303
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:23,728
Mm-hmm. Would you, uh...
Do you want a drink?

1304
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,532
Uh, no, thanks.
Sally's cooking dinner.

1305
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,968
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.

1306
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,237
- I'm so sorry to intrude.
- Oh, not at all.

1307
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,005
How's the new job?

1308
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:37,910
Well, it's, um, eye-opening.

1309
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:41,647
In fact, I wondered
if I might ask Ben's opinion

1310
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:45,251
about a new case that my office
has been asked to prosecute.

1311
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:48,688
It won't take a minute.
Would you mind?

1312
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,689
How do you know
that I met her?

1313
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:53,459
Security services
are all over this.

1314
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:54,693
Mm-hmm.

1315
01:13:54,695 --> 01:13:56,595
And it's not just
a domestic embarrassment.

1316
01:13:56,597 --> 01:13:57,964
The Americans
are very unhappy.

1317
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,465
Oh, well,
that is upsetting.

1318
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:02,736
Oh, come on, Ben,
it's not funny.

1319
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:05,770
What she did was a
deliberate act of betrayal.

1320
01:14:05,772 --> 01:14:08,072
Look, Ken, we're not
colleagues anymore.

1321
01:14:08,074 --> 01:14:09,474
We're on
different sides here.

1322
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:14,080
I think she wants to be seen
as some sort of cause celebre.

1323
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:18,283
But she swore allegiance
to the intelligence services

1324
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:20,618
and when you do that you
don't get to pick and choose

1325
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,920
what orders
you'll follow.

1326
01:14:21,922 --> 01:14:24,290
Following orders is not
a defense to a war crime.

1327
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:28,527
Yes, but who is she to undermine
the strategic objectives

1328
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:31,496
of a democratically-elected Prime Minister.

1329
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:34,700
Oh, come on, she's not selling
state secrets to Moscow.

1330
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,969
She exposed
an illegal attempt

1331
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:39,304
to secure
a UN resolution for war

1332
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:41,072
which would have
given Blair perfect cover

1333
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:42,640
for the bloody mess
that we're in now.

1334
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,810
No, she should have
kept her mouth shut

1335
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:47,045
or complained
to her superiors.

1336
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:48,613
Now I've got
a real problem with people

1337
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:50,715
who think that
from some lowly position

1338
01:14:50,717 --> 01:14:52,385
they can possibly see
the big picture.

1339
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,185
So then you would
never question authority

1340
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:55,955
even if you knew
it was breaking the law.

1341
01:14:55,957 --> 01:14:58,858
Ben, you can't blame me
for being angry with her.

1342
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,225
We're at war.

1343
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:02,428
So, I'm going to assign the
best prosecutor in my office

1344
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,897
to bring this girl down,
which shouldn't be difficult.

1345
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:05,965
She's already confessed.

1346
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,899
I appreciate
your determination

1347
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:11,306
to make an example of her,
but you shouldn't be here.

1348
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:15,273
Oh, come on,
we're friends.

1349
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:17,410
I'll make my position
perfectly clear.

1350
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,845
If you charge her,
then I will defend her

1351
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:22,050
to the best of my ability.

1352
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:25,283
So let's go home
and pretend

1353
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,823
that this conversation
never happened.

1354
01:16:00,922 --> 01:16:03,221
You're not working today?

1355
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:06,494
No. I have to sign in
at the station.

1356
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:12,533
- Then we can go for a hike.
- I want to see the sea.

1357
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:27,114
Leave it.

1358
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:36,188
<i>Hi, we're not in.
Please leave a message.</i>

1359
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,825
<i>Katharine,
it's James Welch from Liberty.</i>

1360
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,594
<i>Uh, we should talk.</i>

1361
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:44,729
<i>Could give me a call
when you get the message?</i>

1362
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:46,432
Hello?

1363
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:48,302
<i>Oh, ah, Katharine.</i>

1364
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:52,136
<i>I'm afraid I have
some bad news.</i>

1365
01:16:52,138 --> 01:16:54,340
Uh, James, you know that

1366
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:56,340
GCHQ said I
couldn't talk to you.

1367
01:16:56,342 --> 01:16:57,910
<i>Oh, then,
well, the good news is</i>

1368
01:16:57,912 --> 01:17:00,179
<i>we finally had
the gag order lifted.</i>

1369
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:01,580
<i>We've agreed to not
ask any questions</i>

1370
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:04,515
<i>about what other work
you did at GCHQ.</i>

1371
01:17:04,517 --> 01:17:08,088
<i>But what happens going forward
isn't up to them.</i>

1372
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,456
<i>Your case is now in the hands</i>

1373
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,094
<i>of the Crown Prosecution
Service.</i>

1374
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:17,631
<i>They're going to charge you.</i>

1375
01:17:20,935 --> 01:17:23,004
<i>We should meet next week.</i>

1376
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,043
- <i>Katharine?</i>
- Yes. Uh...

1377
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:31,178
Okay. Yeah.

1378
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:34,712
<i>I know that this is
a lot to take in,</i>

1379
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:35,947
<i>but we will help you.</i>

1380
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:37,385
Thank you.

1381
01:17:39,352 --> 01:17:41,019
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thank you very much, James.

1382
01:17:41,021 --> 01:17:42,222
<i>Speak soon.</i>

1383
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:50,395
"GCHQ whistleblower charged."

1384
01:17:50,397 --> 01:17:51,764

01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:53,166

"Leak against this war."

1389
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:02,140
She's everywhere.

1390
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:04,309
What's your angle?

1391
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:05,379
Look.

Little tabloidy,
don't you think?

1398
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:22,260
Hey, we're building awareness.
How about Daniel Ellsberg?

1399
01:18:22,262 --> 01:18:24,130
He leaked
the Pentagon Papers.

1400

I know who Ellsberg is,
Martin.

Of course you do.
Forgive me.

time, possibly, to avert it."

1407
01:18:41,114 --> 01:18:44,218
Okay, that's classy.

1408
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,060
I'll be quick.

1409
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,350
Are you waiting
for the tall man?

1410
01:19:19,352 --> 01:19:21,254
- The dark-haired one?
- Yeah.

1411
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,654
He was shouting
that his wife was outside.

1412
01:19:23,656 --> 01:19:25,157
- They took him.
- What?

1413
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,360
They took him.

1414
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:38,403
Where is he?

1415
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:40,138
Sorry. Who are you?

1416
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,073
I'm Yasar Gun's wife.
Where's my husband?

1417
01:19:42,075 --> 01:19:45,712
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's scheduled for deportation.

1418
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,245
What?

1419
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,046
No. No, no. Uh, no, no.

1420
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:51,317
Look, look, there's been
some sort of mistake.

1421
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,285
I need to see my husband
right now.

1422
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:55,289
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

1423
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:57,923
You can't go in there!

1424
01:19:57,925 --> 01:19:59,858
Please. Please,
please, please, please.

1425
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,225
Let me see him, please.

1426
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:02,428
Please, he doesn't
have anything with him.

1427
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,728
He doesn't even
have any money.

1428
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:06,697
I'm sorry.
They've already taken him.

1429
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:08,767
<i>No, no.
They won't say where.</i>

1430
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:10,868
I don't know. Oh, God, James,
I don't know what to do.

1431
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,471
<i>Katharine, I'm so sorry.
I'm at the Hague.</i>

1432
01:20:13,473 --> 01:20:15,273
- <i>Who's your MP?</i>
- I don't know.

1433
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:17,175
- <i>Is it Nigel Jones?</i>
- Nigel Jones, yes. Yeah.

1434
01:20:17,177 --> 01:20:18,411
<i>Do you have
your marriage certificate?</i>

1435
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,944
- Uh, yeah, yeah, somewhere.
- <i>Right.</i>

1436
01:20:19,946 --> 01:20:22,480
<i>Find it and
I'll track Nigel down.</i>

1437
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:23,749
Of course they're legally
married, Beverly.

1438
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:25,617
I'm holding their
marriage certificate.

1439
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:26,852
<i>I'm sorry,
but his application</i>

1440
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:28,853
<i>to remain in this country
has been denied.</i>

1441
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:29,955
Mistakenly.

1442
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,456
He's complied
with every directive

1443
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:32,558
your department's issued.

1444
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,492
<i>Nigel, your constituent
is accused</i>

1445
01:20:34,494 --> 01:20:35,926
<i>of betraying her country.</i>

1446
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:37,996
<i>Do you really think we should
be helping her husband?</i>

1447
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:40,800
I think deporting her husband
when she's facing a trial

1448
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,304
looks like state bullying.

1449
01:20:46,373 --> 01:20:49,073
<i>All right,
I'll review his paperwork.</i>

1450
01:20:49,075 --> 01:20:50,710
Thank you.

1451
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:53,548
And please make sure he's not flown out tonight.

1452
01:20:55,482 --> 01:20:57,950
I'm sorry.
Best I can do for now.

1453
01:20:57,952 --> 01:21:01,118
I promise I will pick this up
first thing tomorrow.

1454
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,755
Hello?

1455
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,323
<i>We tracked him to
Harmondsworth Detention Center.</i>

1456
01:21:05,325 --> 01:21:07,760
<i>It's a deportation center
at Heathrow Airport</i>

1457
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,560
<i>right off the M-25.</i>

1458
01:21:09,562 --> 01:21:11,496
<i>Go to the main gate
and wait there.</i>

1459
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:12,898
<i>Uh, are they
gonna release him?</i>

1460
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,401
<i>We have ministerial
approval but no paperwork yet.</i>

1461
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,035
<i>There is a possibility</i>

1462
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:19,237
<i>he's already
been put on a plane.</i>

1463
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:20,605
- What?
- <i>Yeah, I'm checking.</i>

1464
01:21:20,607 --> 01:21:22,273
<i>Just get there
as soon as you can.</i>

1465
01:21:22,275 --> 01:21:25,445
Out you go.
Let's go. Move it.

1466
01:21:28,281 --> 01:21:30,482
This is a mistake, sir.

1467
01:21:30,484 --> 01:21:32,520
- This is a mistake.
- Come on.

1468
01:21:33,887 --> 01:21:35,888
Please.

1469
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,760
I need to call my wife.
I must call my wife!

1470
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:06,221
Next in line.

1471
01:22:29,743 --> 01:22:30,745
Hello?

1472
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:36,985
Hello?

1473
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,261
Yeah?

1474
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,760
James, James, um,

1475
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:51,196
I don't know if I'm
even at the right place.

1476
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
but it's 4:00 a.m.

1477
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,700
There's nobody to talk to.

1478
01:22:55,702 --> 01:22:58,439
Wait, wait.
Someone's coming. Wait.

1479
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,576
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1480
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:05,477
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1481
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:06,644
- It's all right.
- You okay?

1482
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:07,712
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

1483
01:23:07,714 --> 01:23:09,449
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1484
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:18,223
If they try and pull
anything like that again,

1485
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:19,323
then I want
to go public.

1486
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:20,858
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

1487
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,260
Because people are fickle.
Many will hate you.

1488
01:23:23,262 --> 01:23:25,096
Your personal lives
will be picked apart,

1489
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:26,697
your marriage
will be interrogated.

1490
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:28,567
In fact, we think
it will be best

1491
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:31,502
if Yasar was kept
well out of this.

1492
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:34,007
You should probably
not attend the trial.

1493
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:38,276
- I understand.
- What? No.

1494
01:23:38,278 --> 01:23:40,444
<i>Janum,</i> we both know
the jury will prefer

1495
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:42,179
an English girl without
an immigrant husband.

1496
01:23:42,181 --> 01:23:43,514
You know what?
That is ridiculous.

1497
01:23:43,516 --> 01:23:45,951
We are married and we have
nothing to be ashamed of.

1498
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,719
The shame is on them, not you.

1499
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:51,624
You don't need to risk
your freedom to prove it.

1500
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:54,425
We should discuss
how you'll plead.

1501
01:23:54,427 --> 01:23:55,626
Not guilty.

1502
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:57,729
But you understand
you confessed.

1503
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:01,200
I confessed that I leaked a memo
in order to try and save lives.

1504
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:05,804
And we will use that argument
to ask for a reduced sentence.

1505
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:08,773
If you do plead guilty,
there will be no jury.

1506
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:11,143
You could be out of jail
in less than six months.

1507
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:12,777
Given how badly
the war is going,

1508
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:15,179
we think a judge
is likely to be sympathetic.

1509
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:17,515
But I'd have
a criminal record.

1510
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:18,849
That is true.

1511
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,487
Which I would carry with me
for the rest of my life

1512
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,087
into every job interview,

1513
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:24,255
every application for credit.

1514
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,157
- Yes.
- And I'm sorry.

1515
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,893
We would be conceding

1516
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:32,163
that no one in Intelligence can
ever tell the British people

1517
01:24:32,165 --> 01:24:33,866
when their government
is lying.

1518
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:35,334
Not when
the lies are protected

1519
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,702
by the
Official Secrets Act, no.

1520
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:39,036
I'm sorry.
This is all a charade.

1521
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:40,872
I mean, if you're saying
that I have to plead guilty

1522
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:43,642
because the act allows
absolutely no defense whatsoever,

1523
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:46,045
then the very idea
of a fair trial is a joke.

1524
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:47,779
I'm sorry,
Katharine,

1525
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:51,783
but the best we can do is
ask a judge for leniency.

1526
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:54,551
Post <i>Belgrano,</i> there
really is no defense

1527
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:56,087
to a breach of
the Official Secrets Act...

1528
01:24:56,089 --> 01:24:57,992
Except perhaps one.

1529
01:24:58,959 --> 01:25:00,593
Katharine said it herself.

1530
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,295
She leaked the memo
to try to save lives.

1531
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:04,728
But she still
broke the law.

1532
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,032
Yes, but there are circumstances
where you can break the law.

1533
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:09,835
It's only in situations
of absolute necessity...

1534
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:12,304
- Necessity. Exactly.
- Ben, you're reaching.

1535
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:15,608
Am I? What are the requirements
for a defense of necessity?

1536
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,643
Imminent threat to your life
or the lives of others.

1537
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,246
Yeah, and no other reasonable
way to prevent loss of life.

1538
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,813
Yes, right, well,
the invasion posed

1539
01:25:21,815 --> 01:25:23,915
an imminent threat
to thousands of lives.

1540
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,850
Katharine has no right
to try and prevent a war

1541
01:25:25,852 --> 01:25:27,118
authorized by
the Attorney General.

1542
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,488
- Unless the war is illegal.
- What?

1543
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:33,724
Wait, wait, so now we're going to put the war on trial?

1544
01:25:33,726 --> 01:25:34,893
Yes.

1545
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:39,363
I believe that Katharine Gun
tried to stop an illegal war.

1546
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:41,066
What she did was necessary

1547
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:44,435
to try to save thousands of
British-American and Iraqi lives.

1548
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:47,538
And Goldsmith
specifically stated

1549
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,040
that the invasion was legal.

1550
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:51,910
He said so only three days
before the invasion.

1551
01:25:51,912 --> 01:25:53,312
What was his position
before that?

1552
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,081
What was his advice at the
time Katharine leaked the memo?

1553
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,948
- Well, we have no idea.
- Well, I'd like to find out.

1554
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,584
Because Blair spent
a lot of energy

1555
01:25:59,586 --> 01:26:02,187
trying to secure
a new UN resolution.

1556
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:03,421
I suppose.

1557
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:05,590
When Lord Goldsmith
finally said

1558
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:09,161
the war was legal,
his deputy legal advisor resigned.

1559
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:10,961
Yes, Elizabeth Wilmshurst.
Yeah, that's right.

1560
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,496
- She resigned. Yes, yes.
- But she didn't say why.

1561
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,032
She couldn't.

1562
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,001
If she did, she'd be charged
under the Official Secrets Act.

1563
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:18,202
So I need to get a meeting
with Elizabeth Wilmshurst.

1564
01:26:18,204 --> 01:26:20,171
- She's not gonna go public.
- She doesn't have to.

1565
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:21,406
All we need is a hint

1566
01:26:21,408 --> 01:26:24,242
that Goldsmith changed his mind
about the legality of the war.

1567
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:28,179
I'm sorry, Ben. There are two
ways they could justify war.

1568
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:30,447
- We've only addressed one.
- So what am I missing?

1569
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:31,916
- Self-defense.
- Oh, come on.

1570
01:26:31,918 --> 01:26:33,852
Does anyone honestly believe
that this country

1571
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:35,621
was about to be attacked
by Iraq?

1572
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,923
I do agree, but that's why
they trotted out Powell.

1573
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:40,157
- To make the case for WMDs.
- Oh.

1574
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,960
If it's true that Iraq has
weapons of mass destruction

1575
01:26:41,962 --> 01:26:44,595
that pose an imminent threat
to this country,

1576
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:48,567
the war is legal
without a UN resolution.

1577
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:49,901
How many people
actually believe

1578
01:26:49,903 --> 01:26:51,803
Iraq still has weapons
of mass destruction?

1579
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:53,272
Well,
they're still looking.

1580
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:56,711
If we go down this route,
we better pray none are found.

1581
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,649
I'm gonna get
Elizabeth Wilmshurst's number.

1582
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,885
You've put me
in a rather awkward position.

1583
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:10,955
I'm sorry, but thank you
for seeing me.

1584
01:27:10,957 --> 01:27:14,024
I think what she did
took great courage.

1585
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:17,862
And she was naive,
of course, but brave.

1586
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:20,935
And you were
brave enough to resign.

1587
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,638
But not to
speak out in public.

1588
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,041
If I had, I might have caused
more of a brouhaha.

1589
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:31,910
Sparked a proper debate.

1590
01:27:31,912 --> 01:27:36,083
Can I ask you, uh,
how did you resign?

1591
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,756
I wrote a letter.

1592
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:46,191
And in that letter,
did you give a reason

1593
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:48,225
for your resignation?

1594
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:51,563
I restated my position on
the legality of going to war.

1595
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:53,430
Which was?

1596
01:27:53,432 --> 01:27:55,800
That it would
not be lawful to use force

1597
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:59,170
without a new
Security Council resolution.

1598
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:03,910
Um, did Goldsmith initially
support your view?

1599
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,879
He did.

1600
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,113
He told Blair that
if military action were taken,

1601
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:11,282
he expected
the government to be accused

1602
01:28:11,284 --> 01:28:13,820
of acting unlawfully.

1603
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:17,992
And was that
a written opinion?

1604
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:21,228
It was a detailed
advisory document.

1605
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:26,363
Right, so then would that
have been his position

1606
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:29,501
at the time that Katharine Gun
printed the Koza memo

1607
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:31,105
on February 3?

1608
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:34,742
Yes.

1609
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:39,046
And then
he went to Washington.

1610
01:28:39,946 --> 01:28:41,380
Oh, really?

1611
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:46,053
- Well, who did he meet there?
- I wasn't given details.

1612
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:50,822
But after that trip,
his opinion changed.

1613
01:28:50,824 --> 01:28:53,959
In nine short paragraphs,
he said that

1614
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:57,528
the UN's authorization
for the 1991 Gulf War

1615
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,965
could be reactivated

1616
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:02,401
to legitimize
a new war with Iraq.

1617
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:05,702
He told the Prime Minister
what he wanted to hear?

1618
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:07,839
At best, he was
persuaded to support

1619
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,474
a really fringe point of view.

1620
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:13,644
- Oh, really fringe.
- Yeah.

1621
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:21,118
- Martin Bright.
- Martin.

1622
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,420
- Ben.
- <i>Ben.</i>

1623
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:23,854
I took
your whistleblower's case.

1624
01:29:23,856 --> 01:29:26,291
Yes, I heard.
Can I meet her?

1625
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:28,760
No, not yet, Martin.
I don't want a media frenzy.

1626
01:29:28,762 --> 01:29:30,062
Okay. When she's ready.

1627
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,296
Before some hack
tracks her down.

1628
01:29:32,298 --> 01:29:34,532
Come on, Ben, I broke her story.
I'm on her side.

1629
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,234
Well, you can help
by finding out

1630
01:29:36,236 --> 01:29:38,803
why the Attorney General
went to Washington

1631
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:40,671
<i>just before the war started.</i>

1632
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:43,175
Wait, Goldsmith went to DC?

1633
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:44,876
<i>I'd like to know
who he met there.</i>

1634
01:29:44,878 --> 01:29:46,044
<i>Right. I'm on it.</i>

1635
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:48,479
- And how is Peter?
- Peter is in Iraq.

1636
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:50,782
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I've been reading his articles.

1637
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:53,050
Listen, if he hears anything,
even a hint

1638
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:56,287
that Saddam really did have
weapons of mass destruction,

1639
01:29:56,289 --> 01:29:57,456
<i>then please call me.</i>

1640
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,590
Of course. Can I ask why?

1641
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:01,559
Well, let's just say
that if WMD are found,

1642
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:04,862
then defending Katharine will
be a little more complicated.

1643
01:30:04,864 --> 01:30:06,697
- I'll get back to you.
- <i>All right, thank you.</i>

1644
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,135
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

1645
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,935
There's thousands
of inspectors here

1646
01:30:11,937 --> 01:30:14,139
from the US Army,
the British Army

1647
01:30:14,141 --> 01:30:15,773
the CIA, FBI.

1648
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:17,175
<i>And still nothing?</i>

1649
01:30:17,177 --> 01:30:20,510
No, no, not a fucking thing.
Nothing.

1650
01:30:20,512 --> 01:30:23,380
Anyway, some Polish troops found
a cache of Sarin gas warheads

1651
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:25,884
dating back to the Iran-Iraq
War, but they were all empty.

1652
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,618
<i>And right now, I'm standing
in a glass factory</i>

1653
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,792
and all they've found is piles
of silica sand and soda ash.

1654
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:34,926
So, yeah.

1655
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:36,862
<i>Things must be getting ugly
in Washington.</i>

1656
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:39,063
Well, you should talk to Ed.

1657
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:41,465
Maybe we could end up doing
a joint piece or something.

1658
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,603
- Peter, what was that?
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1659
01:30:45,605 --> 01:30:48,105
It's just our guys detonating
some conventional ordnance.

1660
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:49,707
- They don't wanna have...
- <i>Jesus.</i>

1661
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:52,510
...kids finding unexploded
shit in the rubble.

1662
01:30:52,512 --> 01:30:54,979
All right, talk soon.
Take care.

1663
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:57,916
Yeah, all right, mate. Bye.

1664
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:00,285
- February 11.
- <i>What?</i>

1665
01:31:00,287 --> 01:31:03,121
<i>Goldsmith's in DC
meeting with the attorneys</i>

1666
01:31:03,123 --> 01:31:05,290
for Bush, Powell,
Rumsfeld and Rice.

1667
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,325
- <i>Okay, hold on...</i>
- But that's not the big story.

1668
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:10,728
<i>The really big story
is the OSP.</i>

1669
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:12,296
The Office of Special Plans.

1670
01:31:12,298 --> 01:31:14,831
Turns out when Bush wasn't getting
the intelligence he wanted,

1671
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,669
Rumsfeld bypassed the CIA

1672
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:20,071
<i>and set up his own
intelligence unit.</i>

1673
01:31:20,073 --> 01:31:22,372
They fed
raw unvetted intelligence

1674
01:31:22,374 --> 01:31:25,876
to Bush and Powell
who lied us into a war!

1675
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:27,578
Yeah. Okay, Ed.
I appreciate that.

1676
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,014
But let's, first, try and help

1677
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,848
a young woman
stay out of prison.

1678
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,050
Uh, you said Goldsmith
met Bush's lawyers

1679
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:35,120
on February 11.
Who were those lawyers?

1680
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,987
"John Ashcroft,
Alberto Gonzales,

1681
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:40,125
William Taft, Jim Haynes,
John Bellinger."

1682
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:43,327
The attorneys for Bush,
Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice.

1683
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:46,096
Wow. They really
turned up the heat.

1684
01:31:46,098 --> 01:31:49,099
You know, I almost
feel sorry for Goldsmith.

1685
01:31:49,101 --> 01:31:52,402
Don't. He fucking caved when
his country needed him most.

1686
01:31:52,404 --> 01:31:54,773
- That's a great headline, mate.
- <i>It bloody is.</i>

1687
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,375
- All right.
- <i>Print it.</i>

1688
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,343
- Yeah. Bye.
- <i>We'll share the byline.</i>

1689
01:31:58,345 --> 01:31:59,777
Bye.

1690
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:01,112
Nutter.

1691
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:03,048
<i>Goldsmith was
under tremendous pressure</i>

1692
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,648
<i>before he went to Washington.</i>

1693
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,283
Our military were
refusing to invade

1694
01:32:06,285 --> 01:32:07,986
without a clear legal opinion
from him

1695
01:32:07,988 --> 01:32:09,586
that what they were doing
was legal

1696
01:32:09,588 --> 01:32:11,156
<i>in case of a war crimes trial.</i>

1697
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,057
Thank you, Martin,
very helpful.

1698
01:32:13,059 --> 01:32:14,693
Well, no, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

1699
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:15,992
Do you think
you have a defense?

1700
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,495
- We're working on it.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1701
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:19,163
- <i>Let me know when you do.</i>
- Well, you'll hear it in court.

1702
01:32:19,165 --> 01:32:20,965
- <i>Come on, Ben.</i>
- Bye.

1703
01:32:20,967 --> 01:32:22,901
- He's persistent.
- He is.

1704
01:32:22,903 --> 01:32:24,102
But it's your story

1705
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:26,703
and you don't need
a media trial.

1706
01:32:26,705 --> 01:32:29,741
We should request full
disclosure of all legal advice

1707
01:32:29,743 --> 01:32:33,310
given by Goldsmith in the year
leading up to the invasion.

1708
01:32:33,312 --> 01:32:35,179
He'll almost certainly
refuse to comply.

1709
01:32:35,181 --> 01:32:37,148
Then we'll
subpoena Wilmshurst.

1710
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,085
Hell, we'll subpoena Goldsmith himself.
And Blair too.

1711
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:44,255
Ben, if we can't prove that
Goldsmith changed his advice,

1712
01:32:44,257 --> 01:32:48,062
we can't argue that Katharine
tried to stop an illegal war.

1713
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:49,897
What then?

1714
01:32:58,404 --> 01:33:02,275
- Then I'll be found guilty.
- Almost certainly, yes.

1715
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:12,684
So, do you want
to risk it all

1716
01:33:12,686 --> 01:33:17,889
and ask for disclosure
of the government's documents,

1717
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:19,323
or would you
rather plead guilty

1718
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:22,195
and hope
for a reduced sentence?

1719
01:33:30,303 --> 01:33:31,504
I think...

1720
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:36,644
...we were lied
into an illegal war.

1721
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:44,584
Let's ask for the documents.

1722
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:52,159
All right.

1723
01:34:22,388 --> 01:34:23,988
You ready?

1724
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,889
No statements now,
remember.

1725
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:27,627
Let's just get through
those doors.

1726
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:53,151
- Katharine, you okay?
- Yeah.

1727
01:34:53,153 --> 01:34:54,986
Ben's already
in the courtroom

1728
01:34:54,988 --> 01:34:57,255
but he wanted you to
meet Martin Bright.

1729
01:34:57,257 --> 01:34:59,724
Uh, he's covering the trial.

1730
01:34:59,726 --> 01:35:01,526
Katharine, it's an honor.

1731
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:04,161
I'll be in the press gallery.
I hope that's all right?

1732
01:35:04,163 --> 01:35:06,965
Yeah, uh, yeah. You...

1733
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:09,600
You took a real risk.

1734
01:35:09,602 --> 01:35:11,368
No, you took the risk.

1735
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,938
I think what you did
was extraordinary.

1736
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,673
I think what you exposed
was extraordinary.

1737
01:35:15,675 --> 01:35:17,375
All our institutions
failed us.

1738
01:35:17,377 --> 01:35:19,210
The government,
the intelligence services,

1739
01:35:19,212 --> 01:35:22,346
the press,
they failed us categorically.

1740
01:35:22,348 --> 01:35:25,183
Even my own paper supported
the war before that memo.

1741
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:26,718
Well, thank you
for being here.

1742
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,819
No, thank you.

1743
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:32,159
It's important what you did.
It matters.

1744
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:36,094
- We should go in, Martin.
- Yes.

1745
01:35:36,096 --> 01:35:39,700
Sorry, James. Yes.
Uh, be strong.

1746
01:35:42,302 --> 01:35:44,801
Katharine,
you're going that way.

1747
01:35:44,803 --> 01:35:46,670
Uh, can I just have a moment?

1748
01:35:46,672 --> 01:35:48,474
- Of course.
- Thanks.

1749
01:35:51,511 --> 01:35:53,577
You should leave that
behind, ma'am.

1750
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:56,315
Uh, yeah, sorry,
can I just have a second? Just...

1751
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:08,425
<i>Janum?</i>

1752
01:36:08,427 --> 01:36:11,664
Hi. Um, I'm about to go in.

1753
01:36:15,735 --> 01:36:17,104
I love you.

1754
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,671
I love you too.

1755
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:24,709
Uh, I'm gonna try
and call as soon as I can.

1756
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:26,579
<i>I wish I was there with you.</i>

1757
01:36:29,716 --> 01:36:31,084
I know.

1758
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:33,651
I'm so sorry.

1759
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:36,256
<i>You have nothing
to be sorry for.</i>

1760
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:41,127
I'm so proud of you.
So proud of you.

1761
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,399
Bye.

1762
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:48,135
Bye.

1763
01:36:54,106 --> 01:36:55,641
Miss?

1764
01:36:56,943 --> 01:36:58,145
Sorry.

1765
01:36:58,811 --> 01:37:00,478
I can take your bag.

1766
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,117
- We'll see you in there, okay?
- Yeah.

1767
01:37:34,379 --> 01:37:37,217
Your scarf and jacket,
please.

1768
01:37:42,521 --> 01:37:45,591
Okay, and then
if you'll raise your arms.

1769
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:00,507
Okay.

1770
01:38:05,811 --> 01:38:06,946
She's here.

1771
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:09,813
Right. Okay.

1772
01:38:09,815 --> 01:38:10,950
Judge is ready.

1773
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,428
Up you go.

1774
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,285
Are you
Katharine Teresa Gun?

1775
01:38:47,287 --> 01:38:48,419
Yes.

1776
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:52,156
I'm sorry.
Can you speak up, please?

1777
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:53,523
Yes, I am.

1778
01:38:53,525 --> 01:38:56,126
"Katharine Teresa Gun,

1779
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,560
"you are charged
with an offense

1780
01:38:57,562 --> 01:39:00,698
"contrary to Section 1,
Subsection 1

1781
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:04,501
"of the Official Secrets Act
of 1989.

1782
01:39:04,503 --> 01:39:08,673
"In that between January 30
and March 2 of 2003

1783
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:11,309
"you did knowingly
and intentionally

1784
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:14,245
"disclose top secret
intelligence information

1785
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:16,714
"contrary to the said act."

1786
01:39:16,716 --> 01:39:20,654
How do you plead?
Guilty or not guilty?

1787
01:39:22,989 --> 01:39:24,357
Ms. Gun?

1788
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,893
Not guilty.

1789
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,435
Yes, Mr. Ellison.

1790
01:39:39,204 --> 01:39:41,374
Yes, thank you, My Lord.

1791
01:39:42,374 --> 01:39:46,111
My Lord, in light of
recent developments,

1792
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,478
the prosecution
will offer no evidence

1793
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,215
against the defendant
on this indictment.

1794
01:39:52,852 --> 01:39:54,520
I beg your pardon?

1795
01:39:56,823 --> 01:40:00,291
My Lord, the prosecution will
not pursue the indictment.

1796
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:01,561
Today?

1797
01:40:02,495 --> 01:40:04,862
- No, My Lord.
- I'm sorry.

1798
01:40:04,864 --> 01:40:08,368
Are you asking for
an adjournment, Mr. Ellison?

1799
01:40:09,334 --> 01:40:10,701
No, My Lord.

1800
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:12,803
You are saying
that you do not wish

1801
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:15,907
to proceed at all?

1802
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:17,274
Yes, My Lord.

1803
01:40:17,276 --> 01:40:19,645
But the accused confessed.

1804
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,844
Yes, My Lord.

1805
01:40:21,846 --> 01:40:24,615
And yet you do not
wish to proceed?

1806
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:26,416
- No, My Lord.
- I'm sorry.

1807
01:40:26,418 --> 01:40:28,486
I find that extraordinary.

1808
01:40:28,488 --> 01:40:30,524
Do you care to explain?

1809
01:40:33,025 --> 01:40:36,559
My Lord, the accused
submitted an unusual defense.

1810
01:40:36,561 --> 01:40:39,162
Yes. The defense of necessity.

1811
01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:40,798
- Yes.
- And?

1812
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,167
And we do not believe we have
sufficient evidence to rebut it.

1813
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,036
Why not? She confessed.

1814
01:40:46,038 --> 01:40:47,639
Because, My Lord,

1815
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,642
the documents that
we have called for would show

1816
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:54,045
that this country was taken
to war illegally...

1817
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:57,915
...and may expose

1818
01:40:57,917 --> 01:41:01,452
the government to
charges of war crimes.

1819
01:41:01,454 --> 01:41:03,890
- That is absurd!
- Is it?

1820
01:41:05,624 --> 01:41:07,692
Then kindly hand over
the documents

1821
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:10,661
that we have asked to see.

1822
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:12,429
My Lord, the prosecution
is not obliged.

1823
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:15,765
Indeed, it is not permitted to continue
with a case if it does not believe

1824
01:41:15,767 --> 01:41:18,368
there is a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1825
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,604
To do so would be a waste
of taxpayers' funds.

1826
01:41:20,606 --> 01:41:22,473
My Lord, I am thankful

1827
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:25,643
that the charges against
Ms. Gun are being withdrawn

1828
01:41:25,645 --> 01:41:28,277
and that the Crown
is suddenly so determined

1829
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:30,480
not to waste taxpayers' money.

1830
01:41:30,482 --> 01:41:33,718
But surely,
after months of uncertainty

1831
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,022
and severe distress,
Ms. Gun is entitled to know

1832
01:41:38,024 --> 01:41:40,925
why the government
is dropping this case?

1833
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:44,194
Indeed, the public
is entitled to know.

1834
01:41:44,196 --> 01:41:45,998
- Hear, hear.
- Hear.

1835
01:41:48,534 --> 01:41:50,069
Mr. Ellison?

1836
01:41:53,338 --> 01:41:55,005
Again, My Lord, we do not feel

1837
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:57,908
we have a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1838
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,046
There is nothing more
I can say.

1839
01:42:01,047 --> 01:42:02,580
To be clear,

1840
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:06,750
you are withdrawing
all charges

1841
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:09,489
against
Katharine Teresa Gun?

1842
01:42:12,525 --> 01:42:13,657
Yes, My Lord.

1843
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:25,872
Ms. Gun...

1844
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:32,813
...you are free to go.

1845
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:11,215
<i>In a startling about-turn,

01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:02,767
Would you do it again?

1866
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,801
- Would you do it again?
- I have no regrets.

1867
01:44:04,803 --> 01:44:07,039
Yes, and I would
do it again, yes.

1868
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:23,990
Caught anything?

1869
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:26,626
Not yet.

1870
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:44,010
You know, it wasn't
my choice to prosecute.

1871
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:49,348
I was bound by the decision
of the Attorney General.

1872
01:44:50,748 --> 01:44:54,152
Why did you keep her
in a state of distress

1873
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:58,721
for a year
before you brought charges?

1874
01:44:58,723 --> 01:45:02,492
The services wanted to make
an example of her.

1875
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:05,429
If we dropped the case
any earlier,

1876
01:45:05,431 --> 01:45:08,133
what kind of message
would that have sent?

1877
01:45:13,138 --> 01:45:15,007
Do me a favor, Ken.

1878
01:45:15,675 --> 01:45:17,744
Go and fish somewhere else.

1879
01:45:51,244 --> 01:45:56,244
