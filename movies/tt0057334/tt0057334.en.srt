2
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,330
I really don't think we'll be
very welcome here, Miss Marple.

3
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,911
I know Mr. Enderby's rich...

4
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,658
...but he's, well, rather eccentric,
to say the least.

5
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,589
He may close his door on the world,
Mr. Stringer...

6
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:16,295
...but he must expect it
to be knocked on sometimes.

7
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:19,469
He's never been known to give
anything away. Not even to charity.

8
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:22,176
Well, perhaps the poor man's
never been given the chance.

9
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,101
I really must be getting back
to the library, Miss Marple.

10
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,554
It's a very worthy cause, no doubt,
but my employers...

11
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,723
Surely, you're entitled to your tea?

12
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:35,561
- Yes, but I haven't had it.
- Oh, but you shall.

13
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,023
This will be our last call. After that,
you must come back to my cottage.

14
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,241
I've prepared a very special tea
to reward us for our labors.

15
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:50,369
Perhaps I'd better leave him to you,
Miss Marple, if you don't mind.

16
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:53,664
Now, pull yourself together.
He can't eat us, can he?

17
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,412
No, I suppose not.

18
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:01,470
- He must be out.
- You know he never goes anywhere.

19
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,729
Mr. Enderby?

20
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,437
Mr. Enderby?

21
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,373
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Enderby.
We've just...

22
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,335
Oh, my.

23
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,634
My goodness.
What could have happened?

24
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,471
How is he?

25
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,853
Dead, I'm afraid.

26
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,657
- What is it?
- Well, it's a piece of mud.

27
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,320
From some recent visitor, apparently.

28
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,744
Who still seems to be here.

29
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,920
- Stay with him.
- Miss Marple, you mustn't.

30
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,917
Please be careful.

31
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,207
- What was it?
- A cat.

32
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,661
But I thought...
I thought he hated cats.

33
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,296
He did.

34
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,207
He was frightened to death of them.

35
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,873
Frightened to death?

36
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:26,277
Why, Miss Marple,
this is an unexpected pleasure.

37
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,906
Oh, good morning, inspector.

38
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,078
Could I have a few words
with you? Privately?

39
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:36,744
Well, yes, of course.
Do come in, please. Here.

40
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,411
Well, do sit down, Miss Marple. Please.

41
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,083
Now, what can I do for you?

42
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:45,424
You're not here to tell me I've overlooked
another crime, by any chance?

43
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:49,378
Well, as a matter of fact I am.
A very grave crime.

44
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:52,593
- One of murder.
- Oh, no. Not again. Please.

45
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,926
This time there is no mistake, inspector.

46
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,852
Well, you might as well get it over with.
Who murdered who? This time?

47
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:03,944
As to the murderer, that will
naturally require an investigation.

48
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,279
The victim is old Mr. Enderby.

49
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,901
Enderby? What are you talking about?
He died of heart failure.

50
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,407
But what caused his heart
to fail so unexpectedly?

51
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,957
I read the doctor's report, Miss Marple.
It was not unexpected.

52
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,252
He'd had a severe heart condition
for many years.

53
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:27,334
Exactly. A very wealthy man
with a chronic heart condition.

54
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:30,631
Yes, the circumstances
are precisely the same.

55
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:36,636
I don't know what they're the same as,
but they don't add up to murder.

56
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,057
But surely, inspector...

57
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,442
...you have read Agatha Christie's
remarkable novel <i>The Ninth Life?</i>

58
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,147
I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure.

59
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,894
That's probably why you failed
to make the connection.

60
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:51,988
Agatha Christie should be
compulsory reading for the police force.

61
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,162
Doom came to her victim
in the shape of a cat.

62
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,370
Now, look, Miss Marple,
enough is enough.

63
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,411
A wealthy old gentleman...

64
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,835
...with a weak heart
and a pathological horror of cats.

65
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,294
What easier than
for some interested party...

66
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,090
...to slip a cat into the house?

67
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,710
A cat that the old man
will come upon unexpectedly.

68
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,837
Yes, old Enderby
was frightened to death.

69
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,848
A very ingenious theory...

70
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,270
...but my advice to you, Miss Marple,
is to read fewer thrillers.

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,061
A nice love story would be
much more soothing.

72
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:27,188
Am I to assume that you are not
going to do anything about this?

73
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,607
Nothing whatever.

74
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,730
You see, I'm a policeman, Miss Marple.
I'm only interested in facts.

75
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,451
Well, then. There is only
one course open to me.

76
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,750
- Now, wait a minute, Miss Marple.
- No, inspector, I know my duty.

77
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,203
I shall have to investigate this myself.

78
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,546
Good day.

79
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:51,421
You will hear from me again
when my case is completed.

80
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,728
Oh, my pastry.

81
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,534
They look good.

82
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:20,916
Oh, dear.

83
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,491
Not one of my failures,
as you are thinking.

84
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,958
Deliberate, I assure you.

85
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,542
I cooked the piece of mud we found
in old Enderby's house...

86
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,549
...and then filled the hole with plaster.

87
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,931
Lo and behold...

88
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,888
...preserved in plaster forever.

89
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,346
I see. Ingenious, Miss Marple.

90
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,562
'Tis rather, isn't it?

91
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,600
Though I'm bound to say it went
against the grain to overcook my pastry.

92
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,605
A perfect match.

93
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,529
- What do you make of this?
- The mark of a stirrup iron.

94
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,026
- Then it was mud from a riding boot.
- Yes.

95
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,619
And from a boot with
a very distinctive scar on it.

96
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,791
That piece of fresh mud
was stuck between the sole and heel...

97
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,335
...of someone's riding boot.

98
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:10,371
Someone who visited Mr. Enderby
just before he died.

99
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,794
The murderer, you mean?

100
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,627
Well, we can hardly call him that...

101
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,637
...since it hasn't been officially decided
that he was murdered.

102
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:20,673
True. But when Inspector Craddock
has had time to consider your theory...

103
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:25,394
Inspector Craddock has assured me that
that is exactly what he is not going to do.

104
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,438
No, Jim...

105
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:32,610
...you and I must pursue this trail
entirely on our own.

106
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,938
Then where shall we begin?

107
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,116
We must find out
who benefits by the death.

108
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,369
Then we'll have to wait till the will
is published in the newspapers.

109
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:45,287
Not necessarily. Not necessarily.

110
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,191
- That's the lot, Fred.
- Right. Tea's up. I'll see you inside.

111
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,616
Right.

112
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,159
Fortune favors the brave.

113
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:29,242
- I beg your pardon?
- That dray, under the very window.

114
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,548
This calls for
a certain amount of ingenuity.

115
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,971
- We have to get up there.
- What if anyone should see us?

116
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,768
We're effectively screened from
the high street by the archway.

117
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,685
Come along.

118
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,489
I feel we're taking a grave risk
of seeming inquisitive.

119
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,246
A calculated one, Mr. Stringer.
On we go.

120
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,913
I trust something pithy will be said,
after all this.

121
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:16,625
Oh, dear. Here we are.

122
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,507
And though it is with some regret...

123
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:23,047
...that I finally satisfy
the greed of my relatives...

124
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:27,885
...I nevertheless do devise
and bequeath that my entire estate...

125
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:33,601
...be divided equally between
my fourth cousin, George Crossfield...

126
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,608
...in order that he no longer need borrow
from his clients' funds...

127
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,196
...my niece, Rosamund Shane...

128
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,569
...in order that she may support
her husband...

129
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:48,322
...in the style to which
he would like to be accustomed...

130
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,919
...to my nephew, Hector Enderby,
in order that he may be able...

131
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,131
...to afford to hunt every day,
rather than once a week...

132
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:02,008
...thereby providing more opportunity
for breaking his neck...

133
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,722
...and finally, my sister,
Cora Lansquenet...

134
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,811
...out of gratitude that
she stayed out of the country...

135
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,933
...for 30 years and didn't bother me.

136
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:19,484
The money to be given outright
to all parties concerned...

137
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:24,151
...with the hope that it will make them all
as miserable as possible.

138
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:28,076
That is the important part
as far as you're concerned, I'm sure.

139
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,782
No, Mr. Trundell, the important part
is, how much money am I going to get?

140
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,039
I don't think you should say
things like that, even if it's how you feel.

141
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,336
Why not? I want to know.

142
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,547
Of course, we all want to know.

143
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:44,336
Well, a rough estimate...
Mind you, very rough.

144
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:50,017
Each of your shares should be about
20, 25,000 pounds.

145
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:55,558
Hector, I don't think you should have
used the word "suddenly"...

146
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,603
...in the newspaper announcement
of your uncle's death.

147
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:03,570
- What do you mean, Aunt Cora?
- Well, it might make people wonder.

148
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,327
But anyway, it's all been hushed up
very nicely, hasn't it?

149
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,535
What are you talking about?

150
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,788
Well, after what he said
when he came to see me last month...

151
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,795
...it can't do any good making it public.

152
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,964
It should be kept
strictly in the family.

153
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,706
My dear, Mrs. Lansquenet,
would you mind saying plainly...

154
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,377
...what you mean by all this?

155
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,009
- But he was murdered, wasn't he?
- What?

156
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,221
Really, Aunt Cora,
that's a very silly thing to say.

157
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,852
Good morning.

158
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,222
Oh, good morning, inspector.

159
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,441
Thank you.

160
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,985
Miss Marple, when I thought it was you,
I thought, "No."

161
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,238
But it is.

162
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,776
- Allow me.
- Oh, thank you.

163
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,831
Miss Marple, you do realize
if I didn't know you so well...

164
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:37,449
...I would at this moment
be detaining you for loitering with intent.

165
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,161
Loitering with intent to what,
conceivably, inspector?

166
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,880
To snoop.

167
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,627
- Snoop?
- That is the word I used, Miss Marple.

168
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,258
I'm sure everyone in Milchester
is interested to know...

169
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,671
...how much Old Enderby had left,
and to whom.

170
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,422
I suppose you wanted to be first.

171
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,799
Well, inspector...

172
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,561
...since you are clearly alleging
that I am a tittle-tattling busybody...

173
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,350
...I will bid you good day.
Come, Mr. Stringer.

174
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,663
Miss Marple, don't you think
you should go to the police...

175
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,166
...tell Inspector Craddock
what you overheard and...?

176
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:23,502
"Tittle-tattling busybody,"
I believe were his words.

177
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,756
- No, yours.
- His meaning.

178
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,298
- Well, perhaps now...
- Please, Mr. Stringer...

179
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,514
...after this morning, I prefer not
to mention Inspector Craddock.

180
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,639
Well, anyway,
no matter what he thinks...

181
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,344
...after what Mrs. Lansquenet said,
at least we know we were right.

182
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,815
- Mr. Enderby was murdered.
- And we know the motive.

183
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,234
Twenty-five thousand pounds
to each of the family.

184
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,729
Yes, and it's a great deal of money.

185
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,201
- And since they all benefit...
- They are all suspect, true.

186
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,243
But a motive isn't enough.

187
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:00,078
Facts are what we want.
Otherwise, we're groping in the dark.

188
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,996
No, we must set to work to find out
all we can about the entire family.

189
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,964
Mrs. Heyley-Brown?

190
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,501
Yes. Always a good starting place.

191
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:12,836
Of course, I disapprove
of her gossiping...

192
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,678
...but in a desperate situation
one must use the means at hand.

193
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,558
- Oh, yes.
- What is more...

194
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,812
...I suggest we start at once.

195
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,558
Surely you realize why.

196
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,778
Have you and I ever read a murder thriller
that stops at a single killing?

197
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,572
- Then, you mean...?
- Yes, the killer may strike again.

198
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,909
I hadn't thought of that.
Perhaps, after all, the police...

199
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,662
We will go to the police
when our case is complete.

200
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,913
They have their methods, we have ours.

201
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,664
Yes, and moreover I'm told
that Cora Lansquenet...

202
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,421
...did not return to Milchester
just for the funeral.

203
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,427
After living in France
for a number of years...

204
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,295
...two months ago she rented a cottage
a few miles from here.

205
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,309
And that's where her brother,
Mr. Enderby, visited her.

206
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,596
Yes, and the vicar maintains
that he was a recluse.

207
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,141
- He hadn't left the country for 30 years.
- Yes, I heard that too.

208
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,483
- And Mrs. Heyley-Brown...
- Always a mine of information.

209
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,820
...says Cora Lansquenet
needed that inheritance badly...

210
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,324
...because, before he died,
her husband ran through all her money...

211
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,118
...buying worthless paintings.

212
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,493
Yes, all very useful.

213
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,745
But it still doesn't tell us why
she thinks her brother was murdered.

214
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,710
Perhaps she wasn't telling the truth.

215
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,082
- Why should she lie?
- Well, she did marry a Frenchman.

216
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,342
- A painter too.
- Yes, and a very bad one.

217
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,084
Still, that doesn't make her
completely irresponsible.

218
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,090
No, not completely.

219
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,133
Do you know, I think it's time
I had my portrait painted.

220
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,770
Your portrait, Miss Marple?

221
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,310
Yes. I'm going
to call on Cora Lansquenet.

222
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,309
Just as an excuse, mind you.

223
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,271
We must find out what
her brother said to her that day...

224
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,446
...that makes her so sure
he was murdered.

225
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,193
I'll be back to tea.

226
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,151
Perhaps you'll be so kind
as to get it ready for us.

227
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,934
Mrs. Lansquenet?

228
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,163
Mrs. Lansquenet,
I'm sorry to disturb you...

229
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,455
Mrs. Lansquenet?

230
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,484
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Well, I was...

231
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,325
And what's the matter
with Mrs. Lansquenet?

232
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,493
I'm afraid she's dead.

233
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,245
Dead? But...

234
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,700
You killed her. You killed her.

235
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,083
- My dear woman...
- Don't you touch me.

236
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,127
You killed her.
I saw you bending over her.

237
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,420
My dear woman,
do I look like a murderess?

238
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,165
Well, I don't know what you look like,
but I saw you.

239
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,298
What you saw or didn't see
isn't of much point at the moment.

240
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,963
We have to call the police.
Where's the telephone?

241
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,850
There it is.

242
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,260
But you haven't yet told me
who you are.

243
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,853
I'm Mrs. Lansquenet's companion,
Miss Milchrest.

244
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,318
Hello?

245
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,027
Yes, I can hear you're talking,
but you'll have to stop talking.

246
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,198
Yes, I know it's a party line,
but this is an emergency.

247
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,775
I have to call the police.

248
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,363
You needn't be sarcastic, young man.

249
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,160
Indeed I have a crime to report.

250
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,785
Murder. Murder most foul.

251
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,309
- Good afternoon, inspector.
- Miss Marple.

252
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,890
Yes, I have some tittle-tattle to convey.
Do come in.

253
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,410
- That's about all we need, sir.
- Fine, thanks.

254
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,903
Let me have a lab report
on that as soon as possible.

255
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,488
All right, sir.
Funny weapon to use.

256
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,074
Yes, a woman's weapon.

257
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,503
Or a man's, wishing everyone
to think it was a woman's.

258
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,501
I wasn't precluding that possibility,
Miss Marple.

259
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,377
The lady says she feels
well enough to talk now, sir.

260
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,013
Right, bring her in.

261
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,257
Well, Miss Marple,
I won't keep you any longer.

262
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,434
It's quite all right, inspector.
I'm entirely at your disposal.

263
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,931
You don't suspect her, do you?

264
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,596
Well, she was here,
the weapon was a hatpin...

265
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,691
True, but would anyone make
themselves so obvious a suspect?

266
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,817
There have been stupid murderers.

267
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,068
She's a timid woman, inspector,
not a stupid one.

268
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,823
By the way, I think you ought to know
that this morning...

269
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,954
Not now, Miss Marple, please.

270
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,366
Oh, Miss Milchrest, sit down, won't you?

271
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,662
Oh, dear. I've never had anything
to do with the police before.

272
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,792
There's nothing to worry about, my dear.
They're really very nice.

273
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,626
Thank you, Miss Marple.

274
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,470
Now, I understand you've been
Mrs. Lansquenet's companion...

275
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,713
...for many years now.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

276
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,683
I know this must be
a great shock to you...

277
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,558
...but there are things we need to know.

278
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,435
- Well, l... I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.

279
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,859
- Now, when did you see her last?
- Just before I went to the library.

280
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,692
- What time was that?
- I caught the 2:00 bus.

281
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,116
I'd say she's been dead
about two hours.

282
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,444
It's now 4:30. So about 2:30.

283
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,742
The coroner will be able
to be a bit more exact.

284
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:40,370
Isn't it extremely difficult to determine
the exact time of death, inspector?

285
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,496
We'll do our best to be
as accurate as possible, Miss Marple.

286
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,756
Before you left her, did she seem
nervous or upset in any way?

287
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,178
No, she was fine.
She was just getting ready to go out.

288
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,345
Miss Milchrest, have you any idea at all
who may have killed her?

289
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,393
Aside from your
suspicions of Miss Marple, I mean.

290
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,605
Anyone else? Anyone who hated her?

291
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,611
Oh, no, she was kind to everyone.

292
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,356
She was very kind to me.

293
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,241
She told me she was going
to leave me her amethyst brooch...

294
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,155
...and one of her own paintings
as a remembrance.

295
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,990
She painted very well, don't you think?

296
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,664
Yes. Yes, indeed.

297
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,790
Miss Milchrest,
did she have any visitors lately?

298
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,707
No, we live very quietly, really.

299
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,376
But did none of her relatives ever
call on her...

300
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,261
...after her return to this country?

301
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,838
Only her brother.
Her late brother, I mean.

302
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,890
He called about a month ago.

303
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,104
But in latter years
he hardly ever left his home.

304
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,646
Was that for any special reason?

305
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,310
Well, yes. You see, they'd been
estranged for a number of years.

306
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,237
After her husband died,
she needed help financially.

307
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,650
She wrote to him.

308
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,234
- Were you present when he called?
- Oh, no.

309
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:58,077
Did you by any chance overhear
anything they said to each other?

310
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,782
Do you suppose I'm the sort of woman
who listens at keyholes? Of course not.

311
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

312
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,373
I just wondered if you might have
happened to overhear something.

313
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,250
I didn't hear a thing.

314
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,341
Miss Marple, I think I'm capable
of asking any relevant questions.

315
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,790
So sorry, inspector.

316
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,215
Thank you, Miss Milchrest.

317
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,223
If you'd be good enough to make
a statement to Sergeant Bacon...

318
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,589
...we'll talk again later.

319
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,676
Sergeant,
you'd better notify the relatives.

320
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,596
The solicitor should have the addresses.

321
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,598
- Right, sir.
- Mrs. Lansquenet told me...

322
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,940
...they were all staying
with Mr. Hector Enderby for a few days.

323
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,316
- That's at the Gallop Hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.

324
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,646
It is also a riding establishment.

325
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:37,983
Miss Milchrest, did you
or did Mrs. Lansquenet ever ride?

326
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,570
- Ride?
- Horses, you know.

327
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,082
- No.
- Thank you.

328
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,870
Well, I won't detain you, inspector.

329
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,746
But I suggest that you pay a call
on the family as soon as possible.

330
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,668
Oh, you do, do you? And why?

331
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,378
Well, I think you ought to know that
at the reading of the will this morning...

332
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,138
...Cora Lansquenet said that
her brother had been murdered.

333
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,642
What? How did you know...?

334
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,183
Oh, yes, of course.
You happened to overhear, didn't you?

335
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,979
As you say, I overheard.

336
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,191
May I ask why
you didn't tell me this before?

337
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,818
Well, I did try to tell you earlier,
but you wouldn't let me.

338
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,530
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. So I didn't.

339
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,660
Don't you think it a trifle coincidental...

340
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,996
...that she should have been murdered
so soon after making that statement?

341
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,214
Yes.

342
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,424
A little too coincidental.

343
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,925
Unless someone in the family...

344
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,345
...thought that Cora not only knew
her brother had been murdered...

345
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,139
...but who murdered him.

346
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,893
Yes.

347
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:48,230
Moreover, that poor woman
is in a very dangerous position.

348
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,679
- Miss Milchrest?
- Yes.

349
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,856
You see, if she did overhear what passed
between Cora and her brother...

350
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,022
...and the murderer suspected it...

351
00:26:56,198 --> 00:27:01,275
...she's likely to receive
the same treatment that Cora did.

352
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,824
Well, I'll have to leave you now,
I'm afraid, inspector, to go and pack.

353
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,036
- Pack?
- Yes, I'm going on a short holiday.

354
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,539
Good day.

355
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:16,041
A very good idea, Miss Marple.
I hope you have a most enjoyable time.

356
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:50,283
- Mr. Enderby, Inspector Craddock.
- This way, sir.

357
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,251
I'll be in touch with you.

358
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,294
Miss Marple, I'm still not
absolutely happy about this.

359
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,679
- I feel if I could be with...
- Now, Mr. Stringer...

360
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,010
...we have agreed that a non-rider
in a place like this would be conspicuous.

361
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,260
Besides, the police are here.

362
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,851
Purely as a matter of routine,
you understand...

363
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,180
...I'd like an account
of all your movements...

364
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,434
...between 2:00 and 4:00
yesterday afternoon.

365
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,898
You're not suggesting
it was one of the family...

366
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,897
...that put poor Auntie Cora down?

367
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,824
I'm not suggesting anything, sir.
I'm merely making inquiries.

368
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,115
Extremely offensive ones,
I have to say.

369
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,859
I'm sorry. I find murder offensive too.

370
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,823
Good heavens. Why would any of us do
a dreadful thing like that...

371
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:31,079
...to an old woman?

372
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,128
Well, one suggestion
that's been put forward is...

373
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,459
...to keep her quiet.

374
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,084
About what?

375
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,502
Well, it seems she made
a statement yesterday morning.

376
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,378
A statement to the effect that
your uncle, Mr. Enderby, was murdered.

377
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,138
How on earth did you find that out?

378
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,348
I think that's irrelevant, don't you, sir?

379
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,348
I take it no one is denying
Mrs. Lansquenet did say it?

380
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,488
Very well, then. There's one motive.
There could be others.

381
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,865
May I start with you, Mr. Shane?

382
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,450
Yes, all right. But I'm afraid
I can't give you an alibi...

383
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,495
...if that's what you're looking for.

384
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,159
Yesterday...

385
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,334
Well, I was out riding all afternoon.

386
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,246
- Alone, sir?
- Quite alone.

387
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,506
Where?

388
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,793
I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough
with the neighborhood to tell you.

389
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,174
But familiar enough with it
to find your way back?

390
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,089
The horse did.

391
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,091
And did you meet anyone
when you were out?

392
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,804
No, I'm afraid not. I wish I had.

393
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,934
Yes, so do I.

394
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,727
Now what about you, Mr. Crossfield?

395
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,021
Well, I was out riding too,
as a matter of fact.

396
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,648
- I see.
- I didn't meet anyone either.

397
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,363
Very well, then. And I suppose
you were out riding too, Mr. Enderby?

398
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,573
No, I was in here all the afternoon.

399
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,404
Were you, Hector?

400
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,330
I tried the door and it was locked.
I thought you were out.

401
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,499
I locked the door.
I didn't want to be disturbed.

402
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:58,582
- What were you doing?
- I was doing my accounts.

403
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,710
I see. Very well.

404
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:06,554
- And you, Mrs. Shane?
- We all seem to have pretty feeble alibis.

405
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,047
I was in my room too.

406
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,760
All afternoon?

407
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,176
Yes, except when I went
to look for Hector.

408
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,552
I was reading.

409
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,597
Did any of the staff see you when
you came here looking for Mr. Enderby?

410
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,652
No.

411
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,271
I must say, inspector, 'tis unusual
for an English woman to prefer reading...

412
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,698
...when she could be riding,
but it is possible.

413
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,739
- I didn't say it wasn't.
- Well, then I hope you're satisfied.

414
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:34,578
I'm far from satisfied, Mr. Enderby.
But we'll leave it for the moment.

415
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,083
I'd appreciate it if you'll all make
detailed statements to Sergeant Bacon.

416
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,796
And keep yourselves available.

417
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,501
I'll be with the chief constable
for the next hour or so.

418
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,714
- Yes, sir.
- Just one moment, inspector.

419
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,008
Does that mean that
you want us all to stay here?

420
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,014
I'm afraid so, Mr. Crossfield.
At least until after the inquest.

421
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,132
- But I have to go up north tomorrow.
- I'm sorry, that isn't possible.

422
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,762
It's an important sale, inspector.
Lord Fotherway's picture collection.

423
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,640
Every dealer in the country will be there,
and I have a client for the Gainsborough.

424
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,689
You also have a partner, I understand.

425
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,815
Does that mean
you've been checking up on me?

426
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
Merely routine, Mr. Crossfield.

427
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,325
Your partner can handle the sale,
can't he?

428
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,986
- Yes, but...
- That's fine. Good day.

429
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,284
Now, sir, perhaps
I can deal with you first.

430
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,369
- There's something I want to tell you.
- Yes?

431
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,913
Well, ask you, really.
I'm trying to run a business here.

432
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,092
It's not very nice having a police car
parked outside the front door.

433
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,594
If you find it necessary to come again,
you might come a bit more incognito.

434
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,433
- Nothing else?
- That enough, isn't it?

435
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,259
Yes, Mr. Enderby, it is.
Good morning.

436
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,273
- Do you see that?
- Can't really miss it, can you?

437
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,643
It's a Broadbreech side saddle.
Broadbreech of Northampton.

438
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,024
- Vintage too. Well, have a look.
- What?

439
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:48,730
Have a look at the date.
Behind the stirrup bar.

440
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,945
Well, it says...

441
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:56,241
No, don't tell me, I'll tell you: 1882.

442
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,988
No, I'm lying to you, 1885.

443
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,919
- Right.
- I can tell you who it belongs to too.

444
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,381
I've only glimpsed one of these once
in the whole country. Lady Curthbrackle.

445
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,794
No, it...

446
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,388
- It belongs to...
- Me, Mr. Enderby.

447
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,881
Morning, inspector.
My mama's, of course.

448
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,636
My dear lady, it's magnificent.

449
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,645
I do hope you have an animal
to accommodate it and me.

450
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,355
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

451
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:25,272
Oh, how nice. I booked in
for a week, don't you know.

452
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,017
Well, inspector, how nice
to see you again after so long.

453
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:31,233
- So long?
- Yes, it must be months.

454
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,864
- Yes, quite.
- I'm delighted, Miss Marple.

455
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,574
I never dreamt that
you aspired to be one of us.

456
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,534
Well, I have done some riding
in my time, you know.

457
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,457
Junior Silver Spurs, Brockbrook, 1910.

458
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,128
Junior Silver, Brockbrook, 1910?
Miss J.T.V. Marple?

459
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,541
- Miss Marple, l...
- You... No, please, inspector.

460
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,388
But to think that we've
been neighbors for years.

461
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,176
You must let me take you in to lunch.
You'll lunch with me.

462
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,840
- Of course.
- 1910. What a year that must have been.

463
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,553
You must have seen
Harry Devenish in his prime. Yes?

464
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,652
- Mr. Enderby.
- So sorry to have kept you waiting.

465
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,445
I said I would wait.
I didn't want to disturb you at lunch.

466
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,453
Well, that was kind of you.
Won't you come in?

467
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,203
We must find somewhere
to bed you down.

468
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,201
- Bed me down?
- Get you a room.

469
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,246
- Won't you sit down?
- How very kind of you.

470
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,421
Nonsense. You couldn't possibly
have stayed in the cottage...

471
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,168
...after what happened.

472
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,462
No, I couldn't. I just couldn't.

473
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,297
That's why I'm so grateful.

474
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,844
It's a pleasure, dear lady.

475
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,389
A shock like this takes weeks
to get over.

476
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,936
A few gallops over the downs...

477
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,227
...will have you back
in the saddle in no time.

478
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,720
But I don't ride.

479
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,692
You don't ride?

480
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,860
Oh, we'll have to see to that,
won't we?

481
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,815
Perhaps whilst I'm here
there might be something I could do.

482
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:59,321
I can arrange the flowers
or be a hostess?

483
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,785
Yes, well, we'll talk about that later.

484
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,160
Yes, I mustn't keep you.

485
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,995
I'm sure you're very busy.

486
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,207
Perhaps someone could
show me to my room?

487
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,256
- I'll take you myself.
- No, don't bother.

488
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,261
I'll get the porter to take my things up.

489
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,888
Oh, Miss Milchrest?

490
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,592
Yes, Mr. Enderby?

491
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,339
There was something I wanted
to ask you. What was it now?

492
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,847
Oh, yes, of course.

493
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,555
The day that her brother
called on poor Aunt Cora...

494
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,436
...were you at the cottage?

495
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,648
Why, yes, I was.

496
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,812
You've no idea
what they were talking about?

497
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,446
Well, no.
Naturally, they wanted to be alone.

498
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,109
Oh, it's not important.
Thank you.

499
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,822
Oh, Miss Milchrest. Good morning.

500
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,624
How nice to see you again.

501
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,121
Good morning.

502
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,002
Don't look so frightened, my dear.

503
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,627
I've done my quota of murders today.

504
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,005
- Are you staying here?
- I am indeed.

505
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,457
Oh, I didn't know that.

506
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,092
A delightful surprise for you,
no doubt.

507
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:43,265
Incidentally, may I ask
what brings you here?

508
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,473
Oh, Mr. Hector's been very kind.

509
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,349
He invited me when he heard
I had to leave the cottage.

510
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,933
I really had no place to go.

511
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,396
- Mr. Hector invited you?
- Yes.

512
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,607
Well, I hope you
have a very pleasant stay.

513
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,854
- Thank you.
- Oh, by the way...

514
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:00,281
...I shouldn't tell the family
that I was in the cottage yesterday.

515
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,024
It might hinder the inspector's inquiries.

516
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,370
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

517
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,890
- Can I help you?
- Well, I was just admiring your boots.

518
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,388
They're quite beautiful.

519
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,470
I'm really envious.

520
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,137
Thank you. Goodbye.

521
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,360
- My dear lady. Feminine but practical.
- Thank you, Mr. Enderby.

522
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,825
When I'm behind one
of my lady guests in jodhpurs...

523
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,784
...I think what a shame it is
that elegance has disappeared...

524
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,239
...from the equestrian scene.

525
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,461
Oh, how graciously put.

526
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,042
Well, now for your preliminary canter.

527
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,093
Hello, George.
What are you staring at?

528
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,730
Come in, Rosamund.

529
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,855
What's so interesting down there,
anyway?

530
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,192
That old woman going off with Hector
is the one who found uncle's body.

531
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,983
- She arrived here yesterday.
- What of it?

532
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,612
I don't like people
prying into my affairs.

533
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,527
You are nervous, aren't you?

534
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:28,372
If you see Michael, will you tell him
I was looking for him?

535
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,123
Don't go for a moment, Rosamund.

536
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,698
Unless it makes you nervous
to be here alone with me.

537
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:35,873
And why should it?

538
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,414
Because you know
how attractive I find you.

539
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,545
Yes, I know that.

540
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,425
- Still only Michael?
- Of course.

541
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,631
And it doesn't bother you that
he married you for your expectations?

542
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:49,139
He didn't marry me.
I was the one who decided.

543
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,678
I knew I wanted him
from the first moment I saw him.

544
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,725
- Do you always get what you want?
- Of course.

545
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,275
I just take it.

546
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,608
You're a dangerous woman, Rosamund.

547
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,398
I hope you never want anything of mine.

548
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,318
You mean, like your money?

549
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,952
I don't, at the moment.

550
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,694
George, why were you
so anxious to get it?

551
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,664
Did you want it that desperately?

552
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,283
Let's just say I needed it pretty badly.

553
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,836
Are you in trouble again?

554
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:18,999
What the devil do you mean?

555
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,716
Clients of yours sometimes give you
money to buy pictures, don't they?

556
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:23,927
What of it?

557
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,461
It wouldn't be the first time
you borrowed some of it?

558
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,639
- Shut up.
- Don't get so angry.

559
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,089
I don't care.

560
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,924
Oh, George, have you...?

561
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,812
Oh, hello, Rosamund.

562
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,684
I was looking for you.

563
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,565
I was looking for you too, darling.

564
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,521
- I want to go for a drive.
- I thought we were going for a walk.

565
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:42,976
I want to go for a drive.

566
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,191
Well, all right then, we might as well.
See you later, George.

567
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,240
Bye, George.

568
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,428
Thank you.

569
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,094
Now, are you comfortable, Miss Marple?

570
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,925
Perfectly, thank you.

571
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,476
I thought Daisy would suit you.

572
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,143
When you get your seat back,
we'll put you on something a bit livelier.

573
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,642
Stand, Black Jack, stand.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

574
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,356
That's better. Come on.
You're nervous today, aren't you?

575
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,355
Careful, sir. He's in an ugly mood.

576
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,570
I can handle him.
Don't worry, Hillman.

577
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:31,739
- He'll throw you if he can, sir.
- Nonsense. Are we ready, Miss Marple?

578
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:35,283
- I am if you are.
- Yes.

579
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,073
He's high-spirited, you know,
but he's no problem to me.

580
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,039
Are you, old boy?
Come on, come on.

581
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,674
We shall have you in shape
in no time, Miss Marple.

582
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:47,796
A few days hacking along the lanes
shall have you cantering...

583
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,487
Hello, Hillman.

584
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:09,905
- You want something, Mr. George?
- Yes.

585
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,826
I'd like to have a little chat.

586
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,951
No time for a chat.
I've got my work to do.

587
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,200
Now, don't be insolent.

588
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,658
All I want is a little information
about Mr. Hector and that old lady.

589
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,992
You'll get no information out of me.

590
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,037
- Why not? Are you hiding something?
- No, I'm not.

591
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:29,343
- Now, let me get on with my work.
- Now, calm down, Hillman.

592
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:33,260
I think that old lady is trying
to make trouble for Mr. Hector.

593
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,801
- She'd better not.
- She might.

594
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:41,018
I think it would be worth your while
to keep an eye on her.

595
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,320
Whoa, boy, whoa. Steady. Steady.

596
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,901
It's a car coming
that seems to be unsettling him.

597
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,915
Can't stand the sound.
I don't blame him. They're a menace.

598
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,667
My foot. My foot.

599
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,715
What are you trying to do?
That was Hector.

600
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,179
- You trying to kill him?
- I wasn't anywhere near him.

601
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:15,258
Well, you nearly hit him.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

602
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:19,347
- What's the matter with you, darling?
- Look, will you slow down?

603
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,237
There. Is that better?

604
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:32,445
All right, Rosamund,
now what's all this about?

605
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,535
- What's all what about?
- You know darn well.

606
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:37,744
All right, so I lied to the policeman
that morning about riding.

607
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,407
What difference does it make?

608
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,618
Depends what you were doing.

609
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,034
Well, I had some business in the city.

610
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:47,295
Did you? I hope it was
to say goodbye to her.

611
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,923
I don't know what you're talking about.

612
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,634
Don't you?

613
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,677
Doesn't matter.
I know when you're lying.

614
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,091
I'm not lying.

615
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,972
Of course you're lying.

616
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,177
You lied about
where you were last week...

617
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:03,389
...when you went to see uncle
on the day he died.

618
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:08,016
- How did you know that?
- I know everything about you.

619
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,443
Now, look here, Rosamund, I don't like
having my movements checked up on.

620
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,772
Now, I mean that.
Don't push me too far.

621
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,191
But I like to know.

622
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,649
What happened?

623
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:20,497
Did you think your fatal charm
might loosen his purse strings?

624
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,372
Something like that, yes.

625
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,747
- And didn't they?
- No.

626
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,955
- And that's all?
- Of course that's all.

627
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,173
Then why not mention it?

628
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,293
I thought that after what happened,
people might think that I...

629
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:36,133
That they might think
that Aunt Cora was right?

630
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,930
Yes, they might think that.

631
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,655
How's the foot now, Mr. Enderby?

632
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,499
As well as can be expected
after a horse has stepped on it.

633
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,918
- I'll help you.
- Thank you, that won't be necessary.

634
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:10,669
But I insist, Mr. Enderby.
That boot must come off immediately.

635
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:20,348
All right, Black Jack. Whoa.
Come on, Black Jack.

636
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:23,766
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.
Is he all right?

637
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:27,178
- Well done.
- I can manage quite well now.

638
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:30,191
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.
Come along, leg up.

639
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,526
- Please don't trouble yourself.
- I assure you, it's no trouble at all.

640
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:36,447
The longer you wait,
the worse that swelling's going to be.

641
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,569
I propose to stand the whole thing
in cold water for an hour or so.

642
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:43,444
Useless, Mr. Enderby. Boot up.

643
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:47,368
Now, this may hurt a little when I pull.

644
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,662
But be brave. Be brave.

645
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:55,121
Come along, now. Take the strain.

646
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,379
Here we go.

647
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,761
Gently, gently.

648
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,595
Nearly off, Mr. Enderby.

649
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,898
There. Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?

650
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,190
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

651
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,864
- What's the matter?
- The colonel's not going to like this.

652
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,899
- The colonel?
- They're his boots.

653
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,446
I borrowed them this morning.

654
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:25,237
Some fool stable girl
upset paint all over mine.

655
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:26,737
Oh, did she?

656
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,620
No idea, of course, how to get it off.

657
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:34,210
Mr. Enderby, I think you'd be
better occupied bathing that foot.

658
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,330
Unless, of course,
you want it to swell even more.

659
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,920
Yes, perhaps you're right.

660
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,929
It'll be up like a balloon
in the morning anyway.

661
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,940
What the devil are you doing?

662
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,823
Mr. Hillman, how you startled me.

663
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,112
- What are you doing with those boots?
- Merely admiring them.

664
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:07,244
Fine old English leather.

665
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,612
Strong, yet supple.

666
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,830
Well, leave them alone from now on.

667
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:14,536
Hillman, that's no way to talk to a lady.
Now, get on with your work.

668
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,164
Well, I only came to tell you
Black Jack was back.

669
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,425
You mustn't worry about Hillman.

670
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:23,346
He's a surly chap,
but he's been with me for years.

671
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:25,506
Completely trustworthy.

672
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,514
Then his appearance
is extremely deceptive, Mr. Enderby.

673
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:33,684
Well, if you'll forgive me,
I really must have a little rest.

674
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,438
Careless of me.

675
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:59,578
It's a family matter.
I don't propose to discuss it in public.

676
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,707
Johnson, will you see we're not
disturbed for the next half-hour?

677
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,123
- Right, sir.
- Are you going out, Miss Marple?

678
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,630
I always take a constitutional
before retiring, Mr. Enderby.

679
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,113
All right, John. Put them in there.

680
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:35,335
You don't seem to understand.

681
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,595
I don't want anything of uncle's
except that picture.

682
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:42,215
Well, that's just too bad, because I told
Hector yesterday that I wanted it.

683
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,394
Why not auction all the stuff,
divide what it brings equally...

684
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,436
...and there won't
be any more quarrelling.

685
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:48,934
I'm not quarrelling, darling.

686
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:51,433
That picture wouldn't
fetch two pounds at an auction.

687
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,445
Are you sure, George?
You're an art dealer.

688
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:57,448
Maybe it is valuable
and you're the only one who knows it.

689
00:51:57,616 --> 00:52:01,780
It's not valuable. It just happens
to appeal to me, that's all.

690
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:05,370
As Rosamund feels so strongly about
this picture, you better let her have it.

691
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,913
After all, "ladies first"
and all that sort of thing.

692
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:10,042
- Not in my book.
- Well, it is in mine.

693
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:12,003
Oh, why don't you toss up for it?

694
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:15,541
You, none of you,
seem to understand. I want it.

695
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,417
That doesn't mean
you're going to get it.

696
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:18,564
But it does.

697
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:20,754
- You listen to me, Rosa...
- Stop it, both of you.

698
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:23,434
I've had all the unpleasantness
that I can take around here.

699
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,185
- Well, Hector.
- I mean it, Rosamund.

700
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:29,226
- Yes, Hector, you may mean it, but...
- No "buts." The matter's settled.

701
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:32,150
This is my house.
I make the rules around here.

702
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:35,402
It's marvelous what a little security
does for some people, isn't it?

703
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,777
I don't find that remark very amusing.

704
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:39,905
I didn't mean it to be amusing.

705
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:42,483
Anyway, I'm glad it's all settled.
Thank you, George.

706
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:45,413
It's not settled
as far as I'm concerned.

707
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,075
Oh, but it is, George.

708
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,242
I think you misunderstood, Rosamund.

709
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,502
It's settled...

710
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,745
...because I'm keeping it.

711
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,502
Oh. Not in bed yet, Miss Marple?

712
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:00,250
I'm just choosing something
to read before retiring.

713
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:02,671
- Good night.
- Good night.

714
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:32,955
If you're looking for Miss Marple,
she's downstairs in the lounge.

715
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:36,123
I'm sorry to have startled you.

716
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:38,789
That's all right.
I'm still a little nervous, I suppose.

717
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:42,134
Yes, well, under the circumstances,
I'm not surprised.

718
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,763
What do you mean?

719
00:53:43,931 --> 00:53:46,219
Well, if I was the murderer,
I'd be very worried...

720
00:53:46,392 --> 00:53:49,476
...in case you heard what Old Enderby
said to Cora when he called.

721
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:50,724
But I didn't.

722
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,972
Personally,
I don't blame you for forgetting.

723
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,849
The murderer would hardly leave you
running around, now would he?

724
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,860
- Oh, I must... I must...
- Go?

725
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,613
Yes, so must I. Good night.

726
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,239
- Is anything wrong, Miss Milchrest?
- Yes, I...

727
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,657
- Could I speak to you, please? Alone?
- Of course.

728
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:16,120
- Won't you come to my room?
- Thank you.

729
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,502
I hope this means that you
no longer think I'm a murderess.

730
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:24,388
Forgive me for that.
It was stupid of me.

731
00:54:24,596 --> 00:54:25,639
Not at all.

732
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:29,051
A natural conclusion when you
found me standing over the body.

733
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:31,931
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

734
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:34,686
There was something
you wanted to say to me?

735
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:37,941
Oh, Miss Marple, I did overhear Cora...

736
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,268
I mean, Mrs. Lansquenet
and her brother that day.

737
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:43,019
- Yes, I thought so.
- I wasn't deliberately eavesdropping.

738
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:45,868
Naturally not. What did you hear?

739
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:48,074
Only bits and pieces, really.

740
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:51,696
But enough to realize he was afraid
that someone in the family...

741
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:53,072
...was going to kill him.

742
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,871
- Which one of them?
- I don't know.

743
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:58,796
He kept sort of hinting,
as though he hated to say the word.

744
00:54:58,964 --> 00:55:00,873
Understandable.

745
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:05,210
Miss Milchrest, have you told this
to anyone else?

746
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:08,887
Oh, no. Because when he died
so soon afterwards...

747
00:55:09,058 --> 00:55:10,849
...I began to wonder.

748
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:13,343
And then, Mrs. Lansquenet...

749
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:16,979
Oh, Miss Marple, I'm afraid.
I'm terribly afraid.

750
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:19,064
Yes, I think you have reason to be.

751
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,101
They've all asked me,
every single one of them.

752
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:24,687
And they look at me
as if they don't believe me.

753
00:55:25,574 --> 00:55:28,694
I'm afraid you're not a very good liar,
Miss Milchrest.

754
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,075
Now, we must tell this
to Inspector Craddock...

755
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:33,576
...and to no one else.

756
00:55:33,749 --> 00:55:35,742
- And the sooner the better.
- Yes.

757
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:37,910
Don't let it worry you anymore.

758
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:40,708
Go to your room
and leave the rest to me.

759
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,123
Yes. Thank you very much.

760
00:57:23,525 --> 00:57:26,526
Is that you, inspector?
Miss Marple here.

761
00:57:26,695 --> 00:57:28,688
Please forgive
the lateness of the hour...

762
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:32,067
...but, as it happens, I have
the evidence I've been looking for.

763
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:34,912
I know who the killer is.

764
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:22,454
I hardly think you're
in a position to threaten me.

765
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:24,417
But under the circumstances...

766
00:58:24,586 --> 00:58:27,623
And you surely don't think
it will stop me anyway, do you?

767
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:31,333
Nothing more to say? Good.

768
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:32,797
Then listen.

769
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:36,257
Yes, I went to see the old man
on the day that he was killed.

770
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,845
We, all of us, went there
at one time or another.

771
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:40,476
And all for the same reason:

772
00:58:40,644 --> 00:58:42,767
To get money out of him.

773
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:45,397
But you were worse than any of us.

774
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:48,899
You were greedy enough to kill for it.

775
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:51,525
Oh, and not just
for a quarter of the estate...

776
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:54,402
...but for a real sum of money.

777
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:57,820
That picture is worth a fortune.

778
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,365
Ironic, isn't it...

779
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:04,283
...to think that he must have picked it up
30 years ago in Paris for a song?

780
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,463
Now, I know
what that picture is worth...

781
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,623
...and I want it.

782
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:16,963
If you don't tell me where it is,
you know what's going to happen.

783
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:18,594
So where is it?

784
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,933
- What are you doing?
- Let me go. You're hurting me.

785
00:59:23,103 --> 00:59:26,472
Snooping and prying, you old busybody.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

786
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:28,475
How dare you.

787
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,695
I shall report you to your employer
first thing in the morning.

788
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,423
Hey, who's there? Let me out.

789
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:51,975
Help! Let me out!
Let me out of here!

790
01:00:52,443 --> 01:00:54,737
Help! Help!

791
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:02,692
Stop that infernal row.
Turn the engine off.

792
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:12,578
Come on, Black Jack. Come on, boy.
Steady. Steady, boy, steady.

793
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:17,922
What on earth's going on here?
What's happened?

794
01:01:18,093 --> 01:01:21,011
- What's the matter with Black Jack?
- Black Jack's all right, sir.

795
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,635
- He's all right.
- But there was someone in there.

796
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:26,808
- What?
- There was someone in there.

797
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,562
Who?

798
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:32,973
Mr. Crossfield, sir. He's dead.

799
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:44,935
- And where were you, sir?
- I was upstairs in my room.

800
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:46,893
And you, madam?

801
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:50,653
I was fast asleep, inspector.

802
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:56,783
So you were all in your rooms?

803
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,070
One of you wasn't.

804
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:19,846
Whoever locked that stable door
and turned that motor on is a murderer.

805
01:02:20,018 --> 01:02:21,346
That is the situation...

806
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:24,686
...and until I get to the bottom of it,
none of you is to leave.

807
01:02:24,856 --> 01:02:27,062
That will be quite impossible, inspector.

808
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:29,898
I'm afraid I must insist.
My men will be here...

809
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:31,813
...to see those orders
are carried out.

810
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:34,146
Are you trying to ruin me?
I can't have police...

811
01:02:34,324 --> 01:02:35,522
You can and you will.

812
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,025
But, good heavens,
tonight is our annual dance.

813
01:02:38,578 --> 01:02:41,745
Tonight? You're having a dance here?

814
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:42,957
It may sound unfeeling...

815
01:02:43,124 --> 01:02:45,001
...to hold a dance
under the circumstances...

816
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:46,537
...but I'm running a business.

817
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:48,620
I've lost enough guests already.

818
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:51,504
All right, you can have your dance.

819
01:02:51,674 --> 01:02:52,955
But nothing else changes.

820
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:54,713
That's all for the moment.

821
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:57,922
Can I get back to work now, sir?
There's a lot to do for tonight.

822
01:02:58,181 --> 01:03:01,217
- I suppose that's permissible?
- Of course.

823
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,350
Does that mean we can all go?

824
01:03:03,728 --> 01:03:05,886
As long as you don't leave the grounds.

825
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:08,894
Inspector, I wonder if I might
go to London this afternoon.

826
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:11,319
- I have an app...
- No, I'm sorry, but no one leaves.

827
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:13,154
- But, insp...
- That's all, Mr. Shane.

828
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:15,563
- Oh, Miss Marple.
- Yes, inspector?

829
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,866
Could I have word with you?

830
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:18,824
I have something
rather important to say.

831
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:20,535
Yes, sure.

832
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:26,790
About that call last night.

833
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,240
Oh, that. Yes.

834
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:31,041
You had the evidence and the murderer,
I believe you said.

835
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:33,539
Well, I'm afraid I was
a little premature there.

836
01:03:33,716 --> 01:03:36,836
Were you? Who'd you think it was?
Crossfield?

837
01:03:37,011 --> 01:03:40,712
As a matter of fact, I did.
But only briefly, inspector.

838
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,298
Very briefly. Now, I really know.

839
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:46,311
- Oh, yes. Yes, I'm sure you do.
- But I do.

840
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,889
Only before I can be quite sure...

841
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:51,734
...I need the expert opinion
of an art dealer.

842
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:54,736
- An art dealer?
- That's what I said, inspector.

843
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:58,320
However, I'll take care of that.
But I need your help.

844
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,945
There is Mr. Stringer.

845
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:03,451
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be with you in a moment.

846
01:04:05,373 --> 01:04:08,789
I'm sending him to London
on an important mission...

847
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,834
...and when he returns tonight...

848
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:14,088
...he will have certain information
that I need.

849
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:17,840
After that, we can force the killer
out into the open.

850
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:21,261
- Oh, we can, can we?
- Yes, I guarantee it.

851
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:24,553
How much do you know
about first aid, inspector?

852
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:26,434
First aid?
What has that to do with it?

853
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:29,563
I'm planning to have a heart attack
at the dance tonight...

854
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:33,313
...and I shall be much obliged
if you will pretend to take care of me.

855
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:34,813
If you think for one moment...

856
01:04:34,986 --> 01:04:37,477
And have the doctor confirm
the diagnosis.

857
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:40,277
Just like that. May I ask
what you're proposing to do then?

858
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,864
I am proposing to allow myself
to be frightened to death.

859
01:04:45,288 --> 01:04:47,115
Good day, inspector.

860
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,662
Come, Mr. Stringer,
let's go up to my room.

861
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:51,952
It's easier to talk there.

862
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:56,462
You know, I'm not entirely sure
about that woman.

863
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:59,302
George thought she was working
for the police, and I do too.

864
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:02,339
What nonsense. She's a lady.
Besides, she's a great horsewoman.

865
01:05:02,513 --> 01:05:05,349
One doesn't necessarily preclude
the other, does it, Hector?

866
01:05:05,516 --> 01:05:08,054
I've never heard
of a mounted policewoman.

867
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:12,142
You know her well.
Is she working for the police?

868
01:05:12,315 --> 01:05:15,814
Oh, no. At least, I don't think so.

869
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:18,559
I believe she knows
the inspector personally.

870
01:05:18,738 --> 01:05:22,356
What does it matter, darling? You sound
like a man with a guilty conscience.

871
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:24,740
My conscience is perfectly clear,
thank you.

872
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:27,236
In that case, you have nothing
to worry about.

873
01:05:27,413 --> 01:05:29,536
Hector, now I can have the picture,
can't I?

874
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:30,833
No.

875
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:34,704
Nobody else wanted it but George,
and he's dead.

876
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:38,046
I've told you why. I'm keeping it myself.

877
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:45,296
Now, you are pleased to take this
to London to the art dealers.

878
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:48,427
They will appraise it.
Get it back here as quickly as you can.

879
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:49,846
All right, if it will help.

880
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:53,353
I'm hopeful it will not only help,
but clinch the whole matter, so to speak.

881
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:57,022
- That means you've made real progress.
- Yes. We are near the end. Very near.

882
01:05:57,193 --> 01:05:59,020
- You know who did it?
- I think so.

883
01:05:59,195 --> 01:06:02,315
- Oh, good. Who?
- I can't tell you that at present.

884
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,657
- Miss Marple, please be careful.
- Of course I'll be careful.

885
01:06:05,827 --> 01:06:07,819
And you see you don't
get yourself arrested.

886
01:06:07,996 --> 01:06:09,371
That's stolen property.

887
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:11,531
Stolen prop...?

888
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:18,837
Mr. Enderby, you quite startled me.
Won't you come in?

889
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,916
Thank you.
Sorry, I was just going to knock.

890
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:24,543
- Of course. You know Mr. Stringer?
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.

891
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,548
I'm so sorry. Mr. Enderby, Mr. Stringer.

892
01:06:26,723 --> 01:06:30,423
Always delighted to meet any friend
of Miss Marple's. How do you do?

893
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:32,226
How do you do?

894
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:34,055
Well, goodbye.

895
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,057
You're not leaving on my account,
I hope?

896
01:06:36,232 --> 01:06:38,723
No, no, no.
An errand in London, you know.

897
01:06:38,902 --> 01:06:41,571
What a shame. I was hoping
you'd stay for our little dance.

898
01:06:41,738 --> 01:06:44,573
Now, isn't that a good idea?
And you are so fond of dancing.

899
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:46,698
- I am?
- Well, you know you are.

900
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,157
Why don't you return here
after going to London?

901
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:51,202
Yes, yes, perhaps I could do that.

902
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:53,910
Capital, capital.
Perhaps you'd like to leave your parcel?

903
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,957
He'd never be parted from that.
Would you?

904
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:57,253
No, no, no.

905
01:06:57,462 --> 01:06:59,182
Don't you think it's time
you got started?

906
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:01,378
The sooner you go,
the sooner you will get back.

907
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:04,336
True, true. Well, it's been very nice
to meet you, Mr. Enderby.

908
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,633
The pleasure was mine.

909
01:07:09,098 --> 01:07:10,806
What a charming man.

910
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,427
Is he by any chance in the same line
as my cousin George was?

911
01:07:14,604 --> 01:07:18,436
- And what line would that be?
- He's an art dealer.

912
01:07:18,775 --> 01:07:21,610
- What can have put that into your head?
- I'm not sure really.

913
01:07:21,778 --> 01:07:24,020
Perhaps it was the parcel
he was carrying.

914
01:07:24,197 --> 01:07:25,857
It rather suggested a picture.

915
01:07:26,032 --> 01:07:29,650
Oh, no. Mr. Stringer is custodian
of the local library.

916
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:33,362
- Do you know anything about pictures?
- Well, just a little.

917
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,077
I can't tell a good one
from a bad one myself.

918
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:39,287
I'd rather value your opinion
on some my uncle left me.

919
01:07:39,587 --> 01:07:41,746
My knowledge
of pictures is rather limited.

920
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:43,962
But surely, just an opinion?

921
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:46,885
Well, you're welcome to that,
but at some other time.

922
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:49,176
This afternoon I'm afraid
I really want to rest.

923
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:50,972
I'm not feeling very well.

924
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,094
Oh, dear. And here am I, making
a nuisance of myself.

925
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:56,178
- Not at all.
- You must rest.

926
01:07:56,354 --> 01:07:58,810
We must have you
fit for the dance tonight.

927
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:02,647
I'm looking forward
to a whirl or two with you.

928
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:21,001
You dance beautifully, Miss Marple.

929
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,875
Why, thank you, Mr. Enderby.
So do you.

930
01:08:24,048 --> 01:08:27,382
Well, my foot holds me back a bit,
you know, but I manage. I manage.

931
01:08:27,552 --> 01:08:28,797
Indeed you do.

932
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:31,009
I hope you don't misunderstand
about the dance.

933
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,130
It's not that I'm unfeeling about George,
but we always have it.

934
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:38,311
Naturally. You have to consider
your guests.

935
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,061
- Care for another whirl?
- Of course, Mr. Enderby.

936
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:53,196
- Perhaps we'd better sit this one out.
- Oh, dear.

937
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,658
Dreadful. Not dancing at all.

938
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:59,413
Still one must be tolerant
of the young, Mr. Enderby.

939
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:02,205
I remember my dear mama
was quite horrified...

940
01:09:02,378 --> 01:09:04,834
...when she caught me doing
the Charleston in public.

941
01:09:05,006 --> 01:09:08,126
But the Charleston was different.
I'm sure you danced it beautifully.

942
01:09:08,301 --> 01:09:09,416
Thank you.

943
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:11,629
There's Mr. Stringer.

944
01:09:12,096 --> 01:09:15,050
As it happens, this is his favorite dance.

945
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:17,550
- Mr. Stringer.
- Miss Marple, I found out...

946
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:21,178
I was just telling Mr. Enderby that
this is your favorite dance. Shall we?

947
01:09:21,356 --> 01:09:23,064
- Dance, you mean?
- Naturally.

948
01:09:23,233 --> 01:09:27,313
You'll excuse us, won't you,
Mr. Enderby? Come along.

949
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,905
- Really, Miss Marple, I don't think...
- Do your best, Mr. Stringer.

950
01:09:31,074 --> 01:09:34,028
This is the only way
I could get you alone.

951
01:09:42,669 --> 01:09:44,044
What did you find out?

952
01:09:44,212 --> 01:09:48,126
You were quite right, Miss Marple.
It's worth at least 50,000 pounds.

953
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:51,051
I knew it.
Then it was that picture, after all.

954
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:53,128
It certainly was.

955
01:09:53,304 --> 01:09:56,424
Excellent. We can now proceed
with certainty.

956
01:09:56,599 --> 01:10:00,300
- Proceed where, Miss Marple?
- To trap the killer.

957
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:03,677
Was Inspector Craddock in the foyer
as you came through?

958
01:10:03,856 --> 01:10:04,899
Yes.

959
01:10:05,316 --> 01:10:08,650
Well, then. I think perhaps a little livelier.

960
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,940
And don't be alarmed
if I suddenly pretend to be ill.

961
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:15,190
Now then, hot it up.

962
01:10:42,103 --> 01:10:44,226
Help me to a chair.

963
01:10:45,982 --> 01:10:47,180
I shall be quite all right.

964
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:50,110
- Really, no need to fuss.
- No, there's every need.

965
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,567
The doctor warned you
after that last heart attack.

966
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:54,199
Did he?

967
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:57,150
I think if I could just lie down.

968
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:58,655
Oughtn't I to get a doctor?

969
01:10:58,828 --> 01:11:01,153
We'll get the police doctor.
It'll be quicker. Bacon.

970
01:11:01,331 --> 01:11:02,825
Yes, sir.

971
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:05,916
She's got to lie down immediately.
Where's her room?

972
01:11:06,085 --> 01:11:09,086
- Upstairs at the end of the passage.
- She can't manage any stairs.

973
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:11,414
Isn't there a room
on this floor she could use?

974
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:14,924
Well, there's a small back room,
but she'd be all alone there.

975
01:11:15,094 --> 01:11:17,585
Good. That's what she needs.
Complete rest and quiet.

976
01:11:17,764 --> 01:11:20,337
Miss Marple, do you think
if we helped you...?

977
01:11:20,516 --> 01:11:23,683
- Yes, perhaps.
- There we are. Easy.

978
01:11:23,853 --> 01:11:26,807
Why, I am so sorry to give you
all this trouble, Mr. Enderby.

979
01:11:26,981 --> 01:11:28,808
Don't be foolish, dear. It's no trouble.

980
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:32,269
- It's just we're rather worried about you.
- Oh, I'll be fine. Fine.

981
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,498
Mr. Stringer, won't you sit down?
She'll be all right, I'm sure she will.

982
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:56,761
- How is she?
- Not very good, I'm afraid.

983
01:11:56,928 --> 01:11:59,929
- She'll be all right, won't she?
- Doctor, could I see her?

984
01:12:00,098 --> 01:12:02,767
I'm afraid not, Mr. Stringer.
She mustn't be disturbed.

985
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:05,769
I won't even risk moving her
to the hospital until the morning.

986
01:12:05,937 --> 01:12:09,472
You haven't answered my question.
Will she be all right?

987
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:11,891
I hope so, but it's a pretty severe attack.

988
01:12:12,068 --> 01:12:14,237
- Now will you see she's not disturbed?
- Of course.

989
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:17,822
- If I could speak to her before we go...
- Absolutely not, inspector.

990
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:19,734
She's to have complete rest and quiet.

991
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:21,072
I won't disturb her...

992
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:23,152
...but she wanted to tell me
about a painting.

993
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:26,615
She can tell you in the morning, possibly,
if she's any better.

994
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,120
I'm afraid I've got to insist.

995
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:29,621
You can insist all you like...

996
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:32,997
...but for the moment, she's my patient,
and no one goes near her.

997
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:37,423
Any disturbance of any kind
would probably be fatal.

998
01:12:38,261 --> 01:12:42,508
Now, I suggest you all get to bed.
Try and get some sleep. Good night.

999
01:13:19,302 --> 01:13:22,718
Miss Marple, are you awake?

1000
01:15:10,413 --> 01:15:12,904
Wake up. Wake up!

1001
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:16,370
It's me, Cora. I've come back.

1002
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:21,048
Yes, Cora, I've been waiting for you.

1003
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,374
You've come for your picture,
haven't you?

1004
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,633
Yes, you stole it.

1005
01:15:25,803 --> 01:15:28,211
I only borrowed it, my dear.

1006
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:34,471
I have it right here.
Allow me to return it to you...

1007
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:37,184
...Miss Milchrest.

1008
01:15:39,943 --> 01:15:43,892
- Then you're not ill?
- I never felt better in my life.

1009
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,942
Then there's nothing the matter
with your heart?

1010
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:51,822
I should have guessed it was a trick.

1011
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:55,454
How foolish of me.

1012
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:00,617
How did you know?

1013
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:04,213
I've seen you before
at the reading of the will.

1014
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:06,293
By impersonating Cora...

1015
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:10,467
...you were able to plant the suspicion
that Old Enderby had been murdered...

1016
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,182
...so that when you killed Cora...

1017
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:16,099
...it would look as if someone
in the family did it to keep her quiet.

1018
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:20,732
I fooled them all.
Not one of them dreamed I wasn't Cora.

1019
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,937
So then you had to kill
George Crossfield too.

1020
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,105
It was clever me, wasn't it?

1021
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:29,694
And all this for nothing.

1022
01:16:31,494 --> 01:16:35,823
No, not all for nothing, Miss Marple.

1023
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:38,205
Because you're the only one
left who knows.

1024
01:16:42,046 --> 01:16:45,166
Not so clever after all,
are you, Miss Marple?

1025
01:16:45,341 --> 01:16:48,342
Nor was Cora. The fool.

1026
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,845
The picture is worth a fortune,
and she didn't even know it.

1027
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:53,546
She was so stupid.

1028
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:57,343
She said I could have it when she died
because I admired it one day.

1029
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,762
You won't get away with it this time.

1030
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:01,137
Oh, yes, I will.

1031
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:05,360
A few minutes from now and I shall be
harmless Miss Milchrest again.

1032
01:17:05,945 --> 01:17:08,697
- Inspector, help!
- Miss Milchrest.

1033
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:11,735
No, please, don't touch me. I don't...
Please, don't touch me.

1034
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,365
All right, Bacon.

1035
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:17,162
For goodness sake,
why didn't you ring?

1036
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:23,705
The law may have a long arm, inspector.
Unfortunately, I haven't.

1037
01:17:24,589 --> 01:17:29,666
And now, if you'll forgive me,
I must catch up on a little sleep.

1038
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:39,229
Come in.

1039
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:46,604
You asked to see me before I left,
Mr. Enderby.

1040
01:17:46,778 --> 01:17:51,736
Oh, yes, indeed, Miss Marple.
Yes. Yes, indeed.

1041
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:54,695
- May I help you with that?
- Oh, that is good of you.

1042
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:56,411
Not at all.

1043
01:17:56,788 --> 01:17:58,033
- There we are.
- May l...?

1044
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,080
Oh, please do.

1045
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:05,251
Is this wise, Mr. Enderby?

1046
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:09,834
Oh, yes. It's the hunt today, you know.
It's the Fidget Hunt.

1047
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,339
Mr. Enderby, you did want to see me?

1048
01:18:13,513 --> 01:18:16,300
Yes, that's true, Miss Marple.
That's true.

1049
01:18:16,474 --> 01:18:17,517
Well?

1050
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,427
Do you know that every chair
in this room is stuffed...

1051
01:18:22,605 --> 01:18:26,473
...with the hair of the horses
that I've loved...

1052
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:28,690
...and I think I may say, have loved me?

1053
01:18:29,696 --> 01:18:31,439
- Really?
- Human beings, you know...

1054
01:18:31,614 --> 01:18:33,654
I've never got on so well
with human beings.

1055
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:35,449
They're all right when they're up...

1056
01:18:35,618 --> 01:18:38,489
...but when they're down,
only two legs, you know.

1057
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:41,577
Yes, I think I follow you, Mr. Enderby.

1058
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:44,287
I knew you would.
We're alike. Alike.

1059
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:49,881
Well, I mean, you're a lady in retirement.
A single lady, living alone.

1060
01:18:50,049 --> 01:18:53,050
Well, I think you know what
I'm trying to say.

1061
01:18:54,971 --> 01:18:58,838
Are you by any chance
proposing to me, Mr. Enderby?

1062
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,393
That's right.

1063
01:19:00,643 --> 01:19:03,810
I'm proposing that you should
keep your saddle here permanently.

1064
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,934
- This is where it belongs.
- I'm afraid...

1065
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:09,860
Oh, it would be
a working arrangement, of course.

1066
01:19:10,153 --> 01:19:13,403
You run the hotel,
and I'll run the stable.

1067
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:15,819
Well...

1068
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,990
You run the stable,
and I'll run the hotel.

1069
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:22,498
I'm extremely flattered, Mr. Enderby.

1070
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:25,951
- Well?
- But I'm afraid I must say no.

1071
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:28,254
No?

1072
01:19:28,755 --> 01:19:32,752
You see, I have so many other interests
to occupy my time.

1073
01:19:32,926 --> 01:19:36,923
One indeed presses now:
The next production at the church hall.

1074
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:40,382
A murder mystery, you know.
I do hope you'll come.

1075
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:42,969
I don't think I'd care for it.

1076
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:45,433
Oh, what a pity.

1077
01:19:46,147 --> 01:19:50,015
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1078
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:53,314
- Miss Marple.
- Yes?

1079
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,072
I would deem it an honor...

1080
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,905
...if you'd at least stay the day
and be my guest at the hunt.

1081
01:19:59,077 --> 01:20:04,202
I'm very sorry, Mr. Enderby,
but I disapprove of blood sports.

1082
01:20:08,628 --> 01:20:10,975
That was a very narrow escape.

1083
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:09,137
