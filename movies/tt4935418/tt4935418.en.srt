Original Uploder: bozxphd

3
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:19,732
Mom! Mom!

4
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,500
Mom!

5
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,269
Mom!

6
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,438
Mom! Mom!

7
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,378
Dude, it pays more, bet on that.

8
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:50,249
Bro, listen. The deal here is...

9
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:55,754
You gotta keep your odds low, okay?
Then you'll play to win big.

10
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,756
- Got it?
- You're telling me?

11
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,159
Son, I was doing this
when you were still a baby.

12
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,660
Good for you, brother!

13
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,630
- Okay, okay. Write it. Mallorca.
- Mallorca.

14
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,900
- Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid.
- Arda Turan!

15
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,135
- Who cares about Arda? Barcelona it is.
- Barcelona.

16
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,338
- Exactly. I agree.
- They won the championship last season.

17
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,907
Dude, I like Catalans.
Catalans are good.

18
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,143
- Messi will score. Barcelona it is.
- Barcelona, okay.

19
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,046
- Write it down.
- Alright.

20
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,516
- Zaragoza vs Girona.
- Girona?

21
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,152
- I like this name. It's like "enter this bet".
- Okay, that's a likeable team.

22
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,488
- The name says it man: "enter this!".
- What about the odds?

23
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:33,659
- Okay, let's bet on this.
- Girona 1.9, Zaragoza 1.4.

24
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,194
- Okay, dude.
- Girona!

25
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,999
- Enter this bet! Yes.
- Okay, the last one. The last game.

26
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:01,247
No way I'd bet for Albacete,
I wouldn't play anyway.

27
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,450
Seyfi! Are you in, man?
You want to bet?

28
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,419
- Dude! Hello?
- Seyfi!

29
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,622
Seyfi, do you still have that headache?

30
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,258
Boss, enough with your fucking bets.

31
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,426
- My head's all fucked up because of you.
- Oh, man!

32
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,463
Bro, watch your words
or I'll fuck you like a chicken now.

33
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,432
Yavuz,
I bet you actually fucked a chicken before.

34
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,068
- What?
- Chicken, man, you know.

35
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,305
Chief, please,
not in front of the newbie.

36
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,575
Alright, alright. Just kidding man.
Don't get offended so easily.

37
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,811
But I have plenty friends
who fucked chicken.

38
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,980
You and your friends, man!

39
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:39,251
Look, it's not about fucking the chicken.
No, it's about catching it.

40
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,453
Chief, why don't you tell us
about your first time?

41
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,823
- Was it with a goat or a cow?
- It was with an elephant!

42
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,259
My first was an elephant! OK?
Cut the crap now.

43
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,894
- Come on!
- Chief, come on.

44
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,829
- Arda!
- Hey, go easy on your chief.

45
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,666
- Come on!
- Who fucks an animal for their first time?

46
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,734
Son... haven't you served in the army?

47
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,572
70 percent of all Turkish men,
lose their virginity by fucking an animal.

48
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,807
- Whoa!
- Make it more like 20 percent chief!

49
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,688
He's a city boy, this one.
I bet his daddy took him to a brothel.

50
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,022
Did he?

51
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,658
Nah. It was some senior students
in high school, who took us to one.

52
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:25,364
Dude, I'm seasoned with brothels,
whores, and whatnot, boy.

53
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,601
Let me tell you a story.
He already knows this one.

54
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,937
- What?
- The one with the string.

55
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,038
Listen to this one.

56
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,975
I was heading down from Maslak highway.
I saw this chick, right.

57
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,712
And what a chick she was!
She was like amazing!

58
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,447
She was... how should I put it?

59
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:44,049
What was that called...
Victoria's... Sectr- or whatever.

60
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,952
- You mean the Victoria's Secret models?
- Yes! She was like one of them.

61
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,455
So hard to find, yeah.
Anyways, I picked her up... driving.

62
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,891
You picked her up?
Just like that?

63
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,193
- What do you mean?
- You say Victoria's Secret.

64
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,161
A Victoria's Secret model
in your car!

65
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,464
- She was a whore, man.
- Oh... Ok. Go on.

66
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,301
I picked her up, driving.
She had a mini skirt on.

67
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,137
She was wearing a low-cut top,
earrings and everything.

68
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,539
She was gorgeous. Unbelievable.

69
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,278
Anyways. We arrived at the hotel,
we went upstairs to the room.

70
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:16,282
She started to get undressed.
She took off her skirt, the earrings.

71
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:19,485
She took off her high heels.
By the way, the room is dark.

72
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,854
And I was excited as hell.

73
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,156
I could hardly control myself.
She was so hot man!

74
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:29,728
Anyways. Finally,
I decided to make my move.

75
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,498
Slid my hand between the legs,
and there it was

76
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,301
a huge cock.

77
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:39,038
I was shocked,
and she laughed like you do now.

78
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:42,374
It was a cock man. A frigging cock!

79
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,177
- Fuck off! How the hell?
- What do you mean "how"?

80
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,780
Look, there was a string.

81
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,951
She pulled it up to her belly
and tied the string rope around her waist.

82
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,752
- It was huge too.
- What did you do?

83
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,521
What could I have possibly done?

84
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,023
Since we were already there,
I went all the way.

85
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,926
But next thing you know...
While I was doing my thing

86
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:04,029
the son of a bitch started
jerking off, while I do him!

87
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,733
I was like "what the fuck!"

88
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,336
It was dirty enough as it is.

89
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,105
But she didn't stop.
I said "Cut that shit bro!"

90
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,875
So I'm pretty seasoned with
all kinds of this shit, boy.

91
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,246
Our religion teacher once said
it was awesome.

92
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:25,351
We asked him about anal sex right?
He replies:

93
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:29,889
"My son, why enter a shithole
when you have a rose garden next to it?"

94
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,999
Maybe I'm an ass man!
What do you care?

95
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,235
Our religion teacher also said
something very similar.

96
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,504
Do you prefer ass, Seyfi?

97
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,275
Yavuz, so, end of the day,
that woman gave it to your hand?

98
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,143
Stop it!

99
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,379
What if she'd said,
"Okay, my turn, bend over"?

100
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:56,382
- I have hemorrhoids.
- Wow! You mean you'd do it otherwise.

101
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,818
- That's right, he would.
- What's up, kiddo? Why are you laughing?

102
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,790
Sir, because you were laughing...
That's why.

103
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,827
- So, we entertained you with our jokes.
- No, sir, it's not like that.

104
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,930
- It was a funny story.
- What's so funny about it?

105
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,265
The woman turned out to be a man,
tying his junk.

106
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,168
- That's what I laughed at.
- So, you are saying that I fucked a guy.

107
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,871
- I didn't mean it that way, sir.
- No, you did.

108
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,839
- Right? He said that I fucked a guy.
- Yeah, Yavuz.

109
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,709
- He said that you fucked a guy.
- Okay, Yavuz, okay.

110
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,345
- No way, sir.
- Are you calling me a faggot?

111
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,280
- No, sir. No way.
- Wait. Come back here.

112
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,349
- Yavuz, leave the kid alone.
- Wait a minute.

113
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,184
- Akif, come here.
- Remzi, wait a minute.

114
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,021
Step away.
Officer, the boy didn't mean it.

115
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:40,326
He's not a boy anymore.
He can defend himself, okay?

116
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,528
Sir, go easy on him.
He's just a kid.

117
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,999
- What is this? Why are you touching me?
- Sir, he's just a kid.

118
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,802
- Step aside.
- I apologize on his behalf.

119
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,304
- Dude, you're getting on my nerves.
- Please, sir. Please.

120
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,739
- Look!
- Take it easy, sir.

121
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,174
Don't get on my nerves!

122
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,210
- Don't piss me off!
- That's enough! Cut it out!

123
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,260
- Okay, we're leaving. Come on.
- Come on, Arda.

124
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,662
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

125
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,498
- Watch it.
- Come on.

126
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,667
If only you weren't cops.

127
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,871
- What did you just say?
- He didn't say anything, sir.

128
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,474
- The kid's talking to himself.
- You're totally getting on my nerves now.

129
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,609
- Please, sir.
- You're totally getting on my nerves!

130
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:49,228
- Sir, can you please just leave?
- Dude! You're pissing me off right now!

131
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,530
- Enough already!
- Please, sir.

132
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,532
Step away, man.

133
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,870
I'm curious...
let's see what you are going to do.

134
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,441
Go on. Do whatever you want.

135
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,077
What happens here stays here.
Right, Apo?

136
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,080
- Totally.
- Come on.

137
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,882
Go on, hit him.

138
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,755
Go on. Show us your moves.

139
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,625
Hit him already!

140
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:30,669
Son, what did you say to me?
The boss here is telling me to hit you.

141
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,305
Why don't you behave?

142
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,310
Hit him, hit him!

143
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,553
- Look, look.
- Who do you think you're messing with?

144
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,208
- Seyfi! What the hell is going on?
- Seyfi!

145
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,099
Pass me the lighter.

146
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,006
Give it back, you weasel.

147
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,737
All he says is that he felt like
losing his mind for a second.

148
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:51,143
He says it's not claustrophobia or
anything. He's feeling a bit better now.

149
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,445
Boss helped him calm down.

150
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,382
- Has this happened before?
- No.

151
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,686
One time, he felt dizzy in an elevator.

152
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,256
It wasn't like this, though.
This is different.

153
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,261
Claustrophobia could have
this kind of effect, sir.

154
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,343
- Are you okay, man?
- He's okay. Let's go.

155
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,512
I'm fine, sir.
I can drive. Come on.

156
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,916
- Boss?
- I said I could drive.

157
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:36,021
Seyfi, you should rest in the back.
Yavuz can drive. Come on.

158
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,993
Boss.
Why are you all looking at me like that?

159
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,462
I learned to drive when I was four.

160
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,999
I was sitting at the wheel of a bus,
on my dad's lap.

161
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,868
- Please. You're offending me.
- You're the man!

162
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,971
Come on. Let's go.

163
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,609
- Such a diva!
- Stop talking nonsense.

164
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,777
- I feel really safe now!
- Come on, come on.

165
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,527
- You're fine.
- God bless him. He's fine.

166
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,429
I'm fine, okay.

167
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:43,315
<i><font color=#e>By the riverbank,
trees reaching into the air.</i></font>

168
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:48,587
Green leaves everywhere.

169
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:53,392
If I can't have the one I want,

170
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:58,764
Death should come and claim her heart.

171
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,469
Come to me from the grapevine.

172
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,908
In a blooming dress, you look divine.

173
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:13,746
My love, let's go far away.

174
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,617
Before the patrols arrive.

175
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,689
Persian girl, Chechen girl,
You wear white and I wear pearl.

176
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:29,461
Let's go high up the mountains,
You smell the roses, I smell the iris.

177
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:34,333
The night is black, and the cops are dark.
When in trouble, I am who you mark.

178
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:39,138
My name's Apo, call me and say "hello".
Knock, knock! And I'm there.

179
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,440
You are the man!

180
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:46,478
We're not afraid, no way.

181
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:53,852
My dear love, come sway.
We're not afraid, no way.

182
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,086
There you go!

183
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,225
All units. We have responded to a call
from the Inceagac neighborhood.

184
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,361
We are waiting for backup.

185
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,265
Nearby units, be advised:
4455 is at the scene.

186
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,568
I repeat: 4455 is at the scene.

187
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,570
What is it? What is he saying?

188
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,339
We're on our way to the scene.

189
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,109
I'll let you know once we arrive.
Over.

190
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,379
- What is it, Apo?
- 4455, bro.

191
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,348
They're calling for backup in Inceagac.

192
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,921
Seyfi. Inceagac is near, right?
Somewhere up there?

193
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,624
Yes, sir. It's really close.
I'll get us there.

194
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,194
Okay, it's official now,
we won't be getting any sleep tonight.

195
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,398
Beggars cannot be choosers.

196
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,606
I remember this Inceagac, but...

197
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,577
- Where did I hear about it?
- Look, sir.

198
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:29,615
I heard many stories about that place
when I was a kid.

199
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,817
Well...

200
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,621
- God, it's late and everything.
- What stories?

201
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,558
- I heard nasty stories.
- Wait, I know.

202
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,461
There's a famous shrine there, right?

203
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,966
Yes. There are many.
There are three just in that area.

204
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,068
Dude, stop talking nonsense.

205
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,570
How can there be nasty stories
in a place full of shrines?

206
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:56,609
Boss, it's not like that.
But that place is no good.

207
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:01,413
Weren't you in shock just a minute ago?
When did you wake up, pussy?

208
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,351
Dude, you don't worry about me.

209
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,635
God damn it.
We've been on this road forever.

210
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,539
There was supposed to be a right turn,
but there's still no fucking sign of it.

211
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,875
You piece of shit radio!

212
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,012
Look, chief.
There's no communication at all, right?

213
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:36,549
- This radio is broken. Get rid of it.
- No, son. Look.

214
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,018
I receive signals.

215
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,991
And this asshole is supposed to know
how to get there.

216
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,626
Yavuz, cut the crap, man!

217
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,962
Chief, I've been driving on this road
for 10 years

218
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,997
but I have no memory of such a place.

219
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,098
Fuck!

220
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,239
Fuck!

221
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,645
- Seyfi, what happened?
- A man... A man passed by.

222
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,315
- What man?
- He was completely naked.

223
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,684
- So, where is he?
- I don't know!

224
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,688
- There's no one here, dude.
- Where is he? Show yourself!

225
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,328
Who's there?

226
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,197
- Shit.
- Hey!

227
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,367
- Shit.
- Hey! You assholes!

228
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,238
- Who are you, you son of a bitch?
- Come out, you bastard!

229
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,341
You bust our balls,
we'll rip your balls off!

230
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,077
We'll fuck you motherfucking
son of a bitch!

231
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:49,154
- Sir, what's this?
- What's what?

232
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,590
Were they here before?

233
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,895
- No, I'm seeing them for the first time.
- What are these scratches?

234
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,264
It's nothing.
Kids must have scribbled some shit.

235
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:02,234
- Who did this?
- You're asking million-dollar questions.

236
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,372
What the hell?

237
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:26,559
So? Was it the frogs then?
All jump up together and hit the van?

238
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:40,206
Boss.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

239
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,942
Come on, bro.

240
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,858
- I'll catch you!
- Okay.

241
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,828
- I'll catch you, you sons of bitches!
- Yavuz, it's okay. Come here.

242
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,991
Dude.
Are you sure you saw a man?

243
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,495
- Shut your damn mouth.
- Man... Maybe it was animal?

244
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,565
It was a fucking frog! Alright?
A frog!

245
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:53,145
- What is this?
- I don't know.

246
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,548
- Pass! Is it over?
- Yes. Come on.

247
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,417
- Alright. How many did I get right?
- I don't know.

248
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,553
- How much time do I have left?
- 1.5 minutes.

249
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,654
Okay.

250
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,491
Whack job!

251
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,360
My father used to say you shouldn't
talk about your dreams at night.

252
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,761
Good one.

253
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:50,903
When my mother was six months pregnant with
me, my name came to my father in a dream.

254
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,040
They hand him a baby and
say "This is Arda".

255
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,444
My parents are really into dreams.

256
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,481
So they didn't even think twice
about it. They named me Arda.

257
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,884
God bless their souls.

258
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,936
Boss, I'll tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone.

259
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,404
Okay.

260
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,806
- Promise?
- I promise.

261
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,914
When I was a child, I had this
close friend. His name was Coskun.

262
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,118
He would come to our house
every once in a while.

263
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,521
We'd go out, go to Kadikoy,
to the movies and stuff.

264
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,258
One day, after seeing a movie,

265
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,028
his dad had died recently.

266
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,165
He told me about how
he was in the room when his dad died,

267
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,634
and that he saw his soul rise
from his dead body.

268
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,003
- He said he actually saw it.
- Saw what?

269
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,340
The soul rising, leaving the body.

270
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,544
- He was crying the whole time.
- The soul leaving the body?

271
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:10,316
He said he saw the man's soul.

272
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,355
His older brother was also there,
but he didn't see anything. He swore.

273
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,292
Anyways, we said to each other:

274
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,964
Whoever dies first, shall appear
to the other without scaring him.

275
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,032
We made a promise.

276
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,436
We were on a dark alley.
There was no one around.

277
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,806
We scared ourselves.
And we hastily left the alley.

278
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,377
I walked him to the ferry.

279
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:42,815
I saw him go through the turnstiles.
I saw him get on the ferry.

280
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,687
Then I went home.
Maybe 15 minutes later,

281
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,023
my parents were not home,

282
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:56,729
I went to my room and changed.
I got in bed.

283
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:01,267
But I couldn't sleep.
I was still a bit restless.

284
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:05,838
- I pulled the duvet up and passed out.
- So what, kid?

285
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:10,676
I had this dream.
There are lots of people around me.

286
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,846
They are all glaring at me.

287
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:17,516
You know how you fear something in your
dream but you don't quite know what it is?

288
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,219
I feel such a fear inside.

289
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,590
Then Coskun comes out from the crowd.

290
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,095
He comes and holds my hand.

291
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,599
"Don't be afraid, Arda.
It's me. Coskun."

292
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:40,806
Then, I wake up, soaked in sweat.
But I'm still dreaming.

293
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,610
I hear moans
coming from my mom's room.

294
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,981
I listen.

295
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:56,455
Suddenly, it stops.
As if the people inside disappeared.

296
00:30:56,555 --> 00:31:02,661
I look at the living room.
The TV is on, but there's only static.

297
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,297
I go turn it off.

298
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:11,737
I look towards the hallway.
There's someone in my room! I can feel it.

299
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:19,979
Coskun is in my room.
The thought of seeing him scares me.

300
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,081
I run to my mom's room.

301
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,250
I keep banging on the door,
screaming "mom, mom".

302
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,594
Then, I woke up for real this time.

303
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,633
That afternoon, we received a call.

304
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,673
I could tell from my mom's voice
on the phone. It was so weird.

305
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:52,111
- Coskun had been hit by a car that night.
- Holy shit!

306
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,380
I swear to God.

307
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,351
Mom says I couldn't function for 10 days.
But I don't remember anything.

308
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,320
She says
she left food in front of my door.

309
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:07,026
I've kept having that same dream.
I had it this morning as well.

310
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,963
It's like I'm still dreaming.

311
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,235
You're the first person
I've told about this, Boss.

312
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,642
When was this,
how long before your parents' deaths?

313
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:31,917
I lost them about a year later.
Car crash.

314
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,891
Arda, I have something to tell you.

315
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,629
I've been meaning to tell you this
ever since the day I met you.

316
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:46,866
The day when your uncle
placed you in my care.

317
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,435
What is it, Boss Remzi?

318
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:55,341
You still don't realize it.
If only it could stay that way.

319
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,943
What is it?
What are you talking about?

320
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:04,350
- Do you see anyone here, other than us?
- The guys.

321
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:15,094
Look around. But not like that.
Look around, taking it all in.

322
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:19,131
- Is there anyone here, other than us?
- What am I supposed to feel?

323
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,306
Boss Remzi, who is that?

324
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,943
This is the first time
someone other than me is seeing it.

325
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,809
Get away you!

326
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,611
- Arda, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

327
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,012
- Breathe.
- I'm fine.

328
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,414
Take deep breaths, son.

329
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,616
- I'm okay. Where's my gun?
- Are you okay?

330
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,586
How is everyone?
Any broken bones?

331
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:58,023
- Fuck you and your driving!
- I'll fuck you up serious, Yavuz!

332
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,360
And you're still talking!
Look at us, asshole!

333
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,295
Fuck off!

334
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:16,609
Were you the ones
who got in front of the van?

335
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,480
Who did then?

336
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,883
Come on, move it.

337
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,885
Move it.

338
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,016
Why the fuck is he laughing?

339
00:36:57,116 --> 00:37:00,152
Did you fall into the creek, Sir?
Did you have an accident?

340
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,189
Why the hell are you laughing?
Why the hell are you laughing!

341
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:07,193
Don't do it, Sir. Don't hit him.
He's a bit slow.

342
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,128
Fuck this shit!

343
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,811
God. Who did we hit?

344
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:30,783
Seyfi, Yavuz, come with me.

345
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,321
We ran over that man.

346
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:17,696
- Where is it, bro? What did we hit?
- We hit something, dude.

347
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:20,165
- We ran over the guy.
- We hit him. There were noises.

348
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:23,402
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean?

349
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,171
- Then where is he?
- How the hell should I know?

350
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:27,673
He sure as hell didn't fly away!

351
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,010
I don't fucking know!
We hit that man, and he's gone now!

352
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:40,553
- Seyfi, your face is bleeding.
- So is yours.

353
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,390
- Where?
- Your face. It's bleeding.

354
00:38:53,799 --> 00:39:00,806
No radio. No phone.
We properly fucked up the van!

355
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,708
Do you people have a phone?

356
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,247
What is this damn place called?

357
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,652
Inceagac.

358
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:21,026
This is Inceagac. It's the way to the
woods. You should go through the grove.

359
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,296
- We've arrived then.
- You mean the place behind those trees?

360
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,399
Yes, behind that grove.
200 meters at most.

361
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,469
- Cut the fucking crap. Come on.
- What? Where, sir?

362
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,304
We'll follow you.
You'll lead the way.

363
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,039
You should sit for a
while and rest, Sir.

364
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,041
Sister, we've got work to do.
We're going now.

365
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:40,346
I said it for your own good. If you
have work to do, you should go indeed.

366
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,214
It's your bread and
butter after all.

367
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,850
Hey, what the hell is
the matter with you?

368
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:46,318
Move it!

369
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:45,010
Chief, isn't that our guys' car?

370
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:48,647
- Back in the Ottoman days...
- Shut up!

371
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:51,884
Okay, okay, Yavuz.
Let him speak. Speak!

372
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:56,155
Back in the Ottoman days,
this place was a police station.

373
00:40:56,222 --> 00:41:02,127
When I was a child, it was a stable.
No one comes here now. Deserted.

374
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:04,763
What are you doing here, Sir?

375
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:10,870
Seyfi, did you know about this place?

376
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:15,007
Chief, I heard about it
when I was a kid.

377
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:17,276
It was a police station
back in the Ottoman days.

378
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:22,581
- Chief. Come on, let's check on our guys.
- Okay.

379
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:27,086
Everybody be careful, okay?
Come on.

380
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:40,266
Your uncle placed you under my care, Arda.
Don't worry, I have the key to all this.

381
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,986
What the hell is this?

382
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:25,511
All units! All units!

383
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,414
It's not working.

384
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,924
- Nothing works in this car!
- Seyfi, enough! Get a grip!

385
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:47,032
Seyfi. Calm down, dude. Calm down.
We have the gun, we have the badge.

386
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,634
- Okay?
- Okay, chief.

387
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:52,605
- How does our national anthem begin?
- "Fear not".

388
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:55,841
Just like that! Come on, boy.

389
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:00,446
Hey! Stop! Don't run! Asshole!

390
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:04,316
Fuck the police.
You goddamn sons of bitches.

391
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:23,569
- Chief, I'm going in.
- Boss, come on. We're going in.

392
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:26,205
Watch the back. Come on.

393
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,374
Easy.

394
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,320
What the hell is this smell?

395
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:50,162
There's nothing here.

396
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:41,046
- Can anybody hear me?
- Is anybody there? Hello?

397
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:45,251
- Is there anybody in there?
- We're talking to you, damn it!

398
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,262
Shit!

399
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,104
What the hell?
What's going on here?

400
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:48,774
Look over here.

401
00:46:49,108 --> 00:46:51,043
Look at us, damn it!

402
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:58,017
Who the hell are you?
Where is your unit?

403
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:02,288
Stop your crying!

404
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:14,133
Where is your unit, dude?

405
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,870
Yavuz, check for his ID.

406
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:24,910
There's nothing on him.

407
00:47:28,147 --> 00:47:30,916
What have you done to yourself?

408
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:35,588
Were you the ones who called for backup?

409
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:39,625
- What the fuck is going on here?
- Son, where is your unit?

410
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:41,627
Where is your unit?

411
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:58,477
- Seyfi.
- Yes?

412
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:00,779
Come here, take him to the car.

413
00:48:00,846 --> 00:48:04,350
- Now! Move it!
- Alright, sir.

414
00:48:09,488 --> 00:48:11,557
Come with me, man.

415
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:19,598
Fuck.

416
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:52,665
Bro, it's pitch black down there.
There's no way in hell I'm going down.

417
00:48:54,667 --> 00:49:00,139
Yavuz, you stay here with Arda.
Apo and I will go check.

418
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:02,875
- Come on, Apo.
- Boss, I'm coming too.

419
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:11,016
Are you sure, man?

420
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:30,669
Fuck this shit!

421
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,848
Brother, what's your name?
Did you call for backup?

422
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:28,127
Fuck!

423
00:50:30,396 --> 00:50:31,931
Fuck! Fuck!

424
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:36,602
Fuck.

425
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:56,916
Fuck... What the hell is this?

426
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:47,233
Boss, let's get out of here.

427
00:52:49,134 --> 00:52:51,770
What the hell have you done here?

428
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,953
Boss, run! Run!

429
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:17,409
Arda, run!

430
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,686
Remzi! Remzi!

431
00:56:30,856 --> 00:56:32,691
Remzi!

432
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,985
Easy, boy.

433
00:57:39,658 --> 00:57:43,262
I felt like...
I was about to pass out.

434
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:47,266
You're fine. Come on.
We'll leave after the coffee.

435
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:52,438
- We have a long way to go.
- I feel so weird.

436
00:57:52,538 --> 00:57:58,177
Where am I? What am I doing?
I'm all dizzy. I don't understand.

437
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:02,014
Not everything has a clear answer, Arda.

438
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:08,020
Let me put it this way:
Tonight, we're at a crossroads.

439
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:12,758
Maybe it's just you and me,
maybe just you, maybe all of us.

440
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:14,894
I don't know.

441
00:58:17,263 --> 00:58:21,300
We were summoned here tonight.
There was no call for backup.

442
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:25,271
- We were summoned here tonight.
- What, who?

443
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:32,244
I felt it the moment we stepped in. But I
thought it was not possible. I was wrong.

444
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,982
So, you know what's going on right now?

445
00:58:37,082 --> 00:58:41,554
When I was a kid, I used to see them
with my grandmother. We used to talk.

446
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,256
Someone is looking for something.
So, it keeps wandering.

447
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:48,227
It's haunting. I can feel it.

448
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:52,665
You can too.
You can feel it on the back of your neck.

449
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:54,433
You just know that something's up.

450
00:58:56,502 --> 00:58:58,971
This has been happening to you
since you were a child, Arda.

451
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:01,407
Don't you see?

452
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:59,879
Who the hell are you,
you son of a bitch?

453
01:02:59,979 --> 01:03:02,882
How dare you chain the police?
Bastard!

454
01:03:47,092 --> 01:03:51,797
Who the hell are you, you son of a bitch?
Speak, damn it!

455
01:03:51,897 --> 01:03:53,799
Don't you have a tongue?

456
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:41,480
I see you're here to join us tonight.

457
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:47,586
And we're here to welcome you
the best way we can.

458
01:04:53,425 --> 01:05:01,433
On a night like this,
when doors open and realms unite...

459
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:07,306
we're here in this chamber together.

460
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:18,050
Hell is not a place you go.

461
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:27,359
You carry Hell with you at all times.

462
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:35,534
You carry it inside you.

463
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:46,245
We are your humble companions
on the road that fate chose for you.

464
01:05:48,747 --> 01:05:56,755
While the stones fall into place,
we can only be shepherds for you.

465
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:03,262
And tonight...

466
01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:10,736
if fate put you first among the
creatures that we are going to herd...

467
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:15,674
there's nothing else we can do
but guide you.

468
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:12,631
Don't do it! Don't do it!

469
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:18,304
- Apo! Apo!
- What are you doing? Son of a bitch!

470
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:20,239
Apo...

471
01:07:23,008 --> 01:07:26,445
- Son of a bitch!
- Apo, don't worry!

472
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:28,781
It's going to be okay.

473
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:39,625
Stop it! You son of a bitch!

474
01:07:42,795 --> 01:07:44,096
Don't do it...

475
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,134
Don't! No!

476
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:59,278
Bro! Bro!

477
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:22,668
What have you done?
What have you done!

478
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:31,777
You die as you sleep,
you resurrect as you wake up.

479
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:37,249
So, fear not.

480
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:50,756
- Son, what is your name?
- We are the goddamn law!

481
01:09:59,231 --> 01:10:02,001
Do you think your law is here?

482
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:10,810
- What is your name, son?
- Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz!

483
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:19,518
Yavuz, you look like a tough young man.
You're scared, but you look tough.

484
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:26,091
The human soul is corrupt.
It only worships power.

485
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:30,462
It keeps searching
for new things to worship.

486
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:36,969
Because it has boundaries,
drawn by its masters.

487
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:39,805
Who the hell are you?

488
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:48,647
Are you insane? Are you insane?

489
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:01,727
- Boss Remzi!
- Yavuz, close your eyes.

490
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:04,964
- Close your eyes, Yavuz!
- Boss!

491
01:11:06,732 --> 01:11:10,536
Are you ready to stop worshipping power and
unite with us?

492
01:11:10,636 --> 01:11:13,806
Are you ready to be one
with the cosmos?

493
01:11:13,873 --> 01:11:21,013
Are you ready to give up your worldly eyes
and open your eyes to what's beyond?

494
01:11:23,415 --> 01:11:25,718
Open your heart to me, son.

495
01:11:25,818 --> 01:11:29,088
- Open your mind to me.
- I can't. I can't.

496
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:34,093
Please, don't.

497
01:11:51,544 --> 01:11:56,248
- Open your mind to me, son.
- Please, don't.

498
01:11:56,348 --> 01:12:00,286
Don't do it.
I'm begging you, please.

499
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,365
Yavuz.

500
01:12:46,665 --> 01:12:50,436
Open the eyes of your heart, Yavuz.

501
01:13:16,662 --> 01:13:19,965
Don't let me down, Yavuz.

502
01:13:23,702 --> 01:13:24,970
Let's begin.

503
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:52,818
Come on, Yavuz.
Show us that you are the right passenger.

504
01:16:02,228 --> 01:16:05,531
I'm begging you, don't do it.
Don't do it.

505
01:16:16,142 --> 01:16:20,045
Open your heart to us, Yavuz.
Don't stop, and it will open.

506
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:21,947
Open your mind.

507
01:16:24,717 --> 01:16:31,957
Don't stop, and it will open, Yavuz.
Open your heart to us, son.

508
01:16:33,325 --> 01:16:39,131
Come on, dear. Come on, Yavuz.
Come on, Yavuz. Come on.

509
01:16:41,033 --> 01:16:42,168
Come on!

510
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:24,844
Yavuz, you're not opening your heart.
You're not.

511
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:29,014
It should be wide open.
Otherwise, it's no good.

512
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,420
Open your mind.

513
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,188
No... No...

514
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:16,422
Maybe the honor will be yours, Arda.

515
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:22,862
Come to me! Come here!

516
01:19:25,698 --> 01:19:27,466
He's just a kid!

517
01:20:26,725 --> 01:20:29,495
I wasn't wrong, Arda.

518
01:20:39,872 --> 01:20:40,873
Come...

519
01:20:51,951 --> 01:20:59,959
Remzi, I thought it was just you.
But you're two passengers here.

520
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:07,066
A thousand thanks to you, son.
You took care of this boy, you helped him.

521
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:13,239
And now, he's ready to understand himself.
I can see it in his eyes.

522
01:21:13,305 --> 01:21:15,808
You saw it too, right?

523
01:21:17,276 --> 01:21:23,349
Boss! Boss!

524
01:23:52,798 --> 01:23:55,634
Remzi! Remzi!

525
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:59,071
Remzi! It's okay.
Everything's okay.

526
01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:01,907
Backup's on its way. Just look at me.
Look into my eyes.

527
01:24:01,974 --> 01:24:04,443
Hang in there...

528
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:15,421
"Whoever dies first, shall appear
to the other without scaring him."

529
01:24:16,422 --> 01:24:21,160
- Remember, Arda?
- Don't do this! Don't go!

530
01:24:24,263 --> 01:24:26,632
I made a promise to your uncle.

531
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:34,740
If you get harmed,
he'll hold me responsible in the afterlife.

532
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:49,288
- He's here, man. He's here.
- You don't need to be afraid.

533
01:24:49,355 --> 01:24:56,962
I have only one key in this life.
And it's yours now.

534
01:25:30,196 --> 01:25:31,931
Arda...

535
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:36,368
Everything ends, but...

536
01:25:37,703 --> 01:25:39,538
everything starts anew.

537
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:43,609
Everything ends, but...

538
01:25:44,305 --> 01:26:44,908
