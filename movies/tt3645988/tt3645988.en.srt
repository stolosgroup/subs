As many of you
already know,

4
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,940
the hospital was heavily
damaged by the storm.

5
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:28,708
The roof almost blew off.

6
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,944
We had to cut back on power.

7
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,145
Which means we are unable
to ensure

8
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,413
any medical care
at the moment.

9
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,850
We should listen to
the Coast Guard warnings

10
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:38,986
and leave the island early
tomorrow morning.

[SAVE YOURSELVES!] <i>They have
a ship docked and waiting.</i>

12
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:43,422
<i>After that we're cut off
from the rest of the world</i>

Yo!

17
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,845
I'm Tom
and doofus here is Klaus.

18
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:06,179
Hello Tom,
hello doofus.

19
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:08,648
Sorry guys,
but I gotta work.

20
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:11,018
Yeah. We thought
you might need a break

21
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,552
and that we'd buy you
a drink or two.

22
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,222
It's like this, man:

23
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,925
If you look around there
aren't that many of 'em here.

24
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:22,695
- Tourists?
- No! Not tourists.

25
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,833
Hot babes, there aren't many
hot babes here.

26
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,835
Oh, got it.

27
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,604
Thanks for the update.

28
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,751
- What is it?
- Sorry guys, but uh...

29
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:45,953
Why don't you guys
go back to your corner

30
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,889
and practice
a little more, yeah?

31
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,508
- Yo?
- <i>Jesus fuck, Clemens! He has my number.</i>

32
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,611
- Danny's got my new number.
- Sure about that?

33
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,181
He just texted me,
the fucker.

34
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,581
Fuck!

35
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:18,151
OK. It sucks, Linda.
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,187
How come he can find me!
Fuck!

37
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,054
<i>Just chill for a second.</i>

38
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,823
It doesn't mean he knows
where you are.

39
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,091
<i>How are you
supposed to know that?</i>

40
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,492
He managed to find
my number.

41
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:30,030
- Wait a minute. Can he trace this call
- <i>Linda, cut it out!</i>

42
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,664
- on my phone?
- <i>No he can't.</i>

43
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,033
We turned geolocation off.

44
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,634
Not gonna happen.
Danny ain't the friggen NSA.

45
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:38,571
Whatever.
I need a new SIM card.

46
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,705
Can you send me one?

47
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,142
Maybe it's time for you
to come home and deal with this.

48
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:44,044
<i>Cause your lawyer's like, if
you're not willing to testify,</i>

49
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,846
<i>nothing's gonna happen.</i>

50
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,948
You been talking with my
lawyer?

51
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,017
Without me?

52
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:56,990
- You fuckin' lost Danny...
- <i>No, we got him covered 24/7.</i>

53
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:59,092
He's at home, I got two guys
parked across the street.

54
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,695
<i>Listen up, little sis.</i>

55
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,631
You been on that island
for three weeks now.

56
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>How long do plan
on being there?</i>

57
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,568
No idea, Clemens.
Just ask fuckin' Danny.

58
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,174
Fuck!

59
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:25,952
How did she take
the news?

60
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:28,288
I didn't tell her,
sounded like she was panicking

61
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,990
Yo, G, I swear to God,
I have no idea

62
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,624
how this asshole
managed to lose me.

63
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:32,793
No fuckin' idea.

64
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:34,593
We're gonna find him.

65
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,930
And then we'll make spaghetti
of his fuckin' brain.

66
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:40,967
Danny is far far away.
He won't be able to find you.

67
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,903
Even if he did,
he can't get here.

68
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:46,206
You're on an island

69
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,875
in the middle
of a hurricane.

70
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,937
<i>Linda!</i>

71
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,176
<i>Linda!</i>

72
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,048
<i>Linda.</i>

73
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,092
<i>Linda.</i>

74
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:56,396
Hello!
Come on, that was a joke!

75
00:08:56,997 --> 00:09:01,001
Hey, where are you?
Don't be afraid!

76
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,303
Hello!

77
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:07,173
It was a fuckin' joke!

78
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,745
Hello!

79
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:16,983
Dude!
She took a pretty big fall!

80
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,452
How was I to know she was
gonna go all stunt-bitch on us?

81
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,954
What's her fucking problem?

82
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:22,088
So what're we gonna do?

83
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,256
Let's get out of here.

84
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,958
No one knows
we're here anyway!

85
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,527
What if she got injured
or something?

86
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,030
She didn't. You saw her,
she ran away.

87
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,470
Stop being a fuckin' idiot
and leave her shit here!

88
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:52,912
<i>My client has already
acknowledged</i>

89
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,280
that he tripped over a dog.

90
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,515
He tripped?
That's good.

91
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:58,685
He was kicking the dog with
steel-toed construction boots.

92
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:00,320
Was it your dog,
Professor Herzfeld?

93
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,589
How is that relevant,
if it was my dog?

94
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,924
Can you instruct your client
that he is required by law

95
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,459
to answer my questions.

96
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,628
Yes, it was quite obviously
not my dog.

97
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,497
Apparently the owner
was shopping.

98
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,532
Were you angry,
Mr. Herzfeld?

99
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,536
- This dog was gestating.
- No.

100
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:19,038
The report from the vet states
it was overweight.

101
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,106
Fat, not pregnant.

102
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,542
If my client conjectured
that said dog is pregnant,

103
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:24,444
such a conclusion
was certainly warranted.

104
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,246
Were you infuriated
about something?

105
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,214
Why are we talking about me,
for crying out loud?

106
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:31,351
He kicked a pregnant dog
in the stomach! Okay?

107
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,954
If you wouldn't mind
standing up for a second.

108
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:37,690
Please, just get up
for a second.

109
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,062
You too.

110
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:46,499
Professor?

111
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,701
Do you truly believe that
you could beat my client

112
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:51,404
in a fight between
the two of you?

113
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,010
Probably not in
every eventuality, no.

114
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,478
But in this dispute?

115
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,647
Wasn't it more likely that
my client was surprised

116
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,082
- by your sudden attack?
- No! That's not the case.

117
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:05,285
What happened on this
morning, Professor Herzfeld?

118
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,187
What made you so angry
that you felt vindicated

119
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,489
breaking my clients nose,
six ribs...

120
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,125
This man kicked a pregnant,
defenseless dog in the stomach

121
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,359
and he didn't just stumble,

122
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,762
cause before that he yelled
"out of my way".

123
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:17,163
Your Honor, forgive me,
I am trying to shine a light

124
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,699
on the situation
leading up to this dispute.

125
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,470
What happened
previously, professor?

126
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,372
Tell us.

127
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:33,279
But going skiing is about the
only thing we still do together.

128
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:35,148
It's like a tradition.

129
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,649
On top of that
I already booked us a cabin.

130
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,685
So like, you can
bring your girlfriend.

131
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:39,686
I don't have a girlfriend.

132
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,653
Wait a minute, this is
right out of left field,

133
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,022
is this your mother
talking to you or what?

134
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:44,557
Yo, well, whatever.

135
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,559
Mom is flying to Australia
with Norman

136
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:49,429
and I finally got the
apartment for me alone.

137
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,064
Chrissi and Lena
are gonna move in

138
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,132
and we're gonna study
for our finals.

139
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,168
Cause it's like...
Skiing, really?

140
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:58,137
Hannah, we haven't seen
since September it feels like.

141
00:12:58,171 --> 00:13:00,306
At Christmas
you didn't show up.

142
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,210
Time is speeding by
and I just have the feeling...

143
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,113
I have no idea
what's going on with you.

144
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,617
What do you wanna know?

145
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,653
What's going on in school?
Did you pass your driving test?

146
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,289
Have you met a boy?

147
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:23,563
Mhh, it's cool, it's cool,
and... not really, no.

148
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:29,502
- Hannah? What's going on?
- What do mean by that?

149
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,771
Our conversations
never exceed

150
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:32,806
the realm of small talk
for years now.

151
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,407
You don't know your daughter?

152
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,777
Maybe you shouldn't have
left us years ago, Papa!

153
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,411
There was another...
One of these days...

154
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,847
Dad, big friggin' dad!

155
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,815
One of these days you'll tell me
your side of the story

156
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:45,151
and we'll hug and kiss,
and live happily ever after.

157
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:47,654
I'm mega-busy
with my finals.

158
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:49,522
Thanks for breakfast.

159
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,191
Hannah, just wait a minute
please, will you?

160
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,126
Hannah!

161
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,270
Would you like the bill,
sir?

162
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:05,839
Help yourself.

163
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,541
Hannah?

164
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,512
Hannah!

165
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,473
Shut the fuck up!

166
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:43,376
- Hey, you fucking asshole!
- What you sayin', faggot?

167
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,849
- <i>Mr. Herzfeld?</i>
- Ehm, the answer is no.

168
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:51,584
No, I was not furious.
I was in a very good mood.

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,968
<i>Sorry for calling,</i>

170
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:11,204
but if there ever was a case
for the boss, this one's it.

171
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,372
No problem.

172
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,307
My appointment
was a waste of time.

173
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,308
What do we know
about the corpse?

174
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,644
Female. It was found in
a park along the river.

175
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:18,912
In a moving box.

176
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,481
A homeless person found it,
who described it really well,

177
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:22,883
and I quote:

178
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,251
- "Looks like someone sucked the air out of her head."
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,088
I know what he means.

180
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,626
Do we still have
the moving boxes?

181
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,428
It's still over
at forensics.

182
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,332
Thank you.

183
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:42,468
The deceased is
a Caucasian woman

184
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:46,406
with an approximate age
of between 50 and 60.

185
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,474
Parallels between
the ambient temperature

186
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:50,811
where the body was found
and the rectal temperature

187
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:52,712
as well as the manifestation
of rigor mortis

188
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:55,983
indicate that the time of death
was a maximum of 48 hours

189
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:59,218
but maybe as little
as 36 hours ago.

190
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:03,423
Both of the rexar
as well as the mandibular

191
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,926
were seemingly separated
after the cutis

192
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,528
and the subcutaneous
tissue were detached

193
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:12,532
evidently with
a coarse-toothed saw.

194
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,704
Both hands were cut by force
from the lower arms

195
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,673
in all probability to hide
the identity.

196
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,876
Yup, I have to
hand it to them.

197
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,345
Someone knew exactly
what they were doing here.

198
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,419
What's the reading on the CT?

199
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,355
It says foreign object
in the cranium.

200
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:39,392
Wouldn't be the first bullet
to the head this week.

201
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:43,764
That's not a bullet.

202
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:58,611
Lack of blood aspiration
in windpipes and lungs.

203
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,480
The external injuries
are post-mortal.

204
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,380
Well that's something.

205
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,950
Just imagine that
she was still alive.

206
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,752
Can we please do
the stomach content?

207
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,552
Oh, I'm too late!

208
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:08,055
Really sorry about that.

209
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,722
And you are?

210
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,059
Ingolf von Appen.

211
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,827
An honor,
Professor Herzfeld,

212
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,896
that I can meet you
personally.

213
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,331
Thank you for allowing me
to be a guest student

214
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:20,033
on these premises
to observe you.

215
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,701
I'm really honored.

216
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:22,568
Don't bother thanking me.

217
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:23,703
You seem to have friends
in high places.

218
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,471
It's seldom the president
of the federal police call

219
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:27,373
to recommend
a guest students.

220
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:31,644
The stomach has
140 milliliter gray-whitish...

221
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:36,984
comma, with a milky appearance,
comma, mealy, fluid content

222
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,451
with sharp acidic odor.

223
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,788
- Oh yeah!
- Are you doing okay young guy?

224
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,823
Uh, oh yeah 'course.
It's all cool.

225
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:47,094
- I'm astounded that there's no like music here, err, whatever.
- Music?

226
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:48,528
Yeah, music.

227
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,429
Stomach content is gonna
have to be analyzed.

228
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,532
Likewise these crumbed
elements here

229
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:53,734
by the opening
of the small bowel.

230
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:54,467
But let's first take
a brief look

231
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,569
at the cranium together,
please.

232
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:01,307
What uh... actually
happened to this woman?

233
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:05,045
Whoops!
I'm really sorry about that.

234
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,815
Stop!

235
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:09,950
Please don't touch
your face with them.

236
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,652
Whatever this woman
has could be contagious.

237
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,955
Oh, right. Of course.

238
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:17,623
You know what? I know
how you can help us, huh?

239
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,392
Yeah, I'd love to.

240
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,393
Then why don't you
do me a favor,

241
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:22,695
- and bring me a cardio-version device.
- An uh?

242
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:24,597
Exactly. Why don't you
go down to the first floor

243
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,464
and ask for Dr. Strohm?

244
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,000
He knows exactly what
I'll be needing.

245
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,802
- OK. A cardio-version device.
- Exactly.

246
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,403
Tell him we need it
for the cadaver here.

247
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,739
Cardio-version device.
First floor...

248
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,674
And right away,
otherwise it'll be too late!

249
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,009
- Yes, cardio-version...
- Gloves off!

250
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,610
Wash your hands!

251
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,679
Wash your hands!

252
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:40,613
Let's get back to work

253
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:42,715
as long as the idiot
is out of the room.

254
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:59,066
Not a projectile,
more like a capsule.

255
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,667
<i>Post-mortem CT
in forensic medicine</i>

256
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:04,037
has the advantage that
even before you make

257
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,571
the first incision
with a scalpel

258
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,174
you already know
what to expect.

259
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,776
<i>This includes not only cadavers,
in which...</i>

260
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:12,145
Dr. Strohm!
Dr. Strohm!

261
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,714
Pardon my interruption,
but Prof. Herzfeld sent me.

262
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,617
He'll be needing
a cardio-version device.

263
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,653
- Herzfeld? A cardio-version device?
- Yes!

264
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,122
He has a cadaver
on his table.

265
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,124
- It's urgent.
- I don't know, who you are

266
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,726
and what you're
up to right now,

267
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,860
but I can assure you:

268
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,795
anybody on
Prof. Herzfeld's table

269
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,764
won't be requiring
a defibrillator anymore.

270
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:45,645
- Do you need any help?
- No, thank you.

271
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:47,480
Keep working on
the abdominal organs, okay?

272
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,982
I'll be right there.

273
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,628
I'll be right back.

274
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:24,945
There's no way in Christ's...

275
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:33,920
Shit!

276
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:55,242
<i>Dad, please help me!
Please!</i>

277
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:57,010
<i>I'm gonna die, dad!</i>

278
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:58,711
<i>He's gonna kill me,</i>

279
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:00,881
<i>if you don't do
what he says!</i>

280
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:05,752
<i>He's controlling you
every step of the way.</i>

281
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:08,288
<i>He said, just the way
you got this message</i>

282
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,057
<i>better make you think.</i>

283
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,962
<i>You know all the cops, dad,
I know,</i>

284
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,597
<i>but you are not allowed
to talk to anyone!</i>

285
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,801
<i>Do you understand?</i>

286
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:24,237
<i>Wait for Erik!</i>

287
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:25,972
<i>He'll tell you
what to do next!</i>

288
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:30,709
<i>You can't tell anyone,
otherwise he'll kill me!</i>

289
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,590
Fuck!

290
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,229
Professor Herzfeld?

291
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,998
Are you in here?

292
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,970
- Yes.
- Everything okay?

293
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,239
Yeah... No.

294
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,910
I'm coming down with something,
I don't know.

295
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:07,180
Ah-ha.
Can I help at all?

296
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:08,849
Should I call a doctor?

297
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:09,682
No, no get back to work.

298
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:11,985
I'll be right there,
I need a moment.

299
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:19,658
Okay. Err...

300
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,661
Did you open up the capsule?

301
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,131
Yeah.

302
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:27,367
Nothing.
The capsule was empty.

303
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:29,970
Okay.

304
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,873
Hm... Okay.

305
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:18,185
Please, not again.

306
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:19,786
Can't we at least...

307
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,789
Please, I have condoms
in my bag, front pocket.

308
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:29,763
No, no!
Please! No!

309
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,269
But of course,
safe sex you little whore.

310
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,031
Shit!

311
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,083
<i>You know all the cops,</i>

312
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:33,019
<i>but you are not allowed
to talk to anyone!</i>

313
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,189
<i>Do you understand?</i>

314
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,159
<i>Wait for Erik!</i>

315
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:40,527
<i>He'll tell you

anyone, or he'll kill me!</i>

Hi, Penny!
Tell me...

318
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,474
Have you been in touch
with Hannah at all?

319
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,376
<i>Hey, now's
not a good time.</i>

320
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,977
<i>It's almost seven
here in Sydney</i>

321
00:26:58,011 --> 00:26:59,446
<i>and we're about to go
to the opera...</i>

322
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,015
- It's really kind of...
- <i>Yeah, I heard about skiing and all,</i>

323
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:03,416
<i>if that's what it's about.</i>

324
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,585
[PROFESSIONAL? RANSOM?]
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

325
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:07,187
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

326
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,490
<i>Sorry... that wasn't fair.</i>

327
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:13,259
<i>Let up on her,
she's a teenager...</i>

328
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:14,327
Have a good time
at the opera

329
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:17,197
and say hi to Norman, yeah?
See you.

330
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,866
REVENGE

331
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,911
Hello, Erik?

332
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,082
Erik, say something.

333
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:39,586
Just tell me
what you are looking for

334
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:40,788
and I will take care of it.
No police.

335
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:43,056
The Feds haven't been informed
and won't be at any point.

336
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,425
I just want my
daughter back.

337
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:48,661
Erik, tell me what you want
and you'll get it,

338
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,563
I'll make sure of that.

339
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:54,300
Listen, you fucking dickhead,

340
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,502
if you so much as
touch my daughter,

341
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:58,905
I don't care what it was,
I'll massacre your fuckin ass!

342
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,174
I will find you! I have
resources at my disposal

343
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,442
and I'll kill you,
you son of...

344
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,244
Hello?

345
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:07,347
Shit!
You fucking idiot!

346
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:13,520
Erik?

347
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:16,222
Listen up, I'm really sorry.

348
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,658
Just tell me what you want,
and you'll get it.

349
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,364
Erik is dead.

350
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:31,304
He's lying here, dead,
on a beach in Heligoland.

351
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:32,639
Who am I talking to?

352
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:35,675
Linda. I was just walking
by on the beach.

353
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:07,407
Shut the fuck up!

354
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:11,244
Cause I can see
you're lovin' it.

355
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:17,751
You're having fun, right?!

356
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:20,453
You're lovin' it!

357
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:26,626
What I'm sayin'!
I don't like that!

358
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:34,501
Women have to be chaste!

359
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:38,605
And if they're not
born like that,

360
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:41,007
then we have to
give 'em a hand.

361
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,181
I'm not quite sure,
how best to cut...

362
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:54,755
Did you know that 97%
of all women in Somalia

363
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:56,489
are circumcised?

364
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:01,294
97%.
Almost all of them.

365
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:03,563
<i>My question is,
do I cut off your clitoris?</i>

366
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,098
<i>Or your pussy lips?</i>

367
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,768
<i>Whatta you think?
97%...</i>

368
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,787
So I'm gonna
step outside now.

369
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,123
<i>Use your time wisely.</i>

370
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:33,226
Cause when I come back,

371
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,696
you know what's
gonna happen then.

372
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:51,879
<i>Do you really work
for the police?</i>

373
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:54,213
More or less,
I'm a forensic medical expert.

374
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:57,350
Am I screwed now,
cause I answered the telephone?

375
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:02,823
No, don't worry.
Where are the local police?

376
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:05,124
<i>They have no idea.
I didn't have a phone with me</i>

377
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:07,293
and we're in a storm
and nothings working.

378
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:10,396
- I was gonna walk in to town and let them know.
- No, no!

379
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,498
Don't do that,
there's no need for that.

380
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:15,134
I beg you, seriously, Linda.
Do not go to the police.

381
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:16,469
What?
And how come?

382
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,605
<i>My daughter's life
depends on it.</i>

383
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:20,874
I can imagine how
absolutely preposterous...

384
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:22,408
It's way out there,
but I...

385
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,210
The only option I have
is to beg you...

386
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:26,245
<i>Okay.
That's not that out there.</i>

387
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,849
- The police don't help you anyway.
- <i>Now listen up.</i>

388
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:30,316
You have to promise me
something.

389
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,353
- I want you to wait for me. I am on my way.
- <i>Forget about it.</i>

390
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:34,454
There's a hurricane
approaching.

391
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,389
Not even the Coast Guard
is on the water.

392
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:39,292
Any connections to the island
have been severed.

393
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,894
I'll get there somehow.

394
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,562
<i>What are you,
a fuckin' superhero?</i>

395
00:31:42,595 --> 00:31:43,897
<i>Or what's your plan?</i>

396
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,199
Do you need a ride,
Professor Herzfeld?

397
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:47,600
How come you're still here?

398
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:50,269
Your colleagues implied
I'd better quit my internship.

399
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:51,772
And I get it,
I screwed that up.

400
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:54,340
But I could make it up to you
by driving you home.

401
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:57,310
No, don't worry about it!
I got a taxi coming!

402
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:59,445
Linda, have you gone
through his stuff yet?

403
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,380
No!

404
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,547
<i>The message from Hannah
didn't say,</i>

405
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:04,550
<i>"Erik will get in touch"
or "Erik will give information."</i>

406
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:05,451
It said "wait for Erik,

407
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,320
he'll have further
directions for you."

408
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,321
Do you understand?

409
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,723
<i>The first direction was on
my autopsy table</i>

410
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,059
<i>this morning in the corpse</i>

411
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:14,661
- and now there's another dead person...
- Aw, just come on.

412
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:17,397
Who knows when a taxi will
come with weather like this?

413
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,466
- ...you know, so it's a kind of...
- Scavenger hunt.

414
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,869
- With corpses.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

415
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:23,536
And somewhere
attached to Erik.

416
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,873
The next clue has gotta be
there with the next direction,

417
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,875
that will lead me to Hannah,
do you understand?

418
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,744
Do you think you're up to
inspecting the body?

419
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,514
Uh...

420
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,354
Okay.
I'm on it.

421
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:44,424
Oh, come on.

422
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:47,660
How difficult are you gonna
make it for me to apologize?

423
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:56,837
- All I want is to say I'm sorry.
- <i>Professor?</i>

424
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,705
<i>This is the last time
I'm doing this crap.</i>

425
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,007
This was by far the most icky,

426
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,708
repulsive thing I've ever done
my whole life.

427
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:03,576
And what a load of shit.
He's got nothing.

428
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,279
<i>No key, no briefcase,
not even a pack of gum.</i>

429
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:08,281
<i>Just this stupid cell phone.</i>

430
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,551
Linda, call the clinic
on the island

431
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:14,253
and get in touch with
a certain Ender Müller,

432
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,521
about the corpse you found.

433
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:18,391
<i>Don't talk to anyone but him,
otherwise it's on record.</i>

434
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:21,360
- Who the hell is Ender Müller?
- Custodian in the building.

435
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:23,030
<i>How come that
doesn't surprise me.</i>

436
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:24,664
More likely an indication
that the person

437
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:26,566
behind this knows me well.

438
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,804
I'll give Ender a call and let
him know you're coming.

439
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:32,740
Don't talk with anyone
until I get there.

440
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:33,907
<i>Till you get here?</i>

441
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:35,876
Haven't you been listening?

442
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:38,979
Hurricane Anna is playing
Housepiñata and winning!

443
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:41,882
<i>The roof of the frickin' clinic
blew off a few hours ago!</i>

444
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:43,249
<i>I don't think
I'll be reaching anyone!</i>

445
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:46,519
- How long is this supposed to go on?
- Probably three days at least!

446
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,921
The waves are
who knows how high!

447
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,555
Not even Moses
would make it here.

448
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:51,825
- We are totally cut off!
- <i>Alright.</i>

449
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,559
I'll be there.

450
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:55,394
So?

451
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:57,731
Where would you like me
to bring you?

452
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,868
Heligoland.

453
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,473
Up front!
Move it up!

454
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,577
Bad goal!
Bad goal!

455
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,679
How come men never
get cellulitis?

456
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,481
<i>Cause it
looks like shit?</i>

457
00:34:15,515 --> 00:34:18,986
- Have I told that one already?
- No, not today, Ender.

458
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:20,020
Yo?

459
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:21,789
Hey, Professor!

460
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,523
So what gives me
the pleasure, huh?

461
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,760
- Hey!
- Oh Jesus Christ.

462
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,395
Yeah, no, no.
Sorry about that.

463
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:30,831
The cops are all
on the mainland.

464
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:33,033
- Yeah, the doctors too.
- <i>Yo, Christmas is coming!</i>

465
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:39,572
Ender Müller?

466
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:42,976
Well, she's proactive!

467
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:50,383
God knows what my parents
were thinkin'.

468
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:53,352
Anyway, Ender,
that's my name.

469
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:55,521
I said "Ma, I wanna be
at the beginning,"

470
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:57,958
and she said
"End o' this discussion."

471
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:00,861
- Good, huh?
- Hey! It's 9 to 3!

472
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:03,362
Let's call it a tie.

473
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:08,035
Know why men
never get cellulitis?

474
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:10,003
Ugh.
Cause it looks like shit.

475
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:11,604
What the fuck?

476
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:13,841
How come everyone knows
that one already?

477
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,746
Right.

478
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:32,658
Brr!
Where did you meet Herzfeld?

479
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,962
Every year people
jump from the cliffs,

480
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:36,830
and if there's ever
cause for suspicion,

481
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:38,899
Paul comes around
and does an autopsy.

482
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:40,033
Good guy!

483
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,068
Uhh!

484
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,072
Yo, Paul's
probably right.

485
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,673
We don't want to make
a big deal outta this.

486
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:49,475
Not that people start
freakin' out and all

487
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,745
considering you can't get off
the island at the moment.

488
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,468
Alright then.
Berlin Central, please.

489
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,290
Ugh!

490
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:13,794
I hope this crappy weather is
really over in three days, huh?

491
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,862
I got something important
on the mainland.

492
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:19,733
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I got a recall for GGT.

493
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:22,035
Germany's Got Talent.
The TV show.

494
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:24,704
I'm not into "janitor"
written on my gravestone.

495
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:26,073
I've got a calling!

496
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:28,909
- And what are your talents?
- I do stand-up.

497
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,211
But got my own concept.
Body Comedy.

498
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:33,713
Like, "Bomedy."

499
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:38,218
- So like acrobatics?
- No, not stupid stuff.

500
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,585
I'm naked in front
of the jury,

501
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:40,854
show off a bit
with my hunkbucket,

502
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,555
tell a couple jokes.

503
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:43,489
But don't worry,

504
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,192
cause I do not unpack
my biggest muscle.

505
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,260
Hm, what a pity.

506
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:48,962
Wanna hear a good one?

507
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:53,100
Neighbors upstairs just moved
outta their basement apartment.

508
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,267
Pow! Get it?

509
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:56,635
Cause there ain't nothin'
under a basement apartment.

510
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:06,880
Yo, Sana-clinik, Ender Müller.
Who is speeding?

511
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,116
Hey, Paul! No, it's forwarded
to the land line.

512
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:11,284
No cell connection here
in the basement.

513
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,285
What? Yeah, no.

514
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,887
Yeah, we're doing A-OK!
Don't worry about it.

515
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,022
The world's coming
to an end out there

516
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:16,923
and no one's out
and about.

517
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,925
I could have brought the corpse
on a white elephant

518
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,260
and no one
would've snatched it.

519
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,963
What?
No way, Paul!

520
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,698
No!
No fuckin way!

521
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,913
Yeah, no, I don't care how
friggin important it is, Paul!

522
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:42,349
You said bring the corpse down
to the pathology department

523
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:43,950
and then we're cool.

524
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:45,786
Corpse here, we're cool!

525
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:47,954
Huh?
Paul, Paul,

526
00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:50,791
I'm shittn' myself just standing
here in pathology, get it?

527
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:52,826
I would love to help you,
but I can't.

528
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,361
Not gonna happen.
Got it?

529
00:38:54,394 --> 00:38:56,730
Huh?
I'll start barfin' is why!

530
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:58,932
What am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to help you.

531
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,033
What?

532
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:04,171
- Linda, what's your job?
- I sketch.

533
00:39:04,204 --> 00:39:07,174
She's a painter.
Walls or portraits?

534
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,310
- Comics!
- Cartoons.

535
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,218
So that means you're dextrous
with your fingers.

536
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:19,986
That right?

537
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:24,958
<i>Linda, listen up,
you were right.</i>

538
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:27,394
It's gonna take a while
for me to get to the island

539
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:29,662
and I have to ask you
a big favor for me.

540
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:30,764
What?

541
00:39:31,664 --> 00:39:33,033
You...

542
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,168
I'm gonna need you to conduct
an autopsy for me.

543
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:36,903
- Are you trying to make a joke?
- <i>No.</i>

544
00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:38,671
<i>A little while ago
it was a joke, maybe,</i>

545
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:39,906
<i>but now I mean it.
Seriously.</i>

546
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,676
Lay the corpse down with the
feet pointing towards the sink.

547
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,179
<i>The small table next to the
portable tray with the sink.</i>

548
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,815
<i>Right next to the shower head.
See it?</i>

549
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,085
- No fucking way!
- Make sure you put on gloves.

550
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,988
Thick, ideally ones
that are nubbed.

551
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:56,389
And try and find
a rubber apron.

552
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:57,958
<i>Ender knows
where all these are.</i>

553
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:01,795
Tell him you need two stable
knives, but not a scalpel.

554
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:03,296
The blades break too easily
and you can get hurt

555
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,931
if you're not used to them.

556
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,234
<i>You're also gonna need
large tweezers</i>

557
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:09,668
- and scissors to cut open his clothes.
- <i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</i>

558
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:12,305
Hold on a sec, Professor!
Have you lost your mind?

559
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:14,875
Yes, it's possible
I've lost my mind.

560
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:16,877
The first corpse
this morning...

561
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,378
And then what I found,
the message,

562
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,280
my daughter calling for help.

563
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,251
It was in the calvarium,

564
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:27,420
<i>the head of a corpse,
do you understand?</i>

565
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:29,122
<i>The message was not
at the corpse,</i>

566
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:30,891
it was inside of it.

567
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,792
So you're asking that I cut
the man open

568
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:34,895
and root about for hidden
messages inside of him?

569
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:36,062
<i>Linda,
I know I am asking a lot</i>

570
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,865
but I'm running out of time!
Hannah is...

571
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:39,966
So, like your daughter?

572
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,401
<i>Hannah is in a bad situation</i>

573
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,702
<i>but wouldn't it be better
to get professional help?</i>

574
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:44,905
This is not only
about Hannah.

575
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,039
I don't know who's
behind this

576
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:48,141
but they've already committed
at least two murders.

577
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:50,076
<i>Which means we're dealing with
a serial murderer.</i>

578
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,912
<i>And what if the murderer
is still on the island</i>

579
00:40:51,945 --> 00:40:54,381
<i>and planning
to kill more people?</i>

580
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:56,082
<i>Linda, I like you
and I'm aware of the fact</i>

581
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:58,185
that I have no right
to demand this of you.

582
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,287
I can only plead with you.

583
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:03,156
- Linda, please.
- <i>I'm a vegetarian.</i>

584
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,325
I can't even slice a steak
in two halves

585
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:06,860
and now you're
asking me to...

586
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,963
- <i>I promise you, you won't have to eat that man on the table.</i>
- Ha, ha.

587
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,765
<i>I'll walk you through it
step by step.</i>

588
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:14,034
You...
Hello?

589
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,269
Shit!

590
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,704
Fuck!

591
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,946
- Hey, intern!
- Ingolf!

592
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,314
- Yeah, whatever.
- Hey, you're still here!

593
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:28,782
Yeah, the trains
aren't running...

594
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:32,052
- Hey dickhead, get your BMW out of the way!
- BMW? You've no idea!

595
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,887
This is a top
of the class Mercedes

596
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,789
with 610 horse power!

597
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:38,024
Then turn'em
the fuck on! Your horsepower.

598
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,227
- You're blocking the exit!
- Yeah, yeah...

599
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,928
So, err,
I'm not curious,

600
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:44,064
but all that stuff
I just heard...

601
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:45,799
You're not some
sick person now, are you?

602
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:47,400
- No, no.
- Hey, asshole...

603
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:51,004
So this thing.
This story from Heligoland...

604
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:54,107
- is pretty significant?
- Life and death significant! Got it? Life and death.

605
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,276
- Hey!
- Everything's cool!

606
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,511
- Err, we're leaving in a second.
- A second?

607
00:41:58,545 --> 00:41:59,813
What are you, a smartass?

608
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:02,782
- I'll smack you upside your head in a second!
- Just calm down.

609
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,820
Um, I'd like to suggest
we get some supplies

610
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:09,122
and warm blankets,
because in this weather

611
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:12,158
getting stuck in traffic
can be unpleasant.

612
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:14,327
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:34,848
Can we start now
with the external examination?

614
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:35,982
<i>He keeps saying "we."</i>

615
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:37,884
<i>But I'm pretty much
alone here</i>

616
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:41,187
<i>and I am only gonna
examine him from the outside.</i>

617
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:49,796
What I have here is something
totally normal, right?

618
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:52,065
No reason to freak out.

619
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:52,866
<i>Exactly right.</i>

620
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:54,934
<i>150,000 people die
every day.</i>

621
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:56,369
That is two per second,

622
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:58,938
to the tune of around
56 million per year.

623
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,974
Seems like there are more
people dead than alive,

624
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:02,242
if you think about it.

625
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,443
<i>Yes, correct.
We assume nowadays</i>

626
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:06,913
that over 100 billion Homo
Sapiens have already expired.

627
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:08,915
<i>And nevertheless
I've got my first corpse</i>

628
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:10,083
<i>in front of me.</i>

629
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:12,619
How come we spend so little
time thinking about death.

630
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:14,020
Why is that?

631
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:15,021
<i>I can't answer that.</i>

632
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:16,423
But if you're gonna go
through with this Linda,

633
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,325
you gotta start now, yeah?

634
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:40,447
Oh, it's disgusting!

635
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,648
I don't remember him
stinking like that!

636
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:44,284
<i>Linda, please describe
exactly, what you are seeing.</i>

637
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:47,087
- At the moment I can only smell.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

638
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,488
Only corpses
stink like corpses.

639
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:49,589
I don't know if it makes
you feel better,

640
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:50,490
<i>but you never
get used to it.</i>

641
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:53,126
- Don't feel better.
- What do you see?

642
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:56,563
Ugh.
He looks kinda unreal.

643
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:58,498
Like made of wax.

644
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:03,937
<i>He's big. Six two.
Maybe 220 pounds.</i>

645
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,039
Toenails haven't been cut.

646
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:09,209
He's just wearing
a t-shirt and jeans.

647
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,279
The word "Erik"
is written on his shirt,

648
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:15,315
probably with a magic marker.

649
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:18,351
His head's uh...

650
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:21,054
His eyes are closed,
God help me.

651
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,622
Mouth is open slightly.

652
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,290
<i>Teeth are yellow,
like he smoked.</i>

653
00:44:24,324 --> 00:44:27,460
<i>Okay, Put him on
the autopsy table.</i>

654
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:30,029
No, sorry about that,
Paul, I told you...

655
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:31,097
<i>I don't give a shit,
Ender!</i>

656
00:44:31,131 --> 00:44:32,098
<i>You're gonna do this now!</i>

657
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,601
Since when did you become
such a wimp, huh?

658
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:36,403
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

659
00:44:36,436 --> 00:44:39,005
<i>Listen, you're gonna have to
pull him on his right arm</i>

660
00:44:39,038 --> 00:44:40,273
to the left,
from the stretcher

661
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:41,508
onto the autopsy table.

662
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,610
<i>Out of the body bag.</i>

663
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:47,480
<i>And you're gonna have to be
careful with his skin,</i>

664
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:50,283
<i>in case he was exposed
to moisture.</i>

665
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,153
<i>This is fuckin' gross,
man!</i>

666
00:45:02,462 --> 00:45:04,464
Wha! Ugh!

667
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:18,278
Now what?

668
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:20,313
<i>Now remove the shirt
and pants.</i>

669
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:22,315
What? No!
No fuckin' way.

670
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,417
- <i>I'm drawing a line here.</i>
- Linda, we already talked about this.

671
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,753
The corpse
has to be stripped.

672
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,220
You and me talked about it,
Professor?

673
00:45:27,253 --> 00:45:29,022
You must be crazy!

674
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:31,491
What I expressed was, I'll
examine it from the outside.

675
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:34,127
<i>How will you examine the body,
if it is still dressed, huh?</i>

676
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,195
<i>If the man was injured,</i>

677
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:37,664
<i>then how are you going
to know what happened?</i>

678
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:45,138
Fuck!

679
00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:48,174
Fuuuck!

680
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:55,715
Uh, here's something.
Hangin' around his neck.

681
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,018
- A chain, with a key on it.
- What kind of a key?

682
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:00,286
<i>Like a normal one.</i>

683
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,422
<i>No writing,
no number, nothing.</i>

684
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:04,190
Is that the clue?
The key?

685
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:06,226
<i>Perhaps. Hard to believe
though, that'd be too easy.</i>

686
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,161
Uh-uh. Any marks
or distinguishing blemishes

687
00:46:08,194 --> 00:46:09,629
you can see?

688
00:46:12,065 --> 00:46:14,634
No, no piercings
or shit like that.

689
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,804
He has a scar
under his left nipple.

690
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:19,172
Like from being vaccinated.

691
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:21,708
What does the pubic
area look like?

692
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:26,446
Err, pubic area is fab,
it's all A-OK.

693
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,414
I'm thinking we can
wrap this up.

694
00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:30,016
<i>Linda?</i>

695
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,651
<i>Linda?!</i>

696
00:46:40,527 --> 00:46:42,295
Ugh!

697
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:45,365
Dude shit in his pants
before he kicked the bucket.

698
00:46:45,398 --> 00:46:46,800
<i>Yeah, that's normal,
unfortunately.</i>

699
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:49,536
Get some scissors,
it'll make it easier.

700
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,421
So...

701
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:14,127
The corpse is now laying
here naked. It's all...

702
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:16,964
...normal.

703
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:19,299
There's nothing conspicuous?

704
00:47:19,332 --> 00:47:20,868
Now that you mention it,

705
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:22,836
his penis looks like
a swastika.

706
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,704
No, all normal,
what I've been telling you!

707
00:47:24,738 --> 00:47:26,339
Otherwise I would've
said something, right?

708
00:47:26,372 --> 00:47:28,541
Linda, I'm aware
you're stressed out.

709
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:29,877
You have no
motherfucking idea!

710
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,178
His legs,
did you spread them out?

711
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:34,681
Yeah, a little.
How come that's important?

712
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:36,382
Cause you're...

713
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,117
gonna have to inspect
his rectum.

714
00:47:38,151 --> 00:47:40,420
No. No. No!

715
00:47:40,453 --> 00:47:41,454
<i>Linda, calm down.</i>

716
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:42,890
At this moment I just need
a superficial look.

717
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:44,524
Spread his legs
as wide as possible

718
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:46,326
and try and take a look.

719
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,430
<i>Linda?</i>

720
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,172
- Nah.
- No what?

721
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:02,175
No objects up his fuckin'
asshole, okay?

722
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:03,777
Good, that should be enough
for now. Thank you.

723
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:04,711
<i>You're welcome!</i>

724
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:05,980
<i>Now take the tweezers</i>

725
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:09,716
- <i>and use them to twist up the eyelids.</i>
- Oh man...

726
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,286
Do I have to? I Feel like
I'm fuckin' Frankenstein.

727
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,822
Punctuated hemorrhaging
in the conjunctiva

728
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:17,390
<i>could be a sign of
violent strangulation.</i>

729
00:48:17,423 --> 00:48:18,658
<i>There is no other way
to check for this.</i>

730
00:48:18,691 --> 00:48:20,460
<i>So please,
take a close look!</i>

731
00:48:20,493 --> 00:48:22,495
No pain here.

732
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:24,732
Corpses feel no pain.

733
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:34,707
Yeah, there are like
dark red spots

734
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:36,275
on the inside
of the eyelids,

735
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:38,344
<i>like speckles
on a pigeon egg.</i>

736
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:40,179
Any visible injuries
on his throat?

737
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:42,883
Yeah, maybe, like an abrasion.

738
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:46,285
Like something was
pressed up against his neck.

739
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,422
Five or six centimeters long,
and one in width.

740
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:51,624
Like he was strangled maybe.

741
00:48:51,658 --> 00:48:53,459
<i>So what does that mean?</i>

742
00:48:53,794 --> 00:48:55,261
Let's move up to bis head.

743
00:48:56,262 --> 00:48:57,630
Then what?

744
00:48:57,798 --> 00:48:59,499
Listen Professor,
I somehow have the feeling

745
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:01,567
you wanna move from the
external to internal autopsy

746
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:02,836
supposing I'm not even
going to notice.

747
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,237
I'm not gonna be cutting
this dude up,

748
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,405
can you comprehend
that at least?

749
00:49:05,438 --> 00:49:07,273
<i>You may not have to do
any of this.</i>

750
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:08,341
<i>Let's go step by step.</i>

751
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:10,443
<i>Now, please open up
the mouth.</i>

752
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,652
<i>Does it help that
the guy's got dentures?</i>

753
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:21,354
Take 'em out.

754
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:26,827
Ugh!

755
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,635
Ugh!

756
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:39,472
This is fuckin' weird.

757
00:49:39,505 --> 00:49:42,608
- What do you see?
- OK. OK, I'm outta here!

758
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:45,979
- Is the joint that connects the jaw missing?
- No.

759
00:49:46,013 --> 00:49:48,749
It's like someone's cut out
his tongue.

760
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,897
Is the missing tongue the
clue you've been looking for?

761
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,432
Can you identify blood
in the mouth cavity?

762
00:50:09,669 --> 00:50:10,570
A little bit.

763
00:50:10,603 --> 00:50:11,704
That means the tongue
wasn't dissevered

764
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:13,974
until after the body was dead.
Makes no sense at all.

765
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:16,375
Yeah, as if anything
we're doing made sense!

766
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:18,011
Maybe not for you,
but for the culprit.

767
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:20,814
And, what he assumes,
for me as well.

768
00:50:20,848 --> 00:50:21,882
Look down his throat.

769
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:23,349
<i>Way down!</i>

770
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:27,620
I don't see anything.

771
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,288
<i>But I also don't have
X-ray vision.</i>

772
00:50:29,322 --> 00:50:31,491
- A flash-light, maybe?
- <i>Yeah, wait a minute.</i>

773
00:50:35,495 --> 00:50:38,065
- Ugh! Yeah, there's something in there.
- <i>What?</i>

774
00:50:38,098 --> 00:50:40,968
No idea. Looks a bit
plastic-yellowish.

775
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:42,002
Try and pull it out.

776
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:45,371
<i>Doesn't work.</i>

777
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:48,641
The tweezers are sliding off.
It's too slippery.

778
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,576
I keep pushing it in
more and more.

779
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,411
You're absolutely right.
Leave it alone for now.

780
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,848
Really good idea.

781
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,417
Okay, good.
When are you gonna be here?

782
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:01,989
I wasn't implying...
That's not what I meant.

783
00:51:02,622 --> 00:51:04,323
<i>Linda, you err...</i>

784
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:06,292
<i>Your gonna have to cut
his throat open.</i>

785
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:08,762
<i>Linda? Hello?</i>

786
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:09,562
<i>Linda?!</i>

787
00:51:09,595 --> 00:51:10,798
Jesus, Fuck!

788
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:16,602
You dumbass.

789
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:25,946
Fuck!

790
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:28,347
Fuck...

791
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:40,928
<i>You're mine!</i>

792
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:43,563
Ender?

793
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:50,037
<i>Now I got you!</i>

794
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:55,742
- Yeah?
- <i>Please, listen closely.</i>

795
00:51:55,776 --> 00:51:57,010
<i>The yellow object.</i>

796
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,678
That's why we're doing
all of this.

797
00:51:58,711 --> 00:52:01,014
That's where the clue is.
Then your job is finished.

798
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,449
- Only one cut.
- It's a human being!

799
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:05,052
You can't expect that of me
and you know it!

800
00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:07,653
Or are you so deformed
by your morbid job?

801
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,122
You want me to cut open
a human being?

802
00:52:09,156 --> 00:52:11,457
What I want to do
as of this morning

803
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,793
is just a vague recollection.

804
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:15,428
What I want to do is no longer
a factor in my life!

805
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:17,496
The only thing that counts is
what I'm compelled to do,

806
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,967
cause God dammit,
I have no other fucking option!

807
00:52:21,735 --> 00:52:23,003
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

808
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:25,138
I'm sorry.

809
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,178
Do you have children?
No, I'm 24.

810
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:33,013
Uh-hm.

811
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:36,783
- <i>Do you want kids, someday?</i>
- Yeah.

812
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:38,517
But not yet.

813
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:41,188
I draw comics.
I'm still a kid myself.

814
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:42,990
My daughter's 17.
She's...

815
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:45,591
She's fond of comics,
as far as I can tell.

816
00:52:45,726 --> 00:52:47,627
That's really manipulative.

817
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:50,831
Emotionally.
That's a pretty shitty move.

818
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:55,802
You're a pretty big asshole,
if you put it all together.

819
00:52:55,836 --> 00:52:57,703
You know Linda,
if I have to accept the fact

820
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:58,805
that you're calling me
an asshole,

821
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,908
then we can be friends,
right?

822
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:02,809
Linda?
Linda, what's going on?

823
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:07,446
Err... Everything's fine.
It's cool, it's cool.

824
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:11,118
- I thought I just saw Danny.
- <i>Danny?</i>

825
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:15,721
- My ex.
- <i>Your ex is on Heligoland?</i>

826
00:53:16,123 --> 00:53:19,458
<i>There's no way
he can be here, but...</i>

827
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:21,627
Err, and he's a problem?

828
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:27,667
Not a,
he's the problem.

829
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:30,469
He hurt me.

830
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:32,873
Badly.

831
00:53:35,008 --> 00:53:37,110
And then he acquired
a taste for it.

832
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:40,847
So he's following you?
A stalker.

833
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:47,054
What a pleasant,
practical word.

834
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:48,755
Stalker.

835
00:53:51,024 --> 00:53:54,094
But it doesn't capture that
sense of being so defenseless.

836
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,731
To violence.

837
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:00,834
To your body
and in your head.

838
00:54:01,902 --> 00:54:04,938
Or that he is wherever I am
regardless of time.

839
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:10,243
- <i>Even if he's not there.</i>
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

840
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:16,582
Me too.

841
00:54:18,919 --> 00:54:21,088
By the way, I'll do it.

842
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:23,924
- I'm sorry?
- <i>I'll cut the guy up.</i>

843
00:54:25,058 --> 00:54:26,960
In the past few hours
I wasn't thinking about Danny

844
00:54:26,994 --> 00:54:29,096
at all for the first time
in who knows.

845
00:54:29,129 --> 00:54:30,696
And I wasn't afraid.

846
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:33,632
Nausea, yeah,
but I wasn't afraid.

847
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:36,737
Linda, that's... that's...

848
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,106
Thank you.
Thank you.

849
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:40,907
<i>You can thank me later,
Paul.</i>

850
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,283
Thanks.
Professor Herzfeld,

851
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:32,385
considering that I'm
driving you around...

852
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:35,422
during the end
of the world here...

853
00:56:35,455 --> 00:56:38,291
Might I get another chance
to participate in an autopsy?

854
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,260
You're totally unfit for that.

855
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:43,063
Hello? Linda?

856
00:56:51,204 --> 00:56:53,740
Is this actually legal
what we're about to do?

857
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:56,743
<i>Can any old amateur
go and cut up some old lady?</i>

858
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:59,346
No, that's desecration
of a corpse.

859
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:01,014
Desecration? Wow!

860
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:03,150
Yeah.
But I'm allowed to do this.

861
00:57:03,183 --> 00:57:06,119
And you are in end effect
an extension of me.

862
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:07,821
I take full responsibility!

863
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:08,955
Now listen closely.

864
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:12,792
<i>You place the knife on
the underside of the chin.</i>

865
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:14,995
<i>You press deeply
into the flesh</i>

866
00:57:15,028 --> 00:57:17,998
<i>and you make a cut straight
down to the sternum.</i>

867
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:49,329
- <i>I can see the muscles.</i>
- Good. This is very good.

868
00:57:49,362 --> 00:57:52,399
Now I want you to place
the knife once again

869
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:54,034
at the point of the chin.

870
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:58,171
Go to the right and left
parallel to both lower jaws.

871
00:57:59,773 --> 00:58:00,706
I'm on it.

872
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:15,088
- And now it's done.
- <i>Very good.</i>

873
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:17,390
You're gonna need
both hands for the next step,

874
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:20,293
one for the knife,
the other for the tweezers.

875
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:22,262
Draw the skin away

876
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,198
<i>and undermine the fat tissue
with the blade.</i>

877
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:26,233
What does that mean?

878
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:29,502
<i>Yeah, Undermine means
you pull the skin up</i>

879
00:58:29,536 --> 00:58:31,304
and detach the fat tissue
underneath

880
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:33,306
with horizontal incisions.

881
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,109
It's similar to...
like cutting a filet mignon.

882
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,212
Just don't compare this
to food, please.

883
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:41,114
You're right.
Sorry.

884
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:05,038
Seems to have a piece
of meat in his throat.

885
00:59:05,071 --> 00:59:06,239
<i>That's the base
of the tongue.</i>

886
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:09,109
- The stump you can probably just, err..
- Amputate?

887
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:11,544
Amputate. Exactly.

888
00:59:28,595 --> 00:59:29,796
- Done!
- <i>Good.</i>

889
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:33,466
Now with the tip of the knife,
you can cut open the larynx

890
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,969
and then pull out
the gristle in there.

891
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:37,337
Like with a shrimp.

892
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,940
- Paul! Can you avoid food?
- Eh, yeah.

893
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:49,516
Ahh...

894
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:14,374
Man! Ender!
What the fuck?!

895
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:15,475
Linda?

896
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:16,576
<i>Sorry, I didn't know
it was gonna be this loud.</i>

897
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:18,611
I thought music might relax
everything a little bit.

898
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:19,579
Put a lid on it!

899
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:21,348
How am I supposed to
talk on the telephone?

900
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:24,384
<i>Linda!</i>

901
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:25,585
- What's going on?
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

902
01:00:25,618 --> 01:00:26,853
<i>I dropped the friggin thing.</i>

903
01:00:26,886 --> 01:00:30,357
- Wha? Do you have the object?
- <i>Hold on! I'm looking!</i>

904
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,126
Do you have the object?

905
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:36,162
- Do you have the object, Linda?
- <i>Yes.</i>

906
01:00:36,196 --> 01:00:37,464
And what is it?

907
01:00:37,497 --> 01:00:38,665
<i>One of those surprise eggs.</i>

908
01:00:38,698 --> 01:00:41,634
So like not the chocolate,
just the yellow plastic thing.

909
01:00:41,668 --> 01:00:45,472
- <i>Should I open it?</i>
- Yes, but carefully!

910
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,248
- Oha!
- It's a picture of some old lady.

911
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:56,583
Kiss my motherfu... Paul!

912
01:00:56,616 --> 01:00:59,652
- That's Töven. Friederike Töven.
- You know this woman?

913
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:02,622
Well from around, yeah.
She lives on the island.

914
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:04,257
Paul?

915
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,426
Were you listening?

916
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:07,694
- Babette?
- <i>Hello.</i>

917
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:10,096
Quick question. I've got
listed in my private calendar

918
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,098
a meeting with
a Mrs. Friederike Töven

919
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,501
I've no idea who that is and
can't remember what it's about.

920
01:01:14,534 --> 01:01:17,570
Would you check the databank
and find out who that is?

921
01:01:17,604 --> 01:01:19,005
Töven. Got it.

922
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:20,140
I'll get right back to you.

923
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,541
<i>Thank you.</i>

924
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:28,381
What are we going to do
in Cuxhaven,

925
01:01:28,415 --> 01:01:31,050
if we find out that no
ferries are running?

926
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:34,654
Do me a favor and...
How rich are you exactly?

927
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:36,589
What makes you think
that I'd be rich?

928
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:42,395
Quite... quite rich.
Stayclose. de

929
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:43,997
- What?
- The same thing as Facebook.

930
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,965
Set it up
when I was 14 years old.

931
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:47,467
I called it an online
friendship book.

932
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,003
At some point I had
400,000 profiles.

933
01:01:50,036 --> 01:01:52,272
Yeah.
You know how the times were...

934
01:01:52,305 --> 01:01:54,974
One day I got an email from
another social media site...

935
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:56,609
And probably sold the site
for a million Euros.

936
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,545
Yeah, I was fourteen.

937
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:02,015
Told them I wanted 14 million
for the site, as like a joke.

938
01:02:02,048 --> 01:02:04,117
Yeah, but they said yes.

939
01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:07,720
- 14 million?
- Hm.

940
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:10,323
And they were all real nice.
Cultivated.

941
01:02:11,224 --> 01:02:14,394
- Hello?
- Friederike Töven is Friederike Erlang.

942
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:16,563
<i>At least that was her name
when she was judge</i>

943
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:19,098
in the trial
against Jan Sadler.

944
01:02:19,132 --> 01:02:22,502
<i>After the whole controversy
she retired early,</i>

945
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:25,773
resumed her maiden name,
and now resides in...

946
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:27,574
In Heligoland.

947
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:44,090
CAUSE OF DEATH: HANGING

948
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,125
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
You're not allowed to be here!

949
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:48,261
Let me see my daughter.

950
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,498
Jens, you shouldn't be here.

951
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:54,167
Paul, let me see my daughter,
fuck the rules!

952
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,669
It's not about that.
Don't do this to yourself, yeah?

953
01:02:56,703 --> 01:02:58,538
Come on, come.

954
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,442
Jens, she hung herself.

955
01:03:02,475 --> 01:03:04,677
There's no reason
to doubt that.

956
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:08,381
Yeah, but that fucker
made Lily do it.

957
01:03:09,582 --> 01:03:12,418
He licked my daughter
on her entire body!

958
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:17,090
And then he raped her.
Again and again and again.

959
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:20,560
And then he described
how he planned to torture her!

960
01:03:20,593 --> 01:03:23,329
For so long till she ultimately
had no alternative.

961
01:03:23,363 --> 01:03:25,331
And then he left a noose
there for her.

962
01:03:25,365 --> 01:03:26,800
Can you follow this, Paul?

963
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:28,701
It was him who murdered her!
Christ!

964
01:03:28,736 --> 01:03:30,403
He might as well've put
the noose around her neck.

965
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:31,471
Jens,
I'm aware of all that.

966
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:34,173
And I'm certain, the court
will bear that in mind.

967
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:35,575
This fucking pig will spend
a lot of time behind...

968
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:37,610
A lot?
C'mon, you shitting me?

969
01:03:37,644 --> 01:03:40,647
Huh, Paul?
We both do the same job

970
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,783
and we both know, if he's
only convicted of rape

971
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,752
that at the latest,
after five years

972
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,686
he's out of jail,
at the very latest.

973
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:48,421
Jens, it wasn't
only just rape.

974
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:51,759
It was abduction as well,
and Lily was a minor.

975
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,762
How old is Hannah now, huh?
Huh?

976
01:03:54,795 --> 01:03:56,563
- 13, am I right?
- Yeah.

977
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:58,398
So tell me, you want
Sadler roaming around

978
01:03:58,431 --> 01:03:59,699
when Hannah is finishing
high school?

979
01:03:59,733 --> 01:04:01,367
No Jens, obviously not!

980
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:04,704
- But I cannot break the rules...
- Yes, yes you can!

981
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:07,808
It's in your hand.
You just write it down.

982
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:11,110
Write that he murdered her.
That's not a lie.

983
01:04:11,144 --> 01:04:12,345
We can cremate the body

984
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:14,815
and nobody'll be able
to verify it, Paul!

985
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:17,317
Please!
Just do this, please.

986
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,652
Jens, that's a criminal
offense.

987
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:21,421
If word were to get out...

988
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:27,660
- No word'll get out, Paul.
- It's too much of a risk.

989
01:04:27,694 --> 01:04:29,228
Ah!

990
01:04:29,763 --> 01:04:31,431
What do you mean risk?

991
01:04:31,464 --> 01:04:34,167
A risk for you?
For your career?

992
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,401
Jens, if word got out,

993
01:04:35,435 --> 01:04:37,303
that'd be a feast
for Sadler's lawyers

994
01:04:37,337 --> 01:04:39,172
- and he'd be out much earlier!
- Enough!

995
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:42,542
Listen, I've got money.
Just inherited.

996
01:04:42,575 --> 01:04:45,712
160,000 Euros. I've spoken
about this to Claudia already.

997
01:04:46,713 --> 01:04:51,217
Yeah? It means nothing to us.
The money's yours!

998
01:04:51,852 --> 01:04:53,419
Paul?

999
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:56,790
Jens, don't do this please.

1000
01:05:03,663 --> 01:05:05,331
I'm sorry.

1001
01:05:08,368 --> 01:05:10,203
<i>There are mitigating
circumstances</i>

1002
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:11,805
<i>on behalf of the accused,</i>

1003
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,274
that he never showed any sign
of inappropriate behavior.

1004
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:19,813
And therefore we must not
lose sight of the potential

1005
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,681
for social rehabilitation

1006
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:24,450
pertaining to
first-time offenders.

1007
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:28,521
The court therefore
issues a punishment

1008
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:30,891
for the case of rape
before us,

1009
01:05:30,924 --> 01:05:34,594
a prison sentence of three years
and eight months.

1010
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:39,198
The grounds for judgement
are the following.

1011
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:40,834
Three and a half years?!

1012
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:43,737
Hey, we're gonna appeal.

1013
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:45,806
Three and a half years?!

1014
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,441
This bastard raped
my only daughter!

1015
01:05:48,474 --> 01:05:50,677
He raped her and then
forced her to commit...

1016
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,212
It was murder,
you godforsaken witch!

1017
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:55,916
You saw the videos
with your own eyes!

1018
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:59,352
This man is a monster.
He's a monster!

1019
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:03,189
Why is he allowed to go
on living, this scum?

1020
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:07,728
While my Lily has maggots
crawling out of her eyes?!

1021
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:10,864
Paul? Paul!

1022
01:06:21,842 --> 01:06:24,912
Zarrentin?
Never heard of it.

1023
01:06:25,012 --> 01:06:26,479
It's a little village
on Lake Schalsee.

1024
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:28,281
Easy to reach
via local roads.

1025
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:33,553
- What are we doing there?
- <i>Recalculating.</i>

1026
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:35,555
It's where Marinek lives.

1027
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:40,460
Is that the guy
who abducted your daughter?

1028
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:44,497
Sorry about that,
it's not like I get off

1029
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,766
on spying on your private
phone conversations,

1030
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:49,002
but I can't cover my ears and
drive you halfway across Europe.

1031
01:06:49,036 --> 01:06:51,337
And about yourself...
Well, you don't say anything.

1032
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,973
How come you're doing this
anyway, huh?

1033
01:06:53,006 --> 01:06:54,674
- What?
- Why are you helping me?

1034
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,576
I already told you,
for the internship.

1035
01:06:56,609 --> 01:06:57,778
I wanted a second chance
to be able to...

1036
01:06:57,811 --> 01:06:59,913
Blablabla.
I don't believe a word of it.

1037
01:06:59,947 --> 01:07:00,848
You're as rich as hell,

1038
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:02,950
you could buy any
internship you wanted.

1039
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,017
Yes.

1040
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:06,787
- I wanted to have the on with you.
- Why?

1041
01:07:09,455 --> 01:07:11,024
I'm sorry, but considering
the circumstances,

1042
01:07:11,058 --> 01:07:12,159
it's not really appropriate.

1043
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:14,995
And I would say, at this
moment it is very appropriate.

1044
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:16,130
I'll let you know
at some point,

1045
01:07:16,163 --> 01:07:19,499
but not until we get this
whole thing taken care of

1046
01:07:19,532 --> 01:07:20,734
and it ends well.

1047
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:23,503
But now?
It's all about you, I'd say.

1048
01:07:23,536 --> 01:07:26,907
Who, err,
is this Marinek guy?

1049
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:35,381
I don't know,
if he abducted my daughter,

1050
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:37,683
but he definitely has
something to do with this.

1051
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:40,921
- And how do we know this?
- Cause of the judge.

1052
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:42,890
What judge?

1053
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:54,902
Mrs. Töven!
Hello? Are you in there?

1054
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:57,603
An old woman is not gonna be
hanging around outside

1055
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:59,605
in this weather!

1056
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,878
Mrs. Töven,
sorry to bother you!

1057
01:08:04,912 --> 01:08:08,081
We found your picture stuffed
in the throat of a corpse!

1058
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:12,385
- She ain't home. C'mon!
- Come on, Ender!

1059
01:08:15,521 --> 01:08:18,058
<i>You can't go around
opening people's doors!</i>

1060
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,999
Mrs. Töven?

1061
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:32,973
- Hello?
- Mrs. Töven?

1062
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:42,682
Mrs. Töven?

1063
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,730
LENIENT JUDGE:
JAN S. RELEASED

1064
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,605
- <i>Linda?</i>
- Hey, Professor!

1065
01:09:05,638 --> 01:09:08,108
Where you aware that Ender
moonlights as a locksmith?

1066
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,179
<i>We found Friederike
Töven's house.</i>

1067
01:09:12,212 --> 01:09:13,747
<i>Looks like it's empty,
though.</i>

1068
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:15,048
<i>Don't go in.</i>

1069
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:17,416
- Whatever you do, don't go in the house!
- Tss!

1070
01:09:17,516 --> 01:09:18,852
I already desecrated
a corpse for you.

1071
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:21,088
Breaking and entering
won't make a difference!

1072
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:22,022
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>

1073
01:09:22,055 --> 01:09:24,523
<i>You have no idea
what to expect in there.</i>

1074
01:09:24,557 --> 01:09:25,993
Ender!

1075
01:09:27,627 --> 01:09:28,929
<i>We'll take a look around,</i>

1076
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:30,063
and then we'll go.

1077
01:09:30,097 --> 01:09:30,998
What's the problem?

1078
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:31,999
<i>Problem?</i>

1079
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:33,166
<i>Linda, I don't think
you're getting this!</i>

1080
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,069
<i>Whoever hid that picture
of Töven in Erik's throat</i>

1081
01:09:36,103 --> 01:09:37,204
<i>is connected to Hannah's
kidnapping</i>

1082
01:09:37,237 --> 01:09:41,540
<i>and is a two-time,
extremely brutal serial killer</i>

1083
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:44,677
<i>and this person just might be
hiding in the house this moment,</i>

1084
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,512
<i>in a closet, under the couch,
behind a door</i>

1085
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:47,647
<i>or who knows where else.</i>

1086
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,917
<i>So please, leave the house
with Ender right away!</i>

1087
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:53,754
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1088
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,589
- Ender!
- <i>Linda, are you listening?</i>

1089
01:09:56,622 --> 01:09:58,658
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- She needs help!

1090
01:09:58,691 --> 01:10:00,994
They taught us this
in driving school. Fuck!

1091
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:03,764
<i>Linda, where are you?
Linda, talk to me!</i>

1092
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:04,563
<i>What's going on?</i>

1093
01:10:04,597 --> 01:10:05,665
Oh God in heaven!

1094
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:10,137
- She's dead.
- No, she's still alive! She's breathing!

1095
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:11,537
- Linda!
- Help me out here!

1096
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,572
How many times do you
have push? Is it twelve?

1097
01:10:13,606 --> 01:10:15,508
Or eighteen?
How many times?!

1098
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,110
Linda, she's dead!

1099
01:10:17,677 --> 01:10:20,713
This woman is dead!
Just take...

1100
01:10:20,747 --> 01:10:22,082
Take a look at her!

1101
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:25,018
She's been dead.

1102
01:10:30,523 --> 01:10:31,925
Fuck!

1103
01:10:34,828 --> 01:10:36,595
<i>Linda!</i>

1104
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:38,564
<i>Linda!
Jesus Christ, Linda!</i>

1105
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:40,133
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

1106
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:43,737
- She... she was still like breathing.
- <i>Linda?</i>

1107
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,172
- <i>Respiration sounds.</i>
- She moaned!

1108
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:46,773
<i>The body decomposes and
expels air out of the lungs.</i>

1109
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,775
Paul, she's got spots.
Lividity?

1110
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:50,077
<i>They go away
when you press on them?</i>

1111
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,878
Do they go away
when you press?

1112
01:10:52,712 --> 01:10:54,915
Err... Let me see.

1113
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:06,827
- No.
- <i>Then she's been dead for several hours.</i>

1114
01:11:14,001 --> 01:11:15,836
Paul, it's me.

1115
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,570
There's no one here.
I checked the house.

1116
01:11:17,603 --> 01:11:19,740
<i>You're gonna have to bring the
body down to the morgue, ok?</i>

1117
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:21,574
<i>Yeah,
of course we can do that,</i>

1118
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:23,576
<i>but we ain't jumpin' for joy,
that's for sure.</i>

1119
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:24,745
I'll get back to you!

1120
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:29,082
- Your colleague lives here?
- Yeah, after his daught...

1121
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,085
After his daughter Lily...
Since back then.

1122
01:12:03,283 --> 01:12:05,986
Oh, look! There must be
about 100,000 Euros.

1123
01:12:06,086 --> 01:12:08,121
It's a 160,000.

1124
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:09,122
That's exactly the amount

1125
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:10,991
that Jens Marinek
offered me.

1126
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:14,961
I think someone's
expecting you.

1127
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:19,299
Whoa!

1128
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:21,600
And you stay put!

1129
01:12:25,704 --> 01:12:27,074
Jens?

1130
01:12:33,013 --> 01:12:34,680
Jens?

1131
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,919
Jens, it's me.

1132
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:47,194
Jens?

1133
01:12:50,097 --> 01:12:52,866
God, it's really
warm in here!

1134
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:54,367
Dude, better be careful
with that thing there.

1135
01:12:54,401 --> 01:12:57,737
You, remain where you are,
at the door.

1136
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:59,372
Have you understood?

1137
01:13:12,285 --> 01:13:14,421
- There must be more of those things!
- son-of-a-bitch!!

1138
01:13:14,454 --> 01:13:16,256
I said, wait at the door,
goddammit!

1139
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:18,191
I was waiting by the door,
but then I found this here.

1140
01:13:18,225 --> 01:13:19,025
Look!

1141
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:22,729
It's an autopsy report.
Err, from...

1142
01:13:22,762 --> 01:13:24,798
There was a young woman,
she'd been raped,

1143
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:27,033
died of a broken neck,
but uhh...

1144
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:30,070
both name and age are missing.
And there's a picture...

1145
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:34,941
Maybe that could be
your daughter?

1146
01:14:17,784 --> 01:14:20,754
Professor Herzfeld,
maybe that isn't a good...

1147
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:27,761
Ugh...

1148
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:36,203
So, time to finally put an end
to this serial murders.

1149
01:14:36,236 --> 01:14:37,437
We only got two tables!

1150
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,305
Nah...

1151
01:14:38,338 --> 01:14:40,340
Let's hope our killer
knows that, too!

1152
01:14:41,474 --> 01:14:44,211
Not that he thinks we got
an unlimited supply of tables.

1153
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:45,979
Unlimited ta...

1154
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:52,718
Hey.

1155
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:57,357
Hey.

1156
01:14:58,425 --> 01:14:59,426
You afraid?

1157
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,195
Yeah of course,
you not?

1158
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:05,932
Yeah, but it's cool.

1159
01:15:07,801 --> 01:15:09,469
It s been worse.

1160
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,979
Look out.

1161
01:15:22,549 --> 01:15:24,417
What the fuck is that?

1162
01:15:25,318 --> 01:15:27,220
Probably the back-up
power supply.

1163
01:15:27,254 --> 01:15:29,289
Generator must
by conking out.

1164
01:15:30,957 --> 01:15:31,791
Where are you going?

1165
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:34,427
Just gonna check
if everything's okay.

1166
01:15:34,461 --> 01:15:35,462
Be right back.

1167
01:15:56,983 --> 01:15:59,185
Huh. Great!

1168
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:01,187
Fuck!

1169
01:16:20,373 --> 01:16:22,442
Someone there?

1170
01:16:25,578 --> 01:16:27,347
Ender?

1171
01:16:32,452 --> 01:16:33,620
You're not seriously
considering

1172
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:36,022
doing an autopsy on
this animal, are you?

1173
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:37,023
If that was expected of me,

1174
01:16:37,057 --> 01:16:39,926
then there'd be autopsy tools
laying around.

1175
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:42,195
Up until now
it was all consistent.

1176
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:44,531
One part of the puzzle
led to another one.

1177
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:47,100
First the body,
then the ax, the money.

1178
01:16:47,133 --> 01:16:49,536
There's a certain latent
symbolism here.

1179
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:52,339
The symbolism isn't that hard
to decipher. You 're a pig.

1180
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:54,274
What was the first thing
we came across here?

1181
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:56,109
Err, the money?

1182
01:16:56,142 --> 01:16:58,345
No, it wasn't that.
Not the money.

1183
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:06,186
They're my size.

1184
01:17:06,653 --> 01:17:08,421
What do they symbolize?

1185
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:12,158
Err... Puddles? Rain?
Being wet?

1186
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:14,961
Water.

1187
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:21,935
Woah.

1188
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:51,498
Oh, that's that Jan Sadler,

1189
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:53,333
who was on the news
way back when.

1190
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:06,413
He must have been
trailing him 24 hours a day.

1191
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,515
For three and a half years
Jens had to be patient,

1192
01:18:08,548 --> 01:18:10,417
till he could
go through with this.

1193
01:18:13,186 --> 01:18:15,688
Hey, and why are you the one
he wants to get revenge on?

1194
01:18:15,722 --> 01:18:19,526
He should spend his time
going after this "specimen."

1195
01:18:25,698 --> 01:18:28,034
I'm afraid
he already did that.

1196
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:33,373
- Oh, is that a...
- Tongue. Exactly.

1197
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:37,043
And now we know
who Erik is.

1198
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:20,520
No one's answering.

1199
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:23,723
Have you seen this yet?

1200
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:25,625
Yeah, that's Lily Marinek.

1201
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:28,762
No, I'm talking about
this here.

1202
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:50,116
Oh God!

1203
01:19:52,685 --> 01:19:54,420
Is that your daughter?

1204
01:19:58,157 --> 01:19:59,292
I'm not sure.

1205
01:19:59,325 --> 01:20:01,694
Look at her ankle.
Some kind of tattoo.

1206
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:03,663
She have one like that?

1207
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:05,565
Err... I...

1208
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:08,301
I don't know.

1209
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:13,741
What is he planning on
doing with the body?

1210
01:20:24,785 --> 01:20:26,653
Who's filming that?

1211
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,255
Must be two of them.

1212
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:35,662
He's bringing her here.

1213
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:15,168
Hey, what's that there,
out there?

1214
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,337
It looks like a buoy,
or what is it?

1215
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,504
No idea.

1216
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:20,506
- Let me go take a look!
- Wait! No!

1217
01:21:23,877 --> 01:21:24,878
Whoa!

1218
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:27,748
- Looks like some kind of a cross!
- What?!

1219
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:30,249
<i>Any doubts yet?</i>

1220
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:33,787
<i>That was never
my cup of tea.</i>

1221
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:40,126
No! Stop!

1222
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:45,565
- It really is a cross!
- <i>Ingolf!</i>

1223
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,201
You're way too close!

1224
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:06,252
Ingolf?

1225
01:22:07,387 --> 01:22:08,756
Ingolf! Ingolf!

1226
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,794
Turn around, towards me.
Ingolf, listen to me.

1227
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:14,962
You have to stay calm.

1228
01:22:14,995 --> 01:22:16,063
It's only a matter
of seconds,

1229
01:22:16,096 --> 01:22:18,364
till your muscles get stiff
and cease to function.

1230
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:20,500
I can't go to you cause
the ice will break.

1231
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:22,435
I want you to do
the following.

1232
01:22:22,468 --> 01:22:23,670
You're gonna look at me

1233
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:25,839
and do one stroke
in my direction.

1234
01:22:25,873 --> 01:22:28,574
Then I can grab you.
Have you understood?

1235
01:22:37,684 --> 01:22:39,285
Give me your hand.

1236
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:38,611
Ender?!

1237
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:44,985
Ender, tell me it's you!

1238
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:54,660
Ah, it's you, oh my God.
There was someone...

1239
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:57,831
Ender?

1240
01:24:10,576 --> 01:24:12,411
It's all good,
everything's fine.

1241
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:15,448
We gotta warm you up.

1242
01:24:15,481 --> 01:24:16,516
Everything's fine.

1243
01:24:22,089 --> 01:24:24,657
We gotta get you back
inside the house.

1244
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,760
Gotta get you warm.

1245
01:24:27,493 --> 01:24:30,396
Okay?
Back to the heating units.

1246
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:32,532
We have to get you warm
or ther'll be hypothermia.

1247
01:24:32,565 --> 01:24:34,567
And you'll be dead.

1248
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,903
Ah!

1249
01:24:37,971 --> 01:24:41,108
Not... on my... first date.

1250
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:42,943
Good!
That's good!

1251
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:45,311
Stay awake.

1252
01:24:45,813 --> 01:24:46,814
Talk to me!

1253
01:24:46,847 --> 01:24:48,015
Okay?

1254
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:49,348
Tell me something.

1255
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:51,384
Hey, hey!
Stay awake!

1256
01:24:51,717 --> 01:24:53,954
Look at me,
don't go to sleep!

1257
01:25:28,155 --> 01:25:30,690
- Hello?
- Paul, I got a serious problem here!

1258
01:25:30,723 --> 01:25:32,425
The lights went out,
Ender was suddenly gone.

1259
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:33,559
They went back on,

1260
01:25:33,593 --> 01:25:35,062
Ender was in front of me
with a knife in his shoulder.

1261
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:37,597
- Ender, can he still walk?
- <i>He took two steps into the room</i>

1262
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,933
and then he passed out
and fell into my arms.

1263
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:43,003
- You're gonna have to go for help.
- <i>What am I going to do?</i>

1264
01:25:43,036 --> 01:25:44,403
<i>There're no doctors
on the island</i>

1265
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:45,873
and the killer's here
in the building!

1266
01:25:45,906 --> 01:25:47,506
Can you lock yourself
away somewhere?

1267
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,442
Yeah, I already did that.
Fuck!

1268
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:51,544
I have no idea, if Ender is
gonna be able to hold on!

1269
01:25:51,577 --> 01:25:54,014
- <i>His pulse?</i>
- Really weak!

1270
01:25:54,047 --> 01:25:54,815
<i>Blood?</i>

1271
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:56,950
Yeah, but it's no
longer spouting!

1272
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:57,985
<i>Good!</i>

1273
01:25:58,651 --> 01:25:59,619
Maybe we're lucky,

1274
01:25:59,652 --> 01:26:01,554
none of the important arteries
were affected.

1275
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:04,457
- Should I pull the knife out?
- No! No way!

1276
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,759
<i>Don't pull out the knife.</i>

1277
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:06,860
<i>You can't move him at all.</i>

1278
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:09,129
You have to keep him warm.

1279
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:11,098
And what?

1280
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:14,400
Jesus Christ, Paul!
I need like some support here!

1281
01:26:15,202 --> 01:26:16,669
Give me five minutes.

1282
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:17,938
Paul?! Paul...

1283
01:26:17,971 --> 01:26:20,439
You son of a bitch.

1284
01:26:20,941 --> 01:26:23,877
Paul!
You fuckin' asshole!

1285
01:26:25,511 --> 01:26:28,048
What am I supposed to do,
you idiot?

1286
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:30,017
Fuck!

1287
01:26:32,185 --> 01:26:34,587
KEEP CALM IN AN EMERGENCY

1288
01:26:41,594 --> 01:26:44,164
No, Ender, it's not time
to go yet, okay?

1289
01:26:44,197 --> 01:26:45,732
Ender?

1290
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:46,900
Ender?

1291
01:26:47,768 --> 01:26:49,803
Don't die now, please!

1292
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:34,214
Was that Hannah
in the video?

1293
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,152
Is she in the lake?

1294
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:42,756
If she is in the lake, then
it doesn't matter what I do.

1295
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:44,657
If she's alive,
it does.

1296
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:47,626
So I'm working under the
assumption she's still alive.

1297
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:52,899
You saved my life.

1298
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:56,837
I...

1299
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,775
I forgive you.

1300
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,177
Like this morning,
you remember?

1301
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:07,914
With the... with the def...

1302
01:28:07,948 --> 01:28:10,784
Defibr... Defibrili...
Defibre...

1303
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:16,857
That was a mean joke.
I forgive you.

1304
01:28:56,163 --> 01:28:57,964
<i>Hello?</i>

1305
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,669
Who's that?
Hello?

1306
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:27,761
- Ender.
- Hey now, what's going on?

1307
01:29:27,794 --> 01:29:30,263
- What's going on?
- How come you don't feel anything?

1308
01:29:30,297 --> 01:29:33,400
- Must have caught a cold...
- No! No, no, no.

1309
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:35,202
Hold on! You're not
allowed to touch that!

1310
01:29:35,235 --> 01:29:38,972
Listen up!
It's like we've been mugged.

1311
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:41,741
You were injured by the killer.
Don't touch it!

1312
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:43,076
Not on your head.

1313
01:29:43,676 --> 01:29:46,645
And more so,
not on your shoulder, okay?

1314
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:48,248
Shi... sh...

1315
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:51,151
Ender... Ender!

1316
01:29:57,057 --> 01:29:58,859
Ender! Whoa!

1317
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:07,868
<i>Finally!</i>

1318
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:11,271
Linda, what's goin' on
out there, huh?

1319
01:30:11,304 --> 01:30:13,773
If you wanna know,
I'm barricading the door!

1320
01:30:15,075 --> 01:30:17,710
- Linda, you have a key, don't you?
- <i>Yes, I do Professor,</i>

1321
01:30:17,744 --> 01:30:18,945
<i>but the killer has one, too!</i>

1322
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:20,679
Linda, you gotta get out of
there so Ender can be treated.

1323
01:30:20,713 --> 01:30:21,548
<i>Forget about it.</i>

1324
01:30:21,581 --> 01:30:22,849
<i>I called the local
weather service.</i>

1325
01:30:22,883 --> 01:30:25,118
- And?
- No chance of any planes.

1326
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,254
In five hours there might be
a window perhaps,

1327
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:28,522
when flights
might be possible.

1328
01:30:28,555 --> 01:30:31,124
- Five hours are way too long.
- <i>Fuck! Do something!</i>

1329
01:30:31,158 --> 01:30:32,192
<i>You're with the police!</i>

1330
01:30:32,225 --> 01:30:34,094
Wish it were that simple.
Lemme see what I can do.

1331
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:37,297
Yes please!
Cause I'm totally not into...

1332
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:38,999
to watching Ender die
before my eyes

1333
01:30:39,032 --> 01:30:40,300
or that this psycho
comes back

1334
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:42,169
<i>and impales me like the
old woman there.</i>

1335
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:43,970
- What did you just say?
- <i>I'm not into watch...</i>

1336
01:30:44,004 --> 01:30:45,438
No, no, no,
what's the impale thing!

1337
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:47,774
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- That someone jammed a stick up her ass,

1338
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:49,743
for chrissake!!
That's what I mean.

1339
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:53,947
Take it out.

1340
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:57,284
No, I'm gonna lay down
in the fetal position

1341
01:30:57,317 --> 01:30:59,819
on the floor next to Ender
and wait for the cavalry

1342
01:30:59,853 --> 01:31:01,254
<i>and pray I'll still remember
the Our Father.</i>

1343
01:31:01,288 --> 01:31:03,790
Linda, I promise you
in the name of all I love:

1344
01:31:03,823 --> 01:31:06,960
I will find a way to get to you
in the next two hours!

1345
01:31:07,394 --> 01:31:10,263
<i>But before that, no one
will get over there, understand?</i>

1346
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,199
No special ops,
no SWAT team,

1347
01:31:12,232 --> 01:31:15,101
not the CIA and certainly
not the cavalry!

1348
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:18,104
- <i>Linda, this stick is a broomstick, right?</i>
- Yeah.

1349
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:19,039
How do you know that?

1350
01:31:19,072 --> 01:31:20,240
<i>From a video,
I'll explain it later.</i>

1351
01:31:20,273 --> 01:31:24,477
<i>Listen: The kidnapper
carved something in the stick.</i>

1352
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:25,445
<i>That is the clue!</i>

1353
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:29,249
Good, Professor.

1354
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,118
<i>I'll help you.
You got two hours.</i>

1355
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:33,386
<i>Then I'm gonna call
the police,</i>

1356
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,355
<i>the fire department
and the news.</i>

1357
01:31:47,434 --> 01:31:49,369
You got something
to write with?

1358
01:31:50,136 --> 01:31:51,271
- Do we?
- Yeah!

1359
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:55,108
5-3-6-6-4...

1360
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:59,012
<i>3-5-7-3-6-4-9-0.</i>

1361
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:01,848
On the other side,
the half that you know...

1362
01:32:01,881 --> 01:32:03,083
is another one.

1363
01:32:03,483 --> 01:32:10,223
<i>9-0-8-9-2-0-7-0-
5-3-1-8-4-5-1.</i>

1364
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:13,193
- Are there dots?
- What's that? Linda!

1365
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:15,528
- Are there periods?
- Decimal points, dots.

1366
01:32:15,562 --> 01:32:18,064
<i>Yeah, maybe.
After the numbers.</i>

1367
01:32:18,098 --> 01:32:19,966
- <i>Hold on.</i>
- What do you think it means?

1368
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:26,139
There really are
periods here.

1369
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:29,109
<i>In the first number
after the 2nd digit,</i>

1370
01:32:29,142 --> 01:32:32,078
and in the second one
after the 1st digit.

1371
01:32:32,112 --> 01:32:34,814
Linda, I'll call you
right back.

1372
01:32:35,282 --> 01:32:37,317
- They're geo-coordinates.
- What's that?

1373
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:38,952
Geo-coordinates.

1374
01:32:39,185 --> 01:32:40,987
Here's the user's manual
from Mercedes.

1375
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:43,056
No idea how it works.

1376
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:44,057
The sales guy
made a big deal

1377
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:47,394
that you can put
geo-coordinates into the GPS.

1378
01:32:48,228 --> 01:32:51,331
- Okay.
- It's a feature for their luxury...

1379
01:33:02,442 --> 01:33:04,911
- <i>Hello?</i>
- The lab tests are back from the dead woman.

1380
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:07,147
<i>A cyanide derivative.</i>

1381
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,049
So that means
she was poisoned?

1382
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:11,251
- Yeah, but it was suicide.
- That's ridiculous.

1383
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:12,319
Someone cut out
her jaw joint

1384
01:33:12,352 --> 01:33:13,620
and then amputated
both hands.

1385
01:33:13,653 --> 01:33:16,389
<i>But it was after she died
and she consented.</i>

1386
01:33:18,058 --> 01:33:19,959
<i>After my passing my dead body</i>

1387
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:21,561
<i>will at least have
a purpose.</i>

1388
01:33:21,594 --> 01:33:23,363
<i>There's a farewell letter
of sorts.</i>

1389
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:26,299
<i>A video our colleagues found
in Schwintowski's apartment.</i>

1390
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:28,134
<i>I do all this
in full command</i>

1391
01:33:28,168 --> 01:33:31,037
<i>of my cognitive abilities
and own free will.</i>

1392
01:33:40,113 --> 01:33:42,449
- <i>Who was this woman?</i>
- <i>Sybille Schwintowski.</i>

1393
01:33:42,482 --> 01:33:45,919
<i>Wife of Philipp Schwintowski,
who owns a moving company.</i>

1394
01:33:45,952 --> 01:33:47,822
<i>They have one daughter,
Rebecca.</i>

1395
01:33:52,926 --> 01:33:55,095
<i>Schwintowski... Who is that?</i>

1396
01:33:56,496 --> 01:33:58,431
<i>The Feds have
a huge file on him.</i>

1397
01:33:58,465 --> 01:34:01,868
<i>Bookmaking, loan sharking,
mafia connections.</i>

1398
01:34:01,968 --> 01:34:03,603
<i>When he was younger
he was in court for murder</i>

1399
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:06,239
<i>but got acquitted
for lack of evidence.</i>

1400
01:34:06,506 --> 01:34:07,974
Please, no!

1401
01:34:08,274 --> 01:34:09,609
Don't do it!

1402
01:34:13,546 --> 01:34:16,015
<i>He's calmed down a bit,
now that he's older.</i>

1403
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:17,984
<i>Apparently due to his wife
and daughter.</i>

1404
01:34:18,017 --> 01:34:20,487
<i>He's supposed to be
a loving dad.</i>

1405
01:34:24,724 --> 01:34:26,693
What does he say to all this?
Has he been questioned?

1406
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:27,694
<i>No, he's still
being looked for.</i>

1407
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:30,530
<i>His daughter, too.
Gone without a trace.</i>

1408
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,969
Does this Schwintowski guy
have a sailboat by any chance?

1409
01:34:36,002 --> 01:34:37,103
Yeah!

1410
01:34:37,137 --> 01:34:40,173
He's a real sailing aficionado,
does all sorts of races.

1411
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:41,474
How did you know that?

1412
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,944
Professor?
Hello?

1413
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,735
You have reached
your destination.

1414
01:35:49,108 --> 01:35:50,210
Where are we?

1415
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:51,745
No idea.

1416
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,213
Somewhere in the middle
of nowhere.

1417
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,085
Ingolf, I'd like you to remain
here for the moment.

1418
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:01,554
Be right back.
I wanna take a look around.

1419
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:05,124
Are you sure you want to
go out there by yourself?

1420
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:08,528
Give me ten minutes, and if
I haven't returned by then,

1421
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:10,263
call the police, okay?

1422
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:43,696
Ingolf? I told you you're
supposed to stay in the car!

1423
01:36:50,236 --> 01:36:51,638
Shit!

1424
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,368
Why are your feet so big?

1425
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:15,388
Is this what your
looking for?!

1426
01:38:16,389 --> 01:38:18,358
Does it turn you on?!

1427
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:07,908
<i>Hannah...</i>

1428
01:39:33,633 --> 01:39:36,737
- Huh...
- Jens, where is Hannah?

1429
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:38,271
Tell me, is she alive?

1430
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,475
Jens, please.

1431
01:39:42,508 --> 01:39:44,978
Tell me that Hannah
is still alive, please.

1432
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:52,719
Ah! How did you manage
to keep everyone outside?

1433
01:39:53,319 --> 01:39:55,254
I thought you were
out of the loop.

1434
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:57,590
That you weren't part
of any investigations.

1435
01:39:57,623 --> 01:40:00,460
- You're such a stickler for rules.
- Was that your plan?

1436
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:03,396
Doing all this fucked up shit
to teach me a lesson?

1437
01:40:09,602 --> 01:40:10,871
You lucked out
with the hurricane.

1438
01:40:10,904 --> 01:40:12,638
Otherwise you wouldn't
have made it.

1439
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,407
Your doorkeeper buddy
would've called the police

1440
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,009
a long time ago.

1441
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,312
Why all...

1442
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:21,547
Jens, I don't understand
why you're doing this.

1443
01:40:22,715 --> 01:40:24,717
Hannah was in no way
responsible for your daughter,

1444
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:26,486
and I wasn't either.

1445
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:29,288
No, you didn't murder
my Lily.

1446
01:40:29,322 --> 01:40:30,490
Not her.

1447
01:40:30,523 --> 01:40:32,492
Why are you emphasizing
it like that?

1448
01:40:33,326 --> 01:40:34,828
This is not about you,
Paul.

1449
01:40:35,394 --> 01:40:37,430
Not about your daughter,
either.

1450
01:40:40,366 --> 01:40:42,903
- Not even about my daughter.
- Then what the fuck is this?!

1451
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:45,973
- He'll explain it all.
- Who? Schwintowski?

1452
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:48,441
The man is a known
criminal, Jens!

1453
01:40:48,474 --> 01:40:51,611
What?
What are you doing?

1454
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:53,479
What did you just
put in your mouth?

1455
01:40:54,347 --> 01:40:56,016
Why... Jens...

1456
01:40:56,049 --> 01:40:58,752
How nice that
you're awake, Paul.

1457
01:41:01,387 --> 01:41:02,790
No!

1458
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:07,460
Hold on!
That's Enough!

1459
01:41:07,493 --> 01:41:08,661
Ah!

1460
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:10,663
- Get the bag with the autopsy tools.
- Did you do that?!

1461
01:41:10,696 --> 01:41:12,331
Get the bag
with the autopsy tools!

1462
01:41:12,365 --> 01:41:13,533
Marinek swallowed
a memory chip

1463
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:14,534
We have to get it out
of his insides

1464
01:41:14,567 --> 01:41:16,602
before the stomach acid
totally dissolves it!

1465
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,517
<i>Congratulations,
Professor Herzfeld.</i>

1466
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:32,886
<i>If you made it this far,</i>

1467
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:35,688
<i>then you'll have almost
completed your lesson.</i>

1468
01:41:37,623 --> 01:41:39,425
By the look of it,
you weren't doing things

1469
01:41:39,458 --> 01:41:41,661
by the book this time.

1470
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:45,464
You lied, kept your mouth shut,
suppressed evidence.

1471
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,701
<i>All the things Jens had
asked of you back then.</i>

1472
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:49,803
<i>Funny.</i>

1473
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:54,407
<i>My name is Philipp Schwintowski
and you killed my daughter.</i>

1474
01:41:55,675 --> 01:41:57,744
<i>Did you see the pictures
in the boat house?</i>

1475
01:42:00,113 --> 01:42:02,715
<i>If Jens hadn't been
trailing that bastard,</i>

1476
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:05,018
<i>I never would have found
my daughter.</i>

1477
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:08,387
<i>That whore of a judge
thought child molesters</i>

1478
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,556
<i>should be rehabilitated.</i>

1479
01:42:11,657 --> 01:42:14,660
<i>Do you believe that as well,
Professor?</i>

1480
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,466
<i>And even if you say yes,</i>

1481
01:42:20,499 --> 01:42:23,402
<i>do animals like that deserve
to be re-integrated?</i>

1482
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:25,772
<i>No, they deserve
one thing only:</i>

1483
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,674
<i>the same agony they inflicted
on their victims.</i>

1484
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,441
<i>That son-of-a-bitch hadn't
even been out of prison</i>

1485
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:05,544
<i>six weeks, when he nabbed
my daughter Rebecca.</i>

1486
01:43:05,678 --> 01:43:09,415
Mrs. Schwintowski,
I'm here about your daughter.

1487
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,786
<i>We hit all the places
where Jens had been</i>

1488
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:14,520
<i>spying on Sadler</i>

1489
01:43:14,553 --> 01:43:15,889
<i>and we found her.</i>

1490
01:43:17,623 --> 01:43:19,492
<i>But it was too late.</i>

1491
01:43:19,525 --> 01:43:21,995
<i>That fucker was still there,
though.</i>

1492
01:43:23,997 --> 01:43:26,833
<i>I wanted to torture him
to death, then and there,</i>

1493
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,602
<i>and have my people
take care of the judge.</i>

1494
01:43:29,635 --> 01:43:31,872
But then Jens
explained to me

1495
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:35,976
<i>that there are more important
things than revenge.</i>

1496
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:37,978
There's a problem
in the system:

1497
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:39,679
perpetrators are made
into victims

1498
01:43:39,712 --> 01:43:41,580
and victims become
perpetrators.

1499
01:43:41,614 --> 01:43:44,751
Courts punish tax evaders
more than child molesters!

1500
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:47,788
Psychologists that recommend
parole for rapists,

1501
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:49,790
cause they had a tough
childhood.

1502
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,793
<i>It affects everyone
in this great nation of ours.</i>

1503
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:55,762
It's about you, Professor.

1504
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:59,866
There are thousands of rules,
and regulations,

1505
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,001
<i>and laws,</i>

1506
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,469
<i>But everything's all
fucked up.</i>

1507
01:44:13,579 --> 01:44:16,116
<i>We waited till Sadler's injury
healed up enough.</i>

1508
01:44:16,549 --> 01:44:18,218
<i>Jens sewed up the stump
of his tongue</i>

1509
01:44:18,251 --> 01:44:21,021
<i>so that bastard wouldn't
bleed to death.</i>

1510
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,600
<i>First we gave him something
to look forward to,</i>

1511
01:44:35,302 --> 01:44:37,771
<i>then we let him do
the dirty work.</i>

1512
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,283
<i>Sadler and the judge
both deserved to die,</i>

1513
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:51,985
and me and Jens...

1514
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,123
We fucking lost everything.
Why go on living?

1515
01:44:56,289 --> 01:44:59,826
<i>But you should get a chance
to save your daughter.</i>

1516
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:02,863
<i>Jens said,
you're a good guy.</i>

1517
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:05,298
<i>But even good guys
make mistakes</i>

1518
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:07,200
<i>and they gotta
be accountable.</i>

1519
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:10,669
We left Hannah
alone with Sadler.

1520
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:12,739
If you want to find her

1521
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:15,608
follow the white light
of Alcatraz.

1522
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:17,778
What the hell's that?

1523
01:45:18,611 --> 01:45:20,646
Does he mean San Francisco?

1524
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:24,184
Alcatraz is an island.
Heligoland.

1525
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,206
Schwintowski was bluffing.

1526
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,743
Jan Erik Sadler isn't able
to harm your daughter,

1527
01:45:49,776 --> 01:45:51,278
because he's dead
in the mor...

1528
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:53,013
Yeah, but that's not it.

1529
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:58,085
"We left Hannah alone
with Sadler," he said...

1530
01:45:59,386 --> 01:46:01,088
Past tense.

1531
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:04,324
It's enough, if they leave
Hannah for a while alone

1532
01:46:04,357 --> 01:46:06,059
with Sadler, that's...

1533
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:08,195
He explains in gruesome detail
what he's gonna do

1534
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:10,831
and then gives 'em
a fucking noose.

1535
01:46:13,266 --> 01:46:15,836
Schwintowski hanged himself.
That's the last clue.

1536
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:17,104
If I don't get Hannah
fast enough,

1537
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:20,273
she'll be hanging there
just like that.

1538
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:22,708
Okay, I got it.

1539
01:46:22,742 --> 01:46:24,211
Schwintowski'd never've
killed himself

1540
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:26,079
without taking revenge on
Sadler to kill them.

1541
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:28,014
No way.
He didn't try and hide it,

1542
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:29,216
which is why we were
able to find Erik.

1543
01:46:29,249 --> 01:46:31,985
- What about the time code?
- What you mean? What about it?

1544
01:46:32,018 --> 01:46:35,856
The date's from the day
before yesterday.

1545
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:37,491
There must be a mistake.

1546
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:38,992
Put in the wrong date
or whatever

1547
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:40,260
Why is that?

1548
01:46:40,293 --> 01:46:41,895
Because tonight on
the island of Heligoland

1549
01:46:41,928 --> 01:46:43,296
someone stabbed
my friend Ender

1550
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,031
with a fucking knife
in his goddamn throat

1551
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:47,901
and since Sadler is dead
it has to be Schwintowski!

1552
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:56,009
Let's get moving!

1553
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,241
There's a calm
in the storm.

1554
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,442
If it's like this over
the water as well,

1555
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:33,813
then it might be possible
for a rescue helicopter to fly.

1556
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:35,415
We can let the
authorities know.

1557
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:37,250
Everyone involved
is dead now.

1558
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:39,319
Hopefully we can make it
before the weather ch...

1559
01:47:39,352 --> 01:47:40,387
Fuck!

1560
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,422
Jens slashed the tires.

1561
01:47:43,156 --> 01:47:45,025
Crap!
What should we do?

1562
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,996
- You have spare tires?
- Yes, but just one.

1563
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:52,098
That's not gonna work
in this kind of terrain.

1564
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:53,767
We'll never get there
in time.

1565
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,168
You still have the key?

1566
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:57,103
Never left
my pant's pocket.

1567
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:04,311
Get in the car.

1568
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,014
<i>Err, Professor Herzfeld,</i>

1569
01:48:08,048 --> 01:48:10,283
<i>you're driving deeper
into the forest.</i>

1570
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:12,986
<i>Exactly.
Are you wearing your seatbelt?</i>

1571
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:18,225
We're not gonna
get far like this.

1572
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:19,426
We're not going far.

1573
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:21,795
No emergency vehicle
will get here and save us.

1574
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:23,230
You're aware of that,
right?

1575
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:24,831
Why don't you take
this opportunity

1576
01:48:24,864 --> 01:48:27,000
and tell me why you wanted
to get to know me.

1577
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,935
This could be your last chance
to do that.

1578
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:31,838
Why's that?
You planning on killing us?

1579
01:48:31,871 --> 01:48:32,405
Bit like that.

1580
01:48:34,874 --> 01:48:35,976
Start talking!

1581
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:37,877
My 14 million's in the
meantime a lot more than that.

1582
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:39,145
Get it?
A whole lot more.

1583
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:41,481
And with all that money
you've, you've...

1584
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:46,953
You've responsibility
and shit!

1585
01:48:46,987 --> 01:48:48,922
I started an endowment
that's there to support

1586
01:48:48,955 --> 01:48:50,490
forensic medicine
around the whole world.

1587
01:48:50,523 --> 01:48:51,992
Mass graves,
shit like that.

1588
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:54,194
And I wanted a director.

1589
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:56,429
All I wanted was a director!

1590
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,865
I'll think about it.

1591
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:01,434
Ahhhh!

1592
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:13,213
Don't worry, okay?

1593
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:16,816
The two hours
aren't over yet.

1594
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,288
And he made us a promise.

1595
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:34,567
Another fifteen minutes then...

1596
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:38,038
then I'll go by myself, okay?

1597
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:43,310
Who is that?!

1598
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:48,381
What do you want from me?!

1599
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:53,420
Ugh!
What do you want from me?!

1600
01:49:54,454 --> 01:49:56,222
What the fuck
do you want from me?!

1601
01:49:56,656 --> 01:49:59,592
Danny?!
You're freakin' me out, Danny!

1602
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,129
Stop!

1603
01:50:05,632 --> 01:50:07,400
Please stop!

1604
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:28,021
I'm mot Dammy.

1605
01:50:31,624 --> 01:50:34,861
Err, okay.
What was that about?

1606
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:37,997
You smashed my car
on purpose.

1607
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:40,133
It was your idea.

1608
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:43,903
- How?
- Geo-coordinates.

1609
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:45,372
As I was skimming through
the owner's manual

1610
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:47,006
I saw something worth noting.

1611
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,641
There's an in-car
emergency call system

1612
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:52,078
- that sends the coordinates, when the airbags go off.
- Are you being serious?

1613
01:50:52,112 --> 01:50:53,980
And then assuming
it all works,

1614
01:50:54,013 --> 01:50:56,082
you shouldn't have to wait
more than 10 minutes

1615
01:50:56,116 --> 01:50:58,151
in all of Germany
until emergency services

1616
01:50:58,184 --> 01:50:59,652
are sent to the accident.

1617
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:01,488
Premium class!

1618
01:51:03,256 --> 01:51:05,592
In other words, our fate is in
the hands of a car salesman?

1619
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:08,228
Manufacturer.
Manufacturer.

1620
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,596
We're gonna freeze to death.

1621
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:11,431
Emergency vehicles
won't make it here!

1622
01:51:11,464 --> 01:51:13,133
Exactly.

1623
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:20,273
Seven minutes.

1624
01:51:29,048 --> 01:51:30,950
W'ere iff it?

1625
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:32,519
What?

1626
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:40,660
- Uh ghee?
- Speak clearly, you freak!

1627
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:42,228
Ah!

1628
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:56,709
Uh ghee!

1629
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:05,318
Uh ghee!!

1630
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:12,158
Why 'in't ou 'ell me?!!

1631
01:52:14,594 --> 01:52:16,129
Ah!

1632
01:52:20,633 --> 01:52:22,168
Ugh!

1633
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,010
You mae a bid midake.

1634
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:37,550
You know what?
Fuck you, Danny!

1635
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,153
I'm mot Dammy!!

1636
01:52:43,356 --> 01:52:45,191
Ahh!!

1637
01:52:45,826 --> 01:52:48,027
Ah!

1638
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,054
Ugh! Hmph!
Ah...

1639
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,600
Ugh!!

1640
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:57,330
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1641
01:53:57,363 --> 01:53:59,666
Please hurry, Professor.

1642
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:01,301
You made a promise to us.

1643
01:54:52,753 --> 01:54:54,120
C'mon, let's go!

1644
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:00,326
How you doin'!
I'm Paul Herzfeld.

1645
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,562
I'm running an operation
for the Federal Police.

1646
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:03,864
My colleague Mr. von Appen.

1647
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:06,165
Udo Bandrupp.
My father's the mayor here.

1648
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:07,300
How can I help?

1649
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:10,169
"Follow the light
from Alcatraz!"

1650
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:13,239
Does that sentence
mean anything to you?

1651
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:16,910
Ender? Ender?
Shit!

1652
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:19,780
Ender?

1653
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:22,448
Breathe!

1654
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,655
No! No!

1655
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:31,324
- No, no...
- <i>Linda!</i>

1656
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:33,961
No, you can go
fuck yourself!

1657
01:55:33,994 --> 01:55:36,830
- You're not gonna hurt me anymore.
- <i>Linda.</i>

1658
01:55:36,864 --> 01:55:38,631
- You're not gonna hurt me anymore!
- <i>Linda!</i>

1659
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,299
Go away!

1660
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:43,871
Go away! Go away!

1661
01:55:43,904 --> 01:55:45,538
Go away!

1662
01:55:45,906 --> 01:55:50,309
- Go away!
- Linda, it's me, Paul. Paul Herzfeld.

1663
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:53,847
- Just calm down now. The Professor, yes.
- The Professor. You made it!

1664
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:56,516
- Everything's fine. Just relax.
- Ender...

1665
01:55:56,549 --> 01:55:59,753
I was forced to pull the knife
from his shoulder

1666
01:55:59,787 --> 01:56:02,288
- when he started to attack us.
- What?

1667
01:56:02,321 --> 01:56:04,323
- Who?
- Danny. Danny.

1668
01:56:04,357 --> 01:56:05,258
Who is it that attacked you,
Linda?

1669
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:08,829
I don't know.
He wanted to have the key.

1670
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:12,265
It wasn't Danny.
It wasn't Danny...

1671
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:15,368
He can go fuck himself.

1672
01:56:17,938 --> 01:56:21,274
Ugh!
Oh my fucking God!

1673
01:56:25,411 --> 01:56:27,447
This is not Jan Sadler,
it's Schwintowski!

1674
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,681
How can that be?

1675
01:56:29,817 --> 01:56:32,552
When Schwintowski was
committing murder on Jan Sadler,

1676
01:56:33,887 --> 01:56:35,421
<i>he must have made a mistake.</i>

1677
01:56:40,828 --> 01:56:42,695
<i>He thought he was dead,</i>

1678
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:45,465
<i>and abandoned the body
somewhere</i>

1679
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:48,367
<i>where he knew it would be found.</i>

1680
01:56:48,468 --> 01:56:49,602
<i>But Sadler wasn't dead.</i>

1681
01:56:49,635 --> 01:56:51,571
<i>He came back,
removed his tongue</i>

1682
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:54,273
and prepped the body exactly
as Schwintowski did with him,

1683
01:56:54,307 --> 01:56:55,175
<i>including the "Erik" T-shirt</i>

1684
01:56:55,209 --> 01:56:57,310
<i>and the surprise egg
in the throat.</i>

1685
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:00,346
<i>It effects everyone
in this great nation of ours.</i>

1686
01:57:00,379 --> 01:57:02,381
It's about you, Professor!

1687
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:05,351
Maybe he thought it a good
idea to keep a low profile.

1688
01:57:05,384 --> 01:57:06,452
I've no idea.

1689
01:57:06,486 --> 01:57:08,588
Where is the the key.

1690
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:10,791
The key that Linda was talking
about the whole time?

1691
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:13,026
Mr. Mayor, what can you tell me
about Alcatraz?

1692
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,796
We don't really have
a prison here or nothing.

1693
01:57:15,829 --> 01:57:16,930
Might be a little far-fetched,

1694
01:57:16,964 --> 01:57:20,033
but Alcatraz has
a famous lighthouse.

1695
01:57:20,067 --> 01:57:23,003
Beacons every five seconds,
just like ours.

1696
01:57:25,605 --> 01:57:26,807
Does the lighthouse
have a basement?

1697
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:29,977
There's a system of bunkers
under the tower stretching 20km.

1698
01:57:30,010 --> 01:57:31,879
The Nazis built them
during World War II.

1699
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:33,881
We closed down the entrance
a while back

1700
01:57:33,914 --> 01:57:36,016
after two kids
got lost in there.

1701
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,785
We didn't find 'em for days.

1702
01:57:37,818 --> 01:57:38,819
They were long dead.

1703
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:05,913
Been a while since
I used the keys.

1704
01:58:05,946 --> 01:58:06,914
Is there another entrance?

1705
01:58:06,947 --> 01:58:09,750
Not one, hundreds!
It's a friggin labyrinth.

1706
01:58:09,783 --> 01:58:11,952
Some shafts end at the coast.

1707
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:13,386
We're gonna need
a hundred guys for this!

1708
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:14,021
Open the gate.

1709
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:20,459
- Hannah!
- Hannah!

1710
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:27,134
My question is,
do I cut off your clitoris?

1711
01:58:27,167 --> 01:58:29,468
Or your pussy lips?

1712
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:34,407
Fuck. Fuck!

1713
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:38,812
Whres ma reward?

1714
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,548
Whre s ma reward?!!

1715
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:43,851
- Hannah?!
- Hannah?

1716
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:46,719
Hannah?

1717
01:58:46,854 --> 01:58:47,888
Hannah?!

1718
01:58:49,722 --> 01:58:52,391
<i>Hannah! Hannah...</i>

1719
01:59:16,116 --> 01:59:17,483
No!

1720
01:59:17,516 --> 01:59:19,887
No, no, no, no, no.

1721
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:22,622
Hannah!

1722
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:24,825
Here!
There's someone here!

1723
01:59:26,193 --> 01:59:29,428
I'm no whore,
you fucking prick!

1724
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:33,532
Hannah!

1725
01:59:34,835 --> 01:59:36,502
<i>Hannah!</i>

1726
01:59:41,474 --> 01:59:44,111
<i>I'm no whore,
you fucking prick!</i>

1727
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,782
Hey, hey, hey!

1728
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:50,716
Hey!

1729
01:59:51,617 --> 01:59:54,087
Hey, sweetheart.
I'm here.

1730
01:59:54,121 --> 01:59:55,989
I'm here.

1731
01:59:56,023 --> 01:59:59,558
Everything's
gonna be fine. Shhh.

1732
01:59:59,592 --> 02:00:01,061
It's all good.

1733
02:00:01,094 --> 02:00:03,163
<i>My name is
Rebecca Schwintowski.</i>

1734
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:06,099
Your hands are cold.
We gotta warm you up.

1735
02:00:07,734 --> 02:00:09,169
Burn in hell!

1736
02:00:32,893 --> 02:00:36,063
<i>Oh my God! Oh my God!
My baby!</i>

1737
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,564
KEY

1738
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:40,968
- Hold her up!
- My Baby!

1739
02:00:41,835 --> 02:00:43,236
- Higher!
- You got her?

1740
02:00:44,972 --> 02:00:46,505
You're safe now.

1741
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:50,944
I got you.
I got you, baby.

1742
02:00:51,544 --> 02:00:53,046
<i>I got you.</i>

1743
02:00:54,982 --> 02:00:56,682
It's over now.

1744
02:01:02,289 --> 02:01:05,792
It's over. It's over.

1745
02:02:24,871 --> 02:02:26,639
<i>Professor Herzfeld?</i>

1746
02:02:27,407 --> 02:02:28,674
Linda!

1747
02:02:30,177 --> 02:02:32,045
Hey!

1748
02:02:34,915 --> 02:02:36,216
Where were you?
I was looking for you.

1749
02:02:36,249 --> 02:02:37,650
Packing my stuff.

1750
02:02:38,185 --> 02:02:40,854
- How's Ender?
- He's stable. Stable.

1751
02:02:40,887 --> 02:02:42,655
- He'll make it.
- He's amazing.

1752
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:44,191
He can really take it.

1753
02:02:44,224 --> 02:02:45,759
Yeah.

1754
02:02:46,226 --> 02:02:48,594
I am... Linda...

1755
02:02:51,731 --> 02:02:53,300
You saved my daughter
and I...

1756
02:02:54,334 --> 02:02:56,303
Oh.
What was that for?

1757
02:02:56,336 --> 02:02:57,703
- Why'd I do that?
- Yeah.

1758
02:02:57,737 --> 02:02:59,172
Where the fuck
should I even start?

1759
02:03:00,673 --> 02:03:02,641
For the record: in the comic
I'm gonna make outta all this

1760
02:03:02,675 --> 02:03:04,010
you're not gonna
look good!

1761
02:03:04,044 --> 02:03:05,846
You can't...

1762
02:03:05,946 --> 02:03:07,414
Yeah, but the comic 'll
turn into a real hit

1763
02:03:07,447 --> 02:03:09,316
I can guarantee you
and one day you'll thank me.

1764
02:03:09,349 --> 02:03:10,350
Listen up!

1765
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,085
- I should smack you another time.
- Hey...

1766
02:03:15,856 --> 02:03:18,258
- What will you do next?
- I'm gonna go home.

1767
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:21,061
There's a few things
I need to take care of.

1768
02:03:21,094 --> 02:03:22,362
- Danny?
- Pfff!

1769
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:24,197
I'll show him
not to fuck around.

1770
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:25,398
And my lawyer said...

1771
02:03:27,167 --> 02:03:30,170
...all those fucked up text
messages will probably help us.

1772
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:38,745
Thank you, Linda.

1773
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:41,815
Be seeing you.

1774
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:43,917
Be seeing you.

1775
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:49,422
Hey!

1776
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:51,758
Take care of your daughter,
yeah?

1777
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:53,293
I'm not helping you again.

1778
02:03:55,428 --> 02:03:57,164
I will.

1779
02:03:58,498 --> 02:04:00,666
I sure will.

1780
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,676
<i>Linda?</i>

1781
02:04:25,292 --> 02:04:27,727
<i>And you sure you wouldn't
prefer taking the boat?</i>

1782
02:04:27,761 --> 02:04:30,130
Nah, with this we're home
in two hours.

1783
02:04:30,163 --> 02:04:32,199
Gotta take the bodies
to Berlin anyway.

1784
02:04:32,232 --> 02:04:34,234
My father always preferred
hanging out with the dead

1785
02:04:34,267 --> 02:04:36,336
than with real living people.

1786
02:04:40,874 --> 02:04:43,777
There is a manhunt all
over the island for Jan Sadler.

1787
02:04:43,810 --> 02:04:45,979
And he can't leave
the island.

1788
02:04:46,012 --> 02:04:47,847
Oh, I know they'll get him.

1789
02:04:48,315 --> 02:04:50,050
Why don't you fly
to Berlin with us.

1790
02:04:50,083 --> 02:04:51,318
I know your car is, err...

1791
02:04:51,351 --> 02:04:53,753
There's a new one
waiting for me in Cuxhaven.

1792
02:04:53,787 --> 02:04:54,821
In something like that?

1793
02:04:54,854 --> 02:04:57,357
I wouldn't get in that
for all the tea in China.

1794
02:04:58,792 --> 02:04:59,960
Ingolf, I...

1795
02:05:02,195 --> 02:05:03,430
Thanks for everything.

1796
02:05:04,364 --> 02:05:06,299
Really, for everything.

1797
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:08,435
I'll be getting in touch.

1798
02:06:22,042 --> 02:06:24,077
Hannah,
away from the door!

1799
02:06:49,202 --> 02:06:51,271
