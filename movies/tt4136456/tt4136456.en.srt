3
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:21,916
<i>You prefer corporate
or government jobs.</i>

4
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>There's usually a complete dossier.</i>

5
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>They allow time for planning.</i>

6
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:32,301
<i>Planning because typically
they prefer low profile.</i>

7
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,470
<i>Low profile is safer.</i>

8
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>Low profile makes almost no ripple.</i>

9
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,436
<i>Low profile is unspectacular.</i>

10
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,689
<i>Time can become an issue.</i>

11
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,191
<i>You may have to hasten things along.</i>

12
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:50,111
<i>Your training lets you
slow your breathing,</i>

13
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,029
<i>lets you calm your heart.</i>

14
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,991
<i>Two pounds of pressure and...</i>

15
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,542
<i>But organized crime
likes a visible statement.</i>

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,883
<i>Let them know you were there.
Send a message written in blood.</i>

17
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,763
<i>With this employer, you rarely
get more than a name,</i>

18
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,932
<i>sometimes not even that.</i>

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,687
<i>It adds to the risk,
and it adds to the fee.</i>

20
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,689
<i>But you know there's a risk in that too.</i>

21
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,027
<i>The other risk with organized crime:</i>

22
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,195
<i>it creates enemies.</i>

23
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,448
<i>Experience has taught you
she won't call for help</i>

24
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,992
<i>until she's vacuumed up his cash</i>

25
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,077
<i>and has at least slipped on her panties.</i>

26
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,956
<i>It's vital that you show no urgency.</i>

27
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,462
<i>You trust your planning, your accuracy.</i>

28
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,258
<i>Two minutes until she calls
the front desk.</i>

29
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,346
<i>Fifteen to 30 seconds to get
the manager on duty,</i>

30
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:02,183
<i>some low-level schlump
working the graveyard shift.</i>

31
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,277
<i>He'll call either his boss
or the head of security.</i>

32
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,530
<i>Both will be home sleeping.</i>

33
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,577
<i>The phone rings once every six seconds.</i>

34
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,665
<i>Typically it will ring four times
before they're conscious enough to answer.</i>

35
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,211
<i>That's another 18 seconds.</i>

36
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,091
<i>Another minute before police
are dispatched.</i>

37
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,639
<i>In this part of the city, police should
arrive in under three minutes.</i>

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,187
<i>You're a professional...</i>

39
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,150
<i>an expert devoted to timing and precision.</i>

40
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,195
<i>A virtuoso.</i>

41
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,340
<i>You keep your tools in pristine condition.</i>

42
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,555
<i>Perfection demands precision.</i>

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>Precision demands perseverance.</i>

44
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,027
<i>You live off the grid as much as possible.</i>

45
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,655
<i>You leave no trace of your real self.</i>

46
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,034
<i>You're a shadow.</i>

47
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,510
<i>You keep your true identity protected.</i>

48
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,556
<i>You avoid the US Postal Service</i>

49
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,352
<i>and open a mailbox run by
an independent company.</i>

50
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,941
<i>No names.</i>

51
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,443
<i>No trail.</i>

52
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,921
<i>You make sure
the process to engage you</i>

53
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,131
<i>is complex enough
to preserve your anonymity.</i>

54
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,511
<i>You might miss out on some assignments.</i>

55
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,931
<i>You see it as the cost of doing business.</i>

56
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,268
<i>However, you set your fee
compensate.</i>

57
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,335
Hmm?

58
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,494
<i>You recognize the code.</i>

59
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,804
Go.

60
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,723
You're outside established protocol.

61
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,516
This is a one-off.

62
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,645
And afterwards, we'll return to procedure.

63
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,230
<i>It's a short time frame.</i>

64
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,775
- How short?
- <i>Forty-eight hours.</i>

65
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,403
Not much time to plan.

66
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,988
It's an accident.

67
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,535
Is it worth it?

68
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,413
I'm seeing double.

69
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,795
<i>Let me be clear. Crystal clear.</i>

70
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,296
For this fee...

71
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,175
it is delicate.

72
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,097
<i>Special outcome demanded by client.</i>

73
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,057
- Understood.
- <i>Good.</i>

74
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,687
I knew you would.
We go back a long way.

75
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,982
<i>Do not put me in a bad position.</i>

76
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,776
<i>Call me when it's done.</i>

77
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,236
Details?

78
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,865
You can inquire discretely today...

79
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,619
at 6:32.

80
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:12,511
<i>Six, three, two.</i>

81
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>You need to make it look
like an accident.</i>

82
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,023
<i>You don't mind
the added complexity in general.</i>

83
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,736
<i>But to do it right,
you need more time to plan.</i>

84
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,821
<i>And to add to it, no headlines.</i>

85
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,076
<i>Quiet.</i>

86
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,117
<i>A plan forms in your head.</i>

87
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,757
<i>You have to hit a two-inch moving target</i>

88
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,594
<i>on a car going 60-plus miles per hour
from 50 yards away.</i>

89
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,891
<i>And you only get one shot.</i>

90
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,148
<i>The blown tire should
pull him sharply to the right.</i>

91
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:52,694
<i>He'll overcorrect, which should cause him
to hit this very building.</i>

92
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,950
<i>It's rushed. You know that.</i>

93
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,453
<i>You wish you had more time.</i>

94
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,666
<i>But it's a plan. It'll have to do.</i>

95
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,343
<i>You know the rules.</i>

96
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,888
<i>Do not rush.</i>

97
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,436
<i>Do not hesitate.</i>

98
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,119
Hey, Mom.

99
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,624
Mom! Here, pass!

100
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,709
Okay, kick it over.

101
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,713
Nice one, Mom.

102
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,132
<i>Do not get distracted.</i>

103
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,550
Careful.

104
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,051
I got it.
Don't worry. I got it.

105
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,640
<i>Do not question.</i>

106
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,688
Look out!

107
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,151
Mom!

108
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,206
Mom! Mom!

109
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,626
- Call the police!
- Oh, my God!

110
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,419
Somebody call 911!

111
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,357
Relax.

112
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,198
It's only me.

113
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,827
Your father was a good soldier.

114
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,665
- So you've said.
- It's a fact.

115
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,084
And you too.

116
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,628
So the medals say.

117
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,297
It's a family business.

118
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,260
I figured that I might find you here
since you don't answer the phone.

119
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,514
- I needed some time.
- I understand.

120
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,600
Till now, you were perfect, on point.

121
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,437
I rushed you, I know.
Couldn't be helped.

122
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,398
It's on me, not you.

123
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,609
Yeah.

124
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,739
Collateral damage. It happens.

125
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,075
You know that.

126
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,993
This is not Amarijah.

127
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,371
I know what happened there.

128
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,707
You shouldn't let this stuff
get to you, kid.

129
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,210
I'm not.

130
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,921
It's not your fault.

131
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,676
Did your father ever tell you
about Pinkville?

132
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,596
No. Never spoke of it.

133
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,557
Ah, that's not surprising.

134
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,518
That's where we met, you know... Pinkville.
Me and your old man.

135
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,397
We were just young kids,
fresh out of boot camp.

136
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,232
One night, the officers told us,

137
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,359
"Tomorrow you'll meet the enemy,
a whole battalion of gooks,

138
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,696
Viet Cong, who killed your...

139
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,492
friends, your relatives,
who'd kill your, uh, family

140
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,120
and rape your sister if they could."

141
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,833
So, we kids, we toked it up,
and the officers, they just drank it up,

142
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,877
because, you know, they were...

143
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,296
they were preparing us, as they say.

144
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,257
So we were prepared and...

145
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,553
we woke at 3:00 a.m.,
jumped on those choppers and...

146
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,763
we took off...

147
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,892
to kill or be killed.

148
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,853
It's really simple
when you think about it.

149
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,563
Only, finally, when we got there,

150
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,774
already the intelligence was bad,
because usually it was.

151
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,236
Because there was no hostile fire.
There was no fire at all, really.

152
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,780
There were just old men,

153
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,491
women and children,

154
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,580
sitting around fires, heating their rice,
ready for breakfast.

155
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,125
So, the officers, they just
gathered up all these...

156
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,877
the old men and the women
and the children,

157
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,173
even their pigs and their dogs
and their cats and, uh...

158
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,217
pushed them into ditches.

159
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,346
And, uh, they ordered us,
me and your old man,

160
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,889
to, um, plug them.

161
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,893
So we did. Clip after clip after clip.

162
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,314
Like a couple of automats
staring at each other, just firing and...

163
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,733
So we couldn't see the target,

164
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:51,238
the blood and the... carnage.

165
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,823
Until we stopped firing.

166
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,534
And then, as bad as that was,

167
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:01,248
when it was over, we started to have lunch
right there near the ditches.

168
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,834
And, you know, maybe 10, 15 feet away
from the bodies,

169
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:09,172
from the stench and the groaning.

170
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:13,051
Anyway, suddenly we hear this noise.
It was a whine or a squeal or something.

171
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,679
Maybe it was one of their pigs.

172
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,266
So, we all go to the top of the ditch
and we look in for the first time.

173
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,268
And it's, um...

174
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,235
This ain't no pig. No, sir.

175
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,781
It's a little boy,

176
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,992
two, maybe three, tough to say.

177
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,705
But his mother must've sheltered him
with her own body.

178
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:46,584
And he was too young to know that he
should've just played dead, stupid kid.

179
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,170
So the whole squad is watching him now,

180
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,633
uh, crawling on tiny hands
and feet over dead bodies,

181
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,635
probably his whole family.

182
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,764
And then, uh, none of us is moving.

183
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,142
We're just watching.

184
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,979
Maybe just rooting for the kid.

185
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,860
Till he gets to the top and he starts
running away towards the jungle.

186
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,114
The jungle.

187
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,951
And still none of us moves.

188
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,372
And then this little guy, this officer,
this lieutenant,

189
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,917
he comes running up to us
and he's still finishing his K rations.

190
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,838
And he sees all of us
staring at the tree line,

191
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:37,552
and then he sees the kid,
maybe 30 yards away, still going.

192
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,724
And he looks at me, and he looks
at your old man, and he says, "Plug him."

193
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,768
Pointing at the kid. "Plug him.

194
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,020
Shoot him."

195
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,316
So, I look at your old man
and he looks at me, and...

196
00:19:55,278 --> 00:20:00,825
I can see clear as day
in his eyes, he can't, he's done.

197
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,245
So I look back to this lieutenant,

198
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:09,751
this heartless little motherfucking prick
of a human fucking being...

199
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,799
and he looks at me and he smiles.

200
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,179
He points at the kid, he said,
"Plug him, Goddamn it.

201
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,473
Shoot him."

202
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,935
Yeah.

203
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,692
Oh, yeah.

204
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,282
Yeah, I was a good soldier that day.

205
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,289
- How could he live with that?
- Huh?

206
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,250
How could he live with that?

207
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,211
How could you?

208
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,380
We were soldiers. It's what we do.

209
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,715
It's what we did.

210
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,177
Taking orders from our superior officers.

211
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,179
We followed them.

212
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,099
Did we regret it? Sure.

213
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:10,770
I had no guilt, because...
we were not responsible for it.

214
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,689
That's not what we trained for.

215
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,901
Yeah. But I'll tell you this...

216
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,120
We humans, we human beings,
whatever we are,

217
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,707
we're just homicidal killing machines.

218
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,961
Get it? Homicidal killing
machines, that's all.

219
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,299
And all the military training
and all that stuff,

220
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,095
oh, it's just finishing school.

221
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,973
You'd better believe it, kid.

222
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,225
Yeah.

223
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,937
God, what a beautiful day, huh?

224
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,776
Anyway, 25 years later,
I ran into this guy,

225
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,737
this guy from our squad.

226
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,618
And I could tell straightaway
by just looking at him

227
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,536
that he'd never forgotten.

228
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,372
He was all busted up inside.
Do you know what I mean?

229
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,335
I remember he looked at me
and he said to me, "You know...

230
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:21,382
some of us will walk in those jungles

231
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,595
and hear those cries
of anguish and horror...

232
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,182
for all eternity."

233
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,602
Yeah.

234
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,148
But me and your Dad,

235
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,776
we didn't.

236
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,365
And I'm grateful for that.

237
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,912
Yep.

238
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:56,376
God, I haven't talked like that
for 50 years, do you know that?

239
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,920
Yeah.

240
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,219
Next time,

241
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,889
answer your goddamn phone,
do you get me?

242
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,271
- Yeah.
- Good.

243
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,773
I'm glad.

244
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,485
So, you have a good day.

245
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,800
Yes?

246
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,609
So, what do you think?

247
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,862
You ready for this?

248
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,741
I would tell you to pass
on this one, but...

249
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,661
I can see you've already decided.

250
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,997
Arrive early, look for every advantage,

251
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,209
and don't hesitate.

252
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,047
Call me when it's done.

253
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,387
<i>You get another assignment.</i>

254
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,062
<i>Routine data. Name, employer, address.</i>

255
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,605
<i>Means it's typical.</i>

256
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,691
<i>No name, no address,</i>

257
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,818
<i>no way to confirm identity,</i>

258
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,696
<i>except a cryptic note
that says they don't know much.</i>

259
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,533
<i>Therefore your quarry
must be very special.</i>

260
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,993
<i>You leave your vehicle
in long-term parking</i>

261
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,287
<i>and rent a nondescript sedan.</i>

262
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,039
<i>Dark colors are best, then gray.</i>

263
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,543
<i>You make precise plans.</i>

264
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,295
<i>But the biggest flaw in any plan</i>

265
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,797
<i>always comes from events
you can't control.</i>

266
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,093
<i>But there's always a margin for error.</i>

267
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,349
- There's no bathroom!
- It's around the corner!

268
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,644
It's not around the corner!
No, I told you, stay in the car!

269
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,046
That's gonna be trouble.

270
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,217
You got an eye for trouble?

271
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,636
I'm lookin' at you, ain't I?

272
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,810
All right, thank you.

273
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,439
Bitch!

274
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,108
- Did you see a girl around here?
- I think she's around the corner.

275
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,614
- What are you doing?
- I wasn't... Aah!

276
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,282
Why don't you listen?

277
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,743
What do you not understand
about staying in the car?

278
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,787
I had to go! Aah!

279
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,039
You don't go. You just wait.

280
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,375
Now we're late. Get in the car.

281
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,587
Stay!

282
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,425
You got something to say?

283
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,266
No point. None of my business, is it?

284
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,936
That's right. None of your business.

285
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,524
My hero.

286
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,931
Ride?

287
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,313
Uh... I'd better not.

288
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,827
I won't ask again.

289
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,705
It'll just make things worse later.

290
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,708
Maybe it's just time to get away, hmm?

291
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,460
Just leave.

292
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:17,006
I wish, mister.
But got nowhere else to go.

293
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,928
Yeah.

294
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,130
<i>You make quick note
of the players in the game.</i>

295
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,092
<i>Lone man. Back to the wall,
view of the entrance,</i>

296
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:28,220
<i>coat still on, bulge indicating
a shoulder holster.</i>

297
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,808
<i>A couple. The guy also sitting
where he can observe the entrance.</i>

298
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,729
<i>He sits forward, tense.
Maybe pistol tucked in back.</i>

299
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,943
Small world.

300
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,362
<i>You can say that again.</i>

301
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,908
Please take a seat anywhere.

302
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,579
<i>You pick a seat that lets you
keep an eye on both men</i>

303
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,498
<i>but leaves your back vulnerable.</i>

304
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,635
Can I get you something to drink?

305
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,178
Coffee. Black.

306
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:22,817
<i>It was pricey, but you secure an illegal
app that scans the DMV database.</i>

307
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:27,905
Was I right?

308
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,366
About the girl at the gas station.

309
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,828
Uh, yes, you were right.

310
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:37,957
She'll figure it out, or she won't.
That's quite a gift you have there.

311
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,084
Sometimes it's a curse.

312
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,878
Anything else?

313
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,381
Yes.

314
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,844
Would you know an area around here
called White Rivers?

315
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,974
There's rivers and... white water rafting.

316
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,393
Does that help?

317
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,520
Thank you. Leave the pot.

318
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,406
<i>You check the results of the license
plates and look for clues.</i>

319
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,783
<i>You try to match the players to the cars.</i>

320
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,744
<i>You know the Jeep out back
belongs to the waitress,</i>

321
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,873
<i>but there are three other cars
in the parking lot.</i>

322
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:23,002
<i>The man with the gun in his jacket
probably drives the gray Ford.</i>

323
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:27,256
<i>Could be law enforcement,
or he just may be White Rivers.</i>

324
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,967
<i>The couple, the guy whose position
is second best,</i>

325
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,844
<i>probably arrived after the loner.</i>

326
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,346
<i>Can't keep his eyes off the door.</i>

327
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,265
<i>Two more vehicles in the parking lot</i>

328
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,309
<i>suggest they have not been
a couple for long,</i>

329
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,227
<i>or that they aren't a couple at all.</i>

330
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,355
<i>You classify him as an amateur,</i>

331
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,816
<i>but amateurs can still be dangerous.</i>

332
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:56,243
<i>Another player. Local law enforcement.</i>

333
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,459
Deputy Myers.

334
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,669
- How you doing?
- Oh, fine.

335
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,296
Rosie?

336
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,048
Rosie went home sick, but lucky I'm here.

337
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,674
Hmm.

338
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,594
- Pastry?
- Maybe one for the road, then.

339
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,639
What about two? One for here,
one for the road.

340
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,182
I won't tell anyone.

341
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,475
You read my mind.

342
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,936
That's what I do.

343
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,824
Would you like something
to drink with that?

344
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,035
- How about a glass of milk?
- Sure.

345
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,038
Bit of a rush, I see.

346
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,832
We'll survive.

347
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:49,838
<i>The game should begin,</i>

348
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,841
<i>but... the deputy has thrown
a wrench in the plan.</i>

349
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,652
<i>The first piece to any plan
is your escape.</i>

350
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,446
<i>You want it clean, unobserved, anonymous.</i>

351
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,658
<i>It also adds a new element.</i>

352
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,368
<i>Which one?</i>

353
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,663
<i>But the deputy's arrival
muddies your plan.</i>

354
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,624
<i>You quickly reassess.</i>

355
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,127
<i>Without the Deputy, you could
complete the assignment.</i>

356
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,838
<i>The outcome would look like
a robbery gone wrong.</i>

357
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,214
<i>But now...</i>

358
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,424
Thank you.

359
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,051
<i>Which one?</i>

360
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:41,390
<i>Something's not right.</i>

361
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,392
<i>You decide to give it some more time.</i>

362
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,353
<i>If nothing changes, you'll leave
and revise the plan.</i>

363
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,148
<i>You don't need another rush job.</i>

364
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,201
You gonna lick that clean?

365
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,704
I was thinking about it.

366
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:05,956
So...

367
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,667
Dixy.

368
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,795
Yeah, like the cup, but...

369
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,965
most people, they say "Dee."

370
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,216
What do you want me to say?

371
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,469
You don't have to say anything.

372
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:19,636
And why's that?

373
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,431
Because I can divine your thoughts.

374
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,017
- Divine?
- Try me.

375
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,979
<i>White Rivers.</i>

376
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,940
I know what you want.

377
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,818
And what's that?

378
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,237
Maybe something to eat instead.

379
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,783
Actually...

380
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,579
is there another motel other than the one
I saw on my way into town?

381
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,247
No, that's the only one.

382
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:50,209
There's a couple of B&Bs,
but they're closed.

383
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,377
Too early in the season.

384
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,712
Well, how late are you open?

385
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,509
Usually shut at 9:00,
but if it's slow, we shut at 8:00.

386
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:01,845
Maybe I'll stop in later
for a little something.

387
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:07,309
Okay. If the lights are out,
just... tap on the door.

388
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,103
I'll open it for you.

389
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,555
<i>You wait for the players
to come out.</i>

390
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:29,766
<i>The couple.</i>

391
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,687
<i>Both the car and the house
are in the woman's name.</i>

392
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,690
<i>You figure that either, one,
they're a long term couple</i>

393
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,692
<i>and have put everything
under her name,</i>

394
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:43,155
<i>or two, the guy may have
recently entered her life.</i>

395
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,033
<i>If two is true, it's a good cover.</i>

396
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>The lone man with the gun in his jacket...</i>

397
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,470
<i>he's the most likely target.</i>

398
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:11,517
<i>Wouldn't be going out on a limb to guess
the loner is heading to the motel.</i>

399
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,320
<i>Probably first burned well before noon.</i>

400
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,572
<i>Now it's completely charred.</i>

401
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,491
<i>I can make some fresh for you,
if you want.</i>

402
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,493
Not necessary.

403
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,246
Sorry if I kept you waiting,

404
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,207
I was studying.
I didn't even hear you come in.

405
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,002
There's a college in this area?

406
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,337
Uh, no.

407
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,506
Oh, I'm studying to get my GED.

408
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,259
Oh. Well, it's never too late, huh?

409
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,386
Yeah. That's what my grandpa always says.

410
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,013
Well, before he died.

411
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,476
Um, you need a room, or...

412
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,728
Can't get anything past you, can I?

413
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,814
Something quiet.
How about the room at the end?

414
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,067
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's empty.

415
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,110
But there's a guest
in the room right next door.

416
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:31,073
Let me see if I have something
with empties on both sides.

417
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,575
Is the room next to the one at the end

418
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,328
occupied by a couple
who plan to go at it all night?

419
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:40,624
No. No, it's just some old guy.

420
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,376
Then the room at the end will do.

421
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,295
Okay.

422
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:48,382
I just need a credit card and license.

423
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,591
Yeah.

424
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,765
Thank you.

425
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,523
Do you give a discount
to government employees?

426
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,986
Um, yeah, I don't... I don't think so.

427
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,571
Um, no one's ever...

428
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,867
I could call the manager
at home and find out.

429
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,828
No, don't bother.

430
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:21,415
Are you sure you don't want me
to make a fresh pot?

431
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,501
I just gotta go in the back
and get a new, um...

432
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,086
If it isn't too much trouble.

433
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,840
No, not at all. Not at all.

434
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,484
Yeah, I just, um...

435
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:54,901
<i>Viagra.</i>

436
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,821
<i>And nitroglycerin.</i>

437
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:01,908
<i>The combination causes
blood pressure to drop and can be fatal.</i>

438
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:06,288
<i>Add some sumatriptan, which results
in chest pain that mimics a heart attack.</i>

439
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,208
<i>The threat of death from torture
or a bullet</i>

440
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:14,379
<i>is not nearly as effective as actually
feeling death is imminent.</i>

441
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,983
I wouldn't.

442
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,986
You want to finish that?

443
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,081
What do you want?

444
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,708
Why are you packing?

445
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,420
- I'm a federal marshal.
- Hmm.

446
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:40,632
Pretty chintzy room discount
for government employees, don't you think?

447
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,134
Are you a fed?

448
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,594
No.

449
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:46,429
And neither are you.

450
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,640
But nice try. I've used that line myself.

451
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,725
I had to try.

452
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,983
So, what do you want?

453
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,734
White Rivers.

454
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,903
What?

455
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,114
White Rivers.

456
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,657
I don't know what you're asking.

457
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,301
"Warning:

458
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,431
Do not use with prescribed
heart medication."

459
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:34,060
Well, unfortunately you just chugged it
down with two different heart drugs.

460
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:36,479
- You don't understand.
- You're having a heart attack.

461
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:39,315
- Call 911.
- I would, but out here in the wastelands,

462
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:40,900
who knows how long it would take.

463
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,485
For God's sake, just call them.

464
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,821
- White Rivers.
- Please!

465
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,740
White Rivers.

466
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:49,409
I don't... I don't...

467
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,706
The heart beats two and a half billion
times during the average lifetime,

468
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,459
but there's only one beat
that really matters.

469
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,586
The next one.

470
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,099
<i>You were careful.</i>

471
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,730
<i>You studied weight-based dosing.</i>

472
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,987
<i>The amount you administered should have
just mimicked a heart attack,</i>

473
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,448
<i>giving you ample time to get
the information you needed</i>

474
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,366
<i>for confirmation of kill.</i>

475
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:41,377
<i>Just his luck. He had a heart condition.</i>

476
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,631
<i>He was already on borrowed time.</i>

477
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,531
<i>You search for clues on White Rivers.</i>

478
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,357
<i>If the authorities find
multiple identities on this guy,</i>

479
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,736
<i>that could get them delving more deeply
into his background</i> and <i>death.</i>

480
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,493
<i>You need to have them think
he's just some schmuck</i>

481
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,996
<i>whose weakened heart finally seized.</i>

482
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:14,345
Oh, hey, you're back.
Uh, is everything okay?

483
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,765
Yeah, I found this
on the ground near my room.

484
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,644
Thought the guy in the room next to mine
might've dropped it. Jonathan Ford?

485
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:24,022
Uh, yeah, sounds familiar.

486
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,609
Uh, let me just double-check here.

487
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,612
Yep, that's him.

488
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:34,574
You know what? I'll just give it back
to him on my way back.

489
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,701
But not until I get that cup of joe, huh?

490
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,954
Oh. Uh, thanks, mister.

491
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:45,001
Uh, I'll get that...
Yeah, I'll just get that for you.

492
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:48,630
<i>Jonathan Ford.</i>

493
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,174
<i>Dead.</i>

494
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,926
<i>Of natural causes.</i>

495
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,430
<i>But he's not White Rivers.</i>

496
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,766
<i>You need to look into the couple.</i>

497
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,813
<i>Threat.</i>

498
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,732
<i>Kill.</i>

499
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,442
<i>Everything else.</i>

500
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,987
<i>The woman lives in a farmhouse
a few miles away.</i>

501
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,532
<i>The best time to visit is
between midnight and 4:00 a.m.</i>

502
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,912
<i>You have a hard rule:
eat when you can.</i>

503
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,873
<i>You never know when the chance
will come up again.</i>

504
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:57,240
Ha. Good timing.
I was just about to turn off the stove.

505
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,409
Sure this isn't any trouble?

506
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,035
A man's gotta eat.

507
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,454
Got any specials?

508
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:06,791
Everything around here is special.

509
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,588
Just as long as you order
burgers and fries.

510
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,133
Cheeseburger.

511
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,802
Are you gonna be hard to please?

512
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,305
If that's what you want.

513
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,391
Oh, so it's about what I want.

514
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,976
Isn't it always?

515
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,354
Mostly. I'll just be a few minutes.

516
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,372
Need any company?

517
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,251
Uh, sure, just give me a few seconds.

518
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:02,180
Do you mind if I join you?

519
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,683
I'd prefer it if you do.

520
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,313
Want yours toasted?

521
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,441
Sure.

522
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,282
You ever work in a kitchen?

523
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:24,660
Not as an employee.

524
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:26,913
"Not as an employee."

525
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:29,749
What does that even mean?

526
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,252
Have you worked in many kitchens?

527
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:37,882
Ah, you know, girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

528
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,927
Sometimes we all do.

529
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,389
Yeah, I guess.

530
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:52,105
Um, are these gonna be okay? It just saves
me a lot of time cleaning up.

531
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,148
Sure.

532
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,651
You want the works?

533
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,737
Hold the onions.

534
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,118
Oh. An optimist.

535
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,915
What about beer?
There's a couple in the fridge.

536
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,041
Sure.

537
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,474
I'm conflicted.

538
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,269
Conflicted?

539
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,774
Yeah, there's, um...
there's a part of me

540
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,902
that wants to ask you
all the usual questions.

541
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:44,782
What's your name?
Where are you from? What do you do?

542
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,494
Are you just passing through?

543
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:49,662
However?

544
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:55,668
However, you'll be gone in the morning
and I'll never see you again.

545
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,922
So I can either be left
with the memory

546
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:03,426
of having dinner with a man
that I got to know.

547
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,760
Or, uh...

548
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,012
Or?

549
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,891
Or I can be left with a fantasy.

550
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:13,644
A fantasy that I can shape and change...

551
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,771
however I want.

552
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,815
So?

553
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,113
I think I'm gonna leave
those questions unasked.

554
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,789
Can we talk about you?

555
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,961
What is it you want?

556
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:41,088
You mean now?

557
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:45,343
Like in the next few hours,
or next few years?

558
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:48,179
Whichever one you're clear about.

559
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,305
Now.

560
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,141
I want to finish my burger,

561
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,102
and then I want to spend the night
in a warm embrace,

562
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:59,398
the kind that you only get
after great sex.

563
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,197
In the next few years, then.

564
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:14,539
Um, over the next few years, I, uh...

565
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,583
I want to... triumph.

566
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,128
- Over what?
- What do you got?

567
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,674
What about you?

568
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:29,303
You got any dreams, solitary man?

569
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:35,101
<i>Mom! Look out!</i>

570
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,313
You all right there, partner?

571
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,067
No.

572
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,279
No dreams.

573
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:53,536
Um, before, when you were asking me
about White Rivers...

574
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,539
What is that?

575
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:01,252
I'm not sure. Just wanted
to know what it was.

576
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:05,172
Well, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

577
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:10,011
I know what it's like to want something.

578
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,139
Okay.

579
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,767
I have some things to do. Thank you.

580
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,779
I'm staying at the motel.

581
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,075
You mean the only one in town?

582
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,153
One minute.

583
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,043
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

584
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:52,798
That's some strange foreplay
you got going on there.

585
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,426
What do you want?

586
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,221
I thought that was obvious.

587
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,773
Hey.

588
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,399
Who sent you?

589
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,277
Okay, this is getting weird now.

590
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,531
Wow.

591
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,578
I guess I misread
the signals back there.

592
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,083
My bag?

593
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,343
Tell me...

594
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:40,554
about White Rivers.

595
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,724
Again with this White Rivers.

596
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,187
Just my luck.

597
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,648
The first time I meet
an interesting man in a while,

598
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,691
and look what happens.

599
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,778
No weapons.

600
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,657
What was your plan?

601
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:05,788
Can we just agree that this is a mistake
and just let me go?

602
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,124
I promise I won't call the cops.

603
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,127
- Why didn't you know the deputy?
- What?

604
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,171
Back at the diner, the deputy,
you didn't know him.

605
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,006
How is that possible in this town?

606
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,634
Rosie, she's my aunt, she's the owner.

607
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,804
She's not well. It's...

608
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,931
It's cancer, if you really must know.

609
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:28,477
So I thought I'd come up here
to this godforsaken town

610
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:31,063
to help out, do a good deed.
Look what get.

611
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:35,484
Besides, something was off
about the deputy anyways.

612
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:38,153
What do you mean?

613
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,614
I'm not sure.

614
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,992
Just a feeling.

615
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:48,497
His badge didn't look real.
Isn't it supposed to have numbers on it?

616
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,304
Uh...

617
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:07,349
I'm not going to hurt you.

618
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:12,730
I had to be sure.

619
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:15,858
Okay.

620
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,320
Whatever you say.

621
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,658
Why don't I just...

622
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:28,329
Why don't I just leave
and we'll forget the whole thing?

623
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,166
Hmm.

624
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,292
Mm-hmm.

625
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,628
Thank you.

626
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,190
Well, that was something.

627
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,820
Fuck me.

628
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,534
Okay. Now I'll probably get killed
in a car accident

629
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,662
trying to find my aunt's house.
This is great.

630
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,873
Wait.

631
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,793
What now?

632
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,252
Come back inside.

633
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,756
I don't think so.

634
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,841
Had my fair share
of excitement for the night.

635
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,969
I'm just gonna take my chances.

636
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:28,931
Just... Just until the snow stops.

637
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,391
Please.

638
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:33,894
Okay.

639
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,523
No funny stuff.

640
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:47,277
<i>Your first concern
on a night assault is dogs.</i>

641
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:51,281
<i>The fact that it's been quiet
so far can be misleading.</i>

642
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,994
<i>On nights like this, only the most cruel
of owners leave their dogs out.</i>

643
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:18,183
<i>Experience has taught you
that homes this remote are often unlocked.</i>

644
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:22,062
<i>It's possible the front door
may be locked.</i>

645
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,356
<i>But unlikely all of them are.</i>

646
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,286
<i>Most owners feed their dogs
in the kitchen.</i>

647
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,038
<i>You search for a water dish.</i>

648
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:25,334
<i>You know things don't
always go as planned.</i>

649
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,462
<i>Best to minimize access
to potential weapons.</i>

650
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:33,050
<i>If things go awry, you gain a few seconds
while your quarry is confused.</i>

651
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:53,458
<i>Collateral damage.
It happens.</i>

652
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,837
<i>You know that.</i>

653
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,655
Do not... rush.

654
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:12,412
Do not... hesitate.

655
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,124
Do not get distracted.

656
01:12:21,213 --> 01:12:22,923
Do not question.

657
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,236
<i>This is interesting.</i>

658
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,116
<i>No White Rivers.</i>

659
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,130
<i>You've been taught that,
in this situation,</i>

660
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:48,174
<i>it's best to appear
like a burglary gone bad.</i>

661
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:50,135
<i>You take cash, credit cards,</i>

662
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:53,221
<i>even a few things of minimal value,
and ransack the place.</i>

663
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,172
<i>If this is the real Deputy Myers,</i>

664
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:16,883
<i>then who's in the house?</i>

665
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,727
<i>You can't risk starting the car.</i>

666
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,646
<i>Plumes from the tailpipe will act just
like a smoke-filled beacon.</i>

667
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,816
<i>No bars.</i>

668
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,485
<i>You hope the same is true
for the impostor.</i>

669
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:02,280
<i>You hope that he leaves
the scene quickly.</i>

670
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,742
<i>But if he doesn't leave soon,
you're going to have to risk it.</i>

671
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,841
Got a bit of a problem here.

672
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:08,096
Yeah, I can see that.
Uh, did you call for help?

673
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:12,141
Well, my radio, I think it went out
when I went off the road.

674
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,227
Tried my cell. No signal.

675
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,770
Huh.

676
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,440
Just my cell.

677
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:22,694
Uh, yeah. Me, too. No signal.

678
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,404
Where you coming from?

679
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,864
East.

680
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:33,287
You know anything about a, um, burglary
few miles back?

681
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:35,415
Burglary? Can't say that I do.

682
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:39,836
You see, I got a 911 call,
which by itself is unusual in this town.

683
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,672
It's the home of a local woman.

684
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:46,009
Even more unusual, at the scene,

685
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:48,720
there's a man shot dead
in one of the bedrooms.

686
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,975
And it looks like the woman
was there, possibly wounded.

687
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,185
But there's no sign of her now.

688
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,814
I saw you at the diner.

689
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,818
Wow, you are extremely observant.

690
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:07,363
Well, I go to Rosie's earlier.

691
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:10,533
There's nothing but friendly faces.

692
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,619
And this time, it's all different.

693
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:18,833
It's unusual to see, uh, so many
unfamiliar faces in these parts.

694
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:24,547
So you go to Rosie's
for dinner every night at 5:00?

695
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:29,260
You gonna make some kind
of smart remark about that, too?

696
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,096
Sorry. Can I ask you a question?

697
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:37,143
White Rivers... are you familiar with it?

698
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:40,772
White Rivers? Yeah.

699
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:42,106
I know it.

700
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,858
I just had to be certain.

701
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:10,843
White Rivers!

702
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:36,702
I've been racking my brain.

703
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,961
What does it mean?

704
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:51,968
<i>You calm your heart,
quiet your breath.</i>

705
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,803
<i>You take in every sound.</i>

706
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:50,776
<i>You've completed your mission.</i>

707
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:53,863
<i>Not a complete success,
due to the collateral damage,</i>

708
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:56,908
<i>but in the long run,
it makes no difference.</i>

709
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:59,577
<i>Seven billion people on the planet,</i>

710
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,871
<i>and even with medical advances,
the odds are,</i>

711
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,916
<i>in only 130 years,
maybe less,</i>

712
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,628
<i>every single person
currently alive will be dead.</i>

713
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:11,547
<i>Seven billion.</i>

714
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:14,967
<i>Your work doesn't even equate
to a rounding error.</i>

715
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:23,184
<i>You don't even understand why you care.</i>

716
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:26,479
<i>But you do hope they make it
to the woman in time.</i>

717
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:12,984
You all right?

718
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:15,861
Yeah.

719
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:18,698
Guess so.

720
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:23,494
Just finished.

721
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,122
So everything went okay?

722
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:29,750
It's good to hear from you.

723
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,127
Thanks.

724
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,840
There was one slight hitch.

725
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,635
Another civilian.

726
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:43,139
<i>Not like the last one.</i>

727
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,641
So everything was cleaned up?

728
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,979
You'd better get back here
as quick as you can.

729
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,230
<i>I will.</i>

730
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:55,026
Just need some rest.

731
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,488
And one last loose end.

732
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:02,742
Loose end?

733
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,494
Something personal.

734
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:08,456
Oh, yeah?

735
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,377
Something on your mind?

736
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:17,548
It's just, uh...

737
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:26,474
I keep seeing them burning.

738
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,852
Yeah, I know.

739
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:32,772
Sorry, kid.

740
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,527
Get back as soon as you can.

741
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,655
I'll be waiting.

742
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,596
Did you go out?

743
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,726
- Just, uh, checked the roads.
- For me? Heh.

744
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,395
That's so sweet.

745
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:44,069
I can't believe I... I actually slept.

746
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:46,614
Considering.

747
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:54,663
I mean, you could've done all kinds of
unspeakable things to me, but you didn't.

748
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,667
Maybe you're not a bad guy after all.

749
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:05,758
What do you say, cowboy?

750
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:11,138
Life's short.

751
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:42,896
You check out today?

752
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:47,484
Most likely.

753
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:52,406
I can't wait to get out of this town.

754
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:54,908
It's that bad?

755
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:59,455
Why? You planning on moving here?

756
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,291
Thought not.

757
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,087
Where would you go?

758
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:10,674
Anywhere.

759
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,469
Anywhere?

760
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:14,553
I don't know.

761
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:18,891
Florida, maybe.

762
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:22,519
You ask anywhere...

763
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:27,733
and then you pick Florida?

764
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,865
Okay, Italy.

765
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:37,618
Southern Italy.

766
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,454
It snows in Rome.

767
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:41,372
Hmm.

768
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,000
It must be beautiful when it does.

769
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,087
Do you speak Italian?

770
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,380
I, um...

771
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:52,758
I studied Spanish in school.

772
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,427
It's kind of the same thing, right?

773
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,390
More or less.

774
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:05,729
There are...

775
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,233
some good things here.

776
01:32:11,485 --> 01:32:12,945
Name one.

777
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,426
I'm just gonna go freshen up, okay?

778
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:29,313
<i>White Rivers.</i>

779
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:32,566
Small world. Please sit wherever you want.

780
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,403
- Dixy.
- Yeah, like the cup.

781
01:33:36,487 --> 01:33:38,405
<i>Most people, they see "Dee."</i>

782
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:41,158
<i>Rosie, she's my aunt.
She's the owner.</i>

783
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,076
<i>She's not well. It's cancer,
if you really must know.</i>

784
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,912
- <i>Why didn't you know the deputy?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

785
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:46,872
<i>Back at the diner, the deputy,
you didn't know him.</i>

786
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,624
<i>How is that possible in this town?</i>

787
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,751
Deputy Myers.

788
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:07,976
- Fake.
- Mostly.

789
01:34:09,019 --> 01:34:09,978
Yours?

790
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:12,314
Mostly.

791
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:14,691
Did you kill them all?

792
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:21,573
Yes.

793
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:23,325
Go on.

794
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:27,037
The coroner's report
will show a heart attack.

795
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:30,415
- Nitro and...
- Viagra.

796
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:33,669
Ah. That's always a fun combination.

797
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:36,880
The others?

798
01:34:36,964 --> 01:34:38,549
Burglary gone bad.

799
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:44,054
It'll look like the deputy pulled over
the bad guys leaving the scene.

800
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:52,729
And each one of them...
gunning for you.

801
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:57,234
Not for me.

802
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:00,779
I got there early.

803
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,575
Watched you all saunter in.

804
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:07,035
That was my plan.

805
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,663
Except I stopped to...

806
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:11,206
Ride?

807
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:20,132
It goes that way sometimes.

808
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,926
I had to kill the cook.

809
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:30,434
And Aunt Rosie.

810
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,818
I didn't know there was a cook.

811
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:41,737
Well, he's in the basement now.

812
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,449
Which one showed up first?

813
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:47,367
First was an innocent.

814
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:52,956
<i>Local girl, she'd just finished work.</i>

815
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,666
<i>Came in for a bite.</i>

816
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,710
I thought they might've been a couple.

817
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,378
Ah, no.

818
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:01,673
<i>Handsome Johnnie came strolling on in,</i>

819
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:04,134
<i>instantly started wooing the girl.</i>

820
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:09,890
Now, what is a beautiful woman like you
doing eating alone?

821
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,099
Coming from this town,

822
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:14,853
I think she... thought her prayers
had been answered.

823
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:18,440
It's just her bad luck.

824
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:20,442
The loner?

825
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:23,487
<i>Came in right after the gigolo.</i>

826
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:28,909
<i>Sat, waited for you.</i>

827
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:31,912
For me?

828
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:34,790
Now you're just catching on.

829
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:38,835
<i>I can tell you
I wasn't thrilled to see him there.</i>

830
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:48,345
What about the deputy?

831
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:51,765
<i>I wasn't sure at first.</i>

832
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:55,852
<i>Then I was.</i>

833
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,448
I wouldn't go over there now.

834
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:10,742
That guy on the end, I think he has a gun.

835
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:13,161
Keeps asking about a White Rivers.

836
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:16,581
I ain't never seen him around here before.

837
01:37:16,665 --> 01:37:18,750
You're getting too old
for this kind of work.

838
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:22,087
Finish your coffee and leave him to me.

839
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:26,425
Have a nice big tip for you.

840
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:28,885
I'll bet you do.

841
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,726
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
01:37:55,996 --> 01:37:57,998
I never saw you coming.

843
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:01,626
You see what you want to see.

844
01:38:04,838 --> 01:38:06,673
Look inside the passport.

845
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:26,943
<i>You read your own name.</i>

846
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:32,032
Contact me when it's done.

847
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:53,512
And here I was thinking
that I screwed up.

848
01:38:56,723 --> 01:38:58,850
Had to eliminate them all
just to be sure.

849
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,103
No.

850
01:39:02,104 --> 01:39:03,396
You were right.

851
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:06,817
Except...

852
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,276
About you.

853
01:39:11,822 --> 01:39:13,073
What about...

854
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,370
What about just now?

855
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:21,248
The old man cares about you.

856
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,168
Something on your mind?

857
01:39:26,253 --> 01:39:29,047
I keep seeing them burning.

858
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:31,424
Yeah, I know.

859
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,219
I'm sorry, kid.

860
01:39:35,262 --> 01:39:38,765
- White Rivers?
- He never lied to you.

861
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:42,602
He wanted you to be content.

862
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,772
Happy, almost.

863
01:39:47,691 --> 01:39:48,733
How?

864
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:52,070
Well, that was my choice.

865
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:02,414
Are you happy?

866
01:40:05,542 --> 01:40:06,793
It's just...

867
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:10,672
at my cabin.

868
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:15,719
Just...

869
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:19,931
check the trunk of my car, all right?

870
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:37,532
The choice is yours.

871
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:47,584
I know.

872
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:23,286
<i>It's done.</i>

873
01:41:58,405 --> 01:42:00,156
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

874
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,238
<i>You've really come
to hate mob jobs.</i>

875
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:42,157
<i>They're just too messy.</i>

876
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,660
<i>And sometimes the other side
takes it personally.</i>

877
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:49,706
<i>You decide from now on, you'll only take
corporate or government work.</i>

878
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:53,084
<i>The Intel is better.
It's thorough, it's complete.</i>

879
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:57,464
<i>Allows time for planning, time to mitigate
problems, prepare contingencies.</i>

880
01:42:57,547 --> 01:43:00,717
<i>And a job is just a job.</i>

881
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,386
<i>But rules are important
and need to be followed.</i>

882
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:09,351
<i>And a promise needs to be kept.</i>

883
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:19,069
<i>After all, you're an ace, an expert.</i>

884
01:43:19,152 --> 01:43:20,653
<i>A professional.</i>

885
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:24,574
<i>Some might even say... a virtuoso.</i>

886
01:44:37,785 --> 01:44:42,785
