00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,206
Thanks, Aunt Poppy.

163
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,309
And thanks to this
silver-haired daddy of mine

164
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,010
for bringing me
into this world.

165
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,512
Oh.

166
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,481
I never knew my heart
could be so full.

167
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,283
Peace and love.
Bless up.

168
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,050
Tiny and Daddy out.

169
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,188
Oh. Okay, bye.

170
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,222
Hey, uh, Poppy,

171
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,925
there's something
I was hoping to ask you.

172
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,260
I-I mean,
I guess it's something

173
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:58,230
I want to tell you, more so.

174
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,498
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, but listen.

175
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,000
You could feel free
to respond to it,

176
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,437
uh, with an answer,
i-if you wanted.

177
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,004
Sure. What's up?

178
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:10,509
Uh, what's up is I, uh,

179
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,245
I-I-I-I-I-I...

180
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,383
I wanted to tell you that...

181
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,216
Uh...

182
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,522
You're crushing it
at this queen thing.

183
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,424
Aw, Branch, thank you.

184
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,058
Being a good queen is

185
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,328
the most important thing
in the world to me.

186
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,095
Other than being your friend.

187
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,232
<i>Friend, friend, friend, friend,</i>

188
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,300
<i>friend, friend, friend.</i>

189
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,503
Uh, five it up?

190
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,006
Huh. That could've been better.
Let's try that again.

191
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,174
O-Okay, one more.

192
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:45,444
Huh. For some reason, we can't
seem to make a good connection.

193
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,281
Oh, yes, Fuzzbert!

194
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,417
Now, that's a good connection.

195
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,084
Poppy, help!

196
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:53,951
- Ooh.
- Poppy!

197
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,590
Watch it, watch it!

198
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,559
- Biggie?
- Oh, run!

199
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:03,362
Help!

200
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:06,265
I'm being harangued
by a monster!

201
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,536
Someone stop it!

202
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,070
Gotcha! Ah! It's in my hair!
It's in my hair!

203
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,006
Get it out, get it out, get it out!

204
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,209
There you go.

205
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,314
There you go. Calm down.

206
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:23,582
Who's a good boy?

207
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,149
What is that thing?

208
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,217
It's creepy.

209
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,352
It's scary.

210
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,521
And nasty.

211
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,958
- Hold me, Daddy.
- Oh.

212
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,430
"To Queen Poppy."

213
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,500
Oh, don't worry, everyone.

214
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:43,402
It looks like
it's just an invitation.

215
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:44,603
Whew!

216
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,238
Just an invitation.

217
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,539
I love invitations.

218
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,541
"Barb, the Queen of Rock,

219
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,645

Under Rock World Tour.

220

222
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,083
- Queen of Rock?
- It's nothing!

223
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,520
It means nothing at all.
It's just junk mail.

224
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:02,421
You don't need
to worry about it.

225
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,121
I mean, quit looking at it,
everyone.

226
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,491
Forget what you saw!

227
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,563
There you go. There you go.

228
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,065
Calm down. Calm down.

229
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,469
There you go.

230
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,070
Okay, I'm calm.

231
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,071
I'm calm.

232
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,241
Dad, what's going on?

233
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,477
Well, I have long feared
this day would come.

234
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,447
I was hoping to protect you
from this, Poppy.

235
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,281
Protect me?

236
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,182
I'm not a little kid
anymore, Dad.

237
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,286
I'm the queen now.

238
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,621
You're right.

239
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:40,459
The truth is we are not alone
in this world.

240
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,566
There are other kinds
of Trolls.

241
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,434
- What?
- Wow. That's...

242
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,502
Dad, that's great.

243
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,404
The more Trolls, the merrier.

244
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,138
You don't understand.

245
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,173
These other Trolls
aren't like us.

246
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,175
They're different.

247
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,578
Different how?

248
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,679
Different like Legsly?

249
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:02,314
I love being me.

250
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,582
Or Fuzzbert? Or Smidge?

251
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,116
Or Skyscraper Troll?

252
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,885
Yeah, different like me?

253
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,554
No, it's not that.

254
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:11,623
They're different in ways
you can't even imagine.

255
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,125
You see, we love music

256
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,461
with a hummable hook,
with an upbeat melody,

257
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,264
with a catchy rhythm that makes
you want to snap your fingers,

258
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,500
tap your toes
and wiggle your butt.

259
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,668
That's our music.

260
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,537
That's what makes us
Pop Trolls.

261
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,306
- Ooh.
- It is. -Yes.

262
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,608
But these other Trolls,
they sing different.

263
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,609
They dance different.

264
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:33,445
Why, some of them
can't even begin to grasp

265
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,147
the concept of Hammer Time.

266
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,718
You can't touch that!

267
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,329
♪ Stop. ♪

268
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:52,698
How about we break down
to a smaller group?

269
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:00,372
It's a story as old as time.

270
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,345
In the beginning,
there was silence.

271
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,380
Boring.

272
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,316
<i>Until one day,
someone made a sound.</i>

273
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,721
<i>Our ancestors were
so inspired by the sound,</i>

274
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:18,490
<i>they took six strings.</i>

275
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:22,761
<i>And those six strings had
the power to control all music.</i>

276
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,396
<i>They could play anything.</i>

277
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,266
<i>Techno, funk, classical,</i>

278
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,736
<i>country, hard rock and pop.</i>

279
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:33,538
<i>And every kind of music
in between.</i>

280
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
<i>There was something
for everyone.</i>

281
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,742
<i>It was one big party.</i>

282
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,377
Yay!

283
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,778
<i>But little by little,</i>

284
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,447
<i>Trolls became intolerant
of each other's music.</i>

285
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,715
I want it!

286
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,717
- I want to listen to techno!
- No fair!

287
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,719
Hey, y'all, I want country.

288
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:50,221
<i>They fought
over what kind of music</i>

289
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:51,723
<i>the strings would play.</i>

290
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,426
<i>The elders realized
there was but one solution.</i>

291
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:56,561
Blah,
blah-blah-blah-blah. Agreed.

292
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:59,398
<i>Each tribe would take a string</i>

293
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,402
<i>and go their separate ways.</i>

294
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:07,406
<i>Those six tribes have lived
in isolation ever since.</i>

295
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:10,242
<i>Techno, Country, Rock,</i>

296
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,244
<i>Classical, Funk,</i>

297
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:14,715
<i>and us, the Pop Trolls.</i>

298
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:18,450
Now Barb's announcement
makes sense.

299
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,018
She wants to reunite
the strings

300
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,654
so the Troll World
can be one big party again.

301
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,289
Wait, that's all you heard?

302
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,291
- One big party?
- Yeah!

303
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,026
It's when all the Trolls
lived in harmony.

304
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,462
And what's more important
than living in harmony?

305
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,697
Well, I heard fighting.

306
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,298
The strings together
leads to fighting.

307
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,533
Exactly, Branch.

308
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:37,302
That's why we need
to keep our string safe.

And powerful.

315
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:01,727
Which is why we can't let it
fall into the wrong hands.

And we won't.
Not on my watch.

317
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,498
What we need is a plan.

318
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,466
Don't worry.

319
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:10,669
I've been preparing
for this day for years.

320
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,370
- We run.
- Run?

321
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:13,371
And hide.

322
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:14,606
On it.

323
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:18,343
But we don't even know what
we're running and hiding from.

Uh, father trumps queen.

Now, there's no time
to debate this. Let's go.

- Oh. Nothing.

343

Sneaking out to meet Barb?

344
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,423

Bye-bye, little bat.

348

Your dad just told us
that Queen Barb is bad news.

doesn't know everything.

You didn't even know there was
a string until this morning.

352

He may be fine in a world where
everybody lives in isolation,

353

anything about
the other Trolls.

355

Troll Village.

having a lot of power,

362
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,795
and it's my job
to use it for good.

00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:03,034
Oh, Mr. Dinkles, you're alive.

809
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,069
For a minute there, I thought
you'd kicked the bucket.

810
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,777
I'm really glad
you came with me.

811
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:15,747
Me, too.

812
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:16,981
Yah!

813
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:18,216
There you are. Whew!

814
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:19,851
I think we lost them.

815
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:21,520
- We should be all right.
- Thank you.

816
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:23,355
I don't know
how we can ever repay you.

817
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:25,224
Oh, wait! Yes, I do.

818
00:39:25,226 --> 00:39:26,258
Gumdrops!

819
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,892
Gum what?

820
00:39:27,894 --> 00:39:30,229
Oh. Well, thank you.

821
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:32,163
Whew. That's got a zing,
don't it?

822
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,098
- Uh... Whoa.
- It's not candy time.

823
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,334
It's question time.

824
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:36,335
Huh?

825
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:37,969
- Hug time!
- Hug time!

826
00:39:37,971 --> 00:39:39,837
- Ooh. Oh, that feels good.
- Wow.

827
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,142
Why are you helping us?

828
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:45,843
What's in it for you?

829
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,045
Hey! Branch.

830
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:50,848
I'm sorry
about my... associate.

831
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,251
I loved your message about

832
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:54,018
music bringing Trolls together.

833
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,856
You may be Pop, and I may be
Country, but Trolls is Trolls.

834
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:00,124
"Trolls is Trolls."

835
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:01,859
Wow. Deep.

836
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:04,563
This is the beginning of
a partnership between Trolls

837
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:06,998
that's going to save
all Trolls.

838
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,267
You're darn skippy.

839
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:10,001
Ah.

840
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:12,870
Okay. We need to get to
the Funk Trolls before Barb.

841
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:14,373
Well, quickest way
is down that river.

842
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,874
I'll build us a raft.

843
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,142
This ought to be good.

844
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:19,010
Guy probably doesn't know

845
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:20,947
the first thing about
building a ra...

846
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:26,884
Cappuccino, anyone?

847
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:27,885
Cappuccino?

848
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,187
Cappucci-yes.

849
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,022
- Oh!
- Are you seeing this?

850
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,224
Oh, wow.

851
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:33,891
I do want one.

852
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:35,762
But I am not happy about it.

853
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:45,203
Trolls that look like me!

854
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:46,204
Yes!

855
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,009
Oh.

856
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:59,951
Hello there.

857
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,966
Happy birthday?

858
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,306
I can make a cortado,
a macchiato, latte.

859
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,440
- We also do drip.
- Oh.

860
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:23,074
It is a nice night, isn't it?

861
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:24,343
Mr. Dinkles loves a full moon.

862
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,478
Let's get our grub on.

863
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,079
Food's ready.

864
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,348
Well, I'll bring more kindlin'.

865
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,149
Poppy, maybe it's just me,

866
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,352
but are you getting
a weird vibe from Hickory?

867
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:34,353
What?

868
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:35,654
No. Why? Are you?

869
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,221
I just... I don't know.

870
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,490
- I don't trust him.
- Oh, that's good.

871
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:39,957
Well, yeah, but you don't

872
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,125
trust anybody, Branch.

873
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:43,094
Hey, I just want us to be safe.

874
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,463
And you know what's not safe?

875
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,031
Putting too much trust
into a complete stranger.

876
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:49,133
Oh, I see.

877
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:51,838
It's not Hickory
you don't trust. It's me.

878
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:54,506
Do you not think
I'm a good queen?

879
00:41:54,508 --> 00:41:56,408
Wait, what?
I didn't say that.

880
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,609
I thought we were friends,
Branch.

881
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,678
I'm starting to think you don't
even know what that means.

882
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
We <i>are</i> friends.

883
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,914
And sometimes
that means speaking up

884
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:05,451
if I think
you're making a mistake.

885
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:08,121
Do you hear something?

886
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:15,494
Look at that guy's chest hair.

887
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:19,264
Poppy,

888
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:22,267
I can't feel my face.

889
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:26,170
It's... it's like
I'm being paralyzed by its

890
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,172
smoothness.

891
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:43,154
Hello?

892
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:45,089
Hello. It's me.

893
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:48,327
Look! Narwhals.

894
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,330
Totally gnar-gnar.

895
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:53,234
Poppy!

896
00:42:56,437 --> 00:42:57,438
Oh.

897
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:01,306
Ah...

898
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:02,541
Poppy,

899
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,176
how'd you like the sushi?

900
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:06,578
Oh.

901
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,514
Got you, Pop babies.

902
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:11,450
Soon, Barb is gonna
have your string,

903
00:43:11,452 --> 00:43:15,454
and the world will be rid of
cheesy, pointless pop music,

904
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:17,289
once and for all.

905
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:20,091
Hold it right there, Chaz.

906
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:24,162
And who are you supposed to be,
cowboy pants?

907
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:25,564
My name's Hickory,

908
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:28,767
and I don't much care
for smooth jazz.

909
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,269
Oh, yeah?

910
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Well, you've just never had
the Chaz experience.

911
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,613
Ooh. Ah.

912
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,350
Gumdrops.

913
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:48,152
Soundproof and delicious.

914
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:50,589
Smooth jazz
will be heard again!

915
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:54,259
Smooth jazz will never die!

916
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,529
Who was that guy?

917
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:00,265
One of the many bounty hunters
out there looking for you.

918
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,234
That was awful.

919
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:04,236
So smooth and easy and awful.

920
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:05,604
I know, big buddy.

921
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:08,105
It's enough to put you
off jazz altogether.

922
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,409
All right, that's it!
We need to go home.

923
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:11,610
Biggie, it'll be okay.

924
00:44:11,612 --> 00:44:13,512
Stop saying that,
and listen to me.

00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:16,214
You only hear

929

975
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:39,586
Ooh.

Oh!

Welcome to Vibe City.

987
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:23,695
You are cordial guests
of Prince Cooper.

988
00:48:23,697 --> 00:48:25,063
Cooper?!

989
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:27,365
What are you doing here?!

990
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,503
Actually, I'm over here.

991
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:31,470
What?

992
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,371
Bacon-wrapped hot dogs!

993
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:34,706
Okay. Maybe all the jazz

994
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,608
hasn't left my brain yet.

995
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,377
It turns out
I'm actually from Vibe City,

996
00:48:39,379 --> 00:48:40,779
just like my twin brother.

997
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,547
I'm Prince D.
What's poppin'?

998
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:46,518
I got a twin brother.

999
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,652
How is this possible?

1000
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:51,389
Well, it's a very
complicated story.

1001
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:52,724
<i>When we were both babies,</i>

1002
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:54,693
<i>my egg got snatched
out of the nest.</i>

1003
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:56,762
<i>Mom and Dad looked everywhere,
but they couldn't find me,</i>

1004
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:58,764
- <i>so you guys raised me as one of your own.</i>
- Aw.

1005
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,465
Now dig this.

1006
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:02,534
<i>And then
when I went out to go find</i>

1007
00:49:02,536 --> 00:49:06,738
<i>other Trolls like me, my mom
and dad finally found me.</i>

1008
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,673
Q, is that him?

1009
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:10,342
I think our search
is finally over.

1010
00:49:10,344 --> 00:49:12,410
Our son is finally home.

1011
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,381
I guess it wasn't
too complicated.

1012
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:17,816
Oh.

1013
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:21,653
Poppy, I want you to meet
the King and Queen of Funk.

1014
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,755
King Quincy and Queen Essence.

1015
00:49:23,757 --> 00:49:25,524
My mom and dad.

1016
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:27,559
Aw.

1017
00:49:27,561 --> 00:49:29,828
Wow, Cooper.
You look just like your dad.

1018
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,798
Yeah, that must be
why he's so good-looking.

1019
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,432
Was that a dad joke?

1020
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:35,934
It was lame!

1021
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:37,702
Well, so that means

1022
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:39,437
you're a Funk Troll?

1023
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:40,839
You don't have to be
just one thing.

1024
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,707
I'm Pop and Funk.

1025
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:44,709
- Or maybe you're Hip-Hop, like me.
- Yeah.

1026
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:46,778
Hip-Hop?

1027
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Yeah. I think your map

1028
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:50,682
- is a bit outdated.
- Hmm.

1029
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:53,552
Oh, he's right. Look at that.
It still has Disco.

1030
00:49:53,554 --> 00:49:54,986
Well, Your Majesties,

1031
00:49:54,988 --> 00:49:58,590
we need your help to save
all music from Queen Barb.

1032
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:00,559
If we combine our music,

1033
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:01,960
she'll see that music
unites all Trolls

1034
00:50:01,962 --> 00:50:04,531
and that we're all the same
and that she's one of us!

1035
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,401
Poppy, I mean no disrespect,

1036
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:11,970
but king to queen,
anything but that.

1037
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:13,605
Why not?

1038
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:17,175
Let's tell 'em how it was,
Prince D.

1039
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:18,677
Sick.

1040
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,779
Long ago, our world was
without song or dance.

1041
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:22,881
Then the Trolls
found the strings,

1042
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:24,885
and life was one big party.

1043
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:30,555
Oh, yeah.
I-I've heard this story before.

1044
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:34,025
That is, until the Pop Trolls
tried to steal our strings.

1045
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:35,060
Steal your strings?

1046
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,495
That-That's not what it said
in our scrapbooks.

1047
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:38,630
Scrapbooks?

1048
00:50:38,632 --> 00:50:41,867
Those are cut out, glued
and glittered by the winners.

1049
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:43,768
Let me tell you

And the Trolls
never lived in harmony again.

1110
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:46,891
So the Trolls live in isolation
because of what Pop did?

1111
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:49,928
Pop tried to destroy our music.

1112
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,697
Just like Barb is trying to do.

1113
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:53,999
I can make it right.

1114
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:55,900
History's just gonna
keep repeating itself

1115
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:58,770
until we make everyone realize
that we're all the same.

1116
00:52:58,772 --> 00:53:00,772
But we're not all the same.

1117
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:02,907
It's why all our strings
are different.

1118
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:05,076
Because they reflect
our different music.

1119
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:08,013
Denying our differences

1120
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:10,917
is denying the truth
of who we are.

1121
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:15,086
I hadn't thought of it
like that.

1122
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:20,093
Rock has arrived!
It's on!

1123
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:22,594

Aw, you kidding me?

1134
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,931
- Hard Rock cut the power.
- They're fighting dirty.

1135
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:01,601
Cooper!

1136
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:08,173
- Hickory.
- Don't worry!

1137
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,175
I'll find you guys.

1138
00:54:10,177 --> 00:54:13,044
Uh, Poppy.

1139
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,147
Rock on!

1140
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,723
No!

1141
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:27,759
We have to get back down there.
There's still hope.

1142
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,994
- We can still fix this.
- Poppy, enough.

1143
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,930
I've listened to you
and I've done it your way,

1144
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:33,965
and now it's your turn
to listen.

1145
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,000
It's time to get back home.

1146
00:54:36,002 --> 00:54:38,136
I'm not like you.
I can't just give up.

1147
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:39,737
Give up?

1148
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,673
I want to protect
our friends and family.

1149
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:45,244
I can't go home until I've
proven myself as a good queen.

1150
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:47,446
So that's what this is
really all about?

1151
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:49,013
Why are you so upset?

1152
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:50,882
Because your dad was right

1153
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:53,151
and Biggie was right
and Queen Essence was right.

1154
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:56,990
And I've been backing you up
even when you ignore them.

1155
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,960
But you never listen to me.

1156
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:03,830
Branch, what are you
talking about?

1157
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,865
You want to be a good queen?

1158
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:08,766
Good queens actually listen.

1159
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:10,935
You know what I heard
back there?

1160
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:13,039
Differences do matter.

1161
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:18,042
Like-like you and me.

1162
00:55:18,044 --> 00:55:20,778
We're too different
to get along.

1163
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,782
Just like all the other Trolls.

1164
00:55:34,495 --> 00:55:36,928
- We <i>are</i> really different.
- So different.

1165
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,230
- Completely out of harmony.
- Completely.

1166
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:39,797
I don't even know
why we're friends.

1167
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:41,868
Neither do I.

1168
00:55:49,343 --> 00:55:51,943
So...

1169
00:55:51,945 --> 00:55:55,949
why do I care about you more
than anybody else in the world?

1170
00:55:59,886 --> 00:56:01,888

We are the K-Pop Gang.

That's a shame.

1236

I was so desperate
to be a good queen

1237

that I stopped listening

Including my best friend.

1239
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,057
And it's all because of
this stupid string.

1240
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:05,597
Poppy, take the string
and run as fast as you can,

Ding, ding. Give this person a
strudel for the correct answer.

So sorry.

1267
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:20,272

our beautiful yodeling.

But trust me, you need to get
out of here right away.

1270

What are you doing, Hickory?

This is who I've been
worried about?

1280
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,875
This little pipsqueak?

1281
01:01:56,877 --> 01:01:59,645
I'll never stop fighting
until I make things right.

1282
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:01,647
- And I'm not a pipsqueak!
- Uh, yeah, you are,

1283
01:02:01,649 --> 01:02:03,582
