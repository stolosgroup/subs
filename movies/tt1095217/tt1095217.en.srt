2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,585
Oh, shit.

3
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,663
Duffy split.

4
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,749
Yeah, wasn't that Duffy?

5
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,093
Duffy rolls outta here
in a brand new Cadillac.

6
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,131
The lad has the nerve to ask me to clean up
his fucking locker and save it for him.

7
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,299
Probably has dirty pictures of his wife.

8
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,227
I don't know what the fuck is in here.

9
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,560
Uh-huh.

10
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,645
He does have dirty pictures of his wife.

11
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,981
Yes. He does.

12
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,984
<i>Lucky man.
Look at her hooters.</i>

13
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,319
You like that, huh?

14
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,823
All right.
This is what I'm gonna do.

15
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,616
I'm gonna keep them.

16
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,035
Well, no, I gotta answer
to Duffy for that.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,495
I'll answer to him.

18
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,664
He is a duffus
but he's not a bad guy.

19
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,760
Fuck Duffy. Just fuck him.
Fuck all of them.

20
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,265
Five copies of an arrest report.

21
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,343
If the prisoner was transported,
there wouldn't still be five copies here.

22
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,513
Duffy might've left him downstairs.
What's his name? Chavez.

23
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,607
Let's go find him.

24
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,241
Who's there?

25
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:50,529
It's strange, 'cause the manifest says
the prisoners all evacuated.

26
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,656
Anything's possible in this storm.

27
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,159
I feel a bet coming on.
Shall we open the casino?

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,535
<i>Please.</i>

29
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,997
All right.
Up to his nose by 4:00.

30
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,166
<i>What the fuck took you so long, man?
Please.</i>

31
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,043
Please what, shitbird?

32
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,378
<i>Get me the fuck outta here, man.
The water's rising.</i>

33
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,682
<i>It's been rising for like three hours.
It's already up to my neck.</i>

34
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:14,645
I'm not gonna be able to stay here long, man.
I'll drown. The water doesn't stop.

35
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,141
Get me the fuck outta here.
There's fucking snakes and shit in this water.

36
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:24,030
Twenty bucks and the Polaroid
he says nothing before five.

37
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:28,275
Twenty bucks. What the fuck is that?
Let's make it worth our while, at least. A dime.

38
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm not betting you $1,000.

39
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,779
Five hundred.

40
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,032
Get me the fuck outta here, man!
The water keeps rising.

41
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,117
Two hundred and the Polaroids.

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,452
<i>Please, motherfuckers.</i>

43
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,580
<i>Please what, shit turd?</i>

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,792
Got a broke leg.
Please, get me out of here.

45
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:49,088
<i>Wait a minute.
You want me to get wet on account of you?</i>

46
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,090
Think the world owes you a living, huh?

47
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,424
<i>I'll drown.</i>

48
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,927
Hey, man, I got on
Swiss cotton underpants.

49
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,721
Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $55 a pair.

50
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,933
You think I wanna get all this brown water
and shit all over?

51
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,267
That don't come out.

52
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,603
You got underwear on that cost $55?

53
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,781
My girl gave them to me.

54
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:14,080
Come on, we get the time of death
from autopsy.

55
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,782
What are you doing?

56
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,542
Hold this.

57
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,203
Oh, come on, man.

58
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,123
Let the Fire Department get him out.
What are you, crazy?

59
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,083
He ain't worth it!

60
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,377
Come on, man.

61
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,971
You are crazy.

62
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,144
<i>You okay, man?
You okay?</i>

63
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:43,350
The good news, Terence, is I'll okay you
to return to full duty.

64
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,477
The bad news is that in all likely

65
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,773
you'll be experiencing
moderate to severe back pain.

66
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,400
How severe?

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,819
You'll wanna be taking something for it.

68
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,823
Gonna write you a
prescription for Vicodin.

69
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,408
For how long?

70
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,659
From now on.

71
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,662
No. For how long am I gonna have pain?

72
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,165
We're gonna try to manage this
as along as we can.

73
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,750
For the rest of my life?

74
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,337
Probably. But they're making advancements
every day, so,

75
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,672
just work with me on this, all right?

76
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,309
Now, when this runs out,
call the office.

77
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:27,019
<i>Thank you for helping me honor
our fallen heroes today.</i>

78
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,355
We will now move on
to the awards and promotions.

79
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:35,027
Among those being promoted
to lieutenant today,

80
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,529
it gives me great pleasure

81
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,533
to additionally award
the Distinguish Service Cross

82
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,454
to Sergeant now Lieutenant
Terence McDonagh,

83
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,917
in recognition of extreme valor
in the line of duty.

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,428
<i>Congratulations, Lieutenant.</i>

85
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:14,969
There's three more.

86
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,565
You don't wanna look.
It's execution style.

87
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,029
What did you come up with?

88
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,991
Scale in the closet,
bundle of glass in envelopes.

89
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,117
Dob been around?

90
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,660
I thought he went away.

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,788
<i>He's out.
I saw him the other day.</i>

92
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,373
Let's get him in.

93
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,335
His baby mama is over
by General Taylor and Annunciation.

94
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,128
You have informers doing the canvass?

95
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,880
The duty captain sent them out.

96
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,759
Whoever they talk to,
I want followed up by a member of the squad.

97
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,345
You'll see to that personally, Armand.

98
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,055
Are they pulling security cameras?

99
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,147
Yeah.

100
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:10,891
Every license plate in the area.

101
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,383
Got it.

102
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:40,212
<i>My Friend</i> by Babacar Ndele.

103
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,548
"My friend is a fish.

104
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,258
"He live in my room.

105
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,844
"His fin is a cloud.

106
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,981
"He see me when I sleep."

107
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:23,297
<i>Couple's name:
Dauta and Yasin Ndele.</i>

108
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,759
Dauta's mother's name:
Ramatullai Ndele.

109
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,389
Children's names:
Animata and Babacar.

110
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,474
Family's from Senegal.

111
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,102
Immigration status: illegal.

112
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,937
From what we know,

113
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:44,318
Dauta had been dealing heroin
to supplement his income as a peddler.

114
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,195
Now, I want every drug dealer,

115
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,073
every junkie within a five-mile radius

116
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,410
<i>hassled into giving up
who his supplier was.</i>

117
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,245
<i>Due to the nature of this crime,</i>

118
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,165
<i>you've got full authorization
for overtime if you need it.</i>

119
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,293
<i>Lieutenant McDonagh's gonna be
heading up the investigation,</i>

120
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,128
<i>so coordinate with him.</i>

121
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,964
<i>That's it.
Let's see some results.</i>

122
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,892
<i>McDonagh, see you in my office
for a minute.</i>

123
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,478
You up to this?

124
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,647
Why wouldn't I be?

125
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,316
I know you're still having problems
with your back.

126
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,651
Dealing with being in pain
a lot of the time.

127
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm managing.

128
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,539
You still taking medication for it?

129
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:34,376
Only what the doctor prescribes.

130
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,622
Ordinarily there'd be somebody
with more time on the job

131
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,624
handling this kind of investigation.

132
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,002
But I'm gonna go out on a limb with you
'cause you got good instincts

133
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,421
and do nothing' but work.

134
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,800
But if I find that you needed help
and didn't ask for it,

135
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,760
I will be mad.

136
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,652
Yes, Sir.

137
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,597
How is your old man doing?

138
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,726
He's drinking himself into an early grave.

139
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,228
Give him my best, would you?

140
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,562
I will.

141
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,025
Lieutenant, no more
unnecessary jumps, huh?

142
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,917
Yes, Sir.

143
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,557
Good morning, Mr. McDonagh.

144
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:49,824
Hi, honey.

145
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,117
You bring me something?

146
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,452
You're out already?

147
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,544
Yes.

148
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:13,933
Mm.

149
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,606
<i>Frankie, hi. This is Andy.</i>

150
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:33,195
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Hoping to see
if you have any time tonight.</i>

151
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:37,032
<i>I'm at the Monteleone.</i>

152
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,618
You need to call him back?

153
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,710
No.

154
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:44,623
You know I'd rather go
to the Monteleone with you.

155
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't afford it.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,387
I can.
I can afford it.

157
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,905
Yeah?

158
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,484
Who brought him in?

159
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,620
That's who's questioning him?

160
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,533
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Tell him I'm on my way.

161
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,961
Tell him if he puts his hands on this guy,
he's gonna have a problem.

162
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:27,165
I don't give a shit, Armand.
You tell him to take a fucking break!

163
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,253
Excuse me. Could you tell me
how much longer that's gonna be?

164
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,464
Hello, Miss?
I'm a Lieutenant in the Police Department.

165
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,967
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

166
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,344
Can I get my prescription, please?

167
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,189
Do you see I'm on the phone?

168
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,317
<i>Hey, you can't come back here.</i>

169
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,987
You got me waiting 40 minutes
so you can make a fuck personal phone call!

170
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:54,943
Security. Security to Pharmacy.
Security to Pharmacy, please.

171
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,029
<i>This is it. This is it.
Police emergency.</i>

172
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,531
You're no cop.

173
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,740
What's that look like?

174
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,827
Why are you acting all crazy for?

175
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,705
This is, uh,
$23 with my copay, right?

176
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,165
There's 40.
Give everybody a drink.

177
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,426
Get the fuck out of my way.

178
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,047
<i>Dob, look at me.</i>

179
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,332
<i>Okay?</i>

180
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:20,176
<i>Two hours. That's enough.</i>

181
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,263
<i>Tell me something I don't know.</i>

182
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,056
<i>Man, you gotta get me outta here.</i>

183
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,683
<i>Get you outta here?
Are you crazy?</i>

184
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,352
<i>I got you on possession.
You're on parole.</i>

185
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,730
Maybe but one skinny ass joint.

186
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,024
That joint's gonna get you back.

187
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,401
I've got five dead people, man.

188
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,569
You understand?

189
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,237
I don't know nothin' about it.

190
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,197
Tell me something.

191
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,208
What do you want me to tell you?

192
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,628
I want you to tell me something I haven't heard.
I don't want you to tell me,

193
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,831
look at me, I don't want you to tell me
that you don't know nothing.

194
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,459
But I don't know nothing.

195
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,419
Did you tell him what I said?

196
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,129
<i>You understand what that means?</i>

197
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,008
I'm entitled to whatever I want
in this room.

198
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,345
That means Guantanamo Bay.
You believe this motherfucker?

199
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,098
I've busted my ass for yambos
and this yambo tell me shit.

200
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,643
Detective, can I see you
outside for a second?

201
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,188
Uh, yeah, sure.
Two minutes.

202
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,031
Think about it.

203
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,234
Uh, not a great time to take a break.

204
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,297
What are you doing?

205
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:20,612
He's about to go.

206
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,301
Bullshit.
He's scared out of his mind.

207
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,075
You and your partner made a spectacle
out of picking him up.

208
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,086
Everyone in Central City knows he's in here.
No, just shush.

209
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,955
You think he's gonna go out
if you keep insulting him like that?

210
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,208
You trying to tell me
how to do my interrogation?

211
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,270
Yes. I'm gonna tell you
when you're doing something wrong.

212
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,305
Go fuck yourself.

213
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,174
I'm gonna treat you respectfully.

214
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,435
You treat me respectfully.

215
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,638
I'm looking at some bullshit pot busting.
Because you're on parole

216
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,224
you wind up back in Angola.
Why would you do that?

217
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,434
I ain't the one doing it.

218
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,645
Who did have Kingard piss off?

219
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,690
I never said two words to him.
I don't know.

220
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,576
But you knew he was selling dope.
Come on.

221
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,157
Shall I call your parole officer?
Stop wasting my time.

222
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,043
I knew he was selling.

223
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:12,372
<i>Okay. Tell me where he was selling,
whose neighborhood was it.</i>

224
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,000
Man, look. I got me a good job
at a cleaning service.

225
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,294
I check in when I'm supposed to.

226
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,672
I smoke a little weed,
but that's it.

227
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,100
Tell me whose neighborhood it was, Dob.

228
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:30,773
Man.

229
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,563
You know Fate?

230
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,399
Big Fate? Yeah.

231
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,913
Ain't nothin' moved that part of town,
he ain't got a piece of it.

232
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:48,199
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

233
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,910
Shit. I'm saying all I know.

234
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,756
If you want me to lead you to him,
you well just lock me up.

235
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:07,218
Check Stevie's arrest report on Dob.

236
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,221
If it mentions marijuana,
make sure it gets lost.

237
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,057
What do I tell Stevie?

238
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,892
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

239
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,112
I'm gonna go upstairs
and crash an hour in the crib.

240
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:44,139
What do you want, Mundt?

241
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,222
Internal Affairs is checking
the property room vouchers.

242
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,314
So?

243
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:56,434
That means they're gonna find out
the shit missing.

244
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,528
Not if you don't tell them,
they won't.

245
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:02,866
I can't do it anymore, Terence.

246
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,086
Oh, fuck.

247
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,371
I'm-- I'm really sorry.
I just can't.

248
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,663
Mundt,

249
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:22,052
whatever drugs might've been taken out
of the property room,

250
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:26,222
you will have a voucher,
you understand?

251
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:30,802
They won't turn up as missing,
'cause there's no record of them being there

252
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,305
in the first place, okay?

253
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,775
They're installing cameras.

254
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:41,729
So then you don't do anything

255
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:46,150
where the cameras can see you.

256
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,842
I can't.

257
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:51,197
When it was me doing paperwork
to cover the cash you misplaced,

258
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,242
that was all right.
That was entirely fucking reasonable.

259
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,253
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,381
<i>Hey, Mundt.</i>

261
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,926
Hey, Mundt?

262
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,177
You bad boy.

263
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:55,383
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

264
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,807
Stand against the wall.

265
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,102
Come on!
Stand against the wall.

266
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,074
You're too busy making out
with your girlfriend

267
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,147
you don't know when you've done
something illegal?

268
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,691
What are we hiding tonight?

269
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,817
Nothing.

270
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,778
You passed drugs in that club?

271
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,870
No.

272
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,575
The two of you match a description.
Empty your pockets and the handbag.

273
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,667
Why?

274
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,912
I said you match a description.

275
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,414
Somebody seen passing drugs.

276
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,051
I wasn't passing drugs.
What does that even mean?

277
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:29,754
Empty your pockets. Dump out the handbag.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

278
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,173
This is bullshit!

279
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,676
Just do what he says, okay?

280
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,427
<i>What you got there?</i>

281
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,824
<i>Nothing.</i>

282
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,306
<i>I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?</i>

283
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,398
No.

284
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:44,060
I get stuck,
I'm gonna be very fucking angry.

285
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,187
You're not gonna get stuck.

286
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,532
<i>Where's your badge
if you're a cop?</i>

287
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,612
This is what I'm looking for.

288
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,782
Here's where it says I'm a cop.

289
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:02,287
Sir, it-- it's obviously
just for personal use.

290
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,621
I mean, I'm not a dealer.

291
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,291
That's for the DA to decide.

292
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,552
You're gonna dump that bag
or I gotta do it?

293
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:16,175
Sir, is-- is there any way my parents
don't have to find out about this?

294
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,803
<i>I mean, can we,
can we just handle this?</i>

295
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,056
<i>I'll go to jail on weekends or something
like that if I have to do that.</i>

296
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,527
My father has a heart condition, okay?

297
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:30,982
This would kill him. Please.
Just let me keep this from him.

298
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,317
You think he want might to know?

299
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,914
Yeah. I'd wanna know
if you were my child.

300
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,668
Here.

301
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:48,166
This fur is nothing,
but this is my grandmother's.

302
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,878
It's worth $60,000.

303
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,589
You can give it to your girlfriend.

304
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,507
If you don't have a girlfriend,

305
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,509
you can give it to your mother.

306
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,178
It's bribery.

307
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,554
Excuse me!

308
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,849
This is worth $60,000.

309
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,311
Doesn't that get us passed?

310
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,646
Where's the rock?

311
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,575
Come on, come on,
who's got the kibble?

312
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,611
You wanna hit?

313
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,703
Yes.

314
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,256
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

315
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,132
Again.

316
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:40,476
Yeah?

317
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,819
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

318
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:10,915
This what's gonna take?
Yeah?

319
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,459
You're worried about
your father finding out?

320
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,551
No.

321
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:16,129
What about your mother?

322
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,589
I don't give a shit
about anyone of them.

323
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,299
Did they beat you?

324
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,391
No.

325
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,594
Molest you?

326
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,686
No.

327
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,266
Didn't buy you any clothes
back to school, huh?

328
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:32,436
Didn't see you in
the high school play, huh?

329
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,606
<i>I wonder what'd they say
if they saw you now.</i>

330
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,151
<i>Smokin' crack.</i>

331
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,653
Going out with no panties on?

332
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,372
No panties?

333
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:49,412
I bet they think about you
when you were a little girl.

334
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,756
What the hell happened to ya?

335
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:57,920
Don't fucking move!
You stay and watch!

336
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,433
You watch her!
Watch your fucking girlfriend.

337
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:16,989
Fuck!

338
00:24:58,448 --> 00:25:00,191
I need the coke back.

339
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,901
What happened?

340
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,987
I snorted what I thought was coke.
It turned out to be heroin.

341
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,489
I gotta be at work in a hour.

342
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,741
Oh, baby, okay.
I'm not alone.

343
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,794
Just get the coke.
I'll get out of here.

344
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,217
You didn't break it out for your client?

345
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,219
Nah. He brings his own.

346
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,604
Uh-huh.

347
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:34,859
Who are you?

348
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:44,235
I'm the last person in the world
you want me to be.

349
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,362
He's just an old friend.

350
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,866
Come on, missy, we've had you
under surveillance for weeks.

351
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,578
Do you have any
illegal substances on you?

352
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,246
Like what?

353
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,938
Asshole.

354
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,626
Cooperate with me,
I'll let you walk outta here.

355
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,514
You play games, come with her.

356
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,260
I got some coke.

357
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,752
Get it.

358
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Get out.

359
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,788
That was fun.

360
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:38,880
Hey.

361
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,869
Come. Come!

362
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:21,749
Are you a policeman?

363
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:22,841
Yes.

364
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,293
Do you know who do this?

365
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,461
I don't know, yet.

366
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,837
Look here.

367
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,090
This dead. Babacar.

368
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,676
This little girl, no more.

369
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,220
He's dead, dead.
Older man.

370
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,682
Oh, my angel, she's dead.
All my whole family.

371
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,392
How are you related?

372
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,353
Yasin. She were my sister.

373
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,105
When was the last time you saw her?

374
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,742
I see her dat morning.
I go by in case she need anything.

375
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,320
But dat morning she says she needs
something from the grocery,

376
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,866
and she called there and had it
delivered by a boy to her home.

377
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,701
Help me, please.

378
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,122
Please, help me find
the killer of my family.

379
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:05,009
Please, sir.
Help me. Help.

380
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,022
Are you the manager?

381
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,085
No, sir.

382
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:30,243
The manager's over there.

383
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:36,582
New Orleans Homicide.
You got people making deliveries here?

384
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:40,244
We get different guys making deliveries.
Different days, different guys.

385
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,121
What about Tuesday?

386
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,206
Different times a day.
Different guys.

387
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,583
Late afternoon.

388
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,836
We don't keep track
of who takes what to who.

389
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,472
A delivery boy hasn't shown up
in a while?

390
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:20,326
<i>Excuse us. Hello!</i>

391
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,453
Police Department.

392
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,580
We're looking for Binnie Rogers.

393
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,382
I'm Binnie Rogers.

394
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:30,127
We need to talk to you for a second.
Do you mind stepping in the hall?

395
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,130
No, I can't step into the hall.

396
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,058
Can't you see this lady
needs me here?

397
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,930
We're looking for your grandson,
Miss Rogers.

398
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,681
What are you looking for him for?

399
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,892
Just to talk.
We just wanna talk to him.

400
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,144
He do somethin' wrong?

401
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,355
He might've been a witness to a crime.

402
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,190
I don't know anything about that.

403
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,067
Where can we find him?

404
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:57,997
Young man, what do you think gives you
the right to come into my room

405
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:03,327
and have a conversation
without even acknowledging my presence?

406
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,663
We're terribly sorry.

407
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:09,458
It's very important we talk
to this woman's grandson.

408
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,836
And she told you
she doesn't know where he is.

409
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,588
Actually, she hasn't told us that.

410
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,891
I don't know.

411
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:21,687
I'm sorry, Grandma.

412
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:29,687
What do you wanna know?

413
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:34,283
Did you make a delivery Tuesday
on Josephine and Danneel, son?

414
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,070
Uh-huh.

415
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,530
<i>What did you see there?</i>

416
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,907
This is a 15-year old boy, sir.

417
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,159
<i>We need you to tell us
what you saw, Daryl.</i>

418
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,746
<i>He don't get involved
in drugs, in gangs.</i>

419
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,040
He go to school.

420
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,543
He hold down a job
and he come home.

421
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,587
A family was murdered, ma'am.

422
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,922
<i>And I feel very bad about that.</i>

423
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,384
But I don't want my grandson
involved in it.

424
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,896
<i>Maybe your grandson
has some feelings of his own.</i>

425
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,319
Well,

426
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:17,902
the lady told me to set
the grocery bags in the kitchen.

427
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,989
Uh, as I was setting the grocery bags down,
I heard screaming.

428
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,074
And I heard gunshots.

429
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,836
So I hid in the closet.

430
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,676
When I came out, everybody was dead.

431
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:37,972
Did you see who shot them?

432
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,067
Say yes or no.

433
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,654
This is who we're looking for.
Name is Donald Godshaw.

434
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:05,449
Street name "Big Fate."
You should familiarize yourself with his record.

435
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,619
It goes back to '91.
Did time for rape, sodomy,

436
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,256
aggravated assault, narcotics,
and possession of automatic weapons.

437
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:17,461
We believe he's also behind at least
three homicides including the Ndele family.

438
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,097
Lieutenant, wanna show
some of those victims?

439
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:24,685
<i>All three were possible witnesses.</i>

440
00:32:26,103 --> 00:32:28,514
Godshaw has two flunkies
that he runs with.

441
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,566
Deshaun Hackett, street name "Midget."

442
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:34,687
Has a girlfriend on Burgundy and Mazant.
We'll set up surveillance on the block.

443
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,189
Maybe we'll get lucky he'll turn up.

444
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,235
Gary Jenkins, street name "G."

445
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,946
His grandmother lives
in the Iberville Projects.

446
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,825
If his laying low chances are,
that's where we'll find him.

447
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,543
Let's bring him in.

448
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,441
Give me a minute.

449
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,611
I need access to the apartment next door.
Do you mind?

450
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,740
Oh! It's okay, baby.

451
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,408
Why you need access for?

452
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,546
We had complaints about disturbance,
not answering the door.

453
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,131
Don't fucking breathe.

454
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:23,480
I love it.

455
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,574
I just love it.

456
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:34,625
I've told you everything I know.

457
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:38,254
This is your lucky day, son.

458
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:42,332
You're the first person we've picked up.
You're in a position to help yourself.

459
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,001
Help myself do what?

460
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,461
You know something about this family
that got murdered.

461
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,555
I don't know nothing.

462
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:52,593
You were in the apartment when the Africans
got shot. Who was with you? Midget Donald?

463
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:56,054
Donald Godshaw, "Big Fate."
Where is he? Where can we find him?

464
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,681
I don't know no "Big Fate."

465
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,350
We don't need you no more.
There's gonna be five homicides

466
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,977
and Donald's gonna hand them on you.

467
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,897
He gets eight to ten.
You get for life.

468
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,190
I don't know nobody named "Midget."

469
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,035
I don't know nobody named "Big Fate."

470
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,581
Renaldo Hayes!

471
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,801
Oh. Man!
That's bad luck.

472
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:29,922
I keep hope that once in a while this kid
throws to somebody on his own team.

473
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:33,383
I love the guy. By the end of the fucking game,
I'm starting to hate him.

474
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,885
What do you want for the weekend?

475
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,845
What's the spread on Louisiana-Arkansas?

476
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:37,937
Four.

477
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,015
Louisiana.

478
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,517
Minus to four for a dime.

479
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,354
You got it.
I got a favor to ask.

480
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,230
My kid got a speeding ticket.

481
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,900
I'll take care
if you give me half a point.

482
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,486
You're gonna grind me
for helping out my kid?

483
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,655
Grind you?
You're funny guy, you know that?

484
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:58,459
There's guys getting half a point
on the street for nothing. Grind you.

485
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,590
All right.
But you take care of it.

486
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,820
Hello. Hello!

487
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,698
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh,
New Orleans Homicide.

488
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,283
What can I do for you?

489
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,785
A friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.

490
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,955
She was doing 75 on the way to the hospital
to visit her grandmother.

491
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,958
Has a couple of minor,
minor violations in the past.

492
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,793
She's in danger of losing her license.

493
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,253
What do you want me to do?

494
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,049
<i>I'd like you to take care
of it for me.</i>

495
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,465
You come to the scene of an accident
to ask me that?

496
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,267
There shouldn't be a problem.

497
00:37:57,393 --> 00:38:01,471
Are you asking me to break the law?
Is that what you're doing here?

498
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,734
I'm asking you one cop to another
to do me a favor.

499
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,979
The answer's no.

500
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,731
Just like that?

501
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,316
Just like that.

502
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,861
Is this the same Police Department
my father was in?

503
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,279
You'll excuse me.

504
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,571
Great.

505
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:22,075
Guardian of the Flame, right?
Fucking ass.

506
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,419
Get back in you car, Lieutenant.

507
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:26,997
Or else what?

508
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,089
Hey there.

509
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,126
Hey, what are you doing here?

510
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,669
<i>You know the Lieutenant?</i>

511
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,629
Yeah. We used to work together.

512
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,433
Why don't you walk him
back to his car?

513
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,348
I could've told you not to bother
with that asshole.

514
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,808
You needed a ticket fixed,
why didn't you come to me?

515
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,477
I didn't know you worked here.

516
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,355
They only let me out on patrol
when they're short handed.

517
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,857
Mostly they got me in the property room.

518
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,068
Property room?

519
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,162
What are you doing tonight?

520
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,740
You asking me out?

521
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,709
Yes, I am.

522
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:03,351
Hey.

523
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:10,934
You like these boots, don't you?

524
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,854
Only on you, you know that.

525
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,946
Yeah?

526
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,482
You're horny?

527
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,374
Oh, yeah.

528
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:25,574
No, you're not.
You're high on dope.

529
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,466
Not true.

530
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:32,122
Whatever I take is prescription.

531
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,676
Except for the heroin.

532
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:39,680
Hey! Wake up, McDonagh.

533
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:46,511
Yeah, there's times I can't get
what I need with the prescription.

534
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,003
Really?

535
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:52,859
Yeah. When my back hurts sometimes.

536
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:58,190
Well, maybe there's something I can do
to make that pain go away.

537
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,734
You definitely can.

538
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,487
What's that, baby?
What do you want me to do for you?

539
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,198
Check out your property room

540
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,576
and see if there's any Oxycontin

541
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,868
or morphine

542
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:16,208
you can sneak outta there.

543
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:20,429
Just make sure you get rid
of the voucher copy.

544
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,392
You're nuts.

545
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:43,326
Hey.

546
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:48,406
The ticket's gonna be a
little more complicated than I thought.

547
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,867
You're kidding me.

548
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,745
The best thing to do
is to have her plead not guilty.

549
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,791
By the time a court day comes around,
I'll talk to the cop who wrote her up.

550
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,001
I thought that's what you were gonna do.

551
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,224
I went straight to the Lieutenant.
He wound up being a hard on.

552
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:09,311
It'll work out. It's just gonna take
a little longer. Come on.

553
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:15,016
Kinda calls into question the
half-a-point-for-nothing concept, don't you think?

554
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,060
You're some cheap prick,
you know that?

555
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,938
You say you're gonna do something
and you don't do it.

556
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,315
Good! Charge me for the half point.

557
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:27,654
And after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.

558
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,408
You might, I mean, might

559
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,920
have thought to bring me
a little something.

560
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:38,456
Two dimes!

561
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,709
On Louisiana

562
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,011
against Georgia.

563
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:48,642
Okay, you got it.

564
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:32,719
How long has he been in there?

565
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:33,970
About 20 minutes.

566
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,597
Who else?

567
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,475
His girlfriend. At least one.
That's as far as we know.

568
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,895
What are these fucking iguanas
doing on my coffee table?

569
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,064
There ain't no iguana.

570
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,482
Yeah, there are.

571
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:48,234
There ain't no iguana.

572
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,662
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

573
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:54,032
Are we set up?

574
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,492
SWAT's around the corner.

575
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,703
No! No, just, just no SWAT.
Let them stay there.

576
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,882
The duty captain said he wanted
to coordinate with us when we--

577
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:05,710
Is that what you're fucking doing now?
Reporting back to the duty captain?

578
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,679
I'm telling you what he said.

579
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:11,725
If we need SWAT, we'll call 'em.

580
00:45:20,168 --> 00:45:21,336
Let's go.

581
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:44,392
Who else is in here?

582
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,884
Nobody.

583
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:48,572
We're gonna come back every day,
you understand?

584
00:45:48,697 --> 00:45:54,068
More times we come back,
more chances that child getting shot.

585
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,945
Ain't nobody here.

586
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,582
He's hiding back there in the armoire.

587
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:08,884
You all stay with her.
Armand.

588
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,309
Get up.

589
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,228
I said get up!

590
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,063
Damn, man.

591
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:34,025
It's always nice to see an intact family.

592
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,611
A father who honors his obligations

593
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,489
as far as his children are a concern.

594
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,200
<i>You're here.
That's important thing.</i>

595
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,870
<i>You may be hiding in an armoire,
but your child knows you're here.</i>

596
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,288
Are you tripping, man?

597
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,665
<i>Armand, give us a minute.</i>

598
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,583
You're tripping.
You want that shit.

599
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,803
Shut the door. Shut up.
Shut the door.

600
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,973
Sit down.

601
00:46:57,891 --> 00:46:59,768
Sit down, sit down.

602
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:05,565
Now we can talk.

603
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:10,270
You don't mind if I light one up,
do you?

604
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,362
Fuck, man.

605
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,910
I find it relaxes me.

606
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:19,737
What the fuck, man?

607
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,992
You know we got your boy, "G."
Right?

608
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,419
Man, I don't know no "G."

609
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:29,756
He knows you.

610
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:33,835
It's amazing how much you can get done

611
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:37,305
when you've got a simple purpose
guiding through life.

612
00:47:42,978 --> 00:47:45,388
My purpose is to find out

613
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,141
who shot up this apartment on Josephine.

614
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,269
I know the guy who was living there
was from Senegal.

615
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,313
I know he was selling heroin.

616
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,649
I know whose territory
he was stepping on.

617
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,903
And I know who went over to the apartment
to straighten him out.

618
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,832
I found out all that
in the past few days.

619
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:08,620
Where is "Big Fate," son?

620
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,289
I don't know no "Big Fate."

621
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,341
You see, I know that's not true.

622
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:17,045
'Cause everybody who comes from where you come,
knows who "Big Fate" is.

623
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:20,223
The fact that you're lying to me,
tells me you're hiding something.

624
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:24,177
You know my only reason for being here
is to find out who shot up the apartment.

625
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:27,221
I know that's what you're hiding.
See? It all,

626
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,768
all comes back
to that same simple purpose.

627
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:36,281
Man, I ain't telling you shit.

628
00:48:57,427 --> 00:48:58,427
Hey.

629
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:01,381
What's wrong?

630
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,592
Your father's mad at me 'cause I can't
take care of his <i>fucking</i> dog.

631
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,427
Why does he need you
to take care of it?

632
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,305
'Cause he's going back into AA.

633
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,017
He says he can't do
with any more responsibilities.

634
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,521
Besides that he,
he's gotta stop drinking.

635
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:20,400
I mean, ain't like
I don't wanna take care of it,

636
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,529
but I leave at 7:00 in the morning
to go to work!

637
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,156
Oh, let me talk to him.

638
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,493
I try to be a good wife to him, Terence.
I do. But you know,

639
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,754
I got a limit, too.

640
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:37,500
You know, he's got a drinking problem.
He says he's got a drinking problem.

641
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,336
He wants to so something about it.
That's good.

642
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:44,674
You know, he's been down this road before
and it didn't take.

643
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,811
He wants to try it again.
Good!

644
00:49:47,936 --> 00:49:52,557
But I, I say to him, why don't you
just take the beer the way that I do,

645
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,393
but he says he can't do that.

646
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,285
Hey, Pop.

647
00:49:57,445 --> 00:49:58,730
How are you doing?

648
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,815
I thought you said
the meeting was at seven.

649
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,192
I gotta get there early.
Set up the chairs.

650
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,255
I'll take you.

651
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:05,903
She can do it.

652
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,449
I came over to see you.
Let me take you for a ride, at least.

653
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:12,001
You feed the dog?

654
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:14,704
You feed the dog?

655
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,664
I can take care of him.

656
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,250
What are you talking about?

657
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,170
Genevieve told me a little
about what's going on.

658
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,380
I'll take the dog off your hands
for a while.

659
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,382
How are you gonna take care of a dog?

660
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:30,895
I got a friend. She just loves animals.
All of them. Dogs, too.

661
00:50:33,106 --> 00:50:34,906
Let's go.

662
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:45,118
Have a good time!

663
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:04,578
No. No!

664
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,267
Fuck you. Fuck you.

665
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:15,857
Did we not discuss this on the phone?

666
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:20,978
How come you only call me
when you need something?

667
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,605
You're fucked up, aren't you?

668
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,066
What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fucked up.

669
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,567
What are you doing?

670
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,778
I'm going to work.
I have to go to Biloxy tonight.

671
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,613
Go to the hotel casino.

672
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,282
How are you gonna take care of the dog
if you're fucked up

673
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,159
<i>and you're going to Biloxy?</i>

674
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,120
All right. The doorman's
gonna walk him in the morning

675
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,540
and I get back in the afternoon.

676
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,093
<i>Oh, he's sweet.
What's his name?</i>

677
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:47,472
I don't know.

678
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,716
You don't know his name?

679
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,176
<i>I'll ask my father.</i>

680
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,803
You are unbelievable.

681
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,555
<i>I gotta get going.</i>

682
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:58,307
Unbelievable.
You don't know.

683
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,401
Baby, be nice to me.

684
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:06,824
He smells.
You need a bath.

685
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,236
Try to understand. It doesn't matter
that you were just along for the ride.

686
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,747
It doesn't matter that
you didn't actually shoot anybody.

687
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:15,825
You're playing the prices now.
The price of "Big Fate" getting off,

688
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:19,662
it's gonna help the DA convict <i>you</i>
and your boy <i>"G."</i>

689
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,498
I guarantee you that's just
what he's gonna do.

690
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,333
Why don't you smoke, man?

691
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,835
What are you talking about?

692
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,671
I gotta listen all this bullshit.

693
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,089
Break out to smoke, man.

694
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,716
Flipping out on us?

695
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,677
No, man. Your <i>partner</i> lit up
a motherfucker blunt

696
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,345
before he put the cuffs on me.

697
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,140
I love this guy.

698
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,767
You say I smoked marijuana
in your presence? Huh?

699
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,769
Cannabis?
Is that what you're saying?

700
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,188
Right. Your word against mine,

701
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,941
so they fuck won't believe me, right?

702
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,194
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

703
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,622
Lieutenant, can you step out for a moment?

704
00:53:12,432 --> 00:53:15,176
My name is Eugene Gratz, Lieutenant.

705
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:19,555
I'm an attorney.
This is my client Donald Godshaw.

706
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:23,476
I understand you've been looking for him.

707
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,904
<i>How can I help you?</i>

708
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:43,204
I just wanna talk
to these guys for a second.

709
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,381
Why don't you wait there?

710
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,135
Gentlemen.

711
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:55,132
Can I get you a glass of water?

712
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,093
Um, no, thanks.

713
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:01,973
I gotta turn over the names of my witnesses
to Godshaw's lawyer.

714
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,518
As soon as I do that,
Godshaw will look to scare the kid.

715
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,145
He can't scare him,
he'll kill him.

716
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,480
He'll never get to him.

717
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,273
Since Godshaw turned himself in,

718
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,360
I've authorized 24-hour protection
to start immediately.

719
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,029
Just remember, we have no prints,

720
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,532
no DNA, no weapon.

721
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,868
We lose the kid,
we lose the case.

722
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,129
Understood?

723
00:54:33,221 --> 00:54:36,549
He's a nice dog.
I just can't keep him.

724
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:39,218
She said she'd be back
at 1:00 this afternoon.

725
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,804
I'm off at 4:00,
and I got another job I gotta be at.

726
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,389
She didn't call?

727
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,227
No. And the night guy
ain't gonna go walk him.

728
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:48,060
I can't leave the animal in her apartment.
It might do damage.

729
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,562
How did you get my number?

730
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,690
Miss Frankie gave it to me
in case of emergencies.

731
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,867
Emergencies?

732
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:02,283
<i>This is what I'm talking about.
Doesn't pick up the phone.</i>

733
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:08,089
She isn't where she's supposed to be.
Not showing up.

734
00:55:08,214 --> 00:55:12,501
Terence, think they're gonna put me
on the witness stand by May 15?

735
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,378
Don't know, why?

736
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,598
So my mom goes for the parole board.

737
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:22,770
I'm sure we can get people
to put in a good word for her.

738
00:55:24,605 --> 00:55:25,805
Hello?

739
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:28,442
Where are you?

740
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,022
I'm about an hour from there.

741
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,982
I'm on my way.

742
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,027
Frankie, I'm on my way.

743
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,371
You ever been to Biloxy?

744
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:37,419
Now, you stand there.

745
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,046
Don't move.

746
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,849
I'll be back in five minutes.

747
00:56:43,684 --> 00:56:44,684
Baby.

748
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,804
Hi, baby.
What are you doing?

749
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,930
You all right?

750
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,022
Yeah.

751
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:52,893
You okay?

752
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:53,985
Yeah.

753
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,733
Who did it?

754
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,778
Do you have anything for me?

755
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,363
Some coke.

756
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,781
That's it?

757
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,449
And Vicodin.

758
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,418
I'll take both.

759
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:16,008
What the fuck is going on in here?

760
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,090
Who's this?

761
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,925
Hey, hey, hey!

762
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,302
Take it easy.

763
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,803
<i>Just get my money.</i>

764
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,597
What are you, jealous boyfriend?

765
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,015
Just get me my money.

766
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,683
I'm using to paying when I'm done.

767
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,727
Done smacking her around?

768
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:37,113
It was erotic shit, man.
I didn't hurt her.

769
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:39,398
Didn't that hurt?

770
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,941
Did I hurt you?

771
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,234
Terence, let's just go.

772
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,653
We don't hit women down south.

773
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,156
You just made a big mistake.

774
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:50,326
My father is Andy Winnick,
you ever hear of him?

775
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,828
One of the biggest developers
in the gulf coast.

776
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,163
Congratulations.

777
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,132
Tommy Leonardi is one
of his best friends.

778
00:57:56,257 --> 00:58:00,344
Listen, scumbag. Don't try to impress me with
your-father-knows-some-guinea hood.

779
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:04,515
What you gotta take away from this experience
is that if you ever see that girl again,

780
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,010
you turn around and you walk in the
opposite direction. You got that?

781
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,094
Yeah, man.

782
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,055
So much looking at that girl,

783
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:14,016
you're gonna wish you
were born without a dick.

784
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:19,271
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, whoa.

785
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:22,858
Whoa. Big mistake.

786
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,750
Oh, yeah.

787
00:58:25,286 --> 00:58:27,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

788
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,272
Big mistake.

789
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:41,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

790
00:58:43,304 --> 00:58:44,304
Whoa.

791
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:49,608
Oh, yeah.

792
00:58:53,272 --> 00:58:57,059
Daryl, this is Frankie.
Frankie, Daryl.

793
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,151
Hi, Daryl.

794
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:01,653
<i>Hi.</i>

795
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,873
I gotta go talk to someone.

796
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,669
You go ahead and take Frankie
to the coffee shop.

797
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,422
And you stay with her.
You can do that, right?

798
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:27,514
Yeah.

799
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,216
Do you have to do that now?

800
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,185
I'll be with you in a minute.

801
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:35,022
Let's go?
Take care of me.

802
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:42,438
How'd Louisiana go off that?

803
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:44,273
Three-point underdogs.

804
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,692
Three-point underdogs.
What are they losing by?

805
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:47,984
Eight.

806
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:49,987
Eight? What the fuck is that?

807
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,081
There's still two minutes left to play.

808
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,535
Louisiana ain't got this passing game.

809
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,953
Good point.

810
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:01,165
You wanna get my picks
for the Pac-10?

811
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,342
Do I look like I wanna hear 'em?

812
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:20,476
Where is the kid?

813
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,070
He went to the bathroom.

814
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:05,020
Hi. Are there any other bathrooms
beside that one?

815
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,281
Yeah, on the other side.

816
01:01:16,165 --> 01:01:20,869
<i>Hey, man, insert more coins.</i>

817
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,963
<i>Insert more coins.</i>

818
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:25,966
<i>Insert more coins.</i>

819
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:32,973
<i>Insert more coins.
Play again.</i>

820
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,852
<i>Insert more coins.</i>

821
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:42,274
<i>Insert more coins.</i>

822
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,437
What's going on?

823
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,188
What did he say when he left?

824
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,616
He asked me if I'd be okay
waiting here by myself.

825
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:53,461
I said yeah. He said he had to go
to the bathroom. What is going on?

826
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,154
He's a witness to a homicide.

827
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,238
To what?

828
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,781
To five homicides.
Let's go.

829
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:58,907
Where are we going?

830
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,501
To find him.

831
01:03:26,754 --> 01:03:28,455
Where is he?

832
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,582
Binnie, call security.

833
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,793
Nobody's calling anybody.

834
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,419
Where's your grandson, Binnie?

835
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,097
I don't have to tell you anything.

836
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,345
Yeah, you do.

837
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:47,015
I haven't done anything.
My grandson hasn't done anything.

838
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:50,644
If he doesn't wanna be a witness,
he doesn't have to be a witness.

839
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,355
<i>This is bigger than one, two.</i>

840
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,357
This was a massacre.

841
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,700
Children

842
01:03:58,285 --> 01:04:00,195
were executed.

843
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,290
Maybe you should've thought
of that before.

844
01:04:07,002 --> 01:04:09,746
I need to know where he is.

845
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,802
Young man, I would like to know
the name of your superior.

846
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:21,216
Right now I'm working on
about an hour and a half sleep

847
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,302
over the past three days.

848
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:28,023
And I'm still trying
to remain courteous.

849
01:04:28,148 --> 01:04:33,070
And I'm beginning to think that that's
getting in the way of my being effective.

850
01:04:41,412 --> 01:04:43,414
What are you doing?

851
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:50,212
What-- what are you doing?

852
01:04:51,296 --> 01:04:52,915
I wanna know

853
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:55,250
where Daryl is.

854
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,668
My God.

855
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,421
Nobody saw me come in.
Nobody knows I'm here.

856
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,590
This old woman's gonna run out of air,

857
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,260
and you're gonna have a tough time
convincing people that it wasn't <i>you</i>

858
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,098
who did it to her. And even if,
and even if you do convince them

859
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:13,310
that <i>you</i> didn't kill her on purpose,

860
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,271
you're still gonna have a tough time
selling them that <i>you</i>

861
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,441
took care of her with a fuck!

862
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,109
Now, listen to me.

863
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,954
Where the fuck is he?

864
01:05:25,706 --> 01:05:27,282
I said where the fuck is he?

865
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,951
He's on an airplane.

866
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,537
Miss Antoinette bought him a ticket

867
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:36,300
and send him to live
with her family in England.

868
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:44,299
All right, it's okay. That's okay.
That's a good girl. Suck it up.

869
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,636
There you go. That's it. Take it in.
That's a good girl. Take it in.

870
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,928
Good! Good.

871
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:51,731
Good.

872
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:54,476
That's it. Breathe.

873
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,145
Maybe you should drop dead,
you selfish cunt.

874
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:01,492
You ever think about your kids
or your grandkids? Huh?

875
01:06:01,617 --> 01:06:05,696
Sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked oxygen tube?

876
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:08,332
And Binnie's fucked intensive care?

877
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,044
You fucks, I hate you.
I hate you both.

878
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,331
I should, I should fucking both,
right now,

879
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,926
I should fucking kill you fucking both.

880
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:24,765
You're the fucking reason
this country's going down the drain.

881
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:44,535
Watch out.
He's not in a good mood.

882
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:48,786
<i>Come in.</i>

883
01:06:50,415 --> 01:06:52,451
Have a seat.

884
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:55,337
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.

885
01:06:55,462 --> 01:06:59,291
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard will hold him.

886
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:02,544
Can't do that.
He had no involvement with the crime.

887
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,880
He don't want testify,
we can't compel him.

888
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,215
Well, we could still try
flipping one of the three.

889
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:09,092
<i>You can try all what you want.</i>

890
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:12,220
Nobody flipping on Godshaw.
They're scared to death of him.

891
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,390
As of now,
all are persons of interest.

892
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,017
You gotta let him go.

893
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:19,978
Oh, come on! Five homicides
and you're letting him go?

894
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,731
You weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.

895
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,399
<i>Be glad he didn't turn out dead.</i>

896
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,441
This is bullshit.

897
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,693
Get the hell outta here.

898
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,361
You're not the one on the street--

899
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,155
Get out of my office.

900
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,075
Risking our lives on the street!

901
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:36,295
<i>You know what's involved, right?</i>

902
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:41,884
Maybe if we get a prosecutor worry about
something, we could stand a fucking chance.

903
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:55,013
<i>What happened when you went
to see the grandmother?</i>

904
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,149
<i>I told you.</i>

905
01:07:57,274 --> 01:08:01,103
She said the woman she takes care of, bought
a plane ticket. He was on his way to England

906
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,646
to stay with her relatives.

907
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,439
Any incidents took place over there?

908
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,502
What kind of incidents?

909
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:06,321
Any kind.

910
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:07,167
No.

911
01:08:10,245 --> 01:08:14,407
Whatever it is,
you're gonna have your story down.

912
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,160
Public Integrity is waiting for you
back at the house.

913
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,329
Oh, come on.
Public Integrity into this?

914
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,914
What for?

915
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:25,552
That old woman,
her son is a United States congressman.

916
01:08:29,765 --> 01:08:31,508
I asked where Daryl was.

917
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,761
His grandmother told me.

918
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:39,641
You didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?

919
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,533
No, I did not.

920
01:08:43,612 --> 01:08:46,898
You didn't, at any time,
threaten Antoinette Fahringer?

921
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,733
No, I did not.

922
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:52,654
You should know a formal complaint's
been filed alleging you cut off

923
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,323
Mrs. Fahringer's oxygen supply.

924
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,493
Who's saying that?
Mrs. Fahringer?

925
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,120
Is it true?

926
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,873
I think she might be suffering
from a little dementia.

927
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,250
Lieutenant, we're asking if it's true.

928
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,262
Absolutely not.

929
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:17,604
Lieutenant.

930
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:23,351
You know, I saw five of those
driving into work this morning.

931
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,571
I want you to clean it up.
Clean it up.

932
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:31,693
Ned, excellent. You got my message.
Good. Come on.

933
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:32,986
What message?

934
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,863
You get the flowers I sent?
How's Jenny?

935
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,823
What the fuck are you talking about?

936
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,366
Okay, that's good.

937
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,492
Stop it!
Cut it out.

938
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,785
What are you doing here?

939
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,370
What do you think?

940
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,997
I don't have anything for you.

941
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,373
Then this is a problem.

942
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,083
Yeah, who needs a problem?

943
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,587
You owe me five large, Terence.

944
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,213
I haven't got it.

945
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,466
Then, you gotta give me something.

946
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:58,595
Give me goods if you don't have cash.
Give me a gold Rolex.

947
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,889
Ned, I look like I got a gold Rolex?

948
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,558
Don't pine me for a fucking stooge.

949
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,894
Keep your voice down.
Just keep it down.

950
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:09,564
Don't play me for a fucking stooge.

951
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,274
Are you done?

952
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,819
Do you think these guys care you're a cop?
They will fuck you up

953
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,738
just like everybody else.

954
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:18,865
Let me get something down
with the Texas game.

955
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,117
'Cause that's where the season
turns a lot.

956
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,209
No.

957
01:10:23,378 --> 01:10:28,342
Nothing.
You pay what the fuck you owe.

958
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:35,924
I'm a little late on my rent,
that's all.

959
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:39,017
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

960
01:10:39,117 --> 01:10:43,023
Uh, somebody named Frankie called.

961
01:11:10,092 --> 01:11:11,376
What's going on?

962
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,921
All kinds of things.
Come closer. I'm Dave.

963
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,131
Who are you?

964
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:17,223
Andy.

965
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:18,349
Jeff.

966
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:20,385
<i>What do you want?</i>

967
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,472
<i>What I want right now
is to get this behind position right.</i>

968
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,849
He wants money.

969
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,600
Who are you?

970
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,313
Sit down.
I told you, I'm Dave.

971
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:35,358
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

972
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,412
You make a date with a pretty girl.
You gotta pay.

973
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:43,116
Dear. Like this.

974
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:48,964
You want the schwantz, not the prosty.
See? That's it.

975
01:11:49,089 --> 01:11:53,001
When you engage with another human being,
we remind ourselves we're not alone.

976
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,920
Plus, who knows,
maybe we even learn a little something.

977
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,630
How much?

978
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,759
You took 10 off. To make it right,
you gotta come up with 50.

979
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,343
No, that's bullshit.

980
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,763
No, it's punitive damages.
What can I tell you?

981
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,015
I don't get it.
She kept up with the bargain.

982
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,641
He says no.

983
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,353
He's a fucking liar.
I did everything he asked me to do.

984
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,146
Which was what?

985
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,607
<i>You want details?</i>

986
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,859
You sick people.

987
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:22,155
Oh, listen to her stand up for herself.
The indignation.

988
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,656
I love it.

989
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,075
Where's the money?

990
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,167
In my bag.

991
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,415
It's all here?

992
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,794
Okay. Here are five thousand.

993
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:37,462
There's ten in change here.

994
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,806
Why don't I give you this,
call a day.

995
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:44,969
We could do that. Alternatively,
I could tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

996
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,106
Do you want me to shoot
the fucking dog?

997
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:53,228
Or put my calling card
on this gorgeous punum here.

998
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,155
I don't give a shit about the dog.

999
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,608
But you mark her up, I'm gonna have
a tough time getting you your money.

1000
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,360
<i>By my money you mean $50,000.</i>

1001
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,736
I'll need a couple of days.

1002
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,571
By a couple you mean two.

1003
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:04,663
Yeah.

1004
01:13:04,956 --> 01:13:05,956
Good.

1005
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,405
<i>Hey.</i>

1006
01:13:08,505 --> 01:13:10,712
<i>I know. Relax.</i>

1007
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:14,499
The boys wanna saddle her up
just in the spirit of friendliness.

1008
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,084
<i>You mind?</i>

1009
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:19,254
Well, let her get cleaned up,
put on something hot.

1010
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:21,256
She looks like shit right now.

1011
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,507
Beautiful.

1012
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,476
What are you waiting for?

1013
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:29,305
I don't wanna put
any pressure on you,

1014
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,225
but she has a client
coming over in 15 minutes.

1015
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,977
You boys can be done by then, right?

1016
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,854
The both of us?

1017
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:38,982
<i>They'd had been done in 15 seconds
you hadn't mentioned it.</i>

1018
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,358
My mistake.

1019
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,444
You'll hit her when we come back.

1020
01:13:42,544 --> 01:13:45,113
Two days, same time,
same station, yes?

1021
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,115
Okay.
You got it, baby.

1022
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,876
Don't make me look for you, Terence.

1023
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:24,995
<i>They're gone.</i>

1024
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:31,034
I'm gonna take you
to my father's house.

1025
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:33,670
Buy some time at least.

1026
01:14:35,422 --> 01:14:37,022
Frankie.

1027
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,176
They're gone.

1028
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,511
I can't take her.

1029
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:53,056
I just need a place where
she can stay for a couple of days.

1030
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,475
Why can't you put her
up in your place?

1031
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:59,020
I can't take a chance these guys
find out where I live, Dad.

1032
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,512
Christ!

1033
01:15:02,115 --> 01:15:04,817
They gave me the job
of bringing cookies to a meeting.

1034
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,028
It takes me half a day to get it done.

1035
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,280
You want me to baby-sit a pros?

1036
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,115
You don't have to baby-sit her.

1037
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,243
She's very self-suficient.

1038
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:18,206
Well, I'm not in any kind of shape
to take on something like this.

1039
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:20,667
Look, I get home from one meeting.

1040
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:24,921
I lie on the couch and I wait
till it's time for the next meeting.

1041
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,131
That's all I can do right now.

1042
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,384
Let your wife deal with her.

1043
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,803
They'll get along like sisters.

1044
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:34,397
<i>Get away from me, you rag.</i>

1045
01:15:36,858 --> 01:15:40,645
My husband is trying to quit drinking
and you bring this shit into our house?

1046
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:43,982
Give it back or I'll swear to God
I will stab you in the heart.

1047
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:46,359
I will stab you in the heart.

1048
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,611
What kind of trash
you're bringing in here?

1049
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,447
She's going through my bag!
My personal shit!

1050
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,949
Everybody calm down.

1051
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,742
It's hard enough for your father.

1052
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,495
He's gotta put up with narcotics
under his nose.

1053
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:02,041
<i>Oh, God. It can't be any worse than
you being shit face on beer all the time.</i>

1054
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,526
<i>Enough!</i>

1055
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:06,671
You tell her
I'm shit face all the time?

1056
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,173
<i>Oh, it's pretty fucking obvious, lady!</i>

1057
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,260
<i>Oh, yeah?
You fucking whore.</i>

1058
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,972
Watch this. Come get it.
Come fucking get it.

1059
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,600
Get her outta here.
I can't deal with this shit.

1060
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,202
<i>You cunt.</i>

1061
01:16:22,302 --> 01:16:23,187
Hey, the neighbors!

1062
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,189
<i>You're a cunt, you whore.</i>

1063
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,692
I'll fuck you up.

1064
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,945
We come in or you come out?

1065
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,948
Alright, come on, let's go.

1066
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:37,618
So, uh, Francesca Donnenfeld.
Do you know her?

1067
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,955
Just cut the bullshit, Yasco,
and tell me what you're here for.

1068
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,790
I'm Yasco.

1069
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,127
Here's the thing, tough guy.
You keep fucking with the wrong people.

1070
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:49,139
First the old lady,
now your prostitute friend's customer.

1071
01:16:49,264 --> 01:16:53,217
The old lady, you might've written out.
She, uh, doesn't remember so good.

1072
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,846
The colored nurse,
she's covering for the grandson, whatever.

1073
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,724
But why I get a call
from the chief D's office

1074
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,810
that you've shaken down
your pros friend's customer

1075
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:07,815
whose father's hung all the way from here
to fucking City Hall.

1076
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:10,109
You're done, Lieutenant.

1077
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,694
What do you want?

1078
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,913
Your gun, for starters.

1079
01:17:15,415 --> 01:17:16,666
Come on.

1080
01:17:24,174 --> 01:17:25,833
Until the outcome of the hearing,

1081
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,002
you're on modify duty.

1082
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,598
Better call your delegate.
You got an ass kicking coming.

1083
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:35,727
You have a good day, Lieutenant.

1084
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:51,526
A man without a gun is not a man.

1085
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,612
Oh, well, I know.
Look, you cut the best deal you can

1086
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:58,241
and you get the hell out of the Police Department.
'Cause if you stay in,

1087
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,243
it's gonna get worse.

1088
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,620
Can I talk to you for a second?

1089
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,833
I can't stay here.
I didn't take this shit from my own mother

1090
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,668
and I'm not gonna
take it from <i>her.</i>

1091
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:12,680
Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

1092
01:18:12,805 --> 01:18:16,759
Just give her a day or two.
She's gonna calm down, I promise.

1093
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,304
I'm so, I'm so happy you're here.

1094
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:24,267
And I got something else somewhere.
I'll show you.

1095
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:27,111
She's really mean.

1096
01:18:45,338 --> 01:18:47,549
I wanna show you this place.

1097
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:51,836
I spent a lot of time here

1098
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,172
when I was a boy.

1099
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,090
That doesn't work anymore.

1100
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,018
I was here alone a lot.

1101
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:04,140
This was my special place

1102
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,817
as a child.

1103
01:19:07,068 --> 01:19:09,868
My, my castle.

1104
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:14,775
And I would imagine things here.
Pirates, a buried treasure.

1105
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:19,822
And my dad didn't like that so much,
but my mom, she, she got it.

1106
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,784
And, uh, and before she died,

1107
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:26,829
she bought me a metal detector.
Come on, let me show you something.

1108
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,290
Look at that.
Right out there,

1109
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:34,304
I thought that pirates
came up the Mississippi

1110
01:19:34,429 --> 01:19:39,175
and that they buried a treasure right there
by that tree next to the house.

1111
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,804
So I, I took the metal detector
my mom gave me

1112
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:45,473
and I went out there
waiting it would start beeping.

1113
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,142
It was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.

1114
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,854
And I started digging, and I--
I-- I dug and I dug and I dug,

1115
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:57,652
and I found a, a Sterling
silver spoon, and I was so happy.

1116
01:19:57,752 --> 01:20:01,113
I started screaming
and jumping and laughing.

1117
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,824
And I went,
"Hey, man, this is treasure.

1118
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:07,754
This is pirate treasure."
And I came back in here with it.

1119
01:20:09,255 --> 01:20:12,667
And I hid it somewhere,
this Sterling silver spoon.

1120
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,802
I still can't find it.

1121
01:20:15,929 --> 01:20:17,764
It could be anywhere.

1122
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:22,018
I-- I know it's here.

1123
01:20:33,613 --> 01:20:35,815
<i>I don't know
what to tell you, Terence.</i>

1124
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,984
Not a lot I can do
under the circumstances.

1125
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:39,476
I know.

1126
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:46,534
I tell you guys all the time, you cannot
get away with that cowboy shit anymore.

1127
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:50,546
You don't listen,
now this is where were at.

1128
01:20:50,672 --> 01:20:54,509
My best fucking detective,
I gotta put him in the property room.

1129
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:24,238
Terence, come on.

1130
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,999
Man, I-- I don't wanna you get
jammed off for all of this.

1131
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:31,370
You're doing all this wrong shit and I'm here.
They're gonna think I'm doing it, too.

1132
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,049
So, go to the store warehouse
in Metairie, that way you're not here.

1133
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:39,220
And while you're there, get me my .45 Magnum
and bring it to me. Okay?

1134
01:21:45,518 --> 01:21:46,518
Hey.

1135
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:49,597
You're working here?

1136
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:52,058
Looks like.
What you got there?

1137
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,895
Nine, ten grams of heroin
and a Glock nine.

1138
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:59,315
Yeah. You see that scale over there?

1139
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,950
It's broken.

1140
01:22:01,868 --> 01:22:04,028
See? useless.

1141
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,905
I sent for a new one.

1142
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,991
As soon as it gets here,
I'll weigh the drugs

1143
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,952
and I'll get you your voucher, okay?

1144
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,420
All right, bye-bye.

1145
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:23,806
<i>Can I help you, sir?
Can I help you, sir?</i>

1146
01:22:29,395 --> 01:22:31,222
Can I talk to you a minute?

1147
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,640
Excuse me?

1148
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,359
Mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.

1149
01:22:37,195 --> 01:22:39,989
You interrupted my meal.

1150
01:22:40,114 --> 01:22:43,985
I'm gonna pretend to be polite,
so you look a big man in front of your friends.

1151
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:46,612
You give me a hard time,
I'll put the cuffs on you

1152
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,956
just like any other shitbird.

1153
01:22:51,793 --> 01:22:53,077
I'll be back.

1154
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,203
<i>You a'ight?</i>

1155
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,830
Motherfucker wanna talk to me.

1156
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,666
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you, motherfucker?

1157
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,760
Why would I do that?

1158
01:23:07,934 --> 01:23:10,344
I got something for you
I think you're gonna like.

1159
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:11,813
Let's take a walk.

1160
01:23:21,072 --> 01:23:23,533
Be crazy for coming down here.

1161
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:29,030
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make some money the old fashion way

1162
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,240
with a cop protecting you.

1163
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,825
What I need protection from?

1164
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,368
The cops.

1165
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:38,539
A cop will protect me from cops?

1166
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,208
You'll know when a supplier
is under surveillance.

1167
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:44,295
You'll know when it's safe
to make a pick up, when it's not.

1168
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:45,671
What I gotta give you?

1169
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,548
Fifteen thousand a shipment.

1170
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,809
Oh, I'm sorry, am I being unfair?

1171
01:23:51,143 --> 01:23:53,262
How I know you ain't looking
to set me up?

1172
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,557
Tomorrow I'll bring you some information.
Small shit.

1173
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:59,402
You decide if you wanna go
to the next step.

1174
01:24:01,362 --> 01:24:04,899
What about the murders?
You don't give the fuck about them no more?

1175
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,194
Look at me.
Now look at you.

1176
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,996
I never did.

1177
01:24:44,405 --> 01:24:47,024
<i>Hey, I got the weight
on that dope finally.</i>

1178
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:48,492
Thanks.

1179
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:54,365
That's all there was?

1180
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:56,834
I'll double check it if you want.

1181
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,582
Don't matter.
Still got enough for felony.

1182
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,709
What are you guys got going on today?

1183
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:09,713
Buying bust on Fourth
and Ferret on Andre's outfit.

1184
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,891
Happy hunting.

1185
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:28,065
Undercover just busted one on Andre's.
Fourth and Ferret.

1186
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,901
What do you know?

1187
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,162
Man of your word.

1188
01:25:34,372 --> 01:25:36,657
Are you running me back to my car?

1189
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:41,120
Yeah. I need to make a stop first.
Is that all right?

1190
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,212
Yes.

1191
01:26:02,191 --> 01:26:05,811
<i>This, this is prime real estate.</i>

1192
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,771
Doesn't look prime.

1193
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,066
See, that's the point.
Now is the time to get in.

1194
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,362
Two, three years from now,
all this we'll be river front condos.

1195
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,364
Marble floors, health spas.

1196
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,200
By that time, another motherfucker
made all the money.

1197
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,870
Don't be going legit on me now, "Big."

1198
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,705
Money's money.

1199
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,958
Tell you what.
You'll be the front man,

1200
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,928
I'll be the power behind the throne.

1201
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,641
It's like we're working
for a greater good.

1202
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:38,761
Yeah, you're right.

1203
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,930
This is a good spot
to build condominiums.

1204
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:44,650
See? I know I likes you, man.
Come on.

1205
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,083
May I ask you to step out
of the vehicle?

1206
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,418
What'd I do?

1207
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,461
You bought dope.
I watched you buy dope.

1208
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,555
Now stand the fuck up.

1209
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,678
Put your hands on the car.

1210
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,689
I didn't--
I didn't buy nothing, man.

1211
01:28:07,233 --> 01:28:09,351
No? What's this?

1212
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:10,644
Officer, please, let--

1213
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:11,979
Please what?

1214
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:14,314
I don't know how
that shit got in there.

1215
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,482
Did I put it there?

1216
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:16,900
No, sir.

1217
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,045
Just some freaking currants?

1218
01:28:18,145 --> 01:28:19,877
Yes, sir.

1219
01:28:20,538 --> 01:28:22,448
That's what you tell the judge, then.

1220
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:25,743
Maybe you'll get lucky
and he will be a football fan.

1221
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:27,244
You know who I am?

1222
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,329
Oh, I know who you are.

1223
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:31,457
Then why you wanna
fuck my life up for?

1224
01:28:31,557 --> 01:28:34,251
That's gonna knock me
out the draft.

1225
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:37,087
I'm sure you'll get a contract
of some kind eventually.

1226
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,557
You run the 40 and what?
What's that, four-three?

1227
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:42,718
Why do you do this to me?

1228
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,721
For some motherfucking marijuana, man.

1229
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,182
I was gonna by my mama house.

1230
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:52,153
<i>So, you're going off
for six points favorites against Texas.</i>

1231
01:28:52,278 --> 01:28:57,575
You win by five or less or you lose altogether,
none of this ever happened.

1232
01:28:58,742 --> 01:29:00,369
Sir, I can't do that.

1233
01:29:00,494 --> 01:29:03,781
A fumble, a missed blocking assignment.
You can absolutely do it.

1234
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:06,533
Sir, please.
Please, don't make me do that.

1235
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,369
Listen to me, Renaldo.

1236
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:11,505
I dumped a lot of money this year
on <i>you.</i>

1237
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:15,292
I got the chance to get some of that back,
I wanna take advantage of it.

1238
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:18,846
You're gonna tell me the integrity
of the game is too much to you, fine.

1239
01:29:18,971 --> 01:29:22,174
I wouldn't dream of trying to convince you
to go against your conscience.

1240
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:25,719
Turn around.
I'm placing you under arrest.

1241
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:29,648
You-- you won't tell nobody.

1242
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:34,778
You ain't gonna tell nobody?

1243
01:30:12,858 --> 01:30:16,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This that Taliban shit.
That's what's this is.

1244
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:19,982
That shit Osama give a motherfucker
before they blow themselves up.

1245
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:22,192
That's money.
Money.

1246
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,884
Shut up!

1247
01:30:25,538 --> 01:30:27,281
Where's the 15,000?

1248
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,783
You'll get it, man.
Relax.

1249
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:34,746
Did I not do what I said
I was going to do?

1250
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:38,333
Yeah, man.
Relax.

1251
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,971
Tell me again to relax.

1252
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:46,559
I'm not looking to beat you, man.

1253
01:30:47,726 --> 01:30:49,386
Where's my money?

1254
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:50,596
I'll get your money.

1255
01:30:50,696 --> 01:30:51,659
When?

1256
01:30:51,759 --> 01:30:52,723
Tomorrow.

1257
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,015
Where?

1258
01:30:54,233 --> 01:30:55,734
My place.

1259
01:30:56,902 --> 01:30:59,104
Give me a cut of the uncut dope.

1260
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:01,482
Look, I'm gonna pay you in money.

1261
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:02,983
This is interest.

1262
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,568
That's bullshit, man.

1263
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,445
What's that, little man?

1264
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,823
Midge, chill out.

1265
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:10,915
Here.

1266
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:16,922
Now, put that gun away
before you kill somebody.

1267
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:20,217
I'll kill all of you.

1268
01:31:21,885 --> 01:31:24,054
To the break of dawn.

1269
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:32,688
To the break of dawn, baby.

1270
01:31:36,233 --> 01:31:41,480
<i>Wassup, wassup, wassup,
wassup, motherfucker?</i>

1271
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,899
No fucking bets, Terence.

1272
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,692
What's the matter?
You don't like me?

1273
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,862
You don't pay your debts.
I don't wanna know you. I can't afford it.

1274
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,531
Ten grand!
Five I owe.

1275
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:56,328
Yeah? Five for Louisiana.
Right there. Wassup?

1276
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:57,704
Where did you get this?

1277
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,207
What, are you my priest?
Right there, here.

1278
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:01,708
You got it.

1279
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:03,293
It's a six-point spread.

1280
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:04,985
No shit.

1281
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:13,077
Frankie?

1282
01:32:19,902 --> 01:32:21,403
Frankie!

1283
01:32:30,537 --> 01:32:31,537
Hey.

1284
01:32:32,206 --> 01:32:33,907
I got something for you.

1285
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:35,867
I need to get my clothes.

1286
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:39,421
Don't worry about your clothes right now.
This is uncut dope.

1287
01:32:39,546 --> 01:32:43,384
Just a bunch of stuff from my closet
and then from my dresser by the bed.

1288
01:32:43,509 --> 01:32:47,671
I'm not gonna give you much until we know
how strong it is 'cause it's pure, you know?

1289
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:50,173
Baby, I've been talking
to your father a lot

1290
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,810
and I think I'm gonna go
to a meeting with him.

1291
01:32:55,813 --> 01:32:59,683
What does that mean?
You don't want any?

1292
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:03,770
I mean, of course I want some but I,
maybe when I get back.

1293
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:07,449
<i>Frankie. Frankie, we gotta go.</i>

1294
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:10,850
Okay? Right.

1295
01:34:10,137 --> 01:34:11,430
Thank you.

1296
01:34:33,285 --> 01:34:35,362
This the way to do business.

1297
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:39,866
This, this way I ain't gotta worry
about what I'm walking into.

1298
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:41,958
I got you.

1299
01:34:43,504 --> 01:34:45,506
Yeah, let me hit that shit.

1300
01:34:53,013 --> 01:34:55,413
<i>Yeah.</i>

1301
01:35:01,522 --> 01:35:03,273
You hitting this shit?

1302
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:09,321
Hey, Midget,
light the Caucasian's rock.

1303
01:35:16,995 --> 01:35:20,240
You're my kind of
motherfucking cop, man.

1304
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,492
You're a crazy, motherfucker.

1305
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,670
What did that Ki run you.

1306
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:26,872
What do you care?

1307
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,248
I'm guessing 60,000.

1308
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:29,416
Very good guess.

1309
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,460
Will you shut the fuck up?

1310
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,297
You owe me 15 thousand.
I'll take 25% of the dope uncut.

1311
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,174
That means you're getting my price.

1312
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,726
It's one way of looking at it.

1313
01:35:39,851 --> 01:35:44,481
The other is, you get to keep 75% and not
go to prison for the rest of your life.

1314
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:51,612
Yeah.

1315
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:53,607
Go ahead.

1316
01:35:53,707 --> 01:35:56,193
<i>Make sure you cut that shit
before you sell it,</i>

1317
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:58,528
unless you wanna kill
the motherfucker who buys it.

1318
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,989
Did I ever tell you the story
about nigger Elk?

1319
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,949
I was watching TV, the game, right?

1320
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:06,077
Reynaldo Hayes. He got tossed the ball.
He was running with it.

1321
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,371
He jumped over three linebackers in midair.

1322
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,625
He sprouted antlers like a gazelle.

1323
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,168
Like an elk.

1324
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:14,961
He landed again.
He ran, ran, ran.

1325
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:16,305
He scored a touchdown!

1326
01:36:19,057 --> 01:36:20,759
<i>Crack talking.</i>

1327
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:24,054
Listen, I'm not worried about you,
so don't be concerned about me.

1328
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:28,642
'Cause I'm not concerned if you're not concerned.
I'm not really concerned.

1329
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,519
<i>I'm worried 'cause
if you drop dead,</i>

1330
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,896
I'm the motherfucker
they come looking for.

1331
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:35,690
And then I gotta end up
having a nigger from <i>Africa</i>

1332
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,442
trying to move in on my shit.

1333
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:40,821
And I don't wanna shoot no more
purple ass niggers from Africa.

1334
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:44,249
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
'Cause I'm not Eazy-E.

1335
01:36:46,126 --> 01:36:47,661
Fucking god.

1336
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:51,414
<i>Hey. Hey.
I need to go to the store.</i>

1337
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,061
<i>So?</i>

1338
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:54,084
So I need you to watch him.

1339
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:55,794
<i>Fuck, no, I can't watch him.</i>

1340
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:58,221
Don't be yelling.
There ain't nothin' to eat.

1341
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:01,007
Get the fuck outta here!

1342
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,759
Get the fuck outta here!

1343
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:05,604
<i>Hit me again
with another one on them rocks.</i>

1344
01:37:08,065 --> 01:37:09,858
<i>What the fuck's that?</i>

1345
01:37:11,234 --> 01:37:13,937
It's my lucky crack pipe.

1346
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:15,689
<i>You crazy motherfucker.</i>

1347
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:17,857
You don't have a lucky crack pipe?

1348
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,403
<i>No, I don't have a lucky
motherfucking crack pipe.</i>

1349
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:24,197
Then, Donald,
you're gonna take a hit of mine.

1350
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,324
Why I gotta do that?

1351
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,293
'Cause it's lucky.

1352
01:37:30,671 --> 01:37:31,671
Shit.

1353
01:37:32,839 --> 01:37:35,133
Lucky crack pipe.

1354
01:37:44,643 --> 01:37:48,513
Sorry we're late, fellas.
I hope you didn't wait dinner.

1355
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,348
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

1356
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:52,392
Third party beneficiary.

1357
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:54,811
Your friend here can fill you in
on the details.

1358
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:57,814
I'm working on getting your money, Dave.
That's what I'm doing here.

1359
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,067
I don't know about you,
but the hardest part of collecting debts

1360
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,902
is having to listen to the <i>stories.</i>

1361
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:04,446
Terence owes you some money?

1362
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:07,616
$50,000.
Plus my two young friends here

1363
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:10,744
were supposed to have
a sexual experience of their choosing

1364
01:38:10,844 --> 01:38:15,173
with an attractive woman. Nothing.
He came across with none of it.

1365
01:38:15,298 --> 01:38:19,586
That's wrong. That's wrong you don't do
what you say you're gonna do, Terence.

1366
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:21,763
The dope's worth more than 50,000.

1367
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:24,591
Take it.

1368
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:27,344
Why don't I take all the dope?

1369
01:38:27,444 --> 01:38:30,388
Why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?

1370
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,807
Well, there was a time
when I wouldn't have.

1371
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,977
I would've taken what was mine
and left the rest on the table.

1372
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:39,064
But, you see,
I never got rich enough to retire.

1373
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:42,817
I'm stuck doing this shit.

1374
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,078
And I'm not young anymore.

1375
01:38:46,413 --> 01:38:49,240
So now I don't leave nothing on the table.

1376
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,043
Pick it up.

1377
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,853
Shoot him again.

1378
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,355
What for?

1379
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,657
His soul's still dancing.

1380
01:39:46,389 --> 01:39:47,849
<i>Shoot him again.</i>

1381
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:21,133
Good night, Lieutenant.

1382
01:40:23,885 --> 01:40:25,253
What are you doing tonight?

1383
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,139
I'm getting outta here and go to bed.

1384
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:30,508
Just for fun, why don't you stop
by the apartment on Josephine?

1385
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:31,968
For fun?

1386
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:34,053
You might find something interesting there.

1387
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:35,847
Like what?

1388
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:39,317
These bushwhackers might've hit a crack pipe
while they were there.

1389
01:40:39,442 --> 01:40:43,938
You know? The odd chance is he dropped it
under the bed where the kids were.

1390
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,607
And we missed it.

1391
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:48,535
The DNA'd place them at the scene.

1392
01:40:50,328 --> 01:40:52,122
You had a vision, right?

1393
01:40:53,999 --> 01:40:57,002
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

1394
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:38,126
<i>Frankie? Frankie.</i>

1395
01:41:40,879 --> 01:41:42,914
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?

1396
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,958
Frankie's on her way to rehab.

1397
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:46,250
Rehab?

1398
01:41:46,843 --> 01:41:49,546
What about her clothes?

1399
01:41:49,646 --> 01:41:52,390
Someone will bring her her clothes.

1400
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,561
Anything else you wanna know?

1401
01:42:23,129 --> 01:42:25,465
You don't have to hide it from me.

1402
01:42:26,508 --> 01:42:29,794
We're birds of a feather.

1403
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,597
We both like our poison.

1404
01:42:34,307 --> 01:42:37,018
You just drink beer, I thought.

1405
01:43:24,858 --> 01:43:27,936
Do you mind if I watch the game?

1406
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:30,822
Mh-mh. Be my guest.

1407
01:43:40,331 --> 01:43:45,078
<i>I cannot believe what I'm witnessing.</i>

1408
01:43:45,178 --> 01:43:48,164
<i>Louisiana up by 18 points
in the second quarter.</i>

1409
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:49,916
<i>For another score.</i>

1410
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,626
You wanna share?

1411
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,545
<i>Back to pass.
He scrambles.</i>

1412
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,923
<i>Hobbs builds his way to another--</i>

1413
01:43:57,023 --> 01:43:59,517
I don't know.

1414
01:44:01,186 --> 01:44:04,481
<i>And all this without Renaldo Hayes.</i>

1415
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:08,184
<i>We still don't know
the nature of his injury.</i>

1416
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,269
<i>Just that he's taken himself
out of the line.</i>

1417
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:12,238
I'll kill him.

1418
01:44:12,363 --> 01:44:15,775
<i>Renaldo Hayes being out,
the freshman Johnson has really stepped up</i>

1419
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:19,070
<i>for this football team.
You're in the land of miracles, my boy.</i>

1420
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,948
<i>I'm looking right there at Hayes,
and I'll tell you what.</i>

1421
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:26,327
<i>The guy just does not look like a happy guy.
He's on the sideline.</i>

1422
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:29,047
<i>He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury.</i>

1423
01:45:10,922 --> 01:45:12,165
Hey, guys.

1424
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,333
Good to see you.

1425
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:15,718
Listen.

1426
01:45:16,928 --> 01:45:19,505
This stuff, this thing between us,

1427
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:23,009
it's gotten way out of hand.
Got way outta hand.

1428
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:24,101
Okay?

1429
01:45:24,936 --> 01:45:28,348
Those <i>gumbos,</i>
couple of fucking assholes.

1430
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:31,768
<i>They disappeared because
of something you did to them.</i>

1431
01:45:31,868 --> 01:45:35,688
Whoa, man, I got no beef
with you whatsoever.

1432
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:38,775
Everything between me,
right as rain.

1433
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,526
And I want you to know

1434
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:43,154
that my father got in touch
with his guy

1435
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:45,198
and he told him whoever it is,

1436
01:45:45,298 --> 01:45:48,201
that complaint has been withdrawn.
Finished.

1437
01:45:48,301 --> 01:45:50,093
Oh, yeah.

1438
01:45:50,211 --> 01:45:51,211
Okay?

1439
01:45:54,465 --> 01:45:55,465
Okay.

1440
01:45:57,135 --> 01:45:58,935
Oh, yeah?

1441
01:46:01,014 --> 01:46:02,814
Uh, phew.

1442
01:46:06,603 --> 01:46:07,603
Okay.

1443
01:46:08,354 --> 01:46:09,847
That's the way out.

1444
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,608
Oh, yeah.

1445
01:46:14,527 --> 01:46:16,396
<i>Oh, no. Look, Ned,</i>

1446
01:46:16,496 --> 01:46:19,148
if you'd called first,
I would've saved you the trip.

1447
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:23,495
I'm guessing that you didn't
see the game.

1448
01:46:26,247 --> 01:46:28,074
<i>How did this happen?</i>

1449
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:31,577
Louisiana by three.

1450
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,788
Hayes ended up playing?

1451
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:34,880
Nope.

1452
01:46:36,549 --> 01:46:37,792
Worked out anyway.

1453
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,418
What are you talking about?

1454
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:40,753
Nothing.

1455
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:41,845
Oh,

1456
01:46:42,514 --> 01:46:45,591
and my daughter's tickets,
speeding tickets,

1457
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,052
thank you, thank you, thank you.

1458
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:50,763
This female highway patrol officer calls up,

1459
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:52,815
says they're taken care of.

1460
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,854
It's $10,000.
Sure you don't wanna count it?

1461
01:46:57,954 --> 01:46:59,439
<i>I trust you.</i>

1462
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:01,607
All right, man.
You take care or yourself.

1463
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:02,825
<i>All right.</i>

1464
01:47:04,953 --> 01:47:06,538
Great news.

1465
01:47:06,663 --> 01:47:09,657
Our man came up with this
at the crime scene on Josephine.

1466
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:11,409
I just got lucky.

1467
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:14,963
The lab found Godshaw's DNA on it.

1468
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:22,461
That is fantastic!

1469
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:23,553
Yes!

1470
01:47:28,059 --> 01:47:29,727
Oh, look at that.

1471
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,299
I found the spoon.

1472
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,845
It's not silver.

1473
01:48:05,179 --> 01:48:07,381
It went rusty.

1474
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,517
I wanna give it to you.

1475
01:48:11,352 --> 01:48:13,104
It's yours.

1476
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:15,940
It's for me?

1477
01:48:22,989 --> 01:48:25,116
That's so sweet.

1478
01:48:36,836 --> 01:48:38,463
It's beautiful.

1479
01:48:50,391 --> 01:48:52,385
<i>Yeah, I need eight of them.</i>

1480
01:48:52,485 --> 01:48:54,637
<i>Yes, eight.</i>

1481
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:58,558
<i>Uh-huh.
It's going down, baby.</i>

1482
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:02,019
Yeah, I got some help.
I'm telling you.

1483
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:05,439
Police Department. Stand up.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

1484
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:07,191
What the fuck is this?

1485
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,277
We got it.
Check the outside,

1486
01:49:09,377 --> 01:49:12,196
check the backyard, check upstairs,
check his car.

1487
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:14,907
<i>We got this. it's okay.
Good. We're good. Upstairs.</i>

1488
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:16,200
<i>Cuff him.</i>

1489
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,292
No.

1490
01:49:19,504 --> 01:49:20,504
No.

1491
01:49:21,672 --> 01:49:23,416
What do you mean no?

1492
01:49:23,516 --> 01:49:26,669
This is what happens. Before we can
cuff him, he goes for this weapon,

1493
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:28,713
we shoot this prick
and steal his shit.

1494
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:31,424
Fuck. Terence, what--
What are we doing?

1495
01:49:31,524 --> 01:49:33,518
I thought we had our thing going.

1496
01:49:33,643 --> 01:49:37,513
<i>You're wrong, baby. He acts like he likes you
'cause he likes to get high.</i>

1497
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,725
Huh? That don't mean
he stop bein' the police.

1498
01:49:40,825 --> 01:49:42,101
<i>Cuff him, Stevie.</i>

1499
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:43,853
No. Can you draw a line of murder?

1500
01:49:43,953 --> 01:49:45,545
It's interesting
where to wreck its fun.

1501
01:49:45,655 --> 01:49:47,940
I said cuff him, Stevie.

1502
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,326
<i>This is about money.
You want my fucking money?</i>

1503
01:49:50,451 --> 01:49:54,280
You want my fucking money? Take my money!
You won't kill me for this shit.

1504
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:57,116
<i>Go for it, son.
Go for it.</i>

1505
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:58,960
Got for it. Go for it!

1506
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:02,714
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1507
01:50:04,757 --> 01:50:06,625
Next time.

1508
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:09,178
Now fucking cuff him.

1509
01:50:12,723 --> 01:50:15,852
I said cuff the motherfucker, Stevie!

1510
01:50:41,377 --> 01:50:46,082
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor
to conclude this year on a positive note.

1511
01:50:46,182 --> 01:50:49,627
In recognition of his
leadership and tenacity

1512
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:52,671
in the investigation
of the Ndele family murders,

1513
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:56,342
resulting in the successful
apprehension and prosecution

1514
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:58,978
of the three individuals responsible,

1515
01:50:59,103 --> 01:51:04,684
<i>I'm proud to include Lieutenant Terence McDonagh
among those being promoted</i>

1516
01:51:04,784 --> 01:51:08,529
to the rank of captain.
Captain McDonagh.

1517
01:51:16,287 --> 01:51:17,287
Woo!

1518
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:36,632
Excuse me.
Would you care for some wine?

1519
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:39,977
No, thank you. We're all gonna stick
with our sparkling water.

1520
01:51:42,647 --> 01:51:45,149
I would like to make a toast.

1521
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,227
To the new Captain.

1522
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:50,688
To new life.

1523
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:53,065
I'm probably gonna start
to cry right now.

1524
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:55,284
Oh, that's okay.

1525
01:51:56,577 --> 01:51:58,320
To my new family.

1526
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,072
God bless.

1527
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,666
Here, here.

1528
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:31,270
You still gonna be working on night shift
when I get closer to the due date?

1529
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:34,607
I'll make sure I'm not.
How is that?

1530
01:52:34,707 --> 01:52:39,612
I could get to the hospital and all,
but I like having you home at night.

1531
01:52:39,712 --> 01:52:42,039
I like it better that way, too.

1532
01:53:19,243 --> 01:53:21,245
Thank you, darling.

1533
01:53:46,729 --> 01:53:48,097
<i>All right.</i>

1534
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:49,640
There we go.

1535
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,350
Where are your keys?

1536
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:53,102
<i>Did I give them to you?</i>

1537
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:54,520
<i>No, I don't think you did.</i>

1538
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,938
Stand against the wall.

1539
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:57,147
What'd we do?

1540
01:53:57,247 --> 01:53:58,691
Hey, stand against the wall.

1541
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:00,401
What are you doing?

1542
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:03,612
The two of you match a description.
Passing drugs in the club.

1543
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:07,408
Don't say anything.
Do exactly what I tell you to do.

1544
01:54:07,508 --> 01:54:09,952
So, what are we high on tonight?

1545
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:11,370
Nothing.

1546
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:14,423
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag.

1547
01:54:29,188 --> 01:54:30,889
<i>Room service.</i>

1548
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:33,225
I didn't order any room service.

1549
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:37,563
Oh. It must've been a mistake again.

1550
01:54:37,663 --> 01:54:39,655
Holy shit.

1551
01:54:40,282 --> 01:54:43,068
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

1552
01:54:43,366 --> 01:54:45,807
I was in the prison
that was flooding.

1553
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:46,889
Oh, yeah.

1554
01:54:46,982 --> 01:54:48,574
Do you remember me?

1555
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:50,993
Are you still with the
Police Department?

1556
01:54:51,358 --> 01:54:53,921
Port of call still New Orleans.

1557
01:54:55,673 --> 01:54:56,673
Okay.

1558
01:54:57,049 --> 01:54:59,043
What happened with you?

1559
01:54:59,557 --> 01:55:01,883
The judge remanded
to a drug treatment program.

1560
01:55:02,183 --> 01:55:04,765
November 14th I have a year clean.

1561
01:55:06,142 --> 01:55:08,269
Congratulations.

1562
01:55:13,357 --> 01:55:15,196
Are you all right?

1563
01:55:17,194 --> 01:55:20,364
Sometimes I have bad days.

1564
01:55:23,075 --> 01:55:24,475
Listen,

1565
01:55:24,869 --> 01:55:26,412
you saved my life.

1566
01:55:27,218 --> 01:55:30,235
I'm almost done working.
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

1567
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:32,333
Okay?

1568
01:55:36,523 --> 01:55:39,091
Do fish have dreams?

1569
01:55:59,716 --> 01:56:01,513
You know, Chavez,

1570
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:05,242
I still hate that I ruined
my underwear for you.

1571
