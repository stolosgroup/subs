3
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,993
We weigh 251 tons.

4
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,993
Just over optimal
with a 1.5g buffet margin.

5
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:19,285
1.6 even.

6
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,244
- Jeanne and your meal.
- I'll let her in.

7
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:35,535
Thanks.

8
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,119
We're serving breakfast.

9
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,410
It may get rocky. Let them know.

10
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,993
Ok, I'll get your meal.

11
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,660
Did you rest?

12
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:50,868
Sir!

13
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,785
Please sit down, sir.

14
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,660
<i>Still Swiss control?</i>

15
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:18,827
<i>They'll soon hand us over to Paris.</i>

16
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>On turnaround this week?</i>

17
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,368
<i>New Delhi, then Bali right after.</i>

18
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,244
<i>Any room in your bags?</i>

19
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,702
<i>- Jeanne again.
- I'll let her in.</i>

20
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,077
That's the lot.

21
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:20,493
An iPhone video,
no flight recorder on board.

22
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,493
It looks like the tail rotor went.

23
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,910
Not just that.

24
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,202
Listen.

25
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,493
A transmission gear is too slow.

26
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:41,743
On a Dauphin, it should be at 1730.
I hear it at 1680.

27
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:44,160
You can hear a 50 Hz difference?

28
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,952
I see it too.

29
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:50,160
Here, this line at 1680 Hz.

30
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,493
Pitch that part 300% to bass.

31
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,493
All I hear is the tail rotor.

32
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,202
I'm not sure.
We need a test flight.

33
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,160
The same phone, the same distance.

34
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:17,035
Mathieu, I've seen this before.
The video is clear.

35
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:21,077
Sorry, but I really think
we should do a test flight.

36
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,868
Mathieu, believe me,

37
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,618
you'll end up at the same conclusion.

38
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,869
If you say so.

39
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:30,869
We'll never know.

40
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,577
Want Balsan to take over?

41
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:38,743
Right...

42
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,035
We need the 800 FCOM.

43
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,535
The updated one.

44
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,702
The whole avionic system.

45
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:56,660
The go-team's due at 3 pm.

46
00:05:59,035 --> 00:05:59,869
Call the airline.

47
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,827
Get the recorder serial numbers.

48
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,410
I need to cancel, we have a crash.

49
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,827
We'll free the lab.

50
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,201
Ok, I'll hold.

51
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,035
Yes, I'll hold.

52
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:13,660
An Atrian 800 went down.
300 passengers.

53
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,368
When?

54
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,743
Air traffic just informed us.

55
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,743
All technical data.

56
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:21,702
Plane, engine, the lot.

57
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,785
Pollock's in charge.

58
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:24,910
Who's going?

59
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,035
Rénier wants a CVR guy
and a wreck tech.

60
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:29,119
Yes.

61
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:33,243
We need to work
with your technical adviser.

62
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,410
The go-team flies out ASAP.

63
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,451
Balsan, get your things.

64
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,702
Sorry, but you usually take me.

65
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,201
Balsan is as capable.

66
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,285
If it's about earlier...

67
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:58,243
I can't deal with your misgivings now.

68
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:05,910
The case bag.

69
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,326
- What?
- The bag.

70
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:08,952
We need it.

71
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,118
<i>Heard anything?</i>

72
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,743
<i>I've been side-lined</i>

73
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,285
<i>Tonight is off?</i>

74
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,118
<i>Don't chicken out.</i>

75
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,910
I don't know what time I'll finish.

76
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:45,577
<i>I've got everyone together,
you have to come.</i>

77
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:48,160
No one will come after the crash.

78
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,785
<i>They'll all be after information.</i>

79
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:53,160
<i>Make an effort, for my sake.</i>

80
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:55,785
Shit...

81
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:57,618
- <i>What's up?
</i>- Hold on.

82
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:10,452
<i>Mathieu?</i>

83
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,118
Fuck...

84
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:18,827
<i>Mathieu?</i>

85
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,534
- <i>What's wrong?
</i>- Nothing.

86
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,910
<i>Are you coming?</i>

87
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,952
If you want,
but there'll be no one there.

88
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,951
They act normal,
but they're thinking about the crash.

89
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,910
I'm not on it.

90
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,368
On what?

91
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,035
The investigation.

92
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,619
A huge case and I'm not on it.

93
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:47,368
I'm no better off.

94
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,035
If it's technical, Atrian is doomed,

95
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,827
with me and half this room.

96
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,744
Welcome to the Titanic.

97
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:57,619
Xavier!

98
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,368
- Ok?
- Fine, and you?

99
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:02,869
Pegase is securing CDG's network?

100
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:05,076
We're pleased, it's a big job.

101
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,993
Your single-fibre network

102
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,493
is awesome. It should be standard.

103
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,535
Lighter aircraft
means lower fuel consumption.

104
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,744
Let's do lunch and talk.

105
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:16,869
Next week, after Montreal.

106
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,993
- I'll call you.
- Ok.

107
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,452
He used to hate you.

108
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:26,118
They all want to give me their CVs now.

109
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:28,993
What are you two plotting?

110
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,744
I was asking how you got him here.

111
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,452
- Ok?
- Yes.

112
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,993
- When d'you start with Varins?
- Next month.

113
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,118
I'm so pleased.

114
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:41,827
Thanks again.

115
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,577
Just one call.
How did the agency react?

116
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:47,327
Upset to see you in the private sector?

117
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,452
They'll recover.

118
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,993
Don't be modest,
you're their best element.

119
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:53,993
I'll need to work hard.

120
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,869
Varins is demanding.

121
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,535
- No, you'll be fine.
- I hope so.

122
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,076
I'm organizing a cocktail party

123
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,285
for gender equality.

124
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,452
Could the Entrepreneurs help?

125
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,493
- Want me to ask?
- Please.

126
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,410
Always after favours...

127
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,702
Stop it.

128
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,744
I'm kidding. I'll ask.

129
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,410
I have to see the Safran guys.

130
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,951
I'll call you.

131
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:17,744
Deal.

132
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,327
- Finished mingling?
- Yes.

133
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:29,868
Well?

134
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:31,910
Limited dispersion.

135
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,202
So, no explosion.

136
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:36,785
Got the ACARS and trajectory data?

137
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,076
Yes, a sudden nose-dive.

138
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,826
And traffic control?

139
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,368
The pilots tried to climb
before losing contact.

140
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,494
Could it be technical?

141
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:51,951
Not for me. Our certification showed
the 800 is a Rolls.

142
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,285
Not one major breakdown yet.

143
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:58,535
<i>Nothing new on the Atrian 800 crash
in the Alps this morning.</i>

144
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,118
<i>With the gendarmes</i>

145
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,494
<i>at work all day in the mountains,</i>

146
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:05,035
<i>BEA experts</i>

147
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:08,285
<i>are on site
to localize the black boxes. Nothing...</i>

148
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:13,910
Don't brood. You're not on it, ok.

149
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:18,951
I told you before,
don't get Pollock's back up.

150
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,619
So I just shut up?

151
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,494
We aren't judged on skills alone.

152
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:32,910
You know that.

153
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,494
Just be more diplomatic.

154
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,035
It's green.

155
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,826
I learned that in a coaching seminar.

156
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,910
"Boost a distressed co-worker."

157
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,035
You have no mercy.

158
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,452
None at all.

159
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:59,368
<i>The European Airlines Atrian 800
was carrying</i>

160
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,785
<i>300 passengers and 16 crew.</i>

161
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,452
<i>There are no survivors.</i>

162
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,702

<i>for reasons unknown.</i>

168
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:23,494
<i>A rescue operation was launched
after the loss of radar echo...</i>

169
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:40,327
<i>European Airlines Atrian
Manslaughter</i>

170
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,410
Victor Pollock, BEA investigator.

171
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,243
It's 7:10 pm on October 10, 2020.

172
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:34,993
<i>In the presence of a police officer,
we'll remove</i>

173
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,993
<i>and open the CVR</i>

174
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:40,369
<i>from the October 8 crash
of the Atrian 800</i>

175
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,701
<i>registered FHLBN,</i>

176
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:45,285
<i>operated by European Airlines.
Begin.</i>

177
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:25,118
It's good, it's exploitable.

178
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,785
Land the plane at 800 m

179
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,701
with low auto-brake.
Reverse on my signal.

180
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,160
Reverse thrust!

181
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,077
On a wet runway,

182
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,827
the landing and late reverse
led to a runway excursion.

183
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:16,244
The crew should have tried extra thrust
before wheel contact.

184
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:20,202
A quick simulation
to accuse an absent pilot...

185
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,077
It's a bit too easy.

186
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,160
We reproduced the whole incident.

187
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,035
It's nothing like being in flight.

188
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:30,369
This may be tough, Mr Roussin,

189
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,535
but your colleague lied
when he blamed the plane.

190
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:37,119
Keep accusing the pilots
and planes will be flown like drones.

191
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,077
So you say.

192
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,077
We're judged by people like you.

193
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,451
Frustrated pilots.

194
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:54,244
Recommendation:
review landing on short runways.

195
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,160
<i>Mathieu, I must see you.
It's urgent.</i>

196
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,369
Sorry, is Balsan alone?

197
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,035
Pollock still isn't here.
No one has heard from him all morning.

198
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,702
Yes, come in.

199
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:29,702
I'll send a copy of the CVR,
but we had to talk first.

200
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,993
There were leaks with your predecessor.

201
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:37,160
I need to be sure our information
will remain confidential.

202
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,743
Very good.

203
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,410
Mathieu, we have a problem.

204
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:48,160
Pollock can't be found.
Balsan is stuck on the CVR.

205
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:50,702
The sound is mangled.
Help him.

206
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,660
Ok. What did the FDR show?

207
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:56,077
It's almost useless.

208
00:19:56,576 --> 00:20:00,326
We found some incoherent flight orders
in the final minutes,

209
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,368
but we don't know why.

210
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,077
- <i>The minister's deputy.
</i>- Put him on.

211
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,702
I know it's urgent, Antoine,
but I need time.

212
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:14,077
We're analysing the CVR.

213
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,535
No, 3 pm is too soon.

214
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,119
Ok, 7 pm.

215
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,660
I promise.

216
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,077
I'll keep you posted.

217
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,077
Press point at 7.

218
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,660
Make the CVR talk.

219
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,827
I need the full chain of events.

220
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:52,035
We've only processed the first hour.

221
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,326
The cockpit mic is dirty.

222
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:01,451
Stop.

223
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:03,618
- What?
- A buzz.

224
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,576
Unplug that.

225
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,077
<i>We weigh 251 tons.</i>

226
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,202
<i>Just over optimal
with a 1.5g buffet margin.</i>

227
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,577
<i>1.6 even.</i>

228
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:35,160
<i>- Jeanne and your meal.
- I'll let her in.</i>

229
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,660
<i>We're serving breakfast.</i>

230
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,994
<i>It may get rocky. Let them know.</i>

231
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,618
<i>Ok, I'll get your meal.</i>

232
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:54,702
<i>Sooner than I thought. Seatbelt time.</i>

233
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,994
<i>See those cbs on the right?</i>

234
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,743
<i>We were right to avoid them.</i>

235
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,451
<i>It looks clear ahead.</i>

236
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:05,577
<i>The CDG update.
Westerly landing, visibility 3000 m,</i>

237
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,243
<i>rain, clouds at 800 feet, 8° C...</i>

238
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,702
Static. They're in a cloud.

239
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:14,785
<i>- Where do you live?
- Just north of CDG.</i>

240
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,326
<i>22° today in Biarritz.</i>

241
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,451
<i>You live there?</i>

242
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:20,451
The engine speed has changed.

243
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:22,451
<i>My wife's Basque and I surf.</i>

244
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,285
<i>Still with Swiss control?</i>

245
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,952
Their earphones are off.

246
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:35,535
<i>On turnaround this week?</i>

247
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:38,910
<i>New Delhi, then Bali right after.</i>

248
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:40,451
<i>Any room in your bags?</i>

249
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,577
<i>- Jeanne again.
- I'll let her in.</i>

250
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,243
<i>We're gonna crash!</i>

251
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:29,077
Switch to RX.
Give me 200 to 1800 Hz.

252
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,326
Lower the engine noise.

253
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,535
Let's bring the voices out.

254
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,702
Let me try something.

255
00:23:58,493 --> 00:23:59,702
Can you stop?

256
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,326
Your leg.

257
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:05,994
Thanks.

258
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>...akbar!</i>

259
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,994
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

260
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,201
At the end,
it could be the pilot or the co.

261
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:28,118
We can't determine what they did.

262
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,243
All the 800 controls are touch-screen.

263
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,910
How did the guy get in?

264
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,994
The sound is terrible.
We need more time.

265
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:38,618
I know,
but I can't delay the press point.

266
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:40,410
Can you do it?

267
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:41,910
Yes.

268
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,910
Switch to iZotope RX at 7'51.

269
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,660
The limited spread of debris

270
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:02,118
shows the plane was intact

271
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,702
prior to impact.

272
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:07,326
The initial analysis of the fuselage

273
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,410
shows no sign of explosives.

274
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:13,827
Moreover, the voice recorder shows
a passenger

275
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,410
entered the cockpit.

276
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:20,285
The pilots then fought with him.

277
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:21,994
Here, please.

278
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:23,660
Yes?

279
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:27,035
Caroline Delmas, Mediapart.

280
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:30,535
How could a passenger enter the cockpit

281
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:32,910
with three cameras over the door?

282
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:36,660
He apparently used a stewardess
to gain entrance.

283
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,744
What allows you to assert that?

284
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:40,869
The CVR analysis.

285
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,160
Our investigator, Mathieu Vasseur,

286
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:47,493
will present the initial CVR findings.

287
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:56,660
Hello.

288
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,618
On the recording,

289
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:06,201
at 7:48 am Paris time,

290
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:11,035
we hear the voice of the hostess
entering the cockpit

291
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,493
with the first meal tray.

292
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,785
She returns one minute 20 seconds later

293
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,243
and rings the doorbell.

294
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,035
Probably with the second meal.

295
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:27,035
The pilots identify her
and let her in.

296
00:26:27,076 --> 00:26:29,201
The door remains open

297
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,869
and, over the central mic,

298
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,327
we hear hurried footsteps
approaching the cockpit.

299
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,827
It's clearly not the hostess.

300
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,619
That indicates an intrusion
into the cockpit.

301
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,660
Shortly before, we have isolated

302
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,869
the sound
of the pilots' lavatory latch.

303
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,243
This lavatory...

304
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,076
is here.

305
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,827
The man hid in there

306
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:58,243
before entering the cockpit.

307
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,744
The hostess should have checked
before ringing the bell.

308
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,035
Those are our deductions
after the audio analysis.

309
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:10,577
I hope I've answered your questions.
Thank you.

310
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:14,702
We subsequently hear

311
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:17,327
overspeed and imminent impact alarms.

312
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:22,993
Antoine Istier, Europe 1.

313
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,118
Is it a terrorist attack?

314
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:26,993
In all likelihood.

315
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:30,535
But the judicial inquiry
is still underway.

316
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,993
The full transcript of the CVR

317
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:36,660
will be the subject of a report
in the coming weeks.

318
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:38,619
Thank you.

319
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,202
Thanks, Mathieu.

320
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,410
Have you identified the terrorist?

321
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,410
I can say no more.

322
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:54,410
Mr Vasseur, Caroline Delmas, Mediapart.
One question.

323
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:55,868
Sorry, no comment.

324
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:57,702
Forgive me...

325
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:01,452
Isn't it a little easy,
blaming the hostess's negligence?

326
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:04,827
The CVR shows it. I don't theorize,

327
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,368
I analyse facts.

328
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,368
Excuse me.

329
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:59,702
<i>A lead in the recent Atrian 800 crash
in the Alps.</i>

330
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:01,202
<i>Reliable sources</i>

331
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:04,993
<i>claim a radical Islamist
was on the passenger manifest.</i>

332
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,160
<i>Moqtada Sualazi, an Egyptian aged 26.</i>

333
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:12,785
<i>After analysing the black boxes,
the BEA investigators revealed</i>

334
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,868
<i>that the plane crashed</i>

335
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,868
<i>after a passenger entered the cockpit.</i>

336
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,285
<i>It's too early...</i>

337
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:20,410
Mathieu!

338
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:25,452
Fine work yesterday.

339
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:27,076
Thank you.

340
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,035
After that excellent job, I want you

341
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:31,785
to head the investigation.

342
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:36,118
Thank you very much, sir.

343
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,285
Excuse me...

344
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,243
Any news of Pollock?

345
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:42,535
Still nothing.

346
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:46,702
Victor can be hard to reach at times,

347
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,410
but absent in this storm...

348
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:49,951
I don't get it.

349
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:54,868
I can't wait for him to show up.

350
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,868
Finish the report for me.

351
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,910
Of course.

352
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:01,118
Captain:
<i>What's that noise?</i>

353
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,285
Other sounds:
<i>Change in engine speed / Interference</i>

354
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:12,410
<i>It's Julien. You're replacing Pollock
on the Dubai-Paris?</i>

355
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:13,327
Yes.

356
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:17,368
<i>A victim's husband contacted us.
She called him just before the crash.</i>

357
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,410
<i>Interested?</i>

358
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:21,535
I'm on the transcript.
Try Balsan.

359
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:24,369
<i>He's busy with the Atrian engineers.</i>

360
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,285
Ok, I'll take it.

361
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:32,951
<i>During a search, the Egyptian police</i>

362
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,035
<i>found Jihadi propaganda
on his computer.</i>

363
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:40,202
<i>Controversy reigns as Paris asks</i>

364
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:43,785
<i>how the Emirate authorities
allowed him to board.</i>

365
00:30:47,118 --> 00:30:50,494
<i>Honey, I'm on the plane,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

366
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:54,202
<i>It's chaos, everyone's yelling.</i>

367
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:57,868
<i>I can see mountains.</i>

368
00:30:58,951 --> 00:30:59,951
<i>I love you.</i>

369
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,951
<i>I love you, you hear?</i>

370
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,202
<i>Tell the girls I love them.</i>

371
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,826
<i>I love you all so much.</i>

372
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:07,452
<i>I love you.</i>

373
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,202
She'd gone to Dubai

374
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:18,951
for a job interview.

375
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:25,535
If it worked out,

376
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,410
we planned to move there.

377
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,577
When she called,

378
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:38,951
I was busy at work.

379
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:44,494
Too busy to speak to her.

380
00:31:57,077 --> 00:32:01,785
Forgive me, Mr Reynal,
but I need the original message.

381
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,369
I'll have to borrow your phone,

382
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:07,202
just overnight.

383
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:44,077
<i>One new message.
October 8, at 7:56 am.</i>

384
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:48,494
<i>Honey, I'm on the plane,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

385
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:51,244
<i>It's chaos, everyone's yelling.</i>

386
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:57,285
<i>One new message.
October 8,</i>

387
00:32:57,618 --> 00:32:59,327
<i>at 7:56 am.</i>

388
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,576
<i>Honey, I'm...</i>

389
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:16,369
<i>Time of crash, CET, 07:53 am.</i>

390
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,785
Three minutes?

391
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:18,826
Yes.

392
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:20,660
Remember Germanwings.

393
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:25,077
Between Civil Aviation, the airline,
Flight Radar and others,

394
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,826
no one agreed on the time
by up to eight minutes.

395
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:31,452
I know, but there's this too.

396
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,701
Listen.

397
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,868
<i>Honey,</i>

398
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:40,369
<i>I'm on the plane,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

399
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,118
<i>It's chaos...</i>

400
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,285
Hear the announcement tone?

401
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,410
It's from the cockpit.

402
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:50,202
But the pilot's voice isn't on the CVR.

403
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:52,160
You mean you can't hear it.

404
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,118
The audio is bad.

405
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,493
Yes...

406
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,993
Hold on, one last thing.

407
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:01,160
Here.

408
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:03,327
<i>Emergency d...</i>

409
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:07,535
<i>Emergency d...</i>

410
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,618
I hear "emergency descent".

411
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:13,576
Like for a technical problem.

412
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:15,327
Play it again.

413
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:28,535
I hear "Emergency",
not "descent".

414
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:34,159
Checked European Airlines'
security protocol?

415
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,035
In a cockpit intrusion,
the code is "Emergency Delta".

416
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,451
The "d" you hear could be "Delta".

417
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,827
Carry on with the transcript.

418
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:34,493
<i>Last passenger evacuated.</i>

419
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:43,035
58 seconds.

420
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,952
Congratulations,
your plane is certified.

421
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:53,451
Thank you.

422
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,077
Thank you all.

423
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
<i>- Jeanne again.
- I'll let her in.</i>

424
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:33,868
Are you making a speech?

425
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,785
It's informal.
Dorval will say a few words.

426
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,202
Are you ok?

427
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,952
Yes.

428
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,785
You can relax, you know.

429
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,618
Have some champagne,
chat to people.

430
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,868
Come and meet Varins.

431
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:06,451
Claude...

432
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,077
Meet Mathieu, my husband.

433
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,493
Hello.

434
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:14,618
Your speech yesterday
was very clear and precise.

435
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,910
Thank you.

436
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,535
I'm not head-hunting a couple,

437
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:23,202
but if you tire of the BEA,
join us at Atrian.

438
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,493
You'll never persuade him.

439
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:28,535
Was working at the BEA

440
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:29,576
a vocation?

441
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:33,119
He wanted to be a pilot.

442
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,202
Yes.

443
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,202
But with my eyesight...

444
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,493
I specialized in acoustics at the ENAC.

445
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:42,785
Flight recorders

446
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,994
fascinated me and...

447
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:46,827
There you go.

448
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:51,035
Fascinating but exacting too,

449
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:52,451
to obtain answers.

450
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,702
Which you did.

451
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,535
Bravo. At a time like this,

452
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:59,119
the families and everyone need them.

453
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:04,451
Let's meet the Safran managers

454
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,160
you'll work with.

455
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,952
- Excuse us.
- Certainly.

456
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:19,702
- Hello?
-<i> It's Samir.</i>

457
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,368
<i>The passenger data's on the server.</i>

458
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,952
Anything interesting?

459
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:27,326
<i>A few Facebook photos
and videos during the flight.</i>

460
00:38:28,618 --> 00:38:29,577
Thanks.

461
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,827
Hello, everyone.

462
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,785
Well done, all of you,
for this certification.

463
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:43,827
I'd like to salute Noémie Vasseur.

464
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:47,577
This is her final certification as,
unfortunately for us,

465
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,910
she's leaving this month,

466
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,577
lured away by Atrian.

467
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:55,326
Thank you for your commitment

468
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,410
and passion.

469
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:00,618
I'm speaking for everyone here
at the agency

470
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,618
when I say we'll miss you.

471
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:04,243
Thank you.

472
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:40,660
<i>Where are you?</i>

473
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:47,243
<i>Sorry, emergency at work</i>

474
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:50,577
<i>We weigh 251 tons.</i>

475
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:54,035
<i>Just over optimal
with a 1.5g buffet margin.</i>

476
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,660
<i>1.6 even.</i>

477
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,160
<i>- Jeanne and your meal.
- I'll let her in.</i>

478
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,076
<i>We're serving breakfast.</i>

479
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:21,744
<i>It may get rocky. Let them know.</i>

480
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:23,285
<i>Ok. I'll get your meal.</i>

481
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,327
Sir!

482
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,452
Please sit down, sir.

483
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,285
Sir...

484
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:26,327
Sir.

485
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:27,993
Sit down, please.

486
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:29,744
Sir!

487
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,827
Don't over-interpret things.

488
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,285
You tend to.

489
00:44:03,535 --> 00:44:07,243
You're diligent,
but all the filtering and equalizing

490
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,702
makes a recording say anything.

491
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,368
After 20 years on CVRs,

492
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:15,744
believe me, the best filter is the ear.

493
00:44:16,076 --> 00:44:18,160
And about the meal trolley?

494
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:21,368
Do you really think a trolley

495
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,785
can stop a madman hijacking a plane?

00:44:25,243 --> 00:44:26,202
No, but...

497
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:28,368
Focus on what we really hear.

498
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:31,951

Yes.

501
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:41,202
I need Pollock's input.

I can't complete a report like this.

515
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:24,577

00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,744
He heard phantom sounds again.

526
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:11,910
That you can't hear, huh?

527

You'll see.

528
00:46:13,535 --> 00:46:15,285
It's like the Cessna again.

529
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:42,826
What's that?

530
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,660
The Bourget Falcon 20.

531
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,160
The pilot and the tower.

532
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:49,826
Limited bandwidth is tough.

533
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:53,035
- What is it?
- Tell me,

534
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:56,118
when you listened to the CVR
with Pollock,

535
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:58,202
did you notice anything odd?

536
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:00,118
No, nothing special.

537
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:02,202
When did you finish?

538
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:04,785
Midnight. He stayed.
Why?

539
00:47:05,243 --> 00:47:07,826
You finished before he did?

540
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:12,452
Pollock was anxious to carry on.
Are you done? I need to get on.

541
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,660
I hear a thud on the first call.

542
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:23,410
Probably a bird.

543
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:25,369
Then the engine surges fast,

544
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,327
beyond its limit, up to 200%,
before exploding.

545
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:32,285

You had a control surface problem

Give me five minutes.

The plane was marketed too soon,
to counter the competition.

629
01:03:17,118 --> 01:03:20,452
They turned a blind eye

630
01:03:20,494 --> 01:03:25,993

The penalties for delay were astronomic.

01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:29,327
But the certification commission
ran checks.

632
01:03:29,826 --> 01:03:30,951
You're that naive?

633
01:03:31,577 --> 01:03:35,410
The pride of European aviation.
Atrian's influence is huge.

Heard of control surface problems

645
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:58,327
We had pilot reports six months ago.

646
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,619

It's absurd, Mathieu.

650
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:12,868
You think the plane has a problem?

651
01:05:17,952 --> 01:05:21,035
There were latency problems,
but they were resolved.

652
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:24,868
So why do the pilots say
the MHD took over the plane?

653
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,910
You know that's pure fantasy.

654
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:29,118
It's just an assistance system.

655
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:31,993
But which pilots do you mean?

656
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:36,327
Those opposed to automation
and cockpit cameras?

657
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:39,701
They'll say anything
to keep their old habits.

658
01:05:43,993 --> 01:05:47,452
You really think the agency
would approve a faulty plane?

659
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,202
We did our job and Atrian complied.

660
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:51,410
C'mon, drive.

661
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:53,785
I forgot how close you are.

662
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,868
Meaning what?

663
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,993
There's a report on those tests?

664
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,285
Forget I mentioned it.
It's confidential.

665
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,576
There was a report.

666
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,868
It's confidential, ok.
You're a drag. Now drive.

667
01:06:10,202 --> 01:06:11,576
Drive, I said!

668
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,826
You won't give up?

669
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:24,743
I need to test the MHD.

670
01:06:24,785 --> 01:06:26,952
The facts are confirmed.

671
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:29,993
They're your conclusions.

672
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:31,660
I know.

673
01:06:32,244 --> 01:06:35,244
The MHD
is in a Defence Ministry warehouse.

674
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:37,952
Why Defence?

675
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:39,494
It's sensitive.

676
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:42,826
They've sealed the plane's avionics.

677
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,369
You could order them to return the MHD.

678
01:06:49,743 --> 01:06:52,826
I won't do that
without tangible evidence.

679
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,160
Return to your other files.

680
01:06:58,077 --> 01:06:59,993
How's the Dauphin crash going?

681
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,244
I'm still waiting.

682
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:13,868
<i>This is Alain Roussin.
Please leave a message.</i>

683
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:18,118
This is Mathieu Vasseur again.

684
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,327
You said we could meet.
I need to talk to you.

685
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:23,244
Please call me.

686
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:28,576
<i>This is Alain Roussin...</i>

687
01:07:37,244 --> 01:07:38,410
<i>Stop calling me!</i>

688
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:40,785
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

689
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:43,285
I don't understand.

690
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:45,410
<i>Stop calling me, ok!</i>

691
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:47,993
I thought we agreed...

692
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,618
I keep hearing about you.

693
01:08:02,576 --> 01:08:06,493
You harassed a pilot
and questioned the 800's reliability?

694
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:07,409
Who said that?

695
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,119
Noémie?

696
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,160
No, European's sales manager.
You think Noémie and I talk about you?

697
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:15,576
Trying to get fired?

698
01:08:16,535 --> 01:08:19,326
Noémie's new job is sensitive.

699
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:22,826
She needs your support,
not conspiracy theories.

700
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:26,202
I say that as a friend.

701
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:29,743
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

702
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:37,534
Where's that from?

703
01:08:38,369 --> 01:08:41,993
3 years I've worked with Pollock,
you never said you knew him.

704
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,118
We met in a work group.

705
01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:45,535
Working on what?

706
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:51,077
A distress beacon to permanently locate
a plane in flight.

707
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:52,660
Why show me this?

708
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:54,618
I don't know.

709
01:08:55,909 --> 01:08:59,868
Pollock vanished
two days after the crash, it's weird.

710
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,827
And I'm a suspect?

711
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:04,993
- I didn't say that.
- This is absurd.

712
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:07,868
What is this?

713
01:09:09,284 --> 01:09:11,369
I get on too well with Noémie?

714
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:15,910
You need to relax.
You're getting worked up.

715
01:09:16,244 --> 01:09:18,702
We know what happened on board.
Accept it.

716
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,576
Are you ok?

717
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:23,410
I have to go.

718
01:10:09,618 --> 01:10:11,785
<i>And now yet another day</i>

719
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:13,368
<i>marked by emotion,</i>

720
01:10:13,785 --> 01:10:16,618
<i>10 days after the Atrian 800 attack.</i>

721
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,368
<i>The victims' families</i>

722
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:22,535
<i>took part in a private ceremony
near the crash site.</i>

723
01:10:22,576 --> 01:10:26,410
<i>They were accompanied to the site
by gendarmes</i>

724
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:29,743
<i>and spoke to official representatives,</i>

725
01:10:29,785 --> 01:10:32,868
<i>as well as the examining magistrate.</i>

726
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,160
<i>Reporters were kept to one side</i>

727
01:10:36,618 --> 01:10:39,368
<i>and were given no new information.</i>

728
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,326
<i>The judicial authorities...</i>

729
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:44,868
<i>XAVIER
Dinner confirmed with Varins tomorrow.</i>

730
01:11:14,451 --> 01:11:17,368
Dinner out would do us good.

731
01:11:17,952 --> 01:11:20,451
- We're a bit on edge.
- Mostly you.

732
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:23,326
True.

733
01:11:23,785 --> 01:11:24,994
Dinner where?

734
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:27,785
How about Matsuda?

735
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,660
It's been ages and you like it.

736
01:11:30,952 --> 01:11:32,326
Yes, why not?

737
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,827
Tomorrow evening?

738
01:11:36,994 --> 01:11:38,577
I can't tomorrow.

739
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,285
I'll finish late.

740
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:47,493
The drone report with Isabelle.

741
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,535
Thursday if you want.

742
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:53,660
Thursday then. Great.

743
01:12:34,285 --> 01:12:35,035
<i>Test flight</i>

744
01:12:58,285 --> 01:13:00,577
<i>Copy file to flash drive?</i>

745
01:13:23,452 --> 01:13:25,493
How did you get this?

746
01:13:26,452 --> 01:13:28,035
You wanted evidence.

747
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,368
You'd better be right.

748
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:02,869
Atrian named Solignac project head.

749
01:14:04,577 --> 01:14:06,493
They just announced it.

750
01:14:18,535 --> 01:14:20,410
Claude, what's going on?

751
01:14:20,452 --> 01:14:23,452
- Why name Solignac?
- <i>Things have changed.</i>

752
01:14:23,493 --> 01:14:26,326
What do you mean? I don't understand.

753
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:28,994
<i>You can only blame yourself.</i>

754
01:14:29,535 --> 01:14:31,243
<i>You really disappoint me.</i>

755
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,785
<i>I have to go.</i>

756
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:44,910
<i>You're wanted in the Vauban room.</i>

757
01:14:46,785 --> 01:14:48,368
We wished to talk

758
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,660
about a subject that puts us
in a tricky position.

759
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:56,201
I had a very unpleasant call
from Atrian's CEO.

760
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,744
He claims we leaked information
about one of their planes.

761
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,493
You know what I mean?

762
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:06,702
No.

763
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:10,243
A warrant has been filed
on the Dubai-Paris 800.

764
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:15,326
It was issued by the BEA,
based on the initial report,

765
01:15:15,368 --> 01:15:17,410
which has an electronic signature.

766
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:19,702
It's from your laptop.

767
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:23,243
Do you see how serious this is?

768
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,577
Those tests were confidential.

769
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,535
You broke your non-disclosure agreement.

770
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:31,493
It's gross misconduct.

771
01:15:32,076 --> 01:15:33,785
You're suspended.

772
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:36,410
I'm not behind the leak.

773
01:15:36,452 --> 01:15:38,618
You can explain that later

774
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,910
in a disciplinary hearing.

775
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:43,368
Please hand over your laptop.

776
01:15:45,118 --> 01:15:46,243
You can't...

777
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:47,952
That'll be all, Noémie.

778
01:16:35,285 --> 01:16:39,160
Dorval suspended me today
for gross misconduct.

779
01:16:41,993 --> 01:16:44,118
How could you do that to me?

780
01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:52,118
I'm sorry.

781
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,951
- It shouldn't have...
- You realize

782
01:16:55,993 --> 01:16:57,493
you'll get me fired.

783
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,869
I didn't know it would leak.

784
01:17:00,535 --> 01:17:02,410
I needed the document.

785
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,243
Why? It was an attack.

786
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:06,827
- You heard that first.
- I didn't.

787
01:17:07,285 --> 01:17:10,619
I heard a ton of incoherent bullshit.

788
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,869
They stuffed the guy's laptop
with Salafist videos.

789
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:15,243
That's what's going on.

790
01:17:17,368 --> 01:17:18,619
- Fuck!
- You're mad.

791
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,327
I'm mad?

792
01:17:21,744 --> 01:17:23,493
Your dinner with Varins...

793
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:25,118
Why do you lie?

794
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,535
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me?

795
01:17:27,577 --> 01:17:30,285
To avoid a fit of paranoia like this.

796
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:31,910
Don't you realize?

797
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:35,702
I was scared of a scandal,
scared for me, my job.

798
01:17:35,993 --> 01:17:37,493
Just listen to you!

799
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:40,327
Forget the job
and ask some real questions!

800
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:41,744
I did!

801
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:45,619
Atrian got the plane certified
before it was ready!

802
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49,076
Maybe you turned a blind eye,
maybe you helped...

803
01:17:49,118 --> 01:17:50,327
You're sick.

804
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:52,619
We owe the families the truth!
300 dead!

805
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:53,868
Forget the families!

806
01:17:54,577 --> 01:17:56,243
This is about you.

807
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:57,868
Only your mad ideas count!

808
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:31,243
Mathieu, are you ok?

809
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:35,494
Are you ok?

810
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:42,743
Are you ready?

811
01:19:44,494 --> 01:19:45,368
What for?

812
01:19:45,743 --> 01:19:47,368
The test. Let's go.

813
01:20:11,785 --> 01:20:13,285
No counter-order.

814
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:15,243
There must be. Check.

815
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:22,660
Still nothing.

816
01:20:22,701 --> 01:20:24,701
Make the plane stall.

817
01:20:35,285 --> 01:20:36,160
It's working.

818
01:20:36,619 --> 01:20:38,494
- As per normal.
- Again.

819
01:20:38,535 --> 01:20:39,951
Redo the first test.

820
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:43,494
Again.

821
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:44,826
Find the problem.

822
01:20:44,868 --> 01:20:47,619
- Mathieu, I think...
- Let's find it.

823
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,035
It's not normal.

824
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:50,660
Try again.

825
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:54,494
Try again, I said.

826
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:56,077
Let me do it.

827
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,701
That's enough, Mathieu.

828
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:17,202
Wait.

829
01:21:20,452 --> 01:21:21,118
Wait.

830
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:22,993
Impossible.

831
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,619
It's the wrong box.

832
01:21:27,243 --> 01:21:28,535
The wrong box.

833
01:21:28,577 --> 01:21:30,160
Samir, turn it off.

834
01:21:30,202 --> 01:21:31,619
Wait!

835
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,243
<i>We're gonna crash!</i>

836
01:22:19,285 --> 01:22:20,660
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

837
01:22:21,993 --> 01:22:23,618
<i>We're gonna crash!</i>

838
01:22:26,535 --> 01:22:27,993
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

839
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:46,827
<i>Hi, you've reached Noémie Vasseur.
Leave a message.</i>

840
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:52,285
<i>Four weeks before opening,</i>

841
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,785
<i>the Bourget
aeronautics and space salon</i>

842
01:23:56,118 --> 01:23:58,369
<i>looks exceptional. 240 exhibitors,</i>

843
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,660
<i>150 civilian and military craft</i>

844
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,868
<i>will perform...</i>

845
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:04,077
You should go out a bit.

846
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:06,660
Don't stay in all day.

847
01:24:08,701 --> 01:24:09,952
Can you take Théo

848
01:24:10,618 --> 01:24:11,535
to the park?

849
01:24:14,952 --> 01:24:16,160
Maybe.

850
01:24:16,576 --> 01:24:18,827
<i>The order books should be full,</i>

851
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:21,077
<i>making Atrian a market leader.</i>

852
01:24:21,118 --> 01:24:22,910
Any news of the BEA?

853
01:24:25,035 --> 01:24:26,743
I'm summoned Thursday.

854
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:28,493
Explain things.

855
01:24:28,535 --> 01:24:30,660
Say what you went through.

856
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:33,369
- The endless pressure...
- Stop.

857
01:24:34,244 --> 01:24:35,493
I screwed up.

858
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,202
I screwed up, it's that simple.

859
01:24:47,285 --> 01:24:49,410
Know what? He was right.

860
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:51,660
Who was?

861
01:24:52,202 --> 01:24:52,952
Him.

862
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:57,785
A useless pilot.

863
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:00,827
A useless acoustician.

864
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:01,285
<i>Mr Vasseur?</i>

865
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,535
Yes.

866
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:05,952
<i>Hello, I'm Laura Saunier.</i>

867
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:09,160
<i>Philippe Reynal gave me your number.</i>

868
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:12,618
<i>My son was on the Dubai-Paris flight.</i>

869
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:14,702
<i>His name was Lucas.</i>

870
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,618
<i>I...</i>

871
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:19,327
<i>I need to understand what happened.</i>

872
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:24,952
Sorry, ma'am,
I'm no longer on the investigation.

873
01:26:24,993 --> 01:26:28,035
<i>Mr Reynal told me you're a good man.</i>

874
01:26:28,451 --> 01:26:30,743
<i>I'd like to know if he realized...</i>

875
01:26:31,702 --> 01:26:33,785
<i>that he was going to die.</i>

876
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:38,618
<i>My son was in seat...</i>

877
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:41,451
I can't hear you, ma'am.

878
01:26:50,326 --> 01:26:51,785
Uncle!

879
01:26:54,285 --> 01:26:56,451
Why's it flying on its own?

880
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,410
<i>- What's that noise?
- No idea...</i>

881
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:39,077
<i>What's that noise?</i>

882
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:40,994
<i>No idea. Interference.</i>

883
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:45,368
<i>I can't keep my phones on.</i>

884
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:05,451
What made you change your mind?

885
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,660
Come in.

886
01:28:34,535 --> 01:28:35,702
Come on in.

887
01:28:36,827 --> 01:28:38,535
- How are you?
- Fine.

888
01:28:38,577 --> 01:28:42,243
I don't have long,
an Air China delegation is due.

889
01:28:42,535 --> 01:28:43,827
Want a drink?

890
01:28:44,368 --> 01:28:45,451
No, thanks.

891
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:46,618
Have a seat.

892
01:28:50,577 --> 01:28:51,493
How are you?

893
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,493
What is it?

894
01:28:53,535 --> 01:28:55,077
I need your advice.

895
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:56,994
What about?

896
01:28:57,035 --> 01:29:00,660
Your firm handles computer security
for Atrian's planes?

897
01:29:01,618 --> 01:29:02,493
Yes.

898
01:29:02,535 --> 01:29:05,535
How is the 800 better protected
against hacking?

899
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:08,077
Why?

900
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:09,410
As you know,

901
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:13,493
piloting and communication systems
are hard to make secure.

902
01:29:13,743 --> 01:29:18,577
Could we imagine someone
hacking into the navigation system?

903
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,160
It's unlikely.

904
01:29:21,201 --> 01:29:23,743
Data exchange and onboard wifi

905
01:29:23,785 --> 01:29:25,660
cause new flaws.

906
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:27,952
Couldn't hackers exploit them?

907
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:31,702
We work to remedy that.

908
01:29:31,743 --> 01:29:36,869
Could some geek enter the pilot system
via the in-flight entertainment?

909
01:29:37,285 --> 01:29:40,326
Impossible,
the two are physically separate.

910
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:43,035
Passenger cabin data on one side,

911
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:46,035
the cockpit on the other.
Separate networks.

912
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:51,577
At the ENAC reception,
didn't you vaunt a single-fibre network?

913
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:54,743
Networks can be separate
on the same cable.

914
01:29:55,577 --> 01:29:57,660
Don't you know about computing?

915
01:29:59,952 --> 01:30:02,535
You think the flight was hacked?

916
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:03,743
Yes.

917
01:30:03,785 --> 01:30:07,160
And that, as network chief,
you knew in real time.

918
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:13,535
First, an auto-pilot problem,

919
01:30:13,577 --> 01:30:15,660
now hacking, what next?

920
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,368
A new theory every day?

921
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,910
Your job is to analyse recordings,

922
01:30:20,952 --> 01:30:22,452
not to make stuff up.

923
01:30:22,493 --> 01:30:24,952
I believe Pollock falsified the CVR.

924
01:30:25,243 --> 01:30:27,368
He was alone from midnight to 2 am.

925
01:30:28,743 --> 01:30:30,577
And you asked him to do it.

926
01:30:37,702 --> 01:30:39,243
What can I say?

927
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:42,910
You're pathetic.

928
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,326
I have to work now.

929
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:47,702
Xavier Renaud

930
01:30:47,744 --> 01:30:49,618
ignored a security flaw?

931
01:30:49,869 --> 01:30:52,410
Altering a line of code costs a million

932
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:55,326
and takes a year to be certified,
so yes.

933
01:30:55,368 --> 01:30:57,910
No one could delay the market launch.

934
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,118
Maybe,

935
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,326
but there's no proof of a fault.

936
01:31:02,452 --> 01:31:05,285
We've only seen one case
of plane hacking.

937
01:31:05,618 --> 01:31:08,368
A guy was arrested on landing in Warsaw.

938
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:12,326
He said he altered airspeed
via the in-flight entertainment.

939
01:31:12,785 --> 01:31:14,785
- Got his name?
- Hold on.

940
01:31:19,326 --> 01:31:20,660
Apparently, it's...

941
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,660
David Keller.

942
01:31:23,035 --> 01:31:25,952
These guys love to use their real names.

943
01:31:31,785 --> 01:31:33,910
<i>Flights interrupted in Vienna</i>

944
01:31:37,285 --> 01:31:39,952
<i>Computing breakdown at Vienna airport</i>

945
01:31:44,994 --> 01:31:47,660
<i>We now know more about the incident.</i>

946
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:51,827
<i>Austrian police arrested
a French citizen at the airport.</i>

947
01:31:51,869 --> 01:31:54,994
<i>David Keller,
a computer security technician,</i>

948
01:31:55,035 --> 01:31:57,285
<i>claimed to have hacked a plane before.</i>

949
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:03,076
<i>This looks huge.</i>

950
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:06,285
<i>Keller was fired
after three months at Pegase.</i>

951
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,035
<i>Now he's vanished.</i>

952
01:32:08,076 --> 01:32:10,577
<i>No sign of him since last June.</i>

953
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,535
Caroline, I'll call you back.

954
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,035
What's that noise?

955
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,201
No idea.

956
01:34:05,243 --> 01:34:06,243
<i>Interference.</i>

957
01:34:09,201 --> 01:34:11,535
<i>I can't keep my phones on.</i>

958
01:34:15,035 --> 01:34:16,535
He wanted publicity?

959
01:34:16,577 --> 01:34:19,118
To show the fault, not wreck the plane.

960
01:34:19,535 --> 01:34:21,535
The MHD wasn't faulty,

961
01:34:21,577 --> 01:34:24,535
but it couldn't handle
contradictory orders

962
01:34:24,577 --> 01:34:26,327
from both Keller and the pilots.

963
01:34:27,368 --> 01:34:29,035
You can't prove it.

964
01:34:29,076 --> 01:34:31,702
We have the photo of Keller onboard.

965
01:34:31,744 --> 01:34:33,118
You see Keller.

966
01:34:33,493 --> 01:34:35,827
He isn't on the manifest.

967
01:34:36,243 --> 01:34:38,452
I know. He must have been erased.

968
01:34:41,785 --> 01:34:43,868
Are you on my side?

969
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:45,827
You came looking for me.

970
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,744
Will you do the article?

971
01:34:57,243 --> 01:35:01,243
<i>CEO's Cessna found
in the English Channel</i>

972
01:35:01,744 --> 01:35:02,660
At the time,

973
01:35:02,702 --> 01:35:05,285
a whistle-blower contacted a colleague.

974
01:35:05,826 --> 01:35:07,577
The informer claimed,

975
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:10,327
with documents,
that the engine fractured.

976
01:35:11,243 --> 01:35:13,868
But when the wreckage was found,

977
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,535
the engine was intact.

978
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:19,202
The investigation showed the pilot
overdid the trim.

979
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:22,494
My colleague is categorical.

980
01:35:22,868 --> 01:35:25,619
The documents
had to come from the BEA.

981
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,160
It was you?

982
01:35:28,951 --> 01:35:29,951
Am I wrong?

983
01:35:29,993 --> 01:35:32,868
I heard the propeller shaft snap.

984
01:35:33,243 --> 01:35:36,118
You thought you did,
but you were wrong.

985
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:39,535
I couldn't wait
until they found the wreckage,

986
01:35:39,826 --> 01:35:41,744
with other planes flying.

987
01:35:41,785 --> 01:35:43,327
But you were wrong.

988
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:46,744
You should have told me.

989
01:35:46,785 --> 01:35:48,660
How can I trust you now?

990
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:51,285
Don't drop me. I know I'm right.

991
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:52,452
Sorry, Mathieu.

992
01:35:52,951 --> 01:35:53,868
You're a risk.

993
01:35:54,202 --> 01:35:55,202
Count me out.

994
01:35:56,785 --> 01:35:57,785
Wait.

995
01:36:15,285 --> 01:36:16,494
Noémie, please.

996
01:36:16,535 --> 01:36:18,327
Just give me five minutes.

997
01:36:18,785 --> 01:36:21,785
Blame me. Say I stole the document.

998
01:36:22,202 --> 01:36:23,619
Say it was my fault.

999
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:26,202
I'll talk to them.
They'll reinstate you.

1000
01:36:26,535 --> 01:36:30,077
You have to help.
I have no other solution.

1001
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:32,910
I'll be fired, no one believes me.

1002
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:35,202
But I know the truth about the crash.

1003
01:36:35,243 --> 01:36:36,826
It's all I have left.

1004
01:36:37,868 --> 01:36:39,160
All I have.

1005
01:36:39,577 --> 01:36:42,077
If you go back, they'll believe you.

1006
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:43,160
Wait.

1007
01:36:43,202 --> 01:36:45,702
I was wrong. It was on the CVR.

1008
01:36:45,743 --> 01:36:48,202
The interference, the pilots' phones...

1009
01:36:48,243 --> 01:36:50,327
It was a hacking job, see.

1010
01:36:51,452 --> 01:36:53,660
- Listen to me.
- Let go!

1011
01:36:53,702 --> 01:36:56,619
- Listen...
- Get out of my life!

1012
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,660
Mathieu, this is a difficult decision.

1013
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:14,243
You know how I appreciate your work.

1014
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:18,410
You also know a collective approach
is crucial here.

1015
01:37:20,826 --> 01:37:23,035
You ignored that in recent weeks

1016
01:37:23,077 --> 01:37:26,452
and followed your instincts,
not for the first time.

1017
01:37:28,951 --> 01:37:30,743
You've gone too far.

1018
01:37:35,077 --> 01:37:37,785
I'll have to ask for your transfer.

1019
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:51,577
Excuse me, I need
the Dauphin crash data.

1020
01:37:51,868 --> 01:37:53,369
I can't access it.

1021
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:57,785
Sorry, I need all your files.

1022
01:38:08,494 --> 01:38:11,701
<i>Modified: 11/10/2020 5:12 am</i>

1023
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,118
- You worked on it?
- I can't open it.

1024
01:38:15,535 --> 01:38:17,327
Only Pollock and you could.

1025
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,826
I'm in a hurry.

1026
01:38:21,868 --> 01:38:24,327
I'll collect the files and send them.

1027
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,077
Ok. Thanks.

1028
01:40:31,285 --> 01:40:31,910
<i>Searching...</i>

1029
01:40:42,868 --> 01:40:44,452

01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,576
<i>to join the A86.</i>

1031
01:40:52,244 --> 01:40:53,660
Had any news?

1032
01:40:54,493 --> 01:40:55,327
Sorry?

1033
01:40:55,369 --> 01:40:57,035
Of the hearing.

1034
01:40:57,077 --> 01:40:58,827
It meets in ten days.

1035
01:41:00,244 --> 01:41:01,868
My offer still stands.

1036
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:03,576
I'd love you to join us.

1037
01:41:04,118 --> 01:41:06,035
Thank you. I'm touched.

1038
01:41:07,035 --> 01:41:08,618
I'll think it over.

1039
01:41:11,743 --> 01:41:12,701
Seen Mathieu?

1040
01:41:14,035 --> 01:41:15,327
How's he doing?

1041
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,910
Badly.

1042
01:41:20,451 --> 01:41:21,952
It's awful.

1043
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:25,701
He got so wound up
over the investigation.

1044
01:41:27,285 --> 01:41:30,660
He was totally obsessed
about the black box.

1045
01:41:31,743 --> 01:41:33,410
God knows what he heard.

1046
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,785
Exactly, it was inaudible.

1047
01:41:35,827 --> 01:41:37,660
The pilots took off their phones.

1048
01:41:42,202 --> 01:41:43,285
How did you know that?

1049
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:48,952
About the headphones.

1050
01:41:50,244 --> 01:41:51,785
It's in the report.

1051
01:41:53,451 --> 01:41:55,077
The BEA already published it?

1052
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,327
No, Atrian got it early.

1053
01:42:26,202 --> 01:42:27,244
Excuse me.

1054
01:42:27,285 --> 01:42:29,410
The Dubai-Paris manifest.

1055
01:42:29,785 --> 01:42:32,244
Shall I give it to Balsan tomorrow?

1056
01:42:32,285 --> 01:42:33,285
Who requested it?

1057
01:42:33,785 --> 01:42:34,660
Mathieu.

1058
01:42:36,827 --> 01:42:37,660
Give it to me.

1059
01:42:39,702 --> 01:42:41,493
We had the manifest.

1060
01:42:41,535 --> 01:42:43,535
He wanted the boarding copy.

1061
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,244
Did he say why?

1062
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:48,368
Attention to detail.

1063
01:42:48,952 --> 01:42:50,493
You know him.

1064
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:53,077
Thank you.

1065
01:43:01,077 --> 01:43:02,160

<i>It's me. I have to see you.</i>

1073
01:44:16,576 --> 01:44:19,827
Meet me at the apartment.
It's important.

1074
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,493
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1075
01:44:23,368 --> 01:44:24,493
Yes.

1076
01:44:24,535 --> 01:44:26,994
<i>Listen, I don't know but...</i>

1077
01:44:28,119 --> 01:44:29,868
maybe I was too hasty.

1078
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:32,785
Something's weird.
I need to talk to you.

1079
01:44:35,577 --> 01:44:37,285
<i>Why aren't you speaking?</i>

1080
01:44:37,743 --> 01:44:38,952
<i>Where are you?</i>

1081
01:44:38,994 --> 01:44:40,202
Don't worry.

1082
01:44:41,368 --> 01:44:43,577
I'll see you in an hour, ok?

1083
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,827
I love you.

1084
01:45:14,702 --> 01:45:15,618
Thank you.

1085
01:45:16,243 --> 01:45:17,326
Need a ride?

1086
01:45:17,952 --> 01:45:19,201
I'll get a cab.

1087
01:45:19,493 --> 01:45:20,326
Sure?

1088
01:45:20,702 --> 01:45:22,243
Yes, really.

1089
01:45:27,952 --> 01:45:30,618
<i>Continue 90 metres.</i>

1090

<i>We're serving breakfast.</i>

1096
01:49:46,327 --> 01:49:48,619
<i>It may get rocky. Let them know.</i>

1097
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:49,951
<i>Ok, I'll get your meal.</i>

1098
01:49:54,535 --> 01:49:57,160
<i>Sooner than I thought. Seatbelt time.</i>

1099
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:00,951
<i>See those cbs on the right?</i>

1100
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:03,327
<i>We were right to avoid them.</i>

1101
01:50:03,368 --> 01:50:04,993
<i>It looks clear ahead.</i>

1102
01:50:05,035 --> 01:50:08,118
<i>The CDG update.
Westerly landing, visibility 3000 m,</i>

1103
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,410
<i>rain, clouds at 800 feet, 8° C
and 1014 QNH.</i>

1104
01:50:11,452 --> 01:50:14,243
<i>Stuck at home with the kids again.</i>

1105
01:50:14,285 --> 01:50:17,327
<i>- Where do you live?
- Just north of CDG.</i>

1106
01:50:17,619 --> 01:50:19,869
<i>22° today in Biarritz.</i>

1107
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:22,076
<i>You live there? Not too far?</i>

1108
01:50:22,118 --> 01:50:24,535
<i>My wife's Basque and I surf.</i>

1109
01:50:24,577 --> 01:50:25,827
<i>We had no choice.</i>

1110
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,285
<i>What's that noise?</i>

1111
01:50:32,076 --> 01:50:33,910
No idea. Interference.

1112
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:40,993
I can't keep my phones on.

1113
01:50:58,035 --> 01:50:59,076
What was that?

1114
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:00,202
I didn't see.

1115
01:51:00,493 --> 01:51:01,744
<i>The route changed.</i>

1116
01:51:01,785 --> 01:51:03,076
Is the FMS screwed?

1117
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:05,493
AP off.

1118
01:51:06,993 --> 01:51:08,327
Taking the controls.

1119
01:51:21,493 --> 01:51:22,160
What is this shit?

1120

<i>The AP is back on alone.</i>

1121
01:51:57,744 --> 01:51:59,243
We're descending.

1122
01:51:59,285 --> 01:52:01,160
I know. Are you doing it?

1123
01:52:01,202 --> 01:52:02,535
No, I'm not.

1124
01:52:02,577 --> 01:52:03,535
Let me try.

1125
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:10,076
<i>It's not reacting!</i>

1126
01:52:12,035 --> 01:52:13,744
<i>I'll override the FCC.</i>

1127
01:52:16,535 --> 01:52:18,535
The system isn't reacting.

1128
01:52:46,285 --> 01:52:47,785
Mountains below.

1129
01:52:47,826 --> 01:52:49,076
<i>The limit's at 15 000.</i>

1130
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:50,118
Pull with me.

1131
01:52:50,702 --> 01:52:52,243
- Pull!
- I am pulling!

1132
01:52:52,285 --> 01:52:53,702
Nothing's reacting!

1133
01:52:54,951 --> 01:52:56,826
<i>Cabin crew, emergency descent.</i>

1134
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:14,368
<i>Someone has taken control.</i>

1135
01:53:15,494 --> 01:53:17,452
<i>They're piloting, not us.</i>

1136
01:53:18,077 --> 01:53:19,868
<i>We're gonna crash!</i>

1137
01:53:36,327 --> 01:53:37,369
<i>Mathieu,</i>

1138
01:53:37,785 --> 01:53:39,494
<i>I suppose you're watching.</i>

1139
01:53:40,285 --> 01:53:42,743
<i>It means I was right about you.</i>

1140
01:53:43,494 --> 01:53:46,035
<i>It also means no one will find me.</i>

1141
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:48,951
<i>So go public with what follows.</i>

1142
01:53:51,035 --> 01:53:52,785
<i>My name is Victor Pollock.</i>

1143
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:56,202
<i>I spent 20 years as a BEA analyst.</i>

1144
01:53:56,910 --> 01:54:01,826
<i>A few years ago, Xavier Renaud,
CEO of Pegase Security, contacted me.</i>

1145
01:54:02,619 --> 01:54:07,535
<i>He wanted advance information
to fix minor faults on Atrian planes.</i>

1146
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:09,743
<i>He paid well.</i>

1147
01:54:10,202 --> 01:54:11,660
<i>I needed money.</i>

1148
01:54:12,452 --> 01:54:17,077
<i>I didn't see it as corruption,
just as a way to avoid bureaucracy.</i>

1149
01:54:19,327 --> 01:54:23,243
<i>But once we knew each other better,
he asked for more.</i>

1150
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:26,951
<i>I had to correct certain conclusions,</i>

1151
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:30,535
<i>focus investigations on human factors.</i>

1152
01:54:31,785 --> 01:54:33,118
<i>I was trapped.</i>

1153
01:54:35,826 --> 01:54:37,826
<i>Then the 800 crashed.</i>

1154
01:54:39,535 --> 01:54:42,951
<i>This time, he asked me
to alter the black boxes.</i>

1155
01:54:44,868 --> 01:54:47,993
<i>I refused,
but he threatened to destroy me.</i>

1156
01:54:49,285 --> 01:54:51,118
<i>I don't seek forgiveness.</i>

1157
01:54:51,951 --> 01:54:55,160
<i>I probably deserve what awaits me.</i>

1158
01:54:56,202 --> 01:54:58,535
<i>But the man behind it must be exposed.</i>

1159
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,243
<i>Mathieu,</i>

1160
01:55:02,369 --> 01:55:06,993
<i>I didn't take you to the crash
as you might have found something.</i>

1161
01:55:07,535 --> 01:55:09,118
<i>I know how good you are.</i>

1162
01:55:10,701 --> 01:55:13,952
<i>And I'm recording this now
because I trust you.</i>

1163
01:55:55,785 --> 01:55:57,160
<i>Basement - Lab</i>

1164
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:46,285
The basement.

1165
01:57:13,868 --> 01:57:14,952
<i>Basement speakers</i>

1166
01:57:15,535 --> 01:57:16,868
<i>- Pull!
- I am pulling!</i>

1167
01:57:16,910 --> 01:57:18,369
<i>Nothing's reacting!</i>

1168
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:20,785
<i>Cabin crew, emergency descent.</i>

1169
01:58:44,202 --> 01:58:45,743
<i>Turn around.</i>

1170
01:58:47,035 --> 01:58:48,410
<i>Turn around.</i>

1171
01:58:53,493 --> 01:58:54,410
Jesus!

1172
01:58:59,202 --> 01:59:00,035
Fuck!

1173
02:01:15,285 --> 02:01:16,243
Noémie!

1174
02:01:17,702 --> 02:01:18,451
Are you ok?

1175
02:01:18,952 --> 02:01:19,868
I'm good.

1176
02:01:21,035 --> 02:01:23,535
- Attending my speech?
- Too busy.

1177
02:01:23,577 --> 02:01:26,119
I have the Thales conference at 6.

1178
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,994
Of course.

1179
02:01:27,577 --> 02:01:28,952
I'm glad you came.

1180
02:01:28,994 --> 02:01:31,326
I was going crazy at home.

1181
02:01:32,618 --> 02:01:34,368
If you need anything, ask.

1182
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,952
Our generation

1183
02:01:40,994 --> 02:01:43,577
is slowly coming to terms with the idea

1184
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,326
that pilots will vanish one day.

1185
02:01:47,077 --> 02:01:50,326
The challenge is to protect
and secure planes

1186
02:01:50,368 --> 02:01:53,618
in which artificial intelligence
is predominant.

1187
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:57,618
Some say our ambitions are excessive,

1188
02:01:57,869 --> 02:02:00,493
calling us the Icarus of aeronautics.

1189
02:02:01,535 --> 02:02:05,785
Icarus flew too close to the sun,
his wax wings melted,

1190
02:02:05,827 --> 02:02:07,785
he fell into the sea and died.

1191
02:02:09,243 --> 02:02:12,451
I never really knew
if the moral of the tale

1192
02:02:12,493 --> 02:02:14,910
was do not fly too high,

1193
02:02:14,952 --> 02:02:16,451
as people think,

1194
02:02:16,785 --> 02:02:20,201
or forget wax and feathers
to build better wings.

1195
02:02:22,410 --> 02:02:25,243
In a perpetual quest for innovation...

1196
02:02:28,869 --> 02:02:30,869
Pegase Security is proud to...

1197
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,535
<i>My name is Victor Pollock.</i>

1198
02:02:34,285 --> 02:02:36,869
<i>I spent 20 years as a BEA analyst.</i>

1199
02:02:37,618 --> 02:02:40,119
<i>A few years ago, Xavier Renaud</i>

1200
02:02:40,535 --> 02:02:42,035
<i>contacted me.</i>

1201
02:02:43,952 --> 02:02:48,368
<i>He wanted advance information
to fix minor faults on Atrian planes.</i>

1202
02:02:48,910 --> 02:02:51,577
<i>He paid well. I needed money.</i>

1203
02:02:52,077 --> 02:02:55,910
<i>I didn't see it as corruption,
just as a way to avoid bureaucracy.</i>

1204
02:02:57,493 --> 02:03:00,994
<i>But once we knew each other better,
he asked for more.</i>

1205
02:03:01,035 --> 02:03:02,910
<i>The black boxes doctored</i>

1206
02:03:02,952 --> 02:03:04,952
<i>I had to correct conclusions,</i>

1207
02:03:04,994 --> 02:03:07,077
<i>focus investigations</i>

1208
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:08,577
<i>on human factors.</i>

1209
02:03:09,994 --> 02:03:11,160
<i>I was trapped.</i>

1210
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,326
<i>Then the 800 crashed.</i>

1211
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:18,910
<i>This time, he asked me
to alter the black boxes.</i>

1212
02:03:19,618 --> 02:03:22,368
<i>A fresh twist
in the Dubai-Paris crash.</i>

1213
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:26,618
<i>A BEA investigator's revelations
have created an upheaval.</i>

1214
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:29,452
<i>It seems hacking led to the tragedy,</i>

1215
02:03:29,493 --> 02:03:31,618
<i>with the black boxes altered.</i>

1216
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:35,660
<i>We're now joining the head of the BEA,
Philippe Rénier.</i>

1217
02:03:36,285 --> 02:03:39,535
<i>The BEA has received
a copy of the recording</i>

1218
02:03:39,577 --> 02:03:42,410
<i>of the Dubai-Paris
cockpit conversations.</i>

1219
02:03:43,201 --> 02:03:45,243
<i>If it proves to be authentic,</i>

1220
02:03:45,285 --> 02:03:48,368
<i>it will confirm our latest findings...</i>

1221
