<i>Computers and
conscious robots.</i>

<i>The people deteriorated
into a state of apathy.</i>

<i>After the Great Revolt,</i>

315
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,345
How do the Fremen
survive there?

316
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,347
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

317
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,049
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

318

They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

Yes.

Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

322

Could the spice
affect us in other ways?

323
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,529
Many dangers exist
on Arrakis.

324
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,591
For one,

325
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,234
the Harkonnens
would not have given up

326

their CHOAM Company contract
so easily.

327

The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.

328

But behind them,
I suspect, is the Emperor.

This one kills

01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,432
You didn't fare bad.

799
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,467
Sit down, Thufir.

800
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,141
My lord.

801
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,440
Thufir,

802
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,781
where is this traitor?

803
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,224
I know
you've cleared everyone,

804
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,453
especially those
close to us.

805
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,656
But recheck and find him.

806

<i>(Duke Leto) They have tried
to take the life of my son.</i>

807
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,440
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.

808
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,144
Take it, Thufir.

809
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:42,449
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over

810
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,715
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

[Whirring]

812

8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

813
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,695
The palace
is now secure.

814
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:05,065
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

815
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:09,304
We have troops here
headquartered underground

816
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,709
on sub-floors
6 through 10.

817
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,509
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen

818
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,710
and we have
some on the airfield.

819
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,185
Our new army is
still in training,

820
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,951
but everything,
everything is shielded.

821
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:25,152
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

822
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:28,852
Kynes...

823
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,625
Kynes...

824
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,695
Dr. Kynes is waiting.

825
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,534
He is the Emperor's
Judge of the Change

826
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,369
monitoring the evacuation
of the Harkonnens

827
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,636
and our taking control.

828
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:46,076
He plans on taking you

829
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,379
on an inspection
of the spice mining operation.

830
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:53,879
Now, he may or may not

831
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,086
be sympathetic to our cause.
But, Sire,

832
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,852
with the attempt
on the young master,

833
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,799
I am against your
leaving the palace.

834
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,830
The attempt failed.

835
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,804
Harkonnen captives
have already been taken.

836
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,307
We must crush the Harkonnen
machine on Arrakis.

837
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,672
You all know what to do!

838
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:29,890
Gurney, we desperately need
more spice miners.

839
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,619
Many are threatening to leave
on the next shuttle.

840
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,391
We need spice drivers,
weather scanners, dunemen.

841
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,557
Any with open sand experience.

842
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,227
You must persuade them
to enlist with us.

843
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:49,604
"They shall come
all for violence."

844
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,177
"Their faces shall
sup up as the east wind."

845
01:10:56,552 --> 01:11:00,318
"And they will gather
the captivity of the sand."

846
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,321
Very moving, Gurney.

847
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,458
On your way.

848
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,997
And take care of Doctor Kynes
until Paul and I arrive.

849
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,630
We will not be prisoners here
in this place.

850
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:24,543
Behold, as a wild ass in the
desert go I forth to my work.

851
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:31,208
[Chuckling]

852
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,425
Yes?

853
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,827
I am the Shadout Mapes.

854
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,664
Your housekeeper,
noble-born.

855
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,676
What are your orders?

856
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,801
You may refer to
me as "my lady".

857
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,841
I'm not noble-born.

858
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,179
I'm the bound concubine
of Duke Leto,

859
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,048
mother of the heir designate.

860
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:08,923
"Shadout."

861
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,357
That's an ancient word.

862
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,862
You know the ancient tongues?

863
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,365
I know many things.

864
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,360
I know you came
prepared for violence

865
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,100
with a weapon
in your bodice.

866
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,274
My lady,

867
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,675
the weapon was
sent as a gift,

868
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,044
if you should
prove to be the one.

869
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,141
And the means of my death

870
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,977
should I prove otherwise.

871
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:42,113
[Yelling]

872
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,429
My lady,

873
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:53,629
when one has lived
with prophecy for so long,

874
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:58,367
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

875
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,712
<i>(Man on PA system)
Duke Leto is now here.</i>

876
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,409
<i>Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.</i>

877
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,468
So you are Doctor Kynes.

878
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,437
The Judge of the Change.

879
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,770
And the Imperial Ecologist,
Sire.

880
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,741
Our intelligence
informs us

881
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,438
that there's still
a strong Harkonnen presence.

882
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,743
The process of removal
continues.

883
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,308
This is my son, Paul.

884
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,044
Are you a Fremen?

885
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,382
I've been on Arrakis

886
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,583
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

887
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,717
<i>(Paul)
In the service of the Emperor.</i>

888
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,691
We are in your hands,
Doctor.

889
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,287
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

890
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,265
Would you give us an
explanation of their workings?

891
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,796
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

892
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,097
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

893
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,471
Basically...

894
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,570
(Duke Leto)
It's all right, Gurney.

895
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,275
Yes, Sire.

896
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,649
Basically,
it's a high-efficiency filter

897
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,021
and heat exchange system.

898
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,423
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

899
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,787
and is gathered
in the second.

900
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,727
The salt is separated.

901
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:32,600
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

902
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,863
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

903
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,940
from which you can drink
through this tube

904
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,674
around your neck.

905
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,504
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

906
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:49,012
Should you be in
the open desert,

907
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,051
remember to breathe in
through your mouth

908
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,587
and out through
this nose tube.

909
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:57,348
With a Fremen suit in
good working condition,

910
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,553
life can be sustained
for weeks,

911
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,820
even in
the deep desert, Sire.

912
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,823
My thanks.

913
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,859
With your permission.

914
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:12,067
You've worn
a stillsuit before.

915
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,530
No.

916
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,274
Your suit is fitted
desert fashion.

917
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,276
Who told you
how to do that?

918
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,178
No one.

919
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,817
It seemed
the proper way.

920
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,386
That it is.

921
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:31,218
<i>(Dr. Kynes) He shall know

<i>protective Shield Wall

934
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,511
Will we see a worm?

935
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:06,643
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

936
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:07,620
Always?

937
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:08,815
Always.

938
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,085
Why do they come?

939
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,119
To protect
their territory.

940
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,287
Vibrations attract them.

<i>He's hiding something
about the spice.</i>

944
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,768
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

945
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:34,239
As I said,
they defend the spice sands.

946
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,584
As to their relationship
with the spice,

947
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,115
who knows?

948
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,085
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

949
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,992
That's it. Spice mining.

950
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,057
No other cloud quite like it.

951
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,500
See the spotters over it?

952
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,162
They're watching
for wormsign,

953
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,002
the telltale sand waves.

954
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,642
Seismic probes on the surface,
too, Sire.

955
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:07,673
Worms can travel too deep
for their waves to show.

956
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,111
Looks like
a good patch of spice.

957
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,087
