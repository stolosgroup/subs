00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,649
<i>Well, it's gonna
be a big night, right?</i>

3
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,725
<i>I mean,
how much are we looking at?</i>

4
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,488
<i>I'll give you five a head.</i>

5
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,959
Five a head? Fuck you.

6
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,125
There's tiki bars in Encino
that pay more than that.

7
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,740
We're gonna
pull out on you, then.

8
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,762
<i>How about I guarantee you
500 heads</i>

9
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,800
And you fucking bump us
up to seven?

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>You pull 500 girls
in the club,</i>

11
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,567
<i>I'll give you fucking head.</i>

12
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,766
<i>Wait, am I on speaker?</i>

13
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,137
<i>Yeah, my phone's broke.</i>

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,300
What time is Cole's set?

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,780
<i>Oh, yeah, Cole.
I got him down at 9:00 p.m.</i>

16
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,437
Who's going on at 11:00?

18
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,176
<i>Uh, DJ Gavin playing at 11:00.</i>

19
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,417
Does DJ Gavin have 25
Kappa Alpha Alpha mega-sluts

20
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,956
coming in a fucking party bus?

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,855
'Cause they ain't gonna
be there until 11:00.

22
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,222
You know,
be a fucking gentleman, Nicky.

23
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,555
<i>Be a gentleman? Fuck you, kid.</i>

24
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,493
<i>11:00.
And fix your goddamn phone.</i>

25
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,861
All right, bitch.

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,262
I got you, boo!

27
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,303
Primetime!

28
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,830
You know, it's a major night
for my boy, all right?

29
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,004
Just, you know, cut loose.

30
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,338
Bring whoever. Bring them all.

31
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,809
Bring them all.
The girl with the dimples.

32
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,969
See you then.

33
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,840
- 150 heads.
- Nice, man.

34
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,417
Ooh! No, thanks.

35
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,618
And the squirrel
came scurrying up the tree.

36
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,079
Yo, yo.

37
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,347
Get out. I'm driving.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,687
- What?
- Get out. I'm driving.

39
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,599
Get in. Get in. Come on.

40
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,459
There he is.

41
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,163
Wearing a leather jacket
in the summertime.

42
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,366
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
<i>- Good God.</i>

43
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,372
Five, four, three,

44
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,381
two, one.

45
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,254
James Reed. Thursday. Social.

46
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,585
You should come out to Social.
James Reed is headlining.

47
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,826
How are you doing?
Do you like, uh...

48
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:08,933
Do you like electronic music?

49
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,161
Your nose job looks great.

50
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:12,927
Do you promise?

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,698
James Reed. Social. Thursdays.
Bring a friend.

52
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,865
Bring all your friends.
If they look like you, bring 'em all.

53
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,237
Here, here, all of you guys.

54
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,901
Girl, you want to come out
on Thursday?

55
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,172
James Reed is DJing.

56
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,111
Social. Thursdays.
I'll take care of you.

57
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,238
Okay.

58
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,509
Here, put your number
in my phone.

59
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,175
If you guys bring, like,
a couple of friends,

60
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,515
I can get you a free bottle.
It's Cole, by the way.

61
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,623
See you Thursday.

62
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,945
I should have gone to college.

63
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:37,525
<i>This is the San Fernando Valley,
that flat stretch of land</i>

64
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,255
<i>on the other side
of the Hollywood Hills.</i>

65
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,593
<i>Our greatest contributions

66

<i>remain the porn industry
and ditsy girls.</i>

67
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,997
<i>But we've also got the best sushi
in the western hemisphere.</i>

68
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,072
<i>And it's always
in a strip mall. Always.</i>

69
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,103
<i>That's my friend
Mason's house.</i>

70
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,714
<i>And that's the pool house
in the back</i>

71
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,316

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,514
<i>And these are my friends.</i>

76
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,794
Shh.

77
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,802
Yo, yo. The fact is that 99%
of all people in this world,

78
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,436
they're looking for a party.
Okay?

79
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,014
And 1% of people,
they are the party.

80
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,275
You gotta fucking be that.

81
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,818
You know, your body is 85% water
and I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty.

82
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,022
This isn't some unce unce
bridge-and-tunnel bullshit.

83
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,148
This is the best
dance party in L.A.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,452
And that guy right there...

85
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,992
- He's DJing.
- I'm DJing.

86
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,288
Just the side room, though.

87
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,418
Just the side room.

88
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,071
<i>These days
you can invent an app,</i>

89
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,463
<i>start a blog,
sell shit online.</i>

90
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,590
<i>But if you're a DJ,</i>

91
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,795
<i>all you need is a laptop,
some talent and one track.</i>

92
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,936
<i>That track is your ticket
to everything.</i>

93
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,511
Man, DJing, producing,
look, it's hard.

94
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,639
It's a saturated market.

95
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,844
Yeah. 'Cause there's not
enough actors in L.A.

96
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,010
I'm not an actor.

97
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,948
I'm a movie star.

98
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,120
This is gonna be the best...

99
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,351
- The best...
- The best...

100
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,001
- The best night...
- The best night...

101
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,120
The best night of your life.

102
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,309
You're so fucking
pretty, Ollie. Like an angel.

103
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,166
Get off me.
You smell like shit.

104
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,069
<i>This one's off Beachwood.</i>

105
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,303
Four bedrooms, a party deck.

106
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,003
<i>Two hundred square-foot
dining room.</i>

107
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,306
<i>Perfect for entertaining.</i>

108
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,313
You know, we could turn the
dining room into our office.

109
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:41,011
Mase, uh, dude, the cheapest
place here is six grand.

110
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,882
I mean, you don't have
enough money to fix your car.

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,145
Hey!

112
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,315
- With Ollie's drug money...
- Shut up.

113
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,892
...and our nights at Social
blowing up, okay,

114
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,255
we're gonna be
out of the Valley

115
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,624
by the end of this summer.

116
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,295
<i>Okay? And I feel...</i>

117
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,899
<i>Look, I feel really
fucking good about Thursday.</i>

118
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,729
I mean, like, like so good,
like when Jenny Haze

119
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,268
put her finger
up my asshole good, dude.

120
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,665
Like that kind of good.

121
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,873
Dude, that was your finger.

122
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,996
That was your finger.

123
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,539
I'm pretty sure
she wasn't even there.

124
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,664
Jenna Haze's fingers.

125
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:05,971
Listen, believe in me?

126
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,340
'Cause I believe in you.

127
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,915
What's up, kids?
Good to see you, bro.

128
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,984
You're looking sharp
as ever, Paige.

129
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,108
Yeah, you, too, man.

130
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,089
Hey, you know my boys.
Squirrel, Cole and Mason.

131
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,554
<i>What's up?</i>

132
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,023
Young hustlers' club.
I like it, I like it.

133
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,526
We prefer to be called
entrepreneurs but, uh...

134
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,060
You're an entrepreneur!
My kind of guy.

135
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,689
Yo, Paige, man, you should come to
the new spot, Social, on Thursday.

136
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:29,892
- Social?
- I'll take care of you.

137
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,400
<i>You're gonna
take care of me, huh?</i>

138
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,765
- That's right.
- Tell you what,

139
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,830
whenever you guys are ready to
start making some real loot,

140
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,238
you need to holler at me,
you know, bring the boys.

141
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,777
<i>You do that.
Think about it, huh?</i>

142
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,346
I'll tell you what, brunch is
on me, all right, fellas?

143
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,710
Bye-bye.

144
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,847
Why is he talking about money?
What money?

145
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,320
Man,
Paige is always recruiting.

146
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,625
For what? Doesn't he, like,
produce porn?

147
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,385
No, he's in real estate,
assface.

148
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,076
Can he just, what,
get us a house, then?

149
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,219
We're sitting here
talking about houses...

150
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,855
No, no, no. He's like
a real estate businessman.

151
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,236
What does that mean?

152
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,497
I don't know what that is.

153
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,407
Okay, I'm not exactly sure
what he does.

154
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,736
But...

155
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,264
<i>He's making
a lot of money doing it.</i>

156
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,212
Mason.

157
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,076
Mason.

158
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,118
I asked you three times to
work on that roof yesterday.

159
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,477
The toilet's still broken.

160
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,419
Okay.
I'll fucking do it later.

161
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,649
Now.

162
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,420
- Okay.
- You, too, Cole.

163
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,262
Sorry, my dad's such a dick.

164
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,693
Later, Pop.

165
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

166
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,304
All right,
this is for you, Squirrel.

167
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,640
Yo, I got one. I got one.
I got one.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,674
This moment right here,
with all of you guys,

169
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,181
this is honestly
my favorite part of the night.

170
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,412
It's the moment
before it starts.

171
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,437
Mason. Mason,
where's my 500, bro?

172
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,250
You see
the fucking line outside?

173
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,079
You can wait to thank me till
the end of the night, 'kay?

174
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,278
Hey, you. Do not play
any of the songs on that list.

175
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,480
Do you understand me?

176
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,318
Save <i>Firepower</i> for Mr. Reed.

177
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,722
Ooh! Hello, beautiful.

178
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,454
You look so fucking important
with that list in your hand.

179
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,962
Here you go.

180
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,759
- What's up, Devin?
- What's up, Cole?

181
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:48,958
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, man.

182
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,089
- Good.
- Yeah.

183
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,999
Warming the room up for you.
It's all good.

184
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,165
- Thanks, bro.
- Hey, buddy.

185
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,933
All right, have fun, man.

186
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,233
What a dick.

187
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,138
Yo, Ollie, my main man.
How you doing?

188
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,576
Good, good, good. Look,
hook me up with another round.

189
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,682
I'll throw you a Vine,
I'll make you famous and shit.

190
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,804
All right, I got you.

191
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,248
You guys let me know if you
need anything, all right?

192
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,408
Off the menu.

193
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,351
Hey, hey, bro, bro.
I'm boys with your friend.

194
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,184
You know, Ollie,
the pretty boy.

195
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,622
Uh, sorry, kid.
I'm fucking sorry.

196
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,988
Wait, wait.
What about this guy?

197
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,427
You know him?

198
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,197
Don't "bro" me
if you don't know me.

199
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,673
This party sucks.

200
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,038
- L.A.'s dead.
- Hi, Sarah.

201
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,806
Hey, Cole,
can you play <i>Drunk in Love?</i>

202
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,312
Absolutely not.

203
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,677
Hey, Squirrel,
I like your shirt.

204
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,541
Ow! What the hell?

205
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,847
We gotta round up chicks
for Paige.

206
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,423
Looks like he's doing fine.

207
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,716
<i>Yeah,
those girls are wack.</i>

208
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,654
All right, find me something.

209
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,176
What do you think of this guy?

210
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,305
- This guy?
- Yeah.

211
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,279
<i>I think
he's getting paid too much.</i>

212
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,113
What do you think about him?

213
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,087
<i>I think he used to be good.</i>

214
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,291
<i>Now I think he's just gives
the people what they want.</i>

215
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,931
Hey, do you wanna come
sit at my friend's table?

216
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,670
<i>You can drink for free.</i>

217
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,145
Do you promote here?

218
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,270
No.

219
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,343
My friends promote here.

220
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,843
- Right.
- I kind of help.

221
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,952
- Well, have a nice night.
- I...

222
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,616
Hey, you're James Reed, right?

223
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,686
Mmm-hmm.

224
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:37,987
Do you smoke?

225
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,595
Yes, I do.

226
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,163
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

227
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,932
- Is there tobacco in that?
- Yeah.

228
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,575
- It's a spliff.
- A "spliff"?

229
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,007
What are you, French?

230
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,778
No. I'm American.

231
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,938
All right. This is the
most important advice

232
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,106
you're ever gonna get.

233
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,879
Never mix THC with nicotine.

234
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,351
It fogs up the high.

235
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,556
It'll last longer
if you mix it.

236
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,157
It's not about
making it last longer,

237
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,759
it's about enjoying it.

238
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,523
You spin here regularly?

239
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,095
Yeah.

240
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,398
- They pay you?
- Mmm-mmm.

241
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,195
No.

242
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,206
But the drinks are free.

243
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,643
Well, that's nice of them.

244
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,383
You wanna go to a party?

245
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,713
- What, like now?
- Yeah. Right now.

246
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,651
It should be fun.

247
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,286
Yeah.

248
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,959
You want?

249
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,595
Yeah, sure.

250
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,733
So, like, where have
you been to, to spin?

251
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,500
Okay.
Tokyo, Berlin, Frankfurt...

252
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,970
Uh, Belgium.

253
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,840
Dubai,
which is in the Middle East.

254
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,567
Yeah, it's like Vegas
of the Middle East.

255
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:07,516
Ibiza, Majorca, Madrid, Paris.

256
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,321
Paris, they got some
great music right now.

257
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,718
Yo, you seen Cole?

258
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,950
Can't say I have.

259
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,184
Then what's the plan?

260
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,192
See you in the morning.

261
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,346
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

262
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,943
That painting is worth more
than my car.

263
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,387
James?

264
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,024
Mmm?

265
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,226
This painting is alive.

266
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,529
Nah.

267
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,498
It's just the PCP talking.

268
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,343
PCP?

269
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,667
Ooh.

270
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,784
Well, I've seen many
door girls in my day

271
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,081
- but this one...
- Look.

272
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,921
I will go home with you
tonight under two conditions.

273
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,389
- Yes.
- One,

274
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,152
you understand
that it is pity sex

275
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,591
and I will never admit to it.

276
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:29,098
And two, you shut the fuck up
for the rest of the night.

277
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,460
Okay?

278
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,173
Where are those nuts, Squirrel?

279
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,262
Where did you hide
your fucking nuts?

280
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,676
It ain't winter yet.

281
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,189
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,899
Um, me and James
went to a party, I think.

283
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,494
What are you doing here?

284
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,038
- I... I live here.
- Oh, my God!

285
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,574
My brain is bleeding.

286
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:55,202
<i>My blood is going to start
coming out of my eyeballs.</i>

287
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,837
<i>You like this homeless puppy
I found?</i>

288
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,480
Is he housebroken?

289
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,107
I don't know. Check the rugs.

290
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,214
I can actually
smell the whisky

291
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,343
coming out of your skin.

292
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,411
Mmm?

293
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,286
You didn't drive home
last night, did you?

294
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,324
You used to smell
like fermented liquor, too.

295
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,929
Cole, this is Sophie,
my role model.

296
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,331
Nice to meet you, Cole.

297
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,455
Nice to meet you.

298
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,097
You were talking
a big game last night, kid.

299
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,738
I was?

300
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,636
You were saying,
"All I need is one track."

301
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,503
You were gonna
control people's hearts,

302
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,407
fly around the world.

303
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,746
I'm not supposed
to drink whisky.

304
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,575
Or take PCP.

305
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,073
Uh...

306
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,679
Do you have any aspirin?

307
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,914
We have tons of aspirin
but I'm not giving you shit

308
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,422
until you play me something.

309
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,153
You have tracks
on your phone, right?

310
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,789
Okay.

311
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,124
It's not really morning music.

312
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,789
Oh, well, that's okay
because it's 12:30.

313
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:49,956
<i>It's 12:30?</i>

314
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,951
I'm just gonna skip ahead.

315
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,804
It's fun.

316
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:29,696
"Fun"?

317
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,341
I'm gonna pour myself a drink

318
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,375
before this hangover
gets real.

319
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,638
Soph, can we get Cole an Uber?

320
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,370
Um...

321
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,838
I can give him a ride.

322
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,313
I have some errands
to run, so...

323
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,546
Great! I'll be here,
festering slowly.

324
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,492
You know, James is a snob.

325
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,064
He's really hard on everyone.

326
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,826
- So...
- Don't worry, it's cool.

327
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,367
It's not...

328
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,206
<i>Stanford, huh?</i>

329
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,038
That's a nice school.

330
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,510
Do you go to college?

331
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,811
No.

332
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,682
- I could have gone to college.
- Mmm.

333
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,915
I could have run track
at UC Davis.

334
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,386
Why... Why didn't you?

335
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,694
Well...

336
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,062
School is a waste of time.

337
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,723
It can be

338
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,858
if you're doing something
better with your time.

339
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,532
Can't believe
you guys just left me

340
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,269
abandoned there with Sara.

341
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,538
Dicks.

342
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,911
She did unspeakable things.

343
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,209
Ugh, this fuckin'...

344
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,045
This girl straight
beat my ass.

345
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,345
I thought I was strong, man.

346
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:51,381
Girl was supposed to
call me later. It's whatever.

347
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,583
Gentlemen, your earnings.

348
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,091
Hey, hey.

349
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,096
At ease.

350
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,432
200 bucks?

351
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,233
What the fuck is this, man?

352
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,239
We brought in
560 people last night.

353
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,365
We brought in 562.

354
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,205
I thought that was the point
of this, we bring in 500 heads.

355
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,543
I'm gonna fucking murder
that cheesy motherfucker!

356
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,694
I just read
about this guy, right,

357
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,947
who invented Instagram.

358
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,750
He sold it for $400 million.

359
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,418
So?

360
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,924
Man, he was 26 years old.

361
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,459
<i>I mean, he spent the next
fucking year of his life</i>

362
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,584
<i>flying around the world,</i>

363
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,755
<i>taking pictures of his girlfriend
on different beaches.</i>

364
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,059
- Kevin Systrom.
- What?

365
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,294
It's Kevin Systrom. The guy
who invented Instagram,

366
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,630
his name is Kevin Systrom.

367
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,931
Fuck Kevin Systrom!

368
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,671
Dude, I live for Thursdays.
The club is my thing.

369
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,141
Yeah, man. I'm not saying
we should quit altogether

370
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,472
but aren't you tired
of taking taxis

371
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,944
back from fucking Silver Lake
every night?

372
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,447
I'm tired of taking Squirrel's
mom's fucking station wagon.

373
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,449
Okay. I'm tired of driving
your bum ass around.

374
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,814
I'm fucking tired of you
jerking off

375
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:56,943
5 feet from my pillow.

376
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,817
You're not gonna
get tired of that ever.

377
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,652
You guys want to
make real money?

378
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,740
Or you want to fucking
live and die in the Valley?

379
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,897
Look, I have an idea.

380
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,634
All this abstract,
computerized,

381
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:21,337
digitized, on-paper bullshit
is for pussies.

382
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,949
Fuck a diamond,
that shit's forever.

383
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,020
Hi, Mrs. Henderson?

384
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,991
Hi, I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

385
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,322
Hi, my name is Cole.

386
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,453
I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

387
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,496
This is a list of homeowners
in the area

388
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,534
that are in the
unfortunate position

389
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,001
of facing foreclosure.

390
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,437
I was wondering if I could
talk to, uh, a Mr. Stein?

391
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,564
Uh, Mr. "Steen"?

392
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,971
So we're cold-calling people?

393
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,099
No. no. no, no.

394
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,544
You are calling people
who are in need,

395
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,389
with the solution
that they are looking for.

396
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,314
When you call these people,

397
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,886
you're calling
as their friend.

398
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,089
We charge $5,000

399
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,351
to negotiate their
foreclosures with the banks.

400
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:12,190
Every deal you close,
I give you 15%.

401
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,860
Well, that's like 600...

402
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,329
$750.

403
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,662
Boom. Good fucking math, kid.

404
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,328
Now to, uh, restore
your faith in humanity,

405
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:25,341
let me break you off
something real proper-like.

406
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,876
Welcome to the kingdom, boys.

407
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,581
Holy shit!

408
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:32,842
That's like 1,000 bucks
at least.

409
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,042
Oh!

410
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,551
Smell it. Smell it.
Smell it.

411
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,181
<i>Let's do this. Let's do this.
Come on. it's a good thing.</i>

412
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,026
So, Dad,

413
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,198
me and Cole, we're making
some money, and I thought

414
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,135
maybe we could invest in
a roof and some new floors

415
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,298
and we can have this fucking
house ready to sell by winter.

416
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,670
For sure.

417
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,769
- Hello?
<i>- Yo, San Fernando.</i>

418
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,402
<i>- It's James.</i>
- What's up, man?

419
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,208
<i>What are you doing Saturday?</i>

420
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,714
Uh, nothing. Nothing. Why?

421
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,512
<i>You wanna make some cash?</i>

422
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,679
Doing what?

423
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,945
Hey, can you play
<i>Drunk in Love?</i>

424
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,210
Uh...

425
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,155
Please?

426
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,883
Yeah, sure,
I'll try to work it in.

427
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,721
For you, sir, from James.

428
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,294
What, are you, like,
his secretary now?

429
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,955
His assistant, actually.

430
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,727
Oh, you look so surprised.

431
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,196
Wow!

432
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,328
Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,963
Were you trying to tell her
all about the free drinks

434
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,803
you can get her on Thursdays?

435
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,772
What's in there? Rosé?

436
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,672
Here.

437
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,655
- Club soda.
- With cranberry.

438
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,850
Very stealth.

439
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,988
Hey, you know, this party's
looking a little stiff, Cole.

440
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,793
So what are you saying?
Do I need to amp it up?

441
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,268
You could try but this crowd
doesn't dance before midnight.

442
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,602
Okay.

443
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,004
So it's the DJ's job

444
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,977
to get the crowd out of their
heads and into their bodies.

445
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,340
So in order to do that,

446
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,779
you need at the very least...

447
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,454
...a cursory knowledge
of mathematics

448
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,949
<i>and the broad strokes
of 9th-grade biology.</i>

449
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,523
For example,
the baseline controls

450
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,150
this region
of the body right here.

451
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,821
The most important region.

452
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,803
There's always going
to be resistance,

453
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,529
so you gotta be patient.

454
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,299
Look for that one person who's
not afraid to just go for it.

455
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,231
<i>Next, you want to zero in
on their heartbeats.</i>

456
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,268
<i>I like to start them off
at about 120 beats per minute.</i>

457
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,962
<i>That's equivalent
to the heartbeat</i>

458
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,663
<i>of a long-distance runner.</i>

459
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,212
<i>You see, BPM
is the name of the game.</i>

460
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,943
<i>About 60 BPMs.</i>

461
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,163
<i>Dubstep is actually 140 BPMs
cut to half-speed,</i>

462
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,197
<i>it ends up being
about 70 BPMs.</i>

463
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,465
<i>House is around
110 to 130 BPMs.</i>

464
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,742
<i>I'm not sure
how you dance to that.</i>

465
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,306
Once you've locked
onto their heart rate,

466
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,415
<i>you start bringing 'em up
song by song.</i>

467
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,512
<i>There's a popular myth
that 128 beats per minute</i>

468
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,947
<i>is the rate that synergizes
most with your heartbeat.</i>

469
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,694
<i>That's the magic number.</i>

470
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,395
<i>Once you've gotten
your crowd there,</i>

471
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,057
<i>you're controlling their
entire circulatory system.</i>

472
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,307
Hey, man, would you mind
watching this for me?

473
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,103
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thanks, man.

474
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,376
What are you guys doing here?

475
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,777
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

476
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,441
Think I'm gonna come all the
way out here, pick you up,

477
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,745
and not party?

478
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,950
Hey, James.
Uh, they're with me.

479
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,282
This is Mason,
Ollie and Squirrel.

480
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,754
How is it going?

481
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:14,879
Nice to meet you all.

482
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:15,925
Actually, you met us before.

483
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,789
We promote at Social
on Thursdays.

484
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,421
Listen, we should grab a bite
to eat sometime, man.

485
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,464
I'm basically
this kid's fucking manager,

486
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,896
you know what I mean?

487
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,661
And I think we could use
a little bit of advice.

488
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,327
You know what,
just enjoy the party.

489
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,268
We'll talk shop another time.

490
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,965
Nice to meet you, bro.

491
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,599
Hey, Cole,
I wanna show you somethin'.

492
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,439
Just be cool.

493
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,442
I'm like the coolest
fucking dude ever.

494
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,981
I don't...

495
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,716
Are you kidding me?

496
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,714
You have a Wurlitzer?

497
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,054
Wow.

498
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,732
Well, that's not bad.

499
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,165
My mom taught piano.

500
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,505
Yeah? She still teach?

501
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:06,804
Maybe.

502
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,413
I wanna show you something.

503
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,581
This is called a Buchla.

504
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,752
It's a mod synth.

505
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,022
There's only a couple of them
in the world.

506
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,148
Bowie used one of these
in <i>Space Oddity.</i>

507
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,795
Yes, he did.

508
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:32,000
Holy cow!

509
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,868
How do you ever
leave this place?

510
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,840
You'd be surprised at all the
distractions that can come up.

511
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,243
You were good out there,
you know?

512
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,849
You really know
how to work a crowd.

513
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,446
Thanks, man.

514
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,347
You know what? Let's hear
that track of yours again.

515
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:50,852
You got it with you?

516
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay, here's the thing.

517
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,295
The beginning sounds like
Skrillex's brother made it.

518
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,993
- Okay.
- And then right here...

519
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,600
That sounds like early
Juan Atkins to me,

520
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,765
which is good,

521
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,208
but, uh, you're trying to be
too many different people.

522
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,506
I want it to be that way.

523
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,755
I want a lot of switches.
I want a lot of transitions.

524
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:19,837
Yeah.

525
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,851
- Like, big, heavy drops.
- Mmm.

526
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,282
That's what's crushing it now.

527
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:24,581
You sound like an asshole.

528
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,587
All that was missing
was a hashtag.

529
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,725
"Imitation is suicide."
Emerson said that.

530
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,257
Okay.

531
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,420
<i>Look, you can make
people dance,</i>

532
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,633
<i>and that's half the battle.</i>

533
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:38,726
Any successful artist,
they have this moment

534
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,803
when they stop being
an admirer

535
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,167
and they find their signature.

536
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,205
You know a secret?

537
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,973
I never go to sushi
on Mondays because,

538
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,103
fun fact,

539
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,874
all the fish markets
are closed.

540
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,450
You guys want to hear
something interesting?

541
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:55,745
The best sushi in all of L.A.

542
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,514
is Teru Sushi
in fucking Studio City.

543
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,422
Does this girl look
like she eats in the Valley?

544
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,823
Okay, the sushi in the Valley

545
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,261
is the best sushi in the
western hemisphere, kid.

546
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,465
And what are you,
the Valley Board of Tourism?

547
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,335
- Mase, Mase. Chill, chill.
- Excuse me. Relax. Relax.

548
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,772
Have a sense of humor, bro.

549
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,505
Did he just say "bro"?
Yo, I got a sense of humor.

550
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,544
You want to hear
something fucking hilarious?

551
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,671
You dress like
Hillary Clinton, bro.

552
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,451
Hey!

553
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,220
Hey!

554
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,696
Hey!

555
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,129
What happened?

556
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,566
What was that about?

557
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:48,797
Sushi.

558
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,429
Sushi?

559
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,216
<i>Pick a place, man.</i>

560
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,993
Why don't we come here
more often, man?

561
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,395
I come here all the time.

562
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,498
Really?

563
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,368
Yeah.

564
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,477
You know,
try to clear my head.

565
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,205
Sorry about your gig, though.

566
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,875
- Whatever.
- Yeah.

567
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,021
Oh, Jesus.

568
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

569
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,328
Is James home?

570
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,236
Uh, yeah, he should be.

571
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,467
I'll let you in.

572
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,793
Hey, babe.

573
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,903
<i>I was just
taking a little nap.</i>

574
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,804
<i>I know.</i>

575
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,173
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

576
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,140
I can't accept this.

577
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,710
Oh, Christ.
Put that back in your pocket.

578
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,515
What do you think,
I broke up with you?

579
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,518
- No, man.
- Your friends, dude,

580
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,455
they're gorillas,
but me and you, we're cool.

581
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:24,852
Is that it?

582
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,455
What is that?

583
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,348
That one, right there.
What's that loop?

584
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,964
That's a handclap.

585
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,605
Yeah, I know
it's a handclap, dipshit.

586
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,933
But what is it?
Did you make it?

587
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,029
It's a sample.

588
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,968
Well, ironically, it's the
only live thing in there.

589
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,299
I mean, amongst all this other

590
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,813
synthetic
computer-generated garbage,

591
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:47,281
that's one honest handclap.

592
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,644
Listen, I get it, man.
I've been there before.

593
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,351
But you're not gonna
get anywhere

594
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,512
using the same old sounds

595
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,318
that every other
laptop DJ is using.

596
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,154
Yeah. But, I mean,
by definition, like,

597
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,159
all electronic music
is computer-generated.

598
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,786
Yeah, but it can be organic.

599
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,525
So that synthetic kick drum...

600
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,303
<i>So that tinny keyboard...</i>

601
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,174
Music.

602
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,534
<i>Sounds have soul.</i>

603
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,237
Build them from scratch.

604
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,040
<i>Find new ones.</i>

605
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,443
Get your head
out of that laptop

606
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,280
and start listening to
what the real fucking world

607
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,544
is trying to tell you.

608
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,812
<i>That's your problem.</i>

609
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,414
You don't listen.

610
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,355
Hey, Jimmy is on the phone
about Elysian Fields.

611
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,688
What days are we traveling
to Vegas, 20th or 21st?

612
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,992
What do you think
of that track?

613
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,762
Um, it's fine.

614
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:38,959
See? Haters.

615
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,536
Haters are your
target audience.

616
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,701
Oh. Well, lovers know
where you sleep.

617
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,775
- Which day?
- 19th.

618
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,934
- I need a blackjack day.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

619
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:52,042
Hi, Jimmy.
Yeah, he says, um, the 19th.

620
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,141
Yeah, we're looking
forward to it.

621
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,753
I'll make sure
he gets there on time.

622
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,876
Thank you.

623
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,188
<i>Well, you sounded
highly professional right now.</i>

624
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,088
Don't patronize me.

625
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,784
I'm gonna take a break.

626
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,988
You can use the space
whenever you want.

627
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,760
<i>You are coming with me.</i>

628
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,608
<i>Are you asking or telling?</i>

629
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,276
Hi, I'm calling from
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

630
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,940
Um, may I speak
with Tanya Romero?

631
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,143
<i>- This is she.</i>
- Hi, Tanya.

632
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,616
I understand that
your bank's given you

633
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,982
a notice of foreclosure.

634
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,454
<i>Yesterday.
How did you know that?</i>

635
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,553
Well, we work with the banks
to help negotiate...

636
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,924
<i>Shh, honey.</i>

637
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,725
Sounds like you have
a little monster over there.

638
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,093
<i>That's my son, Richard.</i>

639
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,465
Richard.

640
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:47,332
That's actually...
That's funny.

641
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,132
That's my dad's name.

642
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,797
Cole. Cole, baby,
come check this out.

643
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,843
Why don't you let him work?

644
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,905
<i>Are you really able
to prevent evictions?</i>

645
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,035
Uh, yeah.

646
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,771
Absolutely.
Actually, you know what?

647
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,941
Let me transfer you
over to my manager

648
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,746
and he can talk you
through everything.

649
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:03,988
- First name?
- What?

650
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,043
What is the client's
first name?

651
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,211
Tanya.

652
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,089
Tanya Romero.

653
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,589
Tanya, Paige Laurel.

654
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,356
I hear we're catching you
at a rough time.

655
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:15,026
Right. Oh, right.

656
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,157
<i>Let me just tell you a little
hit about what we do.</i>

657
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,497
Hey, what's up, man?

658
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,006
This is my boy, Cole.

659
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,608
- Come on, I need your voice.
- I don't want to.

660
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,856
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Come here. Help me, come on.

661
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,076
You don't wanna
help your buddy?

662
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,209
No. No!

663
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:45,680
Number nine.

664
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:46,949
Number nine.

665
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,655
<i>Synchronicity is electricity</i>

666
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,697
<i>Synchronicity is electricity</i>

667
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,840
That's good. That's good.

668
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,479
- That was it?
- Yeah, that's it.

669
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:44,876
That's how you make a track.

670
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,243
That was really, really scary.

671
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,408
That was it. That's the one.

672
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,553
He said,
"Meet me at the fountain."

673
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,710
I was like, '"Fountain'?
We're in Rome.

674
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,049
"There's fountains everywhere.

675
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,748
"Which fountain?"

676
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,427
Hey,
let's wait till Clarissa's.

677
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,096
Clarissa. Who's Clarissa?

678
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,833
Um, you met her, like,
three times. She, um...

679
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,237
<i>She just graduated
from Stanford.</i>

680
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,463
<i>Oh, the Stanford party. Right.</i>

681
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:12,934
Come on, they're my friends.

682
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,412
Well, I can be your friend,
baby.

683
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,548
Why don't you take Cole?
Cole, you should go.

684
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,916
Come on, man.
It's Friday night.

685
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,325
Like, what else
are you gonna do?

686
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,859
I'm gonna watch C-Span until
I lose faith in humanity.

687
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,461
But you guys should go.

688
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,184
You can talk about
your millennial angst.

689
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,253
Too much validation.

690
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,028
<i>The irony is
if you're gonna be a lawyer,</i>

691
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,558
<i>you're basically handing in essays
for the rest of your life.</i>

692
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,129
Yeah, but at least
now I'm getting paid for it.

693
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,570
Cheers to that.

694
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:48,569
What do you do?

695
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,707
Uh, I'm an assistant.

696
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:51,973
Oh, yeah? Where at?

697
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,946
A personal assistant,
actually.

698
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,018
- For a musician.
- Oh, for who?

699
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:57,381
I love music.

700
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,580
James Reed? He's a DJ.

701
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,823
Yeah, I don't know him.

702
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,792
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- I'll come with you.

703
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,290
Excuse me.

704
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,628
I think they spent, like,
$200 on cheese.

705
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,270
Yeah, and half the people here
don't eat dairy.

706
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,507
I'm gonna find the bathroom.

707
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,474
All right.
You sure you're okay?

708
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,137
Yeah, I'm fine.

709
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,382
Hey, that Sophie girl
is pretty cute.

710
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:30,508
Is she our year?

711
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,212
Yeah, for like a minute.
She failed out.

712
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:33,712
What do you mean?

713
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,017
Every guy in our dorm
saw her tits.

714
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,627
I never went there personally.
Wish I had.

715
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,887
The line's too long.

716
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:42,229
- Here, let's go over here.
- Why?

717
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:44,800
<i>And she's, like, totally
fucking the DJ she works for.</i>

718
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,627
He's, like, 40
and pays the bills.

719
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,068
Hey, I'd help her buy
groceries for a week or two.

720
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,200
- Don't.
- Hmm?

721
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,740
Hey, when you guys jerk
each other off,

722
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,284
do you take turns?

723
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,216
Or is it more of like
a simultaneous kind of deal?

724
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:11,583
Cole, stop!

725
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:12,751
Hey!

726
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,435
You really didn't have
to do that.

727
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,198
Fuck those guys.

728
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,874
They wouldn't last two seconds
in the real world.

729
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,938
Those guys will end up
running the real world.

730
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:33,712
Yeah, I know.

731
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,645
Just so you know,
I didn't fail out.

732
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,456
I just needed
to take some time off.

733
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,148
Now all my friends
are graduating

734
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,887
and I have nothing
to show for myself.

735
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,724
<i>Why don't you just
go back to school?</i>

736
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,291
I can't afford it.

737
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,968
There's a ton of schools that
are cheaper than Stanford.

738
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,773
Yeah, maybe.

739
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,819
James thinks
you're really talented.

740
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,151
Yeah?

741
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:14,852
Yeah.

742
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,919
He said that?

743
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,027
He said you have

744
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,757
"an acute sense
of assemblage."

745
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,464
Yes!

746
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:34,834
What the fuck does that mean?

747
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,001
Is it French?

748
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,670
Assemblage.

749
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:38,940
Assemblage.

750
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:40,309
Do you really know
what it means?

751
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,440
- No.
- I don't really, either,

752
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:43,814
but it's a good thing, I think.

753
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:44,978
I think so, too.

754
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,862
We have got uppers,
downers, screamers, laughers,

755
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,707
<i>MDMA and some
fucking Special K.</i>

756
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,713
We've even got some mints
for the kids.

757
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:14,214
I fucking love
music festivals.

758
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,319
Yeah, every hit
of ecstasy is, like,

759
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,250
five years of jail sentence
at least.

760
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,822
All right,
rave rule number one. Okay?

761
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,425
If anybody gets lost, we have
the buddy fucking system.

762
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,118
We meet back
at the car, right?

763
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,251
<i>I hate being daddy here,</i>

764
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,744
<i>but I gotta do it.
That's the rule.</i>

765
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,397
<i>Hey, are you here?</i>

766
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,468
<i>I'm at the Ferris wheel.
Come find me.</i>

767
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,198
<i>I love it here.</i>

768
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:48,473
I gotta go.

769
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:52,578
Hey, guys, I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

770
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:53,705
<i>Where the fuck
are you going, man?</i>

771
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,038
Fuck, man!
Where are you going?

772
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:05,149
James got drunk
and ditched me.

773
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,897
- Are you rolling?
- Me? Never.

774
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,767
Stick out your tongue.

775
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,547
Where are you, man?
We're at the spot.

776
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,022
Just give him five minutes.

777
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,804
- Hi.
- Hi.

778
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,812
Should we get room service?

779
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,286
<i>- I want pancakes.</i>
- Hmm.

780
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,663
I want a cheeseburger.

781
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,000
- Cheeseburger?
- With bacon.

782
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,404
And fries.

783
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,134
And a side of avocado.

784
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,012
Mmm.

785
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,723
- So good.
<i>- So good.</i>

786
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,053
How is yours?

787
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,661
<i>Fucking unbelievable.</i>

788
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:33,818
Can I try?

789
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,021
<i>Yes.</i>

790
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,027
Oh, my God.
I'm stuffing my face.

791
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,830
I was so hungry. So good.

792
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,194
Mmm.

793
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,204
You have no idea.

794
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:50,204
<i>I can'! believe you
fucking did that to your friends, right?</i>

795
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,007
<i>I mean, she'd better have
been an eight and a half,</i>

796
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:53,206
<i>like, on a bad day.</i>

797
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,537
<i>What are you
fucking smiling...</i>

798
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,118
<i>You ditch your friends,
and you're smiling.</i>

799
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,117
<i>It's not fucking funny.
If I didn't love you,</i>

800
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,550
<i>or if you didn't have
such a pretty smile,</i>

801
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,816
<i>I swear to God,
I'd fucking take you down.</i>

802
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:05,817
<i>You guys both be quiet.</i>

803
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:07,687
<i>That's the little bit
you told me about.</i>

804
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,161
<i>That's the thing
about girl face.</i>

805
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,233
<i>I know that face.
I know that face.</i>

806
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,154
<i>Hey,
it's Sophie, leave a message.</i>

807
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,029
Gold Star Realty Solutions.

808
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:50,071
<i>Hi, uh, this is Tanya Romero.</i>

809
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,764
<i>Is this Cole?</i>

810
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,204
Yeah. Hi, Tanya.

811
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:54,810
<i>Uh, can you do
something for me?</i>

812
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,902
<i>Hello? Cole?</i>

813
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:00,947
<i>Hello?</i>

814
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,046
You.

815
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,247
What the fuck, man?

816
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:12,793
You didn't call me
at the festival.

817
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:16,462
I met up with these
Ukrainian acrobats...

818
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,261
Oh, cell phone
reception was shitty.

819
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,794
Come on.
The fight's already started.

820
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,801
Oh, uh, can I get you
something to drink?

821
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,034
Uh, yeah, man,
whatever you're having.

822
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:30,472
Well, I'm having Pellegrino
'cause I'm... I'm laying off.

823
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,010
- Sure, the same thing.
- Same thing?

824
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:35,039
Yeah, Pellegrino.

825
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:37,083
All right. Yay!

826
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:45,955
<i>I'm not really into sports</i>

827
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,118
but there's something
about grown men

828
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,321
beating the shit out
of each other

829
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,898
while their friends watch
that really intrigues me.

830
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,803
I'm gonna go get
an energy drink.

831
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,498
Anybody want anything?

832
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,303
No, I'm good, man, thank you.

833
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,015
I tried to call you.

834
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,323
Look, it was inevitable
it was gonna happen

835
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,861
and it happened,
so let's just move on.

836
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:22,423
What?

837
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,735
Is that what you really want?

838
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,932
<i>Anyway...</i>

839
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,408
<i>I may or may not have
gotten a little sentimental.</i>

840
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,137
Here you go.

841
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:49,124
<i>It's actually
a self-serving gift.</i>

842
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,283
I was asked to play
the Pioneer DJ Summerfest,

843
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,450
they said I could
bring an opener.

844
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:53,755
Are you kidding me?

845
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:56,462
But then I imagined you
up there with your janky rig

846
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:58,658
in front of all those
gyrating tweens

847
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:01,326
And it just didn't sit right.

848
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,673
<i>You better get that
track ready.</i>

849
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,642
This, uh, I...
I found on my door yesterday.

850
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,707
Uh-oh.

851
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:44,468
God!

852
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,348
<i>Just awful. Mmm.</i>

853
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,475
I can't even imagine.

854
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,914
So, what's the next move?

855
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,079
<i>Mrs. Romero,</i>

856
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:58,523
I'm sure you must know
the housing market right now,

857
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,722
<i>it's just brutal.</i>

858
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,092
Now, I brought a record of our
correspondence with your bank

859
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,757
and if you look at this,
you can see that we pushed.

860
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,631
It's just...
These guys, they just,

861
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,362
they do not wanna
work with us.

862
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,272
Where does that leave me?

863
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,240
Yeah, Paige, there's gotta be
something we could do.

864
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,946
Okay. Um...

865
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:23,041
Look, there is, uh...
There's one thing, I guess.

866
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:25,313
It's not
something that we usually do.

867
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:29,414
But if you were to sign the
deed of your house over to us,

868
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:34,996
I could offer you a $20,000
rebate right here on the spot.

869
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,429
You're offering to
buy my house for $20,000

870
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,125
but it's worth $300,000.

871
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,395
Yeah, but that's just
a number, right?

872
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,833
I mean, it really doesn't
mean anything.

873
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,667
You see,
that number doesn't matter

874
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,570
because you're in foreclosure.

875
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,938
So you could lose your house,
get nothing,

876
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,910
or sign it over to us.

877
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,277
I'll rent it back to you and
I'll do it at a lower rate.

878
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:00,883
What was that?

879
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:04,254
Just did more for that woman
than any bank ever could.

880
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,826
You just stole
her fucking house.

881
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,226
No, no, no. We just made
real fucking money in there.

882
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:09,490
You got that?
Real fucking money.

883
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,122
Did you see that chandelier?

884
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:14,668
I will sell this place
for 500-600 grand, easy.

885
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,328
Sell it?

886
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,134
You just said you were
gonna rent it back to her.

887
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,742
This guy.

888
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:21,969
You got to relax, kid.

889
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:24,139
I'm not talking about
doing it overnight, all right?

890
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:25,811
- Fuck, man!
<i>- Hey, hey, hey!</i>

891
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,104
Listen.

892
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,944
Everybody is responsible
for themselves. You got that?

893
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,314
You just walked in that house,

894
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:33,683
you earned yourself
a $15,000 bonus.

895
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:36,087
Now, do you want that money
or are you too upset?

896
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:25,948
<i>You know why
the dining experience</i>

897
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,202
<i>is subpar in LA?</i>

898
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,745
Because the restaurant staff
is biding their time

899
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,371
until they land a sitcom.

900
00:59:33,504 --> 00:59:34,744
They can remember their lines

901
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:37,011
but they can't remember
my fucking order.

902
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,882
Well, it got
a good review online.

903
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,818
Oh, yes.
The high-minded people

904
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,152
of the Internet hath spoken.

905
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,384
The high-minded people
of the Internet

906
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:45,858
speak highly of you.

907
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,690
Oh, yeah.

908
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,161
Shows you how much they know.

909
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,458
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

910
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:55,437
- Oh...
<i>- Another drink?</i>

911
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,232
I can't talk
when you're like this.

912
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,840
<i>Oh, like what?</i>

913
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:03,233
Oh.

914
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:04,908
Happy birthday.

915
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,279
I think I'm gonna go.

916
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,078
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

917
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,117
We're gonna have some cake.

918
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,382
<i>- It's my birthday.</i>
- Happy birthday, man.

919
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,355
Come here,
come here, come here.

920
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,925
Take that.
Take it. Take it. Take it.

921
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,363
Thanks.

922
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:27,935
Soph, you want a piece
with a blueberry on it?

923
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,237
Mmm. Oh, this is good.

924
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,403
Cole?

925
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,276
- So good, baby.
- It's really good.

926
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,951
You know I hate my birthday.

927
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:49,157
I got it.

928
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,519
Now I hate it, too.

929
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,453
Soph.

930
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:56,256
All right,
you're gonna miss out.

931
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,961
Cole and I are gonna
eat this entire thing.

932
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:02,229
<i>Do what you want.
You always do.</i>

933
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,633
Yes!

934
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:05,666
It's a good philosophy.

935
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,275
If everybody did
what they wanted,

936
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:08,968
the world would be
a happier place.

937
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,238
You're not happy.
You're drunk.

938
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,075
- I'm just gonna go.
- No, no, no, stay.

939
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,274
Apparently this is my birthday party
and we're gonna celebrate.

940
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:16,806
<i>Sophie, come on,
let's have a drink.</i>

941
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:18,481
Sophie.

942
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,215
Get your ass down here!

943
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:26,583
Is this the part
where I go redeem myself?

944
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,292
Come on.

945
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:36,234
Let's get out of here.

946
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,541
Oh, yeah!

947
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:54,717
Summerfest!

948
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,051
Cheers.

949
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,521
It's gonna be a blast, man.
You think you're ready?

950
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:06,760
- Mmm.
- This could be your big launch, man.

951
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,370
You know, a lotta young DJs
got their start at Summerfest.

952
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:10,597
Are you listening to me?

953
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:12,002
I feel like
you're not listening to me.

954
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13,130
I gotta piss.

955
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:14,699
I'm not feelin' so hot.

956
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:16,869
Jesus!
You broke the seal too early.

957
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:24,914
You are so talented.

958
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,201
Wow.

959
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:49,777
You were right.

960
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,436
You really
shouldn't drink whisky.

961
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,580
What's that?
Is that your phone?

962
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,416
Hey! Answer
your fucking phone, Cole!

963
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:00,484
Who is that?

964
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:01,646
What the fuck is your problem?

965
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,385
Let's see who the fuck
is calling you at 1:00 a.m.

966
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,888
She probably
wants to talk about you.

967
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,900
You ungrateful little shit.
Did you fuck her?

968
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,425
What?

969
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,561
- Fuck.
- Did you fuck her?

970
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,546
Ow!

971
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,282
What the fuck was that?

972
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,284
That's four years of MMA,
emphasis on Muay Thai.

973
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,285
This is your thing, right?
I mean, you like to fight.

974
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,410
<i>Come on, get up.</i>

975
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:35,080
You don't give a shit
about her, man.

976
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,247
What, you think
because you went out to Vegas

977
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,018
and you fucked her that
you know something I don't?

978
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,525
She loves you, you loser.

979
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,958
Oh, I'm a loser? Says the guy

980
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:42,688
with the drug dealer friends
and no car.

981
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,493
You're all talk, man.

982
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,429
You think you're some
musical genius.

983
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,631
Maybe you used to be good.

984
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,968
<i>Now you're just
a drunk sell-out</i>

985
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:57,441
collecting the check.

986
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,822
You listen to me,
you weaselly little cunt.

987
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,981
You don't know
a damn thing about me,

988
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,386
the things I walk around with.

989
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,653
What are you, 23 years old?

990
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,019
You haven't even been alive
long enough

991
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:17,792
to understand the meaning
of the world "irreparable".

992
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,490
But at some point
in your life,

993
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:24,732
there are gonna be things
that finish you.

994
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,477
There won't be a damn thing
you can do about it.

995
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,891
Why did you shave it?

996
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:49,453
Good day, gentlemen.

997
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,259
Dude, Why'd you do that, man?

998
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:52,741
I was just
getting used to fucking

999
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:54,234
hanging out
with Burt Reynolds.

1000
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,838
You look like
you're 10 years old now.

1001
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,029
What happened to you?

1002
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:02,571
Don't wanna talk about it.

1003
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,302
<i>Fucking depressing in here.</i>

1004
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,879
<i>Let's get some sushi.</i>

1005
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,216
After we eat, I got something
special to show you guys.

1006
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:18,582
Whoa.

1007
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,523
I'm gonna join him.

1008
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,464
Sorry about Summerfest, man.
I know you would've killed it.

1009
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:35,705
I've been applying for jobs
at a few places.

1010
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,769
<i>Entry-level positions.</i>

1011
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,410
Wait, are you recording this?

1012
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,651
Why? You don't wanna
keep working with the group?

1013
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,552
I don't know. Do you?

1014
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,861
Don't you feel like there's
a lot more we could be doing?

1015
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,859
- Like more quality stuff?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1016
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,226
Dude, this is
fucking temporary.

1017
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,994
You think we signed up
for a lifetime in real estate?

1018
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,927
And it's not temporary.

1019
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,133
We've always been those guys.

1020
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,199
I mean, Cole,

1021
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,175
are we ever gonna be
better than this?

1022
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,245
I thought we said Hollywood
Hills, not Granada Hills.

1023
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:19,512
It's a stepping stone

1024
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,088
and it gets us all
out of our unsatisfactory

1025
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,349
respective situations.

1026
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,049
Cole, come here.
Check this shit out.

1027
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,526
This right here
is your studio.

1028
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,358
Soundproof the walls.

1029
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,895
What do you give to a man
who has everything?

1030
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,239
Just more of that man.

1031
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,134
And this...

1032
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,511
This is me.

1033
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,343
Of course.

1034
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:49,711
You'll all be
very happy to know

1035
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,307
there's a central AC unit.

1036
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:54,913
Huh?

1037
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,352
What if somebody
wants to move out?

1038
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,482
They fucking move out.

1039
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,496
We'll fill it up
with some Craigslist.

1040
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,889
- How much?
- $750.

1041
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,522
You got the biggest room,
I noticed.

1042
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:06,895
Yeah.
Well, it's a finder's fee.

1043
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:07,924
Well, you pay nine,
we pay seven.

1044
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,058
Great!

1045
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,398
Okay.

1046
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,528
Who is this for?

1047
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,463
- Huh?
- You already rented it?

1048
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,197
- Here you go.
- Are you crazy?

1049
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,905
Oh, dude.
I forgot the best part.

1050
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,747
What are you doing?

1051
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,079
Welcome to the dream, bitches.

1052
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,243
What?

1053
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,351
Get in!
The water's warm.

1054
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,225
Do a back flip, Squirrel.

1055
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,265
Get in!

1056
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,698
Yeah!

1057
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,434
<i>I ain't got no crystal ball</i>

1058
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:54,030
<i>if I had a million dollars
well, I, I'd spend it all</i>

1059
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,541
We fucking made it.
We made it.

1060
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,246
Bring it in real quick.

1061
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:30,203
Oh, fuck.

1062
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,983
Oh, man.

1063
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,419
Can you stop smacking on that?

1064
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,961
Dude, I'm fucking dying here.

1065
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,188
I'm literally dying.

1066
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,059
Hey, what was the name

1067
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,428
of the blonde chick
that was playing, uh,

1068
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,960
chicken fights?

1069
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,730
I think I banged her.

1070
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,899
This house is gonna
get us arrested, man.

1071
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,203
Have you guys seen what
happened in that bathroom?

1072
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,811
It's fucking...

1073
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:05,935
<i>Yo, Squirrel.</i>

1074
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,069
What was the name of that

1075
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,204
<i>fucking blonde chick
that I was, like...</i>

1076
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,748
Yo, this guy was
a fucking legend last night.

1077
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,545
Squirrelly bird, I salute you.

1078
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,314
Squirrel. Hey, who was that
blonde bitch yesterday?

1079
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,252
Remember?

1080
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,414
Hey, wake up.

1081
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,060
Yo, Squirrel.

1082
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,852
Oh, fuck! Squirrel!

1083
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,498
Yo, Cole.
He's fucking gray, dude.

1084
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,827
- What?
- He's cold, man.

1085
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,230
His fucking lips.

1086
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:30,593
Squirrel, wake up!

1087
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,228
<i>Squirrel.</i>

1088
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,965
- Mase, what's the address?
- Yo, he's not breathing, guys!

1089
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,404
- What's the address?
- He's not fucking breathing!

1090
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:36,839
- I don't know.
- You don't know the fucking...

1091
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:37,967
Fuck!

1092
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,511
<i>Ollie, Ollie, he's not
fuckin' breathing, man.</i>

1093
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:40,739
<i>Squirrel, wake up, man.
Get him up.</i>

1094
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,406
Get him up. Get him up.

1095
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:43,608
Let's get him up.

1096
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:45,477
My friend, he's passed out.
He's gray.

1097
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,746
What the fuck? What'd you
give him last night?

1098
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,676
- Don't say that shit to me.
- What'd he take?

1099
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,735
<i>I'm never
going back to that house.</i>

1100
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,894
Paige sends his condolences.

1101
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,257
Wow, that's real thoughtful
of him.

1102
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,025
A condolence text.

1103
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,903
If you think I'm going back
to work for that guy,

1104
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,164
you're out of your mind.

1105
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,873
Oh, that's great.

1106
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,272
Let's throw away
the one good job that we have.

1107
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,036
We're ruining lives.

1108
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,674
Do you realize that?

1109
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,209
<i>Hey, listen.
Fuck Paige.</i>

1110
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,581
We're not going back
to work for him, okay?

1111
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,154
Because we don't need him.
We got our own thing.

1112
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,277
What thing?

1113
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,018
We got Thursdays.
We got the club.

1114
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:32,250
You're gonna book
a sitcom, man.

1115
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:33,655
I know you are,
and you're gonna

1116
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,090
bring celebs to the club.

1117
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,924
And Cole
is gonna be headlining.

1118
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,690
We're gonna Kevin Systrom
this shit right up.

1119
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,732
None of that is real, dude.

1120
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,000
It is not gonna happen.

1121
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,703
Man, I'm not
gonna be an actor.

1122
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,068
We're not gonna be
millionaires.

1123
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,836
Stuff just doesn't...
It doesn't work like that.

1124
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,713
Look, I look around me, man.

1125
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,407
What else am I supposed to do?

1126
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,479
Look, I'm good at this.
You know, I can do this.

1127
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:06,024
I don't wanna be a loser
the rest of my life.

1128
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,287
And you guys...

1129
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,591
You guys can hate me
if you want to,

1130
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,097
but I'm not quitting.

1131
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,699
<i>Good.</i>

1132
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,869
That makes perfect sense,
because you are a fucking loser.

1133
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,136
You're a conniving,
half-blood,

1134
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,800
disloyal little fucking loser.

1135
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:24,934
Oh, calm yourself.

1136
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,375
And if it hadn't been
for your pill-popping ass

1137
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,947
getting Squirrel
fucked up all night,

1138
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,070
I think he'd still be sitting
right the fuck there.

1139
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:31,976
You trying to put that
on me right now?

1140
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,307
Oh, fuck. I'm just saying what

1141
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,480
everybody else here
wants to say,

1142
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:38,114
but they can't do it because
they don't have the fucking...

1143
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,588
Shut the fuck up!

1144
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:48,958
Yeah?

1145
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,535
I'm so fucking done with you.

1146
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,443
Fuck him. And fuck Paige, too.
You know what?

1147
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,552
<i>Those motherfuckers
are perfect for each other.</i>

1148
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:20,626
Fucking Squirrel.

1149
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,826
I can't believe he's gone.

1150
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,033
<i>Hey, are you here?</i>

1151
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,006
<i>I'm at the Ferris wheel.
Come find me.</i>

1152
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,435
<i>I love it here.</i>

1153
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,540
<i>Hey, are you here?</i>

1154
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,618
<i>I'm at the Ferris wheel.
Come find me.</i>

1155
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:39,947
<i>I love it here.</i>

1156
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,118
<i>I've been applying for</i>

1157
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,752
<i>Jobs at a few places.</i>

1158
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:52,764
<i>Entry-level positions.</i>

1159
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,294
<i>Wait, are you recording this?</i>

1160
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,739
Oh, great.

1161
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,642
It's my favorite person.

1162
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,651
I'm good.

1163
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,556
Yeah, I'm not
offering you one.

1164
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,021
- That's okay.
- Yeah. I know it's okay.

1165
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:28,134
You fucked my girlfriend
and you called me washed up.

1166
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,564
Those weren't my exact words.

1167
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:33,162
You 20-somethings, man,
you're all about that.

1168
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,969
Sharing your acute
observations.

1169
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,345
I know I messed up, man.

1170
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:44,845
I'm sorry.

1171
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,711
Is that why
you came over here?

1172
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,315
Mostly.

1173
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,685
- Well, you look like shit.
- So do you.

1174
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:54,658
Yeah, well,
I actually feel terrific.

1175
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,724
<i>Did you know
Sophie moved to the Valley?</i>

1176
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:03,898
North Hollywood.
Is that a real place?

1177
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,375
She's making $6 espressos
at a vegan café

1178
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,067
where they only serve
Fairtrade organic.

1179
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,210
She's better off without me.

1180
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,176
Summerfest is coming up
this Saturday.

1181
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,075
Man, you really messed up
on that one.

1182
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,619
I didn't
deserve it, anyway.

1183
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,285
What's wrong with you?

1184
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,689
Squirrel died.

1185
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,133
It might be my fault.

1186
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,138
Oh, come on, man.
Of course it's not your fault.

1187
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,637
You don't know that.

1188
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,907
<i>It's like, no one thinks
they're a bad person.</i>

1189
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,778
I don't think I'm a good one.

1190
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,157
Man, you're not even
a real person until you're 27.

1191
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,065
I haven't made shit in weeks.

1192
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,126
Don't let it be years.

1193
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,715
Hey.

1194
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:57,909
Hey.

1195
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,220
Are you okay?

1196
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:08,586
Yeah.

1197
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:13,499
So, like,
do you like working here?

1198
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:16,730
No?

1199
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,031
I mean, the tips are shitty

1200
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,730
and the manager's
always hitting on me.

1201
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:24,470
But, you know, if you want
some free pie on Thursdays,

1202
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,806
I might be able to hook it up.

1203
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:26,935
Oh, shit.

1204
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,275
No promises, though, I mean...

1205
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,581
All right.

1206
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,304
Shit!

1207
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:04,833
What are you doing?

1208
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,709
Hold on. Just keep going.
Keep going.

1209
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:29,826
- James.
<i>- What's up?</i>

1210
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,953
Can we talk about
Summerfest real fast?

1211
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,531
I think I have something.

1212
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,403
I'm playing
Summerfest tomorrow.

1213
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:42,973
That's fucking awesome.

1214
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:46,503
Congratulations, man.

1215
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,351
Fellas.

1216
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,593
How ya doin'?
That's my boy Cole. Fellas.

1217
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,567
That's my boy Cole.
Cole. Cole's opening for me.

1218
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:41,929
Nice to meet you.

1219
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:44,030
All right.

1220
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,657
That's a lot of beating hearts
out there.

1221
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,690
Think you can handle it?

1222
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,397
<i>What's up?</i>

1223
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,443
<i>I'm Cole Carter.</i>

1224
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,640
<i>I love it here.
I love it here.</i>

1225
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,447
<i>I love it here.</i>

1226
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:42,771
<i>I love it here.</i>

1227
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,735
Wait, are you recording this?

1228
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:46,999
<i>What, you don't wanna
keep working with the group?</i>

1229
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,674
<i>I don't know.
Do you?</i>

1230
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:52,045
<i>Don't you feel like there's
a lot more we could be doing?</i>

1231
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,611
<i>Like, more quality stuff.</i>

1232
01:26:56,444 --> 01:27:00,119
<i>I mean, Cole, are we ever
gonna be better than this?</i>

1233
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,464
<i>Are we ever
gonna be better than this?</i>

1234
01:27:09,124 --> 01:27:10,604
<i>Are we ever
gonna be better than this?</i>

1235
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,937
<i>Are we ever
gonna be better than this?</i>

1236
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,874
<i>Are we ever
gonna be better than this?</i>

1237
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:34,852
<i>These days
you can invent an app,</i>

1238
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,252
<i>start a blog,
sell shit online.</i>

1239
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,986
<i>But if you're a DJ,</i>

1240
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,923
<i>you're gonna need to start
with one track.</i>

1241
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:44,890
<i>And if it's real enough</i>

1242
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,590
<i>and honest enough,</i>

1243
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,803
<i>and if it's made of
everything that's made you,</i>

1244
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:57,466
<i>where you come from,
who you knew, your history,</i>

1245
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:00,474
<i>then you may have a chance</i>

1246
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:03,242
<i>at connecting
with everyone else.</i>

1247
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:10,919
<i>And maybe that's
your ticket to everything.</i>

1248
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,438
All right, everyone.
One at a time. One at a time.

1249
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,572
Don't fuck with me,
I'm in a good mood.

1250
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:39,474
Who's next?

1251
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:44,979
I'm here to enquire about

1252
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,956
a free piece of pie
that was advertised.

1253
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:49,060
Oh, well, um, I believe

1254
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:51,254
that offer is only
on Thursdays.

1255
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:53,933
But, I mean...

1256
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:56,792
I could make
an exception, I guess.

1257
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:06,877
<i>This is the best part.</i>

1258
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:10,678
<i>The best part
of anything really.</i>

1259
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:15,019
It's the moment
before it starts.

1259
