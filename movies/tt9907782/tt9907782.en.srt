3
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,360
Captain.

4
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,198
Captain.

5
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,835
Thanks, Captain.

6
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,979
Captain.

7
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,355
Hold on.

8
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,983
Hold on, hold on.

9
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,961
Right, bring him to.
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up.

10
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,696
All right, all right.
Bring him over here.

11
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,564
Come on, line him up,
line him up, line him up.

12
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,909
One, two, three, come on.
Bring him over.

13
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,670
Hello, sir.
My name is Dr. Cummins.

14
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,638
I'm going to be
taking care of you.

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,472
Four for a boy...

16
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,942
Okay, we have three shots
in the abdomen.

17
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,519
Five for a wedding,
six for a birth...

18
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,747
- What's he saying?
- Six for a birth.

19
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:52,957
Sounds like a nursery rhyme.

20
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,786
I'm gonna have to go in
and get these.

21
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,228
Hold him down.

22
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,523
Okay, here we go.

23
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,598
One.

24
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,634
Going in for the second.

25
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:13,636
- Stay with me.
- Five for a wedding.

26
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:16,337
- Five for a wedding.
- Two.

27
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,309
Uh, uh, it's shattered.

28
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,311
I'm gonna have to go in
a second time.

29
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,715
- Okay, last one.
- Five for a wedding...

30
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:28,325
Wait a minute,
there's something else in here.

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,919
Okay, here it comes.

32
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,926
Okay.

33
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,997
That's not a German bullet.

34
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,733
Eight for silver.

35
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,542
How is he?

36
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,511
Not so good, ma'am.

37
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:56,839
Charlotte!

38
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,473
I have your book.

39
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,117
Edward, that's my book.
Give it back.

40
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,513
- Give it back!
- Edward, stop this at once!

41
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,048
Charlotte.

42
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,692
Please.

43
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,429
You must stop teasing
your sister.

44
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,526
Delicious.

45
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,460
Thank you.

46
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,965
Anais, would you mind
preparing me some hot water?

47
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,442
- I'd like to take a bath.
- Yes, ma'am.

48
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,193
Hey, you two
better knock it off!

49
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,715
- It's the elders.
- Let's go down and listen.

50
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,261
Yes, we need to find
a solution.

51
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,997
In the last three weeks,
more have joined them.

52
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,765
And do we know
where they are?

53
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,867
They are camped
between Wood Field

54
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,402
and Dei's Rock.

55
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:23,280
They claim the land
belongs to them.

56
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:27,976
Has anyone looked into
the validity of this claim?

57
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:31,113
There does seem to be
some validity to the claim

58
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,215
that dates back 80 years,

59
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,817
but there is nothing
on record

60
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,061
that can't be changed
in our favor.

61
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,690
Has anyone tried
to negotiate with them?

62
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:45,260
They're Gypsies, Seamus.

63
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:47,296
They're laying claim
to a sizeable amount

64
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,364
of our shared lands

65
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,343
and we've made them
an offer to walk away.

66
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,703
The offer was substantial.

67
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,648
They want the land.

68
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,186
That can't be allowed
to happen.

69
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,282
We all have something
to lose in this room,

70
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:11,095
so what I'm suggesting
stays in this room.

71
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:14,156
Charlotte, Edward, off you go.
Off you go. Go, go.

72
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,460
The money that was offered
is used to hire mercenaries

73
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:21,105
to remove them
from the land.

74
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,365
In my experience,

75
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:27,211
the threat of the stick
is normally enough.

76
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,838
This land is not yours.

77
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,911
You're being told
this land is not yours!

78
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:18,581
Gather your people,
get off the land!

79
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,627
Here we go.

80
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,599
Let's take another one.

81
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,248
Caught these two
trying to escape.

82
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,909
Woman had these.

83
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,977
Old whore tried
to fucking bite me with them.

84
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,979
- And did she?
- Nah.

85
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,588
You think you can just
waltz into my country

86
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,456
with your spells and magic

87
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,400
and take whatever land
you fancy?

88
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:18,142
Make an example of them.

89
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:22,179
A warning. His kind
aren't welcome 'round here.

90
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,608
Make sure you bury these
with her.

91
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,209
You sure?

92
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,520
Silver.
Worth a pretty penny.

93
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,223
There's no worth in it.
Just death.

94
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,533
Get 'em outta my sight!

95
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,694
Come on!

96
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:49,406
Put him there.

97
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,510
Now, let's get you
in a nice coat.

98
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:00,050
Yeah, put that on.

99
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:03,353
There we go.

100
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:08,417
We don't want you
getting cold, do we?

101
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,318
You're gonna be out here
a while.

102
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:23,231
Now, this'll teach you

103
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:27,177
to run your filthy Gypsy mouth
to my captain.

104
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,614
Let's get this on you.

105
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,045
Come on! Dirt soon enough.

106
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,183
Shut it.

107
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:27,663

108
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,433

113
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,399
Very nice.

114
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,593
Now time for bed.

115
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,710
I'd like a room
for the night.

116
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:14,912
All guests must
sign in here.

117
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,574
State where you've been,
where you're going,

118
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:19,809
and state your business.

119
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:21,284
Town rules.

120
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,161
Any reports of Gypsies
in the area?

121
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:35,399
Like I said,
state your business here.

122
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,426
Other than that,
food and ale are included

123
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:39,804
with the room.

124
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,841
Take a seat,
I'll bring you some food.

125
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,503
That didn't take very long.

126
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,246
What gave me away?

127
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,641
Other than the fact
you're asking about Gypsies

128
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,643
and you stated
your profession as pathologist

129
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,377
in the guest book,

130
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,822
not much.

131
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,249
Doesn't the good constable
have matters to attend to?

132
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,885
It's lieutenant.

133
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,295
Oh, climbing
the promotion ladder.

134
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:39,864
I'm impressed.

135
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,468
I heard what happened
in Gévaudan.

136
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,703
I'm sorry.

137
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,705
How have you been?

138
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,337
How long will you
be staying?

139
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,841
We could use
a good pathologist 'round here.

140
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,276
Cholera got the last one.

141
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,913
Well, if cholera's the only
thing you have to police,

142
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,724
then you don't need
a pathologist, do you?

143
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,614
Edward!

144
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,506
- Edward!
- Edward!

145
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:40,651
Edward!

146
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,979
Edward, come inside.
Cover yourself!

147
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,388
What happened?

148
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,934
Four for a boy. Five for a
wedding, six for a birth.

149
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,536
Seven for a curse
that's buried in the Earth.

150
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,538
Eight for silver,
nine for gold.

151
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,974
Ten for a wolf
and you won't die old.

152
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,075
Come on, Timmy,
it's your go.

153
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,625
One for sorrow,
two for joy,

154
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,593
three for a girl,
four for a boy.

155
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:25,420
Five for a wedding,
six for a birth.

156
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,131
Seven for a curse
that's buried in the Earth.

157
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:29,100
I've seen it.

158
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,068
Seen what?

159
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,901
Before we go any further, you
must swear not to tell anyone.

160
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,872
I mean it, your father
will banish my family

161
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:44,874
from the settlement
if he finds out.

162
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:48,677
- I swear.
- We swear.

163
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:17,706
We're not supposed
to be here.

164
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:20,242
- The elders forbid it.
- They have forbid it

165
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,678
ever since the night
this field was on fire.

166
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:25,556
But since then...

167
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:29,051
how many of you have dreamt
about the scarecrow

168
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,886
and the silver teeth?

169
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,699
Let's dig up
the box of treasure.

170
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:47,202
- You're scared.
- Am not!

171
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,545
Yes, you are.

172
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,941
- Scaredy-cat.
- Leave him alone.

173
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,720
Are you gonna
dig it up?

174
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,948
If you're so brave,
why don't you dig it up?

175
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,953
All right.

176
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,721
- I will.
- No, Timmy, don't.

177
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,297
Timmy.

178
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,235
Timmy, don't.

179
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,718
Don't touch him, Eddie!

180
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,769
Run, Charlotte, run!

181
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,637
Get out of here, run!

182
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,692
Help!

183
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:28,771
Charlotte!

184
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:30,806
Charlotte,
what's the matter?

185
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,641
What is it?
What's happened?

186
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,320
Fetch the doctor.

187
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:44,361
What's happened?
What happened to him?

188
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,799
Darling,
just be brave, dear.

189
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,360
Here.

190
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:12,881
It's very dark in here.

191
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:15,826
Yes, the light,
it was hurting his eyes.

192
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:17,394
Right.

193
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:21,298
Let's have a look,
shall we?

194
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:25,069
Mm-hm.

195
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:33,702
Edward has been bitten
by some kind of wild animal.

196
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:35,704
The wound does seem
to be infected

197
00:26:35,746 --> 00:26:37,106
and he has a fever.

198
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:38,407
I've treated the wound

199
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,309
and given him
something to, uh,

200
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:41,952
calm him down.

201
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:45,914
I shall come back in a day
or two and check on him.

202
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:47,082
Thank you.

203
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:48,392
This way.

204
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,028
Thank you, Doctor.

205
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,339
Run!

206
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:20,442
Edward?

207
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,087
Edward?

208
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,059
Eddie?

209
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,444
It's Edward.

210
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,179
There's something wrong
with him.

211
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:58,548
Stay here.

212
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:15,964
Edward?

213
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,368
Edward?

214
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,079
Edward!

215
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,087
Edward!

216
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:45,595
Edward!

217
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:53,935
Edward!

218
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:39,490
Molière.

219
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,653
Come to boast about
another promotion, have you?

220
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:46,355
There's a manor house
half a day's ride from here.

221
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:47,923
They've sent for me
regarding their son

222
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,559
who's gone missing.

223
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,561
And what's that
to do with me?

224
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:54,963
There was a Gypsy problem
that way not so long ago.

225
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:58,233
It may be connected
to what you've been looking for.

226
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:22,232
Psst!

227
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:46,457
Timmy?

228
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,992
What happened to Edward
in the field?

229
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,596
You don't remember?

230
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,222
What I remember
was the silver teeth

231
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,467
and then a nightmare,
and then...

232
00:31:57,769 --> 00:31:59,729
and then,
I woke up on the ground.

233
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,332
You used the teeth
to bite Edward.

234
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:10,706
Did you and the others
tell them what happened?

235
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,284
No.

236
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,279
We took an oath,
remember?

237
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:23,318
"And Judas asked,

238
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,353
'What are you willing
to give me

239
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:27,599
if I deliver him
over to you?'

240
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,434
And they counted out
for him

241
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:35,798
30 pieces of silver."

242
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:45,182
It is the same silver
that was given to Judas.

243
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,247
Take this,
you may need it.

244
00:32:58,696 --> 00:33:00,197
Where's the silver?

245
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:02,491
It's here.

246
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:07,429
On holy ground.

247
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,777
I saw the flames
in my nightmare.

248
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:18,641
We will all pay for the sins
made by our elders.

249
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:25,781
We're all going to die.

250
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:45,735
Charlotte!
What did Timmy want?

251
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:49,539
Come.

252
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,618
Edward!

253
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,289
Edward!

254
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,383
Good day, sirs.

255
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:36,319
Please, follow me.

256
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,804
Mr. Laurent will be
with you shortly.

257
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:06,408
Gentlemen.
Seamus Laurent.

258
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,309
Lieutenant Alfred Molière.

259
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,988
- This is the pathologist.
- John McBride.

260
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,616
We have prepared
guest rooms for you

261
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:14,884
in case you need to stay.

262
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:16,719
Mr. Laurent,
you sent for us

263
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:18,721
about an urgent matter
regarding the disappearance

264
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:19,922
of your son.

265
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,322
Yes.

266
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:22,658
But since
we sent for you,

267
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,560
things have gotten
a lot worse.

268
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,534
Jesus.

269
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:08,063
Cause of death is consistent
with attack by a wild animal.

270
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:09,832
A wild animal?

271
00:38:09,874 --> 00:38:11,700
Size and shape
of the bite marks

272
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:13,510
suggest a wolf.

273
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,080
Who is he?

274
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:18,040
The Adams boy.

275
00:38:18,082 --> 00:38:20,350
And your son
is still missing?

276
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:21,944
Yes.

277
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:24,146
Well. That's that.

278
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:26,615
I'll head back to the department
and file a report.

279
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:27,992
Is that it?

280
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,085
You have an attack
by a wild animal.

281
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,620
Your boy's missing.

282
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:33,564
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

283
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,125
but the country's in the middle
of a cholera pandemic.

284
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,902
Thousands are dead.

285
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,771
Many towns are
closing their gates.

286
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:44,700
Trade routes heavily affected.

287
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,043
I'm sorry.

288
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,746
There's nothin' more
I can do.

289
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,040
No, I'd like to stay on
for a few days,

290
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:52,116
if that's all right.

291
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:01,959
Let me know
if your boy shows up.

292
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:19,034
So you knew the boy.

293
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:21,203
My son Edward
and my daughter Charlotte

294
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:23,748
often play with the children
from the settlement.

295
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:27,643
And on the day
Edward went missing,

296
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:29,120
what do you remember?

297
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,479
A group of them
had been in the woods

298
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,057
with the Adams boy.

299
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:37,628
Something had happened
and Edward had been hurt.

300
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:40,122
And by the time we got him
back to the house,

301
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:42,524
he had developed
a terrible fever.

302
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,801
Mm.

303
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:47,537
Something had attacked Edward
in the woods.

304
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:49,774
An animal.

305
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:58,115
He, uh... he had bite marks
on his, um...

306
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:03,486
Yes, they had to have come
from an animal.

307
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:08,693
Charlotte seemed to be in shock.
She couldn't tell us anything.

308
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:12,187
Later that evening,
I went to check on him

309
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:14,657
but his bed was empty
and he was nowhere to be found

310
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:15,532
in the house.

311
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:19,971
We haven't seen him since.

312
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,698
A few days later,
the body of the Adams boy

313
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,241
was found in the woods.

314
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:28,112
Mr. McBride, the families in
the settlement are frightened.

315
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:30,539
They are in my employ,
they live on my land,

316
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,149
and I am responsible
for them.

317
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,986
They're looking to me
to resolve this.

318
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,519
May I present
my wife, Isabelle.

319
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,120
This is Mr. John McBride.

320
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:46,897
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Laurent.

321
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,500
I'm so sorry to hear
your Edward is missing.

322
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:53,595
Is it possible

323
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,597
- he's just run away?
- No.

324
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,232
That wouldn't be
like Edward.

325
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:00,011
You see,
he is a very happy child.

326
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:03,172
Besides,
we have searched everywhere.

327
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:05,207
And we are still
looking for him.

328
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,751
Please help us find him.

329
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:10,546
Why, yes... uh,
may I see his room?

330
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:11,722
Of course.

331
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,176
We had to clean
the sheets.

332
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,312
Edward, he was, um...

333
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:38,082
he was unwell.

334
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,719
May I see
the rest of the house?

335
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:44,713
Of course.

336
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,569
When I came down,

337
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:00,829
this door was wide open.

338
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:44,406
We need to board all the windows
on the ground floor shut.

339
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:45,816
Why?

340
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:48,377
It's just a precaution.

341
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:12,167
♪ Come over the hills,
my bonnie Irish lass ♪

342
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:19,675
♪ Come over the hills
to your darling ♪

343
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:25,380
♪ You choose the road, love,
and I'll... ♪♪

344
00:43:29,426 --> 00:43:30,953
Anais.

345
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,389
Charlotte.

346
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,915
John?

347
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:20,090
Are we going to die?

348
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,294
Of course not!

349
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:27,989
I will not stand
for such talk at the table.

350
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:30,959
Mr. McBride is here
to help us find Edward,

351
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:34,664
and we can help him
by maintaining our strength

352
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:36,473
and remaining steadfast.

353
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:39,635
Now, eat, please.

354
00:48:33,397 --> 00:48:34,724
Hm.

355
00:49:58,382 --> 00:49:59,483
McBride?

356
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:01,343
Seamus, fetch a rifle.

357
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:31,807
What kind of animal
tries to break into houses?

358
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,778
There are some things
I'm going to need from you.

359
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:40,315
What's happening here?

360
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:42,785
Can't be sure until I set up
a hunting ground.

361
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,528
You're gonna hunt it?

362
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:46,163
Mm.

363
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:52,402
I'll need to gather the elders
and tell them of your plans.

364
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,898
We own all the land
in this region.

365
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,770
Make sure they travel
under armed guard.

366
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:15,518
Gentlemen, you're all aware
of the unfortunate circumstances

367
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,795
that have brought us here
this evening,

368
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:19,889
the killing
of the local child

369
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:22,634
and the disappearance
of my own son, Edward.

370
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:25,928
Mr. John McBride
has kindly offered

371
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,505
to help capture the animal
that killed the Adams boy.

372
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:31,834
You are sure that this is
some kind of animal,

373
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,310
not the work of a madman?

374
00:51:34,378 --> 00:51:35,738
After examining the body,

375
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,540
I concluded
that the cause of death

376
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:40,384
had been consistent
with an animal bite.

377
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:43,788
What kind of an animal
are we talking about?

378
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:46,356
Wolf.

379
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:50,662
You're a pathologist.

380
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:52,722
That's correct.

381
00:51:52,764 --> 00:51:54,899
What does that mean,
exactly?

382
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,827
Our body speaks
even after our death.

383
00:51:57,869 --> 00:51:58,502
I listen.

384
00:52:00,638 --> 00:52:02,798
Isn't it a job
for hunters?

385
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,635
I'm sure we've all read about
the Beast of Gévaudan,

386
00:52:05,677 --> 00:52:07,435
perhaps heard the stories.

387
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:08,838
You see,
I was stationed there

388
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,840
during the troubles
with the army.

389
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:13,308
You think what happened
in Gévaudan is happening here?

390
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,711
It might very well be.

391
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:18,681
Then, isn't this a job
for the army?

392
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:20,916
Unfortunately,
the army can... will...

393
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,918
only be deployed
if there is confirmation

394
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,563
that the same thing is happening
here as in Gévaudan.

395
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:30,358
Are you suggesting
that we stay inside our house

396
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,227
and board the windows shut?

397
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:34,429
I would strongly advise it.

398
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:58,988
No one should be
out in the field

399
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,790
until that madman is caught.

400
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:01,991
There's no use
complaining.

401
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:03,926
We drew the short straws.

402
00:53:03,968 --> 00:53:06,461
We get this done,
we get ourselves home,

403
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:08,296
all right?

404
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:10,298
Jakob,
you take the far side.

405
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,275
We'll work inwards
till we meet in the middle.

406
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:17,247
Keep your eyes peeled.
Stay in sight.

407
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,474
All right?

408
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,445
Calum?

409
00:54:15,606 --> 00:54:16,832
Calum!

410
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,913
Calum!

411
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:39,454
Jakob?

412
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,627
Jakob?

413
00:54:48,606 --> 00:54:50,132
Jakob?

414
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:59,141
Jakob?

415
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:18,961
Jakob?

416
00:55:34,886 --> 00:55:36,879
Jakob?

417
00:55:57,507 --> 00:55:58,601
Run!

418
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:08,611
Help!

419
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,179
Somebody help!

420
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:15,951
Help!

421
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:28,639
This is all we found.

422
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,936
Anne-Marie was working
the fields with Calum and Jakob.

423
00:56:33,978 --> 00:56:36,572
She made it back to the
settlement and raised the alarm.

424
00:56:36,614 --> 00:56:38,749
We came back here
and...

425
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,677
no Calum and no Jakob.

426
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,078
Did the girl see
what attacked them?

427
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,115
Well... she's in shock.

428
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:47,816
What... what she says
makes no sense.

429
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:49,526
What did she say?

430
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,996
She said it was a dragon.

431
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,257
She's in a bad way,
she... she's lost a lot of blood.

432
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:56,901
She was bitten?

433
00:56:58,602 --> 00:57:00,195
Where is she?

434
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,588
She... she was just here.

435
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:23,552
Everyone must leave.

436
00:57:23,594 --> 00:57:25,921
We can't protect them
in the field or in the village.

437
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,756
It's no longer safe here.

438
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:29,892
- And go where?
- Take them to the church,

439
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:31,260
barricade the door shut.

440
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:33,162
Food and water
can be fetched for,

441
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:35,631
but under armed escort only.

442
00:57:35,673 --> 00:57:37,933
It is imperative
that we limit this exposure.

443
00:57:37,975 --> 00:57:39,243
Exposure?

444
00:57:40,077 --> 00:57:41,879
- Exposure to what?
- Seamus,

445
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:44,648
you and your people
are being hunted.

446
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:47,109
Water, I need water.

447
00:59:22,913 --> 00:59:24,406
Sorry.

448
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:25,407
Oh.

449
00:59:25,449 --> 00:59:27,218
Can't sleep.

450
00:59:28,919 --> 00:59:30,846
Oh, me neither.

451
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:31,822
Drink?

452
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:36,994
Yes.

453
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:50,074
Who's Edith?

454
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:53,277
My wife.

455
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,714
Do you have children?

456
01:00:03,154 --> 01:00:05,089
Seems a long time ago now.

457
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:07,892
Are they no longer
with you?

458
01:00:12,163 --> 01:00:14,331
We'd been stationed
to Gévaudan.

459
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:19,170
They were plagued
by a wolf.

460
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:24,366
Two people had been killed
in the first week,

461
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:26,443
six the following.

462
01:00:27,745 --> 01:00:29,747
That's when the army
had been drafted in.

463
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,253
There was talk
that the wolf was a curse,

464
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:39,356
and if people need to know.

465
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:44,762
The first time I saw it,

466
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:47,932
it was covered
in fresh blood,

467
01:00:48,399 --> 01:00:50,401
just outside our village.

468
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:54,939
By the time I got back there,
it was... too late.

469
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,210
Thirteen people
had been killed by the beast.

470
01:01:00,344 --> 01:01:02,913
My wife and daughter
were among them.

471
01:01:10,555 --> 01:01:12,489
I'm so sorry.

472
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:28,205
Did they ever catch
this wolf?

473
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:33,368
Shortly after that,

474
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:36,413
a band of traveling gypsies
came to Gévaudan.

475
01:01:37,414 --> 01:01:40,142
They said the curse
had had its revenge

476
01:01:40,184 --> 01:01:43,254
and was to be contained
in gypsy silver.

477
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:45,548
They then traveled northwest,

478
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,025
but the trail went cold
in Le Malzieu.

479
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:52,329
Well, the gypsies had a claim
on my husband's land.

480
01:01:52,863 --> 01:01:54,456
My husband and the elders...

481
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:55,399
That's enough!

482
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:03,073
That's enough.

483
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,076
I want no more talk
of curses.

484
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:08,279
We've locked everybody
in a church,

485
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:10,372
and I have nobody
working the fields.

486
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,983
If you're here to help,
then please help.

487
01:02:14,586 --> 01:02:17,045
I just want this beast
or this wolf or whatever it is

488
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,981
captured and killed.

489
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:21,258
Tomorrow
I will set the traps.

490
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:55,893
What in God's name is it?

491
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:05,360
Gentlemen,
I must warn you,

492
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:07,162
this won't be easy.

493
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,240
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

494
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:08,758
- It's Anne-Marie.
- Don't touch it!

495
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,801
She's gone.

496
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,994
They never come back
the same.

497
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:19,711
It's the kindest thing
we can do for her now, Saul.

498
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:22,905
I've known her
since she was a baby.

499
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:24,506
Saul.

500
01:09:26,483 --> 01:09:28,744
Saul!

501
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:31,823
- Saul!
- Saul!

502
01:09:34,025 --> 01:09:35,718
Oh, Jesus Christ!

503
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,852
Saul!

504
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:40,623
Saul, shoot her!

505
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:41,657
Do it now!

506
01:09:57,547 --> 01:10:00,350
Is this a fate
that has befallen my son?

507
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:09,618
Isabelle must never know
about this, I beg you.

508
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,362
What else
doesn't she know about?

509
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:16,934
Do you dream much,
Seamus?

510
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:20,462
The land of Gévaudan
had been cursed.

511
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:23,065
At night, everyone had
the same dream.

512
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:24,307
Who is she?

513
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:26,068
What?

514
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:28,369
The woman buried
in the field.

515
01:10:28,411 --> 01:10:30,072
Woman... I don't know
what you're talking about.

516
01:10:30,114 --> 01:10:32,349
She cursed the land.

517
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:34,643
That's absurd.

518
01:10:34,685 --> 01:10:36,879
Is what you just saw absurd?

519
01:10:36,921 --> 01:10:38,547
The dreams, the beast.

520
01:10:38,589 --> 01:10:40,950
You were cursed,
and it started with Edward.

521
01:10:40,992 --> 01:10:44,019
Edward? Edward had
nothing to do with this.

522
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:46,655
He will kill
and keep on killing.

523
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:48,891
- Edward is innocent.
- Anyone who survives an attack

524
01:10:48,933 --> 01:10:51,093
will change until the curse
has had its revenge.

525
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,829
Revenge? I am the one
seeking revenge

526
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:56,641
for what this thing
has done to my family!

527
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:02,379
I started this,
so I will finish it.

528
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:06,951
I will hunt it myself and put
an end to it once and for all.

529
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:11,556
Now you burn
this thing...

530
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,860
...whatever it is.

531
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:23,592
Get the torch.

532
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:48,059
Please don't leave us,
Nana.

533
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:57,635
Go on, Charlotte.

534
01:12:35,472 --> 01:12:36,841
Isabelle...

535
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,411
Who is the woman
buried in the field?

536
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:53,515
It's the only trophy
that's kept locked in a drawer

537
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:55,593
and not displayed
on the wall.

538
01:12:58,095 --> 01:13:00,497
We must find
what was buried.

539
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:07,905
We've all dreamt of the silver
that has cursed this land.

540
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:13,177
On the body of Timmy, I found
a page torn from the Bible.

541
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:17,740
He knew something
about the silver,

542
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:20,017
as there was
a passage underlined.

543
01:13:21,085 --> 01:13:23,846
"As silver is melted
in the furnace,

544
01:13:23,888 --> 01:13:26,657
so will you be melted
in its midst;

545
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,053
and you shall know
that I, the Lord,

546
01:13:31,095 --> 01:13:33,856
have poured out My fury
upon you."

547
01:13:40,705 --> 01:13:44,942
Ezekiel 22:22.

548
01:13:48,012 --> 01:13:49,213
Charlotte...

549
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:52,683
is there anything
you can tell us?

550
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:55,119
Anything at all?

551
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:13,862
"And Judas asked,
'What are you willing to give me

552
01:14:13,904 --> 01:14:16,040
if I deliver Him over to you?'

553
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:19,969
So they counted out for him
30 pieces of silver."

554
01:14:23,347 --> 01:14:25,908
The silver from the dream.

555
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:29,078
You believe it was
the same silver given to Judas.

556
01:14:31,789 --> 01:14:33,758
Where is the silver?

557
01:14:38,829 --> 01:14:40,998
McBride, open the door!

558
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,510
We've all prayed
for your safety.

559
01:14:52,943 --> 01:14:54,737
Some of the men
have joined Seamus

560
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:56,105
to go and hunt the beast.

561
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:57,639
We cannot control
what Seamus

562
01:14:57,681 --> 01:14:58,516
is doing or has done.

563
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:01,118
I believe there is
a way to stop this.

564
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:02,753
Charlotte...

565
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:04,947
where is it?

566
01:15:27,812 --> 01:15:30,139
Saul,
send word to Molière.

567
01:15:30,181 --> 01:15:32,608
The army must
be deployed immediately.

568
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:35,920
And, Saul,
I need a blacksmith.

569
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,500
We'll try again tomorrow
at first light.

570
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:52,507
Isabelle?

571
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:55,919
Isabelle?

572
01:18:57,254 --> 01:18:59,181
Have you seen my wife?

573
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:01,116
I'm sorry, sir.

574
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:03,285
What's the matter with you,
are you sick?

575
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:04,428
No, I'm fine.

576
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:06,888
Go and clean yourself up.

577
01:20:21,972 --> 01:20:23,907
One hundred.

578
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:27,077
Two hundred.

579
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,447
Three hundred.

580
01:20:31,716 --> 01:20:33,550
Four hundred.

581
01:20:34,184 --> 01:20:36,011
Five hundred.

582
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,168
Is anyone missing?

583
01:20:53,203 --> 01:20:54,905
Everybody's here.

584
01:20:56,173 --> 01:20:57,207
What is it?

585
01:20:58,142 --> 01:21:00,235
Where is the maid?

586
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:02,371
She's in the kitchen,
why?

587
01:21:08,318 --> 01:21:09,587
I think
you should leave here.

588
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:13,649
Charlotte, darling,
please go to your room.

589
01:21:22,099 --> 01:21:23,492
- Tomorrow.
- No, Seamus.

590
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:25,160
We need John's help.

591
01:21:25,202 --> 01:21:26,461
We'll hunt again
at first light

592
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:27,963
and put an end
to all this.

593
01:21:28,005 --> 01:21:29,164
And come back
empty-handed

594
01:21:29,206 --> 01:21:30,533
just like you did today.

595
01:21:30,575 --> 01:21:32,100
Like all the weeks
the army tried

596
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:34,102
to hunt
the Beast of Gévaudan.

597
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,104
It's you it wants,
Seamus.

598
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,047
You and your kin.

599
01:21:37,882 --> 01:21:39,575
Dead or chains
makes no difference.

600
01:21:39,617 --> 01:21:41,276
You don't have
to go hunt for it,

601
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:43,345
because it will hunt you
for what you've done.

602
01:21:43,387 --> 01:21:45,615
What I did I did
for my family.

603
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:48,684
The gypsies, they had a claim
to the land, didn't they?

604
01:21:48,726 --> 01:21:50,961
- It was my land.
- And you stole it from them!

605
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:53,623
- And I lost my son!
- Now you know the cost of greed.

606
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:56,425
My wife and child paid the price
because of men like you!

607
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:58,101
Please, please.

608
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,564
I just want
to find my Edward.

609
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,142
Yes.

610
01:22:07,077 --> 01:22:10,080
Why don't you ask
your husband where he is?

611
01:22:12,784 --> 01:22:13,984
Get out.

612
01:22:15,587 --> 01:22:17,379
You know, Seamus,
all this time

613
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:20,558
I thought I was tracking
the beast that took my family.

614
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:24,328
But now I realize
I got it all wrong.

615
01:22:24,696 --> 01:22:26,455
I'm just the caretaker,

616
01:22:26,497 --> 01:22:29,090
making sure it all
gets put back in the box

617
01:22:29,132 --> 01:22:31,694
before any more
innocent people are killed.

618
01:22:34,304 --> 01:22:36,465
I'm staying here
until the army arrives.

619
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:19,609
I miss Edward.

620
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,452
Can you stay with me
here tonight?

621
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:31,587
Of course, darling.

622
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:21,264
Anais?

623
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,955
Anais?

624
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:49,419
Have you seen Seamus?

625
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:18,774
Isabelle!

626
01:28:18,816 --> 01:28:19,975
Isabelle!

627
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:23,821
Charlotte!

628
01:28:24,856 --> 01:28:26,949
Charlotte, Isabelle!

629
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:27,825
Isabelle!

630
01:28:30,828 --> 01:28:32,655
Seamus!

631
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,660
It's Seamus,
he's gone outside.

632
01:28:37,702 --> 01:28:38,970
He's out...

633
01:28:39,502 --> 01:28:40,663
Find Charlotte.

634
01:28:40,705 --> 01:28:42,598
The house is on fire, go!

635
01:28:47,111 --> 01:28:48,537
Seamus!

636
01:28:51,682 --> 01:28:52,942
Seamus!

637
01:28:54,652 --> 01:28:55,845
Seamus!

638
01:29:17,074 --> 01:29:18,200
Charlotte.

639
01:29:21,946 --> 01:29:23,806
Charlotte,
we must leave the house.

640
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:28,911
Seamus!

641
01:29:34,491 --> 01:29:35,885
Seamus.

642
01:29:49,607 --> 01:29:51,541
It was Anais.

643
01:29:52,509 --> 01:29:53,736
I shot it.

644
01:29:59,183 --> 01:30:02,019
I see the flames
every night, John.

645
01:30:02,954 --> 01:30:03,955
I was bitten.

646
01:30:05,856 --> 01:30:07,182
I'll change.

647
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:09,827
Tell Isabelle and Charlotte

648
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:12,487
I'm so, so sorry.

649
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:13,956
No, no, wait, wait!

650
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,628
Isabelle, Charlotte.

651
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,829
Come on!

652
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:06,735
Wait, where's Seamus?

653
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:12,341
We have to get
to the church.

654
01:32:12,383 --> 01:32:14,843
It's the only
safe place. Let's go.

655
01:32:17,688 --> 01:32:19,014
Come on!

656
01:32:19,056 --> 01:32:20,191
Let's go!

657
01:32:41,078 --> 01:32:42,137
Come, come, come.

658
01:33:03,734 --> 01:33:04,969
Nana?

659
01:33:05,903 --> 01:33:07,905
Get down, get down.

660
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:15,713
Stay still, stay still.

661
01:33:26,323 --> 01:33:27,382
Nana?

662
01:33:34,899 --> 01:33:36,725
Charlotte,
you must be quiet.

663
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:41,196
Stay right there.

664
01:33:58,789 --> 01:34:00,057
Silver.

665
01:34:03,093 --> 01:34:05,187
Get up, get up!

666
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:06,430
Come on, move, go!

667
01:34:07,431 --> 01:34:08,857
Come.

668
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:15,230
Stay behind me
and move towards the church.

669
01:34:15,272 --> 01:34:17,866
Move, go, go.

670
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:46,962
Let us in!

671
01:34:48,072 --> 01:34:49,831
Let us in!

672
01:34:53,444 --> 01:34:55,804
- Let us in!
- Open the door!

673
01:34:55,846 --> 01:34:57,272
Open the door!

674
01:35:02,253 --> 01:35:03,754
Close the door.

675
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:07,391
What's happened?

676
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:11,220
The manor is on fire.

677
01:35:11,262 --> 01:35:12,796
And Seamus?

678
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:15,532
He didn't make it.

679
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,859
We barely made it here.

680
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:19,837
It stalked us
the whole way.

681
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:22,532
Were you all that is left?

682
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:23,941
Aye.

683
01:35:24,341 --> 01:35:26,134
So what do we do now?

684
01:35:26,176 --> 01:35:28,270
- We wait.
- Wait?

685
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:29,813
Wait for what?

686
01:35:30,247 --> 01:35:32,341
No, no,
I'm tired of waiting,

687
01:35:32,383 --> 01:35:33,250
hiding.

688
01:35:34,952 --> 01:35:36,487
We're like sheep.

689
01:35:37,888 --> 01:35:39,549
If you're telling me
the thing that killed my son

690
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:41,149
is just outside
those doors, I say,

691
01:35:41,191 --> 01:35:42,884
I say we go outside
and we kill it.

692
01:35:42,926 --> 01:35:44,520
You go out those doors
and you will be dead.

693
01:35:47,264 --> 01:35:49,500
How come you made it here?
You're not dead.

694
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:51,969
I have something
it's afraid of.

695
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:53,937
What?

696
01:35:54,572 --> 01:35:56,331
I have the silver bullet.

697
01:35:56,373 --> 01:35:58,166
But we have to wait
for daylight,

698
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,603
draw it into the open
and have a clean shot.

699
01:36:00,645 --> 01:36:02,413
That is our only hope.

700
01:36:04,048 --> 01:36:06,141
We got word to Molière.

701
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:08,443
The army will be here
by morning.

702
01:36:08,485 --> 01:36:10,421
- That's good.
- Now rest.

703
01:36:11,989 --> 01:36:14,149
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

704
01:36:38,248 --> 01:36:40,117
I believe this belonged
to your boy.

705
01:37:13,283 --> 01:37:15,552
What happened to Seamus?

706
01:37:18,222 --> 01:37:19,657
It was Anais.

707
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:25,062
He was badly wounded
when I got to him.

708
01:37:27,699 --> 01:37:30,401
He told me to tell you
and Charlotte...

709
01:37:31,502 --> 01:37:33,404
that he was sorry.

710
01:37:40,411 --> 01:37:42,980
Is Edward lost
to this nightmare?

711
01:37:54,091 --> 01:37:55,926
I can't say.

712
01:38:14,612 --> 01:38:17,247
The sins of my people
have soiled.

713
01:38:18,783 --> 01:38:21,185
But now I come to you
as a mother,

714
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:24,689
aching the weight
of my grief, please.

715
01:38:25,723 --> 01:38:28,718
Anything I can give,
any path,

716
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:31,153
please show me,
I beg you.

717
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:34,189
Show us mercy, if there is
any hope, please show me.

718
01:38:34,231 --> 01:38:35,700
I beg you, Lord,
show us mercy.

719
01:39:44,802 --> 01:39:46,596
Please don't leave us,
don't go!

720
01:39:46,638 --> 01:39:48,463
Please, Mother!

721
01:39:48,505 --> 01:39:49,707
Edward.

722
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:53,536
Mother, please, please,
come get me!

723
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:54,712
Mother!

724
01:39:56,513 --> 01:39:57,840
Edward.

725
01:39:57,882 --> 01:40:01,084
Edward, I'm coming.

726
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:04,747
Isabelle!

727
01:40:04,789 --> 01:40:06,114
No!

728
01:40:08,258 --> 01:40:09,719
Mother!

729
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:19,695
Get back!

730
01:40:21,471 --> 01:40:22,598
Move!

731
01:41:29,607 --> 01:41:31,441
Enough!

732
01:41:32,209 --> 01:41:34,378
- Isabelle.
- Edward.

733
01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:37,280
Move out of the way.

734
01:41:37,949 --> 01:41:40,918
Please come get me!

735
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,579
No.

736
01:41:43,621 --> 01:41:44,622
I'm sorry.

737
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:55,544
Picked them up
off the church floor.

738
01:44:02,627 --> 01:44:04,854
He doesn't remember
anything.

739
01:44:08,633 --> 01:44:09,533
Edward.

740
01:44:10,601 --> 01:44:11,769
Son.

741
01:44:13,503 --> 01:44:16,641
You and your sister are going
to come and live with me now.

742
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:18,901
All right?

743
01:44:24,949 --> 01:44:27,777
None of this
was your fault, son.

744
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,560
All right.

745
01:44:36,393 --> 01:44:37,995
Up you go.

746
01:44:38,796 --> 01:44:39,764
Charlotte.

747
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:44,602
Charlotte.

748
01:44:51,175 --> 01:44:52,601
It's time.

749
