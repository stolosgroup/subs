00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,928
1 standard lamp...

169
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,262
Not my lamp!

170
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,929
1 TV, brand: Radiola.

171
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,386
Not my TV!

172
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,471
A dresser, style:

173
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,096
country or rustic.

174
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,554
Bunch of assfuckers!

175
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:17,837
If you have a complaint,
phone the Court.

176
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:20,762
The number is on
the paper I gave you.

177
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:38,263
<i>To make a bill Payment,
say "Payment".

178
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:40,013
It worked just now.

179
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:43,722
<i>Please repeat. I did not
understand your selection.

180
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,389
<i>- Going out tonight?
- To a party.

181
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,056
<i>Call the guys up, then.

182
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:05,181
<i>- Where is it?
- In Paris.

183
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,991
What's up, Granny?

184
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,725
I want to see the boss.

185
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:32,558
Who?

186
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,057
Vito!

187
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,475
What name?

188
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,100
Get off me, Jigaboo!

189
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,475
Say that again.

190
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,016
Let her go!

191
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,600
What d'ya want?

192
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,567
To talk to Mr Vito, please.

193
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:52,976
That's me.

194
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,767
Who is it?

195
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:02,584
Mr Vito, I know what you do.
I want in.

196
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,276
Oh yeah? What is it I do?

197
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,202
I want to sell drugs.

198
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,012
Hey Granny, you think
this is a retirement home?

199
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,502
Hold on! I ran a business for
35 years and very well, too!

200
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,535
Go to bed, Granny, it's late.

201
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:28,161
No idea what you're talking about.

202
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:45,694
We thought you weren't coming.

203
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:48,278
Hello, my little darling!

204
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:51,354
- Peekaboo!
- No!

205
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,436
He'll need a dentist.

206
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,895
I'm partners with Maria,
you're with Renée.

207
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,687
Renée? She can't recognize
her own name!
205.1
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:00,937
Paulette!

208
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,929
What? It's true, isn't it?

209
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,479
Yes, but we take turns.

210
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,062
Hi, Walter!

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,912
Ladies!

212
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,255
That's all we needed!

213
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:17,396
You're more resplendent
every day.

214
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,546
Mr Walter!

215
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,738
It's true.

216
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,322
OK, whose turn is it?

217
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:28,896
Pass.

218
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,147
You gonna bid today?...

219
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,997
Where's Francis?

220
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,996
Renée, just play.

221
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:43,922
Remember, we played at the
restaurant, before our shift?

222
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,173
We should put her to sleep.
She's just gonna get worse.

223
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:54,347
Go on, play, Alzheimer!

224
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:17,708
Ousmane, Yves, that way!

225
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,024
Hurry!

226
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:26,601
Now what?...

227
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,483
Peek-a-boo!
It's Granny Paulette...

228
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,317
bringing you something you lost!

229
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:34,317
You fucker!

230
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,442
Go on, whack that ...!

231
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,109
Square, triangle!

232
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,560
Where d'you get that?

233
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:45,775
In a trashcan.

234
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:47,934
What trashcan?

235
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,443
Listen, Mr Vito,

236
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,813
I know that Jérémy and his
pal sell drugs.

237
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:54,998
I saw them.

238
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:58,561
I promise I won't complain
if you give me work.

239
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,268
I can't afford to eat.

240
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,561
I worked my whole life.

241
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,996
She lives in Block Victor Hugo.

242
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,461
There must an opening
now that Jérémy's in jail.

243
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,561
And the fuzz on your ass.

244
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,444
The what?

245
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,568
The cops.

246
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,744
Who'd suspect me?

247
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:21,652
Listen...

248
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,861
Paulette.

249
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,512
It's the first a little old ladywants to work for me.

250
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,803
Maybe not such a dumb idea.

251
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:43,647
I'll try you out. 90-10.

252
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:44,998
90% for me,

253
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:46,888
10% for you.

254
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,937
It's a deal, Mr Vito.

255
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,870
Know what to do?

256
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:56,313
5-gram bars.
Want me to show you?

257
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,996
No. What do you think I am?

258
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:03,971
You nuts, Vito?

259
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,739
Very clever, bro!

260
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,621
Don't you get it?
In business you gotta innovate

261
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,280
Keep it down!

262
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,656
What does this shit
sell for, anyway?

263
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,690
Francis, do you know?

264
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:56,024
Ousmane, you have a visitor.

265
00:20:57,992 --> 00:20:59,324
Something wrong?

266
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,032
Everything's fine.

267
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,866
Why are you here?

268
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,882
I came to say hello.

269
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,074
- So, Osama...
- Ousmane.

270
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,616
Could you show me around a bit?

271
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,283
I've never seen a police station.

272
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,699
The thing is...

273
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,425
Where's the stuff you confiscate?

274
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,200
I dunno, like...

275
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,267
contraband cigarettes, coke...

276
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,618
Won't you show me,

277
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,725
dear little Ousmene.

278
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,618
100 kilos!

279
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,990
How much would that fetch?

280
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,618
200 to 250,000 euros.

281
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:44,801
That much!

282
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,834
Biggest bust we made !

283
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,152
And this?

284
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,319
5 kilos. 10,000 euros.
Twice that, on the street.

285
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:56,985
5,000 grams, each worth... hm

286
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,895
Know where I can get some hashish?

287
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:13,635
What?!

288
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:15,478
Hashish.

289
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:18,777
- Hash!
- I got it.

290
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,991
You get stoned at your age?

291
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:24,203
At my what?

292
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:27,999
Never mind. By the station,
in the underpass.

293
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,004
- At your age it's not right.
- Here's my age!

294
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,830
Want some dope?

295
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,456
Some what?

296
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,417
Want some drugs?

297
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,413
Hashish!
295.1
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:43,449
M'sieur, you want drugs?

298
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,040
You work for the cops?
296.1
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,540
Hashish.

299
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:49,299
You're a narc?!.. Man!

300
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,108
No, I sell drugs.

301
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,125
What're you doin'? Dealing?

302
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:08,790
Who do you think you are,
selling shit to grannies?

303
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,584
I'm not.

304
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:12,458
Go on, beat it! Piss off!

305
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,542
If I see you dealin' here,

306
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,417
I'll kick your head in!

307
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:18,416
Beat it!

308
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,001
How much for a bar?

309
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,127
Well, 25 euros.

310
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:34,584
5 grams. I weighed it myself.

311
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,334
I only have 20.

312
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:38,626
Alright.

313
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:41,460
Thanks!

314
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:46,600
You here often?

315
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,627
I'd rather buy from you than
those kids who sell me crap.

316
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:54,935
At least, I can be sure you
don't work for the police.

317
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:57,511
What an ass!

318
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,044
- I hope it's not cut with tires.
- Tires?

319
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:03,744
Don't worry, grandma.
If it's good, I'll be back often.

320
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:18,462
Already?

321
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,504
- It's all there.
- Sure?

322
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,420
Don't just stand there,
get the shit!

323
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,180
- 10%, right?
- That's right.

324
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:41,671
Thank you, Mr Vito.

325
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,214
There!

326
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,492
What is it, boy?
What is it, "Delinquent"?

327
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,965
Find it, "Delinquent"!

328
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,341
Track him.

329
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,174
Filthy beast!

330
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:35,757
Track'im!

331
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,590
Good boy!

332
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,341
Get off me!

333
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,501
Hold your slobbery mutt!

334
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,841
Filthy beast!

335
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,849
Hold your dog dammit!
He knocked the lady over!

336
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,550
"Delinquent" is on a trail.
334.1
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,050
"Trail" ?!..
He's on my mother-in-law.

337
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,634
No, I'll carry it.

338
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:58,215
I'll manage alone.

339
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,208
No, I insist.

340
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,990
Heavy bag!

341
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:06,610
What you got in it, hm?

342
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,392
Drugs.

343
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,685
Drugs?!

344
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:13,760
No, it's OK.

345
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,717
That's a good one!

346
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,801
I didn't know you could be so funny.

347
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,670
Well, thanks.

348
00:27:21,677 --> 00:27:25,893
I bet the elevator's out.
I'll take it upstairs.

349
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:37,801
Thanks a lot.

350
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:45,510
You know, I'm really pleased...

351
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:49,295
we can talk.
Things improved between us.

352
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:52,245
You stopped calling me a "filthy Black".

353
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,800
- Can I ask you...
- Yes?

354
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:08,103
How much does a cannabis
retailer earn?

355
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,379
Paulette, open up!

356
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,338
Oh, shit!

357
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,843
If you don't open
I'll call the super...

358
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:35,100
Where have you been?

359
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:37,871
We keep calling,
but you never answer.

360
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:41,905
You don't even come to play cards.

361
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,305
Are you redecorating?

362
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:53,139
It smells good.
It smells really good!

363
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:55,535
Not in there!

364
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,005
What are you hiding?

365
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,015
Someone's in there.

366
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:03,431
Who?

367
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,772
A man.

368
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,803
Introduce us.

369
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,516
He's not "visible".

370
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,390
- You mean...?
- Buck naked.

371
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:11,307
All naked?

372
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:13,806
I'll tell you later.

373
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,940
Who do you think it is?

374
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,051
The janitor?

375
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:22,850
No, she can't stand him.

376
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:24,190
Not Father Baptiste?

377
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,382
No. Plus, he's black.

378
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,349
Notice, they were doing it
in the kitchen!

379
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,222
It must be very physical.

380
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:32,449
- Passionate.
- And how!

381
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:35,649
Walter !

382
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:37,102
No !

383
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,825
Why the fuck is she here?

384
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:46,308
1 euro a can!

385
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,680
A can of tuna, 1 euro.

386
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,058
2 steaks, 1 euro!

387
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:58,802
Shit, Afghan, ganja!

388
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,511
- Good stuff?
- Oh, yeah!

389
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:01,792
I'll take it.

390
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,459
Got the money?

391
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:05,176
Piss off!

392
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,334
You short changed me.

393
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,998
You owe me 20 euro.

394
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:17,901
Here. Later!

395
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,600
Hi. Got more stuff?

396
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,094
5 bars for the price of 4.
A bargain!

397
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,060
Here you are.

398
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,999
Never touch the stuff, Madame.

399
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:36,319
Top-quality...

400
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,180
When will you reconnect my phone?

401
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,386
Tomorrow, or the next day.

402
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,312
Not today?

403
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,762
Your payment has to clear.

404
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:02,837
Fucking trade unionist!

405
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,979
Who's this?

406
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,480
Come now, Renée...

407
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,929
...it's Paulette.

408
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:26,488
I didn't recognize you.

409
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:28,772
What's that coat?

410
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,322
It's calfskin.

411
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,431
The bag's new, too!

412
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,106
From that guy, the other day?

413
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:34,999
Who?

414
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,016
You know very well, who.

415
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,564
In the kitchen.

416
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,823
Drop it. You're like the Fuzz!

417
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,489
- The what?
- "Fuzz".

418
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:53,864
My respects, Miss.

419
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,349
You're ravishing, today!

420
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,865
It's him, the old fool!

421
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,441
No, it's not him.

422
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,649
Who, then?
420.1
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,649
A young one.
You heard how she speaks now!

423
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,315
- Where are you going?
- You promised to tell us.

424
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,065
Later. Can't now.

425
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,816
Body of Christ...
423.1
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,916
Body of Christ...

426
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,858
Father Baptiste, I've sinned.

427
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,083
You put roaches
in your neighbor's food?

428
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:29,892
Worse than that, father.

429
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,741
The sin of lust?

430
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:36,816
No! Worse than that.

431
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:40,634
What have you done, my child?

432
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,267
I sold drugs.

433
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,026
You sold what?!

434
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,451
Hash, ganja...

435
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,392
Paulette, you know it's forbidden!

436
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,402
I know it's wrong, very wrong.

437
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,385
A momentary lapse.
Never do it again.

438
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:04,234
I earn money, I meet people...

439
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:07,943
I pay off my debts,
I buy myself nice things...

440
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,818
I feel as excited

441
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,652
as when we had the restaurant.

442
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,944
I want to make a donation.

443
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:18,653
I want God to profit from it, too.

444
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:23,360
Just put it in the box.
I don't want to know.

445
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,900
So that some "Sand Monkey"
could snatch it!

446
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:28,111
No, thanks! I'll give it
directly to you.
444.1
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,311
Paulette!

447
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,611
What?

448
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,886
Your collection at Mass
won't pay for the new roof.

449
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:36,986
Go on!

450
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:39,694
Hallelujah!

451
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,863
It's Granny Giggles!

452
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,820
Go sell your shit!

453
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,446
Don't go, Granny.
You got good stuff.

454
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,780
What's in your bag?

455
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,445
What's your name,
Granny Giggles!

456
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:04,920
Give me your bag, Granny.

457
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:09,571
Not so proud now, you old slut?

458
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,101
What's with you?

459
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:13,071
And you!..
You're French, dammit!

460
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,180
Yeah, so?...

461
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,905
Stop. Have you guys flipped?

462
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,238
Shut your face!

463
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:19,864
You said you'd just scare her.

464
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:21,489
She's my grandma's age.

465
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,739
She's poaching customers on
our turf. Do we say nothing?!

466
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,906
Piss off! Time to retire!

467
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,114
Fuck off back to the farm,
mind your cows!

468
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:30,781
We don't need you, here.

469
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,089
If I see you on our turf,

470
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,922
I'll rip your head off!
I'll end you!

471
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,197
Stop !

472
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,657
Don't blow a gasket!

473
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,240
What'll I tell Vito?

474
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,907
"Those little shits
swiped half my wad"?

475
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,434
A 5-gram bar...

476
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,691
A bit of tire...

477
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,667
Not enough tire.

478
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,967
What happened?

479
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,195
Why are you wearing
Dad's sunglasses?

480
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,393
I have to work overtime, again.

481
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,926
I won't keep the kid.

482
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:47,785
I got no one!

483
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:51,210
Should've thought about it before
you got knocked up by a spade!

484
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,702
And don't bug me!

485
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Where's the TV?

486
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,510
If they ask, 
you know nothing!

487
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,820
"How To Beat The Heatwave..."

488
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,744
What a stink!

489
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,353
This shit'll never work.

490
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,312
What do you want?

491
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:30,500
Please open up, Grandma.

492
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:31,778
No!

493
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,700
What smells?

494
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:35,827
I baked a cake for my friends.

495
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,370
Can I have some?

496
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,454
No!

497
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,872
Leo?

498
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,515
Is this Mom?

499
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:27,991
You're smiling.
Looks like you're having fun.

500
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,206
Leave that, you little shit!

501
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,700
What did I do?

502
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,241
You shit disturber!

503
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:34,831
I didn't do anything!

504
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,941
Open up or you'll get it!

505
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,032
What are you doing?

506
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,882
Leo, let me in.

507
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:59,258
Please, sweetie... dear...

508
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:01,325
You're mean!

509
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:06,074
I was mean, yes.
But I won't do it again.

510
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,792
Come on...

511
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:15,718
My little Leo, let me in, please.

512
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,243
I shouldn't have got upset.
I was wrong.

513
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:21,408
I'm sorry.

514
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:36,759
- Did you touch this?
- Touch what?

515
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,700
Don't tell your mother.

516
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,496
What's so important in that box?

517
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:54,127
If you like, Granny'll give you
a big slice of chocolate cake,

518
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:57,370
because you've been good.

519
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:00,310
I don't want any cake.
And I'm gonna tell Mom.

520
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:05,252
Sweetie, I'd like us
to get to know one another,

521
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:07,086
see more of each other.

522
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,586
Sometimes I may tease you,

523
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:10,178
'cause you're black.

524
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:13,361
I'd rather you were white.

525
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:15,220
That's just how it is.

526
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,086
But deep down, I like you a lot.

527
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:20,587
Rotten liar! I'll tell Mom!

528
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:23,712
Just you wait and see!

529
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:35,797
Granny!

530
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,838
Quick... Water...

531
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,839
Why are you mean to everyone?

532
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,123
Why don't you like anyone?

533
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,382
You saved my life,
my little Pickaninny.

534
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,465
Of course, you're my Nana.

535
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,713
Sorry I'm late. Couldn't help it

536
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:44,584
My battery died...

537
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,008
No big deal.

538
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,825
Was Nana mean to you?

539
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,090
Did she hit you?

540
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:52,966
No. Come on.

541
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,900
You're wearing a ton
of make-up, Paulette.

542
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:58,216
Expecting someone?

543
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,752
What's wrong?

544
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,150
It's got an odd taste.

545
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,592
Salt, pepper...

546
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,550
Mm-sugar...

547
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,544
And something, I don't know...

548
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:13,759
What?

549
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:16,476
I'd guess, cinnamon.

550
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,518
You put cinnamon in it.

551
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:24,142
With less sugar, salt and pepper,
it'd taste different.

552
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:26,710
Sill, it's not bad !

553
00:41:27,178 --> 00:41:28,935
I'll have another piece.

554
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,860
Choikan Restaurant?

555
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:34,385
You hungry?

556
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:35,778
We'd like 4 pizzas.

557
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:37,785
The Japanese don't make pizza.

558
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,735
No they do, but with raw fish!
Or noodles!

559
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:42,928
What's so funny?

560
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:46,802
Tell us what you put in the cake.

561
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:48,386
What is it?

562
00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:50,053
It's him.

563
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,594
Mr Walter?

564
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,928
Speaking.

565
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,594
My heart's on fire.
I want you so much!

566
00:41:58,804 --> 00:41:59,554
Stop it.

567
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,845
Who is this?

568
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,919
Come... I'm waiting!

569
00:42:06,095 --> 00:42:07,954
Stop messing around !

570
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,337
- Stop it!
- Wait, wait.

571
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,879
Miss Paulette!

572
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,296
It's me, Walter!

573
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,188
You've gone too far !

574
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,831
Francis, thanks to the little pickaninny,

575
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:42,430
I think I found a way out.
573.1
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:31,000
Pau...

576
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,383
Agnes tried to reach you.
She was worried.

577
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,391
You look odd.

578
00:43:40,642 --> 00:43:41,892
Are you OK?

579
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,298
'Course. I just woke up, is all.

580
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,500
It's 2 in the afternoon.

581
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:50,175
Really? Thank you, Ousmana.

582
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:52,159
You know her?

583
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,999
Yeah, I know her!
She said you had a tiny dick.

584
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:58,425
- What?
- Nothing in your pants, buddy.

585
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,392
Where are you going?

586
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,997
Didn't you get what I said?

587
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:05,393
- I'm selling cakes.
- Are they any good?

588
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,850
- Paws off!
- Are you crazy? Don't touch me!

589
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:10,434
- Stop it, Zak.
- What? Piss off !

590
00:44:10,435 --> 00:44:13,476
You disrespect us and take our
business. Who do you think you are?

591
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:16,299
So you're in the cake business, now?

592
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,346
"Mademoiselle" Zak, the baker!

593
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:22,101
- Pick on someone your own size!
- Is she your grandmother?

594
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,576
Don't mention my grandmother!

595
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,819
Why, what's wrong with your
grandmother, camel face!

596
00:44:27,603 --> 00:44:30,519
Very funny, you clowns!

597
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:32,976
Tasty Afghan shortbread!

598
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:34,852
Giggle cakes!

599
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:37,186
Afghan shortbread! Giggle cakes!

600
00:44:39,187 --> 00:44:40,436
Afghan shortbread!

601
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:41,894
Got any shit?

602
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:43,932
No, I bake cakes now.

603
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:45,931
Cakes aren't my thing.

604
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:47,203
Afghan shortbread!

605
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,638
For you, I'll try one.

606
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,853
How much for a shortbread?

607
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:52,827
20 euros.

608
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:54,470
It's expensive!

609
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:57,195
Well, it's extra labor...
Plus, it's organic.

610
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:01,620
Giggle cakes.

611
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:02,620
How much?

612
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:04,128
- 20 euros.
- 20 euros?!

613
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:06,187
- Can we sample them?
- It's shortbread.

614
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,321
Not at all, no samples.

615
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,221
It's 5,000.

616
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,774
How do you do it?
Third time this week!

617
00:45:21,775 --> 00:45:24,189
Mr Vito, I have business training.

618
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,638
A propos of which,

619
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:27,934
it seems a dealer's percentage

620
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,922
is 30-70 rather than 10-90.

621
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,480
- Who said that?
- It's not important.

622
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:38,114
But next time, I want 30
or I'll go elsewhere.

623
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,064
Mr Vito,

624
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,390
you wouldn't take advantage
of a penniless little old lady?

625
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,873
- 25.
- 30!

626
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,982
- Can I help you?
- I want a TV.

627
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:17,457
Of course. Do you want...

628
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,849
...a 50 or 80 cm. screen?

629
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:23,567
That one.

630
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:28,750
That's the Ferrari of TVs.

631
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:33,057
156 cm., Full HD,
Double speed progressive scan

632
00:46:33,443 --> 00:46:36,775
3D, of course,
but it's not for you.

633
00:46:36,776 --> 00:46:38,242
What's 3D?

634
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:43,242
I want this one.

635
00:46:45,276 --> 00:46:46,726
Seen the price?

636
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,700
Will you pay in 20 installments?

637
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,700
40 installments?

638
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:54,593
Cash, you twat!

639
00:46:57,635 --> 00:46:58,693
'Evening, Paulette.

640
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,551
He asked where you lived.

641
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,694
It's my girlfriend's birthday.
She loves your shortbreads.

642
00:47:03,694 --> 00:47:06,810
I want her to have a blast
with some really good stuff.

643
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,835
For how many?

644
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,935
6 to 8.

645
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,769
Come back tonight.

646
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:21,660
- Granny Giggles...
- ...and her killer cakes!

647
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,935
Come in.

648
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,903
What do you want?

649
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:32,527
A dozen Afghan cookies.

650
00:47:32,528 --> 00:47:35,453
And Madeleines that get you stoned.

651
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,045
Rachid, why'd you do that?

652
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:43,046
They'll only deal with you.

653
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,400
The others are real jealous.

654
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:47,487
Pierrot's stirring up shit
against you.

655
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,353
Be careful, Madame.

656
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,979
I'll tell you something.

657
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,396
See these jerks...

658
00:47:59,397 --> 00:48:01,746
they both thought
you wanted to screw me.

659
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:03,737
I swear, she's crooked...

660
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,794
Shut up, Pierrot!
You never bring in this much.

661
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:08,604
- And you...
- My jacket!

662
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:12,538
Keep cheating at "Infamous 2"
and I'll break your fingers.

663
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,172
Want a drink?

664
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,399
No, Mr Vito, I'm not thirsty.

665
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,355
4 kilos this time. OK?

666
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,863
What? A problem?
Anyone bothering you?

667
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:28,364
Tell me, I'll clean house right away!

668
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:29,639
Don't be a jerk, Vito.

669
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,397
Vito, calm down.

670
00:48:32,397 --> 00:48:34,764
- It's not that, Mr Vito.
- What's the problem, then?

671
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:37,594
I'm tired.

672
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,539
You should've said.

673
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,264
Momo, take the shit to her place.

674
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,651
Take load off, guys.

675
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:32,534
What's this, bro?

676
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:34,400
What does the old bag want?

677
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,567
Listen to her, 2 minutes.
She's proposing a deal.

678
00:49:37,568 --> 00:49:39,442
What proposal?

679
00:49:39,452 --> 00:49:41,484
You'll see. Sit down.

680
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,318
Not for me.

681
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,399
Help yourselves, kids. Oven fresh!

682
00:50:10,078 --> 00:50:13,411
I think there's room for everyone.

683
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:16,369
I'll handle pastrymaking, only.

684
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,753
And I'll give you 10% for
every customer you bring me.

685
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,819
That way everybody's happy, no?

686
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,928
This IS good!

687
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:26,829
Shut up!

688
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,369
Listen to him talk!

689
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:31,870
The cake's good ! Admit it!

690
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,700
Just 'cause WE don't bake...

691
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:37,830
doesn't mean it won't bring
new customers. It's great.

692
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:39,700
We'd be screwing ourselves.

693
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,204
Guys who get high on "Space Cake"..

694
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,530
...smoke less spliffs.

695
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:46,080
But a full stomach,
also makes you wanna smoke.

696
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:49,471
And when you smoke,
you want to eat.

697
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,321
15%.

698
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,405
Alright.

699
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,772
This busts my balls!
Not even room to pass by!

700
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,949
Cool ! Still getting
stoned at your age!

701
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,674
Know what my buddy says?

702
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,999
"No age limit for toking up."

703
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:00,424
I didn't understand a word.

704
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,583
What's "toking up"?

705
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:04,758
I'll tell you later. Later.

706
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,916
Madame Paulette!
704.1
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:13,516
Yes!

707
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:16,660
Do you know Granny Giggles well?

708
00:52:16,668 --> 00:52:18,250
"Granny Giggles"?

709
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,417
We know her whole family,
even her grandson, Leo.

710
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:22,934
Her daughter, Agnes.

711
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,842
And her son-in-law, who's in the police.

712
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,543
There you are.

713
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:35,167
Thank you. Goodbye.

714
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:40,960
Voila.

715
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,100
What are you doing here?

716
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,460
We are "miffed"!

717
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,126
Like, "totally"!

718
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,200
Madame doesn't come
to play cards anymore.

719
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,794
And when she does,
Madame falls asleep.

720
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,086
What's your little secret?

721
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:57,544
I sell cakes.

722
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:04,411
Imagine "The Bold and the Beautiful"
on a TV like this!

723
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:11,086
So, with your little cakes
you bought that! Hm?

724
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:13,544
Do you take us for idiots?

725
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:15,795
No, I don't take you for idiots.

726
00:53:15,803 --> 00:53:17,653
I thought we were friends,
724.1
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,978
but if you're afraid
we'll steal your thunder,

727
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:21,600
keep your little secrets.

728
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:24,228
We'll find a fourth
for our card game.

729
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:25,646
Come, Renée.

730
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,179
Don't go. You're my only friends!

731
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,995
Very well. Spit it out!

732
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:36,771
Remember the chocolate cake?

733
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,354
Yes.

734
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,246
The "ingredient", was "shit".

735
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,990
Yes, hashish!

736
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,194
You know, ganja, cannabis!

737
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,346
Drugs!

738
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,207
Ah! That was the funny taste!

739
00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:56,879
I know it's wrong, but I was
fed up living like a bag lady.

740
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,847
That's great, Paulette!
You're so right!

741
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,389
Sheer genius!

742
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,670
Work more, earn more!

743
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:08,380
'Course, I never touch hard drugs!

744
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:09,740
Of course not!

745
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,465
Gran, how's it coming along?

746
00:54:11,466 --> 00:54:12,840
They seem impatient.

747
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:14,646
I can't manage alone anymore.

748
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:17,531
Wanna help me? We'll share.

749
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:23,766
Do we ever?!

750
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:27,473
Yes, coming!

751
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:33,007
Afghan Shortbread.

752
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,132
Paris Marrakesh.

753
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,674
Ganja Sponge Fingers.

754
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:42,882
Granny Giggles' Meringue.

755
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:52,592
It's too quiet.

756
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:55,125
Even the winos stopped drinking.

757
00:54:56,306 --> 00:55:00,333
Scuse me, dude. Where's Chez Paulette?
[QUEBECOIS]

758
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:01,983
No speak English...

759
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,008
What'd she say?

760
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:09,678
Yes, coming... come in.

761
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,195
Hi, Paulette.

762
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,996
We were in the neighborhood.
We came to say hello.

763
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,237
- Are you busy?
- No.

764
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:20,221
Bye, Paulette. Bye, guys.

765
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,262
By the way, Paulette...

766
00:56:22,263 --> 00:56:24,200
Yes, goodbye.

767
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,000
Your little business
is doing quite well !

768
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,787
Everyone's talking about it.

769
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,455
Not too legit... all this.

770
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,363
Private premises, no license...

771
00:56:35,364 --> 00:56:39,298
You're not gonna nitpick with
little old grannies who bake!

772
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,900
What's in it?

773
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:44,055
It's a secret, isn't it?

774
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,440
Sure.

775
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:48,995
Hey, thanks "bye", Paulette.
That was good "Tabarnac"!
[QUEBECOIS]

776
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,222
- Piping hot!
- What're you up to, Renée?

777
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:57,139
What do you take me for,
a dumb blonde? Madeleine..?

778
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,500
- No, wait.
- A meringue...

779
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,389
- They're not done.
- Waddaya mean, not done?!

780
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,098
You can see they're not.

781
00:57:04,515 --> 00:57:06,764
So, how are things at home?

782
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,998
Agnes sees only the black side.

783
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,139
Yeah, well...

784
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,699
Things are tense between us.

785
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,815
And Leo's bearing the cost.

786
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,932
No one's getting that?

787
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,057
Yes, coming, coming!

788
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,224
Hello.

789
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,532
Granny, got any of those
mind-blowing cakes?

790
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:31,057
Meet "Osama" and his colleague.
Policemen.

791
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:33,718
They're investigating hashish
trafficking in the hood.

792
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:35,241
It's OK, Paulette.

793
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,635
Don't let us put you out.
Pretend we're not here.

794
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:39,391
How's the investigation going?

795
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:43,891
Seems like the dealers are
on vacation. Right, Ousmane?

796
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,184
What the hell are they doing here?

797
00:57:57,235 --> 00:58:00,934
Idriss and Momo, such nice kids.
They run errands.

798
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,342
I'll fuckin' smoke 'em!

799
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:05,659
Cool it, we're at
my mother-in-law's.

800
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,902
Hands up!

801
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:14,484
Mademoiselle Paulette's not in?

802
00:58:15,686 --> 00:58:17,309
Are you mental ?

803
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:20,927
Excuse us, Monsieur.

804
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,935
I just wanted to invite her
to dinner.

805
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:26,943
Mr Walter, Paulette will be
delighted to dine with you.

806
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,303
Isn't that so?

807
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:31,060
- When?
- In 1 hour.

808
00:58:31,229 --> 00:58:34,768
Sorry, gentlemen,
Paulette has to get ready.

809
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:37,435
Yes, of course. We won't keep you.

810
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,536
This place?

811
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:46,728
Yes. You know it?

812
00:58:48,604 --> 00:58:49,936
Come on, Paulette.

813
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:53,686
Good evening.

814
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,770
Mr Walter, we reserved you
our best table.

815
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:00,687
Thank you. Meet my friend Paulette.

816
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:05,737
If you'd come this way.

817
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,895
Been here before?

818
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:20,455
Yes, Madame Paulette comes often.

819
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:23,313
To unwind and let go of
what "bugs" her!

820
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:28,896
Paulette, to think we've been
neighbors for so long!

821
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,021
Tell me again what you saw!

822
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,189
Fuck, I told you 20 times!

823
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,272
We went to restock Paulette.

824
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:41,564
2 cops were there, having tea.

825
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:42,731
And then?

826
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:47,748
I'm sure she wants her neighbour
to put his icing on her cake!

827
00:59:51,316 --> 00:59:53,189
Thanks for a splendid dinner.

828
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,564
Paulette, I want you!

829
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:59,398
I can't stand it anymore!
You drive me crazy!

830
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:01,900
Not tonight.
- Why not?

831
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:04,232
Not the first night.

832
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,148
Why not?
831.1
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:07,648
Huh? Paulette!

833
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:09,898
Another time... maybe.
832.1
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,648
Paulette!

834
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,999
<i>Screw her and be done with it!

835
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,375
Are you angry, Francis?

836
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,934
I swear, you've no reason to be.

837
01:00:46,861 --> 01:00:48,817
- Father Baptiste...
- No, I don't wanna know.

838
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:51,234
We can fix the church roof.

839
01:00:51,444 --> 01:00:53,900
God is grateful, but that's enough!

840
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,985
Father Baptiste...

841
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,900
I feel like I'm changing.

842
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:01,160
At my age, it scares me.

843
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,299
Me, who didn't like anyone --
I detested the Yellows, the Blacks--

844
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,918
I ate Chinese and it was good.

845
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:09,710
I fraternized with that
little Camel Jockey.

846
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:11,990
I've reconciled with my Jungle-bunny

847
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:13,393
and even my neighbor.

848
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,718
The ways of the Lord
are always impenetrable.

849
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:17,693
You think so?

850
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:19,777
I'm sure of it.

851
01:01:19,903 --> 01:01:22,086
What will my Francis think?

852
01:01:22,153 --> 01:01:25,861
I think he'll be very pleased
to see you happy.

853
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,694
Hallelujah!

854
01:01:31,803 --> 01:01:33,412
What about me?

855
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,203
- How was the boat ride?
- Really great.

856
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:45,020
What's wrong?

857
01:01:45,738 --> 01:01:47,162
You're interested, now?

858
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:51,737
I lost my job.
It was bound to happen.

859
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:54,404
I'd like nice clothes, too.

860
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,620
Or weekends at the seaside.

861
01:01:56,905 --> 01:01:59,754
But my life is ugly and shitty.

862
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,054
Always fighting with Ousmane.

863
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,671
Here.

864
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,479
This might help.

865
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,371
Where'd you get this?

866
01:02:09,197 --> 01:02:11,200
We bake cakes. Me Maria and Lucienne.

867
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:12,280
It's going well.

868
01:02:12,281 --> 01:02:14,030
I don't want your cash!

869
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,730
Where were you when I gave birth?
868.1
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,107
Why'd you never come to his birthday?

870
01:02:18,108 --> 01:02:20,022
Did you buy him ONE single gift!

871
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:21,697
NOW you remember your grandson!

872
01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:23,030
Keep your damn cash!

873
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:23,864
Agnes...

874
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,739
Leave me alone, mom!

875
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:41,998
I wanna play!

876
01:02:42,198 --> 01:02:43,740
Screw this "Sharon and Desi" shit!

877
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:47,456
Shut up, you!
That's a real woman!

878
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:51,482
- Vito.
- Now what?

879
01:02:51,491 --> 01:02:53,406
Taras wants to see Paulette.

880
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,540
You shittin' me?

881
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,965
I thought Ashley's breasts
would be bigger.

882
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,574
Flat as a board!

883
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:06,907
Yes? You're here?

884
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,999
Madame Paulette, would you follow me.

885
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,949
Monsieur Taras is waiting.

886
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:15,200
I'll be right there.
885.1
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,600
Paulette.

887
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,542
- Hey, Paulette.
- Hi, Rachid.

888
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,693
Hey, Paulette.

889
01:03:29,326 --> 01:03:30,200
Hello.

890
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:31,743
Brown-noser!

891
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,251
Watch your paws!

892
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:36,259
Pow, pow! Paulette!

893
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:38,634
She's clean, boss.

894
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,543
Give him a right hook!

895
01:03:46,185 --> 01:03:49,360
Delighted to meet you.

896
01:03:51,752 --> 01:03:53,760
Who are these floozies...

897
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:55,952
whores, or friends of yours?
896.1
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,552
Give her the champagne.[RUS]
896.2
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,885
Na zdorovia.

898
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,619
Your health, Mr Taras.

899
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,486
Babushka (grandma), sales
have tripled, in a month.
898.1
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:23,953
What's your secret?

900
01:04:23,954 --> 01:04:26,353
Mr Taras, if I tell you,
it won't be a secret.
899.1
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:27,553
Enough! [RUS]

901
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:30,420
As my husband, Francis, used to say:

902
01:04:30,497 --> 01:04:31,829
"The trick is

903
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:35,328
to vary the menu
to increase the clientele."

904
01:04:36,479 --> 01:04:37,999
Hear that, Vito?

905
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,929
Yeah, "vary the menu,
to increase the clientele."

906
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,421
Why didn't YOU think of that?

907
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,999
Honestly, I dunno.

908
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:48,746
Babushka, you take his place.

909
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:51,304
- We'll take drugs beyond the ghetto.
- Wait.

910
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:55,997
You and me, we're going
to expand the business.

911
01:04:56,623 --> 01:04:57,955
And me, Mr Taras?

912
01:04:58,248 --> 01:04:59,330
You?

913
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,988
Fucking Taras! Dumps me in
this shithole!

914
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:19,664
Fuck, shit!

915
01:05:19,732 --> 01:05:22,064
♪ She said go whistle

916
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:23,998
♪ there upon the hill

917

a bouquet of eglantines

918

♪ Zai zai zai zai...

921

Kids love cakes. Imagine, Babushka...

922
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:45,056
...if we sell in kindergartens.

923
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,575
Kindergartens?

924
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,715
They'll soon be junkies.

925
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,890
Then, crack, heroin, cocaine! 

926
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:52,790
A higher income level!

927
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:55,275
Imagine the dough we'll make, Babushka!

928
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:56,824
But, Mr Taras...

929
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:59,449
What?... Chocolate buns!

930
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:02,275
Kids love chocolate!
Start on it tomorrow.

♪ Zai zai zai zai...

Nana, what are you doing here?

01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,168
Who gave you this chocolate bun?

933
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:33,543
Mom did.

934
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,476
Know what? My friend's going
to the seaside with his granny.

935
01:06:39,503 --> 01:06:41,835
Would you like to see the sea,
pickaninny?

936
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:43,492
You bet I would!

937
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,693
Una cosa (one thing [SPAN])
936.1
01:06:57,693 --> 01:07:01,893
Did the guy at Hertz
tell you how many gears?

938
01:07:02,254 --> 01:07:03,811
6, he said.

939
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:05,244
6?

940
01:07:06,904 --> 01:07:09,520
I can't find at least 2 of'em.

941
01:07:09,779 --> 01:07:11,744
Are you happy?

942
01:07:14,304 --> 01:07:15,837
What do I do?

943
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:18,999
Try the red handle under the seat.

944
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:37,045
The salon.

945
01:07:41,047 --> 01:07:42,671
The first bedroom.

946
01:07:46,756 --> 01:07:48,755
And here's the second bedroom.

947
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:04,306
Mesdames, we wish you an
excellent stay in our hotel.

948
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,281
This is where we spent every summer.

949
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,172
But...

950
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:18,722
where's the house?

951
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,973
We're too late, Alzheimer.

952
01:08:22,923 --> 01:08:24,257
Granny!

953
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:29,090
Not too fast!

954
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,800
Is this where you came with Mom?

955
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,082
- Yes
- It's beautiful.

956
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,724
I'd forgotten how beautiful it was!

957
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:20,900
No, Mom...

958
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,399
If she was mean, I'd tell you.
No need to ask.

959
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,760
Sure you won't be scared alone?

960
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:30,993
No, my pickaninny's not scared.

961
01:09:31,052 --> 01:09:33,785
Why'd you act mean for so long?

962
01:09:33,886 --> 01:09:35,922
You're not as mean as that!

963
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:37,760
Be careful, though!

964
01:09:38,701 --> 01:09:42,319
Y'know, if we're here, at all,
it's thanks to you.
963.1
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,319
Paulette...

965
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,327
I'll tell you when you're grown up.

966
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:57,128
Mr Taras, I thought it over.

967
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,327
I wouldn't touch your
"cakes for kids caper".

968
01:10:00,345 --> 01:10:03,895
Why? Because I think it's wrong.

969
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:08,695
Know what, Rusky? Get bent!

970
01:10:20,622 --> 01:10:24,429
How about a drive along
the coast? Just us two.

971
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:26,129
Piss off!

972
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,213
7, rouge, impair. (red odds)

973
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,929
You're very lucky!

974
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,939
- What's your name?
- Alzheimer!

975
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,258
You OK, my little Leo?

976
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,275
Time to go back home, now.

977
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,369
What happened?

978
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,952
Francis...

979
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,250
Is there a problem, Mr Vito?

980
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,740
You could say a "slight" problem.

981
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:05,646
Taras hates it when people
hang up on him.

982
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,604
What are you gonna do?

983
01:13:08,605 --> 01:13:11,354
We'll burn your feet
with a blowtorch.

984
01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:14,600
Then, we'll cut you up into
little bits. Right, Vito?

985
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,937
- We have your snotty kid.
- My pickaninny!

986
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:19,562
Listen, Paulette,
do everything Mr Taras wants.

987
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,400
Or I'll grind the kid
into Merguez (sausage)!

988
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,663
Don't hurt him, I beg you,
Mr Vito.

989
01:13:24,664 --> 01:13:26,472
He has nothing to do with it.

990
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,265
Her birthday?

991
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:35,355
No, she took Leo to the seaside.
991.1
01:13:38,274 --> 01:13:39,355
<i>Paulette.

992
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,881
Watch it, it's the police. Open up!

993
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,814
If you don't open, I'll call in
SWAT and they'll smash your door!

994
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,957
One...

995
01:13:55,987 --> 01:13:57,420
<i>Paulette?

996
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:02,843
Paulette?

997
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,999
Don't forget your grandson.
Keep your mouth shut!.. Let's go!

998
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:17,940
Pardon me.

999
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,275
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1000
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:35,820
- Nothing? You've been robbed!
- No.

1001
01:14:35,821 --> 01:14:37,858
I'll get a patrol here, now.

1002
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:40,151
No, Ousmane, there's no need.

1003
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,657
A gust of wind slammed some doors 
1003.1
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:43,417
and knocked over a few trinkets.

1004
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,527
A gust?... More like Katrina!

1005
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:46,900
It's fine, really.

1006
01:14:46,902 --> 01:14:50,230
- You sure, Paulette?
- Absolutely, thanks for dropping by.

1007
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,517
I just have to tidy up now. Tidy up.

1008
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,042
<i>I think they're bluffing.

1009
01:14:58,111 --> 01:14:59,476
<i>Leo can handle himself.

1010
01:14:59,486 --> 01:15:01,560
<i>They mean business.

1011
01:15:08,986 --> 01:15:10,643
<i>Mom, open up!

1012
01:15:11,903 --> 01:15:13,368
Is he here?

1013
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:14,793
- Who?
- He's not?

1014
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:17,060
- Who?
- Leo, dammit!

1015
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:21,269
He disappeared after school.
I thought he was here.

1016
01:15:22,578 --> 01:15:24,336
Vito kidnapped him.

1017
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,986
Who's Vito?

1018
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:30,794
Our drug supplier.

1019
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,870
We started dealing hashish.

1020
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,606
That imbecil, Vito, thought
we were double crossing him.

1021
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:41,937
So, he kidnapped the kid
to blackmail Paulette.

1022
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,778
What?

1023
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,870
I'll call Ousmane.

1024
01:15:47,904 --> 01:15:49,362
No, don't do that.

1025
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,270
They might hurt the kid.

1026
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:56,362
Who is it?

1027
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,522
Tell me where the kid is.

1028
01:16:28,523 --> 01:16:30,997
Or we'll eat your balls!

1029
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,323
Momo, what the fuck's up?

1030
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,332
What's going on?
What's this shit?

1031
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:54,972
Fuck you doin'?

1032
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,500
Don't play with fire, Paulette.

1033
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:02,200
Don't fuck around, Vito,
they're mean.

1034
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,899
- Not so smart now!
- Drop it. We'll talk.

1035
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,574
- Free the kid first.
- The hell you say!

1036
01:17:07,575 --> 01:17:09,866
- "Not negotiable!"
- What?

1037
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,399
Les Experts: Manhattan (CSI: NY)

1038
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,092
Now what?

1039
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,992
Untie him!
I don't give a fuck if I die!

1040
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,860
- Untie the kid.
- Seriously?

1041
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:37,376
Do as I say, dammit!

1042
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,176
Granny!

1043
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,892
Run fast, pickaninny.

1044
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,400
Where the fuck's Momo?

1045
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:00,526
Dunno where the fuck he is.

1046
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,827
Yeah.

1047
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,951
OK, Taras.

1048
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,099
<i>Babushka, why won't you
be reasonable.

1049
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,700
Mr Taras, never...

1050
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:16,562
Never will I lace cakes with
"shit" for kids my grandson's age.

1051
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:17,702
Vito.

1052
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:18,952
Yeah.

1053
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:22,786
Got it, Taras.

1054
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,120
Idriss, the blowtorch.

1055
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:28,378
Oh, fuck, what a mess!

1056
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,787
What did you tell the fuzz?

1057
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:38,204
Mr Vito, I'd never rat to the police.

1058
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:40,370
Anyway, it's not my fault...

1059
01:18:40,372 --> 01:18:42,570
...if my son-in-law's a cop.

1060
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,153
Are you taking the piss?

1061
01:18:44,204 --> 01:18:45,496
Stop!

1062
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,271
At the moment, my daughter

1063
01:19:06,278 --> 01:19:08,664
is having domestic trouble.

1064
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:11,914
So he came over to discuss it.

1065
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,539
Ever had couples' problems,
Mr Vito?

1066
01:19:15,565 --> 01:19:16,590
Shut up!

1067
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,547
Drop your weapon!

1068
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:26,991
Don't move!

1069
01:19:28,273 --> 01:19:30,281
Go on, move!

1070
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,131
<i>I'll deal with this myself.

1071
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,606
Your act, back at the apartment,
made me suspicious.

1072
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:48,491
Do you know about the cakes?

1073
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,807
What cakes?

1074
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:58,432
Vito says you're the dealers.

1075
01:19:58,433 --> 01:19:59,975
He has proof.

1076
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:02,874
Is that true?

1077
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,995
I know, Francis, I shouldn't have.

1078
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:18,667
You've been gone 10 years.

1079
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:23,642
How can I get by on
600 euros a month? How?

1080
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,194
I'll miss my pickaninny.

1081
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:35,926
I've become attached to him.

1082
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:41,376
Free Paulette!

1083
01:20:41,486 --> 01:20:44,794
Free Paulette! Free Paulette!

GIVE US BACK
PAULETTE

1085
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:57,999
In view of their age, Paulette
Courtine and her 3 accomplices

1086
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:01,800
were given suspended sentences.

1087
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:03,894
As you see, the court's decision

1088
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,144
was welcomed by the
defendants' supporters

1089
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:09,328
and has calmed tensions...

1090
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,000
What'll we do
without the cannabis?

1091
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,086
No more vacations,
shopping, and restaurants.

1092
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:18,911
We sure had fun, though.

1093
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,246
Don't worry. I have a plan.

1094
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,037
I don't understand
a word they're saying.
