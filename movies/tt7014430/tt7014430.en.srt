2
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,870
No way,
I'll get in so much trouble.

3
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,674
Yeah, maybe we can just
figure something out tomorrow?

4
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,409
Oh, come on,
why do you have to be so lame?

5
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,844
- Let's just go now.
- It's seriously almost 1:00 a.m.

6
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:30,279
and I'm already gonna get
in so much trouble.

7
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,249
So, what's the difference, then?

8
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:35,184
Yeah, okay, yeah,
we really need to go.

9
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,354
It's late, and...

10
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:37,922
Whatever, dude,
don't worry about it.

11
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,757
So lame.

12
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,959
Hey, yeah, you know what?
Maybe we are lame!

13
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,095
Hey, don't argue with them
let's just leave.

14
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:48,998
I wasn't gonna go anyways.

15
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,434
You know they're
only after one thing.

16
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,204
Yeah, guys are pigs.

17
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,113
First off, Mikhail,

18
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,115
I told you, not here.

19
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,050
Not in my office!

20
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,252
I thought we understood
each other.

21
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,055
I hear you no like my business.

22
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,025
But I'm paying,
I don't understand.

23
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,359
Five women.

24
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:00,463
Excuse me, three young teenagers

25
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,465
and two 20-year-old women

26
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:07,203
were abducted from my city
by your thugs!

27
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:12,108
- I have high demands. I needed...
- You don't need shit!

28
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,844
You don't understand!

29
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,646
I have to answer for this!

30
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,781
The Chief and I,
we're taking too much heat

31
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,483
because you didn't keep
your promise!

32
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,387
Maybe business will slow down.

33
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,822
Maybe I won't need so many
for a while.

34
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,258
Yeah, sure.

35
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,462
Listen,

36
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:37,067
I will do what I do, no matter
if you take the money or no.

37
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,305
What would you do,
go to the police?

38
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:43,340
You don't get it, do you?

39
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,378
You're leaving me no choice!

40
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:51,648
Think.

41
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,651
What's good for me
is good for you.

42
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,921
Maybe I slow down.

43
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,424
Maybe I go to the suburbs
a little.

44
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,260
Oh, yeah, sure.

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,130
This is no need to stop
our business.

46
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,635
I know you like my candy
too well.

47
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,038
Best we think on this, hmm?

48
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:25,882
Jesus Christ!

49
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,762
Hey, sweetie.

50
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,398
We still on for dinner?

51
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,671
- This year is it.
- You're crazy!

52
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,072
I think they have two or three

53
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,641
good years left
before they're done.

54
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:51,774
- No, no way.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,878
Excuse me, they found
another body in a dumpster.

56
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:00,450
Damn.

57
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,018
Gettin' bad out there.

58
00:06:02,118 --> 00:06:04,053
The coroner's bringing her in.

59
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,122
How old?

60
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,755
Do they even know?

61
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,960
No, but she's, uh, young,
under 30.

62
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:11,728
Shit.

63
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,432
Alderman needs to take
a strong public stand on this.

64
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

65
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,368
All right, let's get to work.

66
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,043
Hey!

67
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:29,346
Before you leave...

68
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,752
- we need to check your sleeves.
- No one cleans us out like that.

69
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,422
I won fair and square.

70
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,156
Is that so?

71
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,358
Let's see those sleeves.

72
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:46,495
Listen, brick head, you
and your dumbass friend lost.

73
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:50,100
Now, you could either lose again
right here and right now

74
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,635
or you could walk away.

75
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,472
You must think I'm
some kinda pussy, huh?

76
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,107
Last warning.

77
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,310
Fuck you!

78
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,512
Your mother ever tell you
not to point?

79
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,416
Now, you have a choice...

80
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,752
learn from your friend...

81
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:09,419
or make the same mistake.

82
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,825
- You tough, man?
- Bad move.

83
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,501
Next time you guys
have a poker game...

84
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,035
work on your hospitality.

85
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:32,876
Wow...

86
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:34,510
this is amazing!

87
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:36,146
Well, we see each other
so infrequently,

88
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,148
I thought this time
should be special.

89
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,851
And your mother would be
very happy to see you with this.

90
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,387
And, uh, you know,
since you're my only daughter,

91
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:48,125
- you're all I got left.
- You have the city, Dad.

92
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,959
And that's your true baby
and you know it!

93
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:52,029
I got a lot of responsibilities,

94
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,530
- it's different.
- I understand. I...

95
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,800
I can't even imagine
how much you have on your plate.

96
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,502
Yeah, there's a lot on my plate.

97
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,504
But how about you,
how you doing?

98
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:06,110
I don't know I'm more
of the same, or whatever.

99
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:08,312
Hey.

100
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:13,283
You'll find your calling
in due time.

101
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,119
- Well, let's hope so.
- I'll bet on it.

102
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:21,157
Uh, I gotta get up early
tomorrow. What about you?

103
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,091
Yeah.

104
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,728
Are we still on for breakfast
this Friday?

105
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,598
Yes, yeah, we are.

106
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,423
- So, do we have? Yeah.
- The money?

107
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:54,190
Yeah, of course.

108
00:08:57,893 --> 00:08:59,863
- Clean and unmarked.
- Great.

109
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:01,899
I appreciate it, thanks.

110
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:03,533
And listen...

111
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,834
I'm gonna shut down
the Russians.

112
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07,404
You should let me take care
of the...

113
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,370
No, listen,

114
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:12,309
I cannot afford to have
a gang war in my city.

115
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:13,709
You see?

116
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:17,447
And, uh, I can't take care
of you if there is one.

117
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,649
- It won't be a war.
- Please, trust me on this.

118
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,887
- Okay?
- If you say so.

119
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,824
Good. A few anonymous tips,
they'll be in prison,

120
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,562
maybe in less than six
months, for a long time.

121
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,064
I would rather he be dead.

122
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:36,499
No.

123
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,302
Trust me on this.

124
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,270
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,141
I trust you'll look out for me
as long as I'm paying you.

126
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:47,010
I trust that, all right?

127
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,619
Let me see this closely.

128
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,055
Drive careful.

129
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,084
Christy, take a look
at this one.

130
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:30,720
It's beautiful.

131
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:33,322
It is.

132
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,492
You have flawless taste, Miss.

133
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:37,660
- Thank you.
- Who made it?

134
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:42,565
A young artist, he has a lot
of depth and soul in his work.

135
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:43,967
J.B. Davies?

136
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,835
- Never heard of him.
- Hmm, he's up and coming.

137
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,838
- I'm sure.
- How much is it?

138
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:52,443
This particular piece
is only 2800 dollars.

139
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,610
I'll take it.

140
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:08,524
You like that?

141
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,863
Let's go.

142
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,002
- What?
- Let's go have some fun.

143
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,235
Go where?

144
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,455
Well, you know...

145
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:42,658
she's just the same
as the others.

146
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:46,763
She died of an
acute drug overdose.

147
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,432
Damn.

148
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,569
Three in a month
and we pretty much have nothing.

149
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,570
I know.

150
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,441
I've never seen
anything like it, ever.

151
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,380
- You finding anything?
- No, nothing yet.

152
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,552
Whoa!

153
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:12,555
Look here.

154
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,792
See that?

155
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,627
The organs look fried.

156
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,099
- This could be a homicide.
- I don't know.

157
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,436
But, she sure didn't do this
to herself.

158
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,540
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

159
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,739
But you know,

160
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,644
she's been on heroin
for at least a year

161
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,548
according to
the hair follicle test we did.

162
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,492
- What?
- Uh.

163
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,661
- Wait, I, um...
- What?

164
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:57,334
- Uh, I think I know her.
- What?

165
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:00,637
- Really?
- No, not exactly know, but I,

166
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:06,009
I think she jogs the same trail
as me, or she used to.

167
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,844
A heroin junkie that jogs?

168
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,849
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure it's her.

169
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:17,253
Well, I think I've seen
everything then.

170
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,628
Okay, so what does that have
to do with me?

171
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,264
I need your help, Wolf.

172
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,199
I can't have the cartel

173
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,069
and the Russians both picking
our girls up off our streets.

174
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,473
- <i>Uh, you shouldn't have either.</i>
- I understand, Mike.

175
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:38,907
But, uh,

176
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,743
you know, it's a big city.

177
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,146
<i>I can't control everything.</i>

178
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,315
- Is that so?
- But I've made a decision.

179
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,918
So what do you want from me?

180
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:50,585
<i>Like I said,</i>

181
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:55,892
Mikhail and his Ruskies,
they're out of control.

182
00:13:58,494 --> 00:13:59,428
I see.

183
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,633
Uh, keep me posted.

184
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,468
Wolf...

185
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,203
don't judge me.

186
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:10,339
You're no choir boy.

187
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,477
No, no, I am not.

188
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:24,253
The mayor's asked

189
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,390
that I not do business
with you anymore.

190
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:28,257
Fuck the mayor.

191
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:30,393
I wish it was that easy.

192
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:33,162
It is, unless you're afraid
of him.

193
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,831
No, Mikhail,
I'm not afraid of the mayor.

194
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,500
It's not about that.

195
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:41,103
It's just that he can make
our lives a lot easier if...

196
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,974
I can make his life easier
or harder, too.

197
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,676
- I'm sure you can, but...
- But? No but.

198
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,478
You want the business or not?

199
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,647
I don't have a problem with you,
Mikhail.

200
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,685
I thought we could talk
like men.

201
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,522
All he wants you to do
is respect the rules.

202
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,864
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules.

203
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,399
Well, why don't we do that, hmm?

204
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,702
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules,
fuck me, fuck you.

205
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:18,173
- He's just as dirty as you or I.
- Whatever, you're right.

206
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,575
It's your decision.

207
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,278
But I want you to know...

208
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,382
that I'm with you, Mikhail.

209
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,783
But I also want you to know

210
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,320
that I am not going down
with you.

211
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,421
Am I clear?

212
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:35,025
It's what I like about you,
Stone.

213
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,426
You are always very clear.

214
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,371
Still wanna go there?

215
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:50,674
Yeah, I'm a grown-ass woman.
I don't need to ask permission.

216
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,675
I know but, still.

217
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,878
Look, I get what you mean, but,

218
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,315
Foxtrot is the hot spot
right now.

219
00:15:58,748 --> 00:15:59,447
You know it is.

220
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,784
I know,
it's not the kind of place

221
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,887
the mayor's daughter
should be hanging out at.

222
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,087
Oh, come on.

223
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:06,522
We can always go
to Grasshoppers.

224
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:09,092
How about we go to Foxtrot?

225
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,728
And if it isn't on fire...

226
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:13,897
then we go to Grasshoppers.

227
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:17,533
You know it'll be on fire
and you're gonna get in trouble.

228
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,303
You only live once.

229
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:21,371
Yeah, you're right.

230
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:37,887
Darryl...

231
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:39,822
find her.

232
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:41,958
You sure about this?

233
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,761
Okay.

234
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:08,952
<i>Hey.</i>

235
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,620
I need you to trace someone
for me.

236
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:13,690
<i>Okay, name?</i>

237
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,757
Marie Alderman.

238
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,628
Oh, shit, that's funny!

239
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:24,034
- <i>Okay, a real name?</i>
- Marie Allison Alderman.

240
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,070
You're serious?

241
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:29,706
<i>I am.</i>

242
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,610
I'm gonna have
to sit this one out.

243
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:36,412
<i>Darryl, it's too risky.</i>

244
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,915
Maybe you wanna take that up
with Mikhail?

245
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,118
Shit.

246
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:44,252
All right, I'll trace her,

247
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,556
but you should really try
to talk some sense into him.

248
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:48,825
<i>Not my job.</i>

249
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,260
All right,
whatever you say, man.

250
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:53,662
Just get it done.

251
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,161
She's here.

252
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:27,096
- What?
- She's at the club.

253
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:41,443
Hey, can we get
two Johnny Vegas?

254
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,612
You got it.

255
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,248
Hey, we should go sit down.

256
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:46,682
- Okay.
- All right.

257
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,984
That'll be 30 dollars.

258
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,853
It's on me, Marco.

259
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,757
Thank you, but we can pay
for our own drinks.

260
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,460
- Trust me, it's no problem.
- Okay then, thank you.

261
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,029
Why don't you come with me?

262
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,135
<i>You're either in or you're out.</i>

263
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:08,470
It's not that easy!

264
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,774
Oh, it's not?
Let me make it easier for you.

265
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,677
Motherfucker!

266
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,083
Fuck!

267
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:28,225
Hey girl, what's up?

268
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,659
Are you out?

269
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,660
Yeah, at Foxtrot with Marie.
Why?

270
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,229
- <i>Mind if I join you?</i>
- No, not at all.

271
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,965
Okay, cool. See you in a few.

272
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:51,113
So...

273
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:54,950
what do you do?
If you don't mind me asking.

274
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:59,989
This, this is mine, the club.

275
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:01,790
And, uh...

276
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,628
I have some other investments.

277
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,099
UM, Sandra just called,
she's on her way.

278
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,536
Did you wanna go wait
for her by the bar?

279
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,771
You can always come back here.

280
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:17,140
Bring your friend.

281
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:20,243
Thank you.

282
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,874
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

283
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,642
<i>Remember the girl we had
in here?</i>

284
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,143
<i>The heroin girl, the runner?</i>

285
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:56,912
Uh, yeah.

286
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,583
<i>Well, I found something.</i>

287
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:01,717
<i>It wasn't murder.</i>

288
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,219
I mean...

289
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:07,989
I guess it was,
but it wasn't intentional.

290
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,759
- What?
- <i>When can you come in here?</i>

291
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,161
I wanna show you.

292
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,031
Uh, on my way.

293
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,312
I cannot believe
that we just hung out with him.

294
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:32,882
In his booth, too!

295
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,017
Oh, my God.

296
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,022
Let's hope no pictures surface
of this one

297
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:41,456
because I will never hear
the end of it.

298
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:43,558
We don't really know if all that

299
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,362
stuff they say
about him is true.

300
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:47,063
I guess.

301
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,706
I so needed to get out.

302
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,076
Just drinking.

303
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,615
- I'm sorry.
- That's a bummer.

304
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:09,185
It's fine, it's just...

305
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:12,689
No, it should have
ended a while ago.

306
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:14,222
Well,

307
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:17,127
let's get you a drink, then.

308
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:19,094
Let's do it!

309
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:27,804
- Hey.
- Hey, Alex.

310
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:30,906
I'm glad you could
come so quickly.

311
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,308
No problem.

312
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:34,911
- So what did we find?
- Well,

313
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:38,448
I received some more information
on girl number one.

314
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:41,016
- Angela, was it?
- Yes.

315
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:44,085
Well, it turns out she
wasn't always an addict.

316
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:45,454
Or I should say,

317
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:49,892
- she wasn't one for very long.
- So the overdose was a cover up?

318
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:51,694
Much worse.

319
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:52,996
Worse?

320
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:55,865
I mean,
the heroin that killed her

321
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,434
wasn't even injected.

322
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,835
I mean, it wasn't even supposed
to kill her.

323
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:03,538
- What do you mean?
- Take a look over here.

324
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,242
See this,
see the shadowing over here?

325
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:07,008
Mm-hmm.

326
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:11,081
Well, she had heroin
bags implanted inside her.

327
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,883
And the only thing I can think
of is one,

328
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,620
you know, one must have leaked
and that's,

329
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:20,222
I'd say, I can see it
on the kidneys here.

330
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,190
Take a look.

331
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,427
Oh.

332
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:29,231
So, I went back and I looked
at the other girls and,

333
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,267
although nothing is confirmed
yet...

334
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:35,338
they most likely died
in a similar fashion.

335
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:37,373
A slow leak...

336
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,276
you know,
just enough to kill them.

337
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:46,482
And these, these bastards...

338
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,286
they just harvested the bags
and discarded the bodies.

339
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,356
I, uh...

340
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:55,991
I'll be damned.

341
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:00,095
This changes everything.
They were drug mules.

342
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:01,331
Exactly.

343
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:09,671
We just can't seem to pin him
for anything.

344
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:13,977
It's fine that we're in the same
building as him right now?

345
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:15,143
Mm.

346
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,446
You're sure we're safe, right?

347
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:21,551
Yeah, I mean as long
as you stay away from his booth.

348
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,256
Besides, if he tries anything...

349
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:30,959
- I'll kick his ass.
- That is why we're best friends.

350
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:36,065
Sandy...

351
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:37,834
we need to talk.

352
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,470
There's nothing left
to talk about.

353
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:44,173
What the hell?
You act like this is all on me!

354
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:46,342
You said you needed a break.

355
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,478
So I gave you one, permanently.

356
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,046
That's because I'm always
playing second fiddle

357
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:53,482
- to your fucking job!
- Oh, really?

358
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,286
You knew what you were
in for dating me.

359
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:58,787
I mean, you knew exactly
what you were getting into.

360
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,389
You knew what I did
for a living.

361
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:01,591
Yeah...

362
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:04,394
and I didn't know how consumed
you would be by it.

363
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,162
I think you need to go.

364
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:09,931
- Oh, should I?
- Yeah.

365
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,101
Are you allergic to spending
time with your boyfriend?

366
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:13,335
Ex-boyfriend.

367
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:17,139
You know what?
Fuck you anyways!

368
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,007
Okay, buddy, take a walk.

369
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,409
This ain't none
of your fucking business!

370
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:21,377
I said walk.

371
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,912
Okay, asshole, let's go!

372
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:26,782
Who the hell was that guy?

373
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:30,519
I don't know but we seen
him with Mikhail earlier.

374
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:34,891
I'm just gonna make
sure nothing bad happens.

375
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:38,161
- I'm coming with.
- Wait for me, guys!

376
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:41,564
You gonna be cool
if I let you go?

377
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:42,598
- Yes.
- Yeah?

378
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:43,932
- Yes!
- All right.

379
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:48,270
What the fuck are you doing?

380
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:51,174
You need to calm down.

381
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,309
Don't fucking touch me!

382
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,213
Is this how you want it, Sandy?
Huh?

383
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:09,258
That was pretty fucking stupid!

384
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,462
Hey, are you okay?

385
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,398
I don't know.

386
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:18,468
Yeah, I'm fine.

387
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:21,603
You?

388
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:23,139
Don't worry about me.

389
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:26,409
You okay?

390
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:29,946
Where's Marie?

391
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,981
I don't know.

392
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:33,149
Is that your friend?

393
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:34,584
Yeah, did you see
where she went?

394
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,419
No, I was kind of busy.

395
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:39,021
Maybe she went back in.

396
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:40,356
Maybe.

397
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:50,732
Hey.

398
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,401
Hey, sorry I missed your call.

399
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:53,702
I'm at Foxtrot.

400
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:55,737
Yeah, I'm just leaving
the morgue.

401
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,573
- Another one?
- No.

402
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,141
But new information,

403
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,443
these girls were likely
used to smuggle drugs.

404
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:04,580
- What?
- Yeah, they were drug mules.

405
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,848
<i>Oh, that's crazy. I...</i>

406
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:10,419
But hey, I have a bit
of a situation here.

407
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:14,323
Uh, Brad came, made a scene,
started a fight.

408
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:15,157
He what?

409
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,892
Long story, but I also managed
to lose Marie in this mess.

410
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,228
So, if you don't mind
picking me up?

411
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:24,599
- <i>Yeah, sure I'll be there in 20.</i>
- Cool, thanks, bye.

412
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,211
Oh, my God!

413
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:40,248
Hello?

414
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:42,584
Oh, hello?

415
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,089
Please, please answer me!
Oh, my God!

416
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:56,164
So, to what do I owe...

417
00:27:58,767 --> 00:27:59,669
for this...

418
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:02,471
pleasure?

419
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,079
I'm pretty sure you know
why I'm here.

420
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:11,514
Maybe I do.

421
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,684
Maybe I don't.

422
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,887
I don't like to assume things,
Carlos.

423
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:21,423
The Russian,
he's getting shut down.

424
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,392
And I know
you have high level clients

425
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:25,995
that will need service
when that happens.

426
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,364
The Russian
is getting shut down?

427
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,767
Is that so?

428
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,205
Carlos, have you ever met
Mikhail?

429
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,940
No.

430
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,344
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything.

431
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:46,481
You haven't met him.

432
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:50,318
That's why you don't see.

433
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:55,658
Mikhail...

434
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:58,460
isn't...

435
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:02,131
wired like the rest of us.

436
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:04,300
Uh-uh.

437
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,235
You know what I mean?

438
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,172
Pretty soon he
won't be wired at all.

439
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,307
I assure you...

440
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,245
you're not the first
to say that.

441
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,216
And yet...

442
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,852
he's still here.

443
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:28,557
In Chicago I wiped people
like him off the streets...

444
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:31,360
until it was mine.

445
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:32,795
Carlos...

446
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,430
this is Detroit.

447
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:38,366
Not Chicago!

448
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:41,804
Things are different here.

449
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:45,507
I came here to extend an offer,

450
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:47,776
not to listen to you defend
the Russian.

451
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,711
I'm not defending the Russian.

452
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:52,314
I'm making sure
you have some idea

453
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:54,350
of what you're getting yourself
into.

454
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:58,888
I guess you'll go down
with him, then.

455
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:01,591
Carlos.

456
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:07,830
Only time will tell.

457
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:14,269
Only time will tell.

458
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:20,742
Last chance.

459
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:24,447
Switch now or hang
onto the Russian and be done.

460
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:27,215
I believe you already

461
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,185
asked that question.

462
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,506
Down goes Frazier.

463
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:53,942
Hey, there you are.

464
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,478
We still can't find Marie.

465
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:58,546
That's weird.

466
00:30:58,713 --> 00:30:59,981
She wouldn't just leave us
like this.

467
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:00,950
I know.

468
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,286
Someone had to
have seen where she went.

469
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:06,455
I mean,
maybe she did leave.

470
00:31:07,255 --> 00:31:08,558
She would have said something.

471
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,665
Settle down or we'll have
to put you back to sleep.

472
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:21,569
What do you want, money?
I have money, please.

473
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,873
- Let me go!
- Shut her up.

474
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:26,374
No, please.

475
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:36,651
Charge her up slowly.

476
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:37,920
Okay.

477
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:41,356
- She's not for play, Karpov.
- I understand.

478
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,259
She's worth too much.

479
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:44,993
Don't fuck it up.

480
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:00,876
Yes?

481
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:02,944
<i>That detective is still here.</i>

482
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,613
She wants to go through
the club after we close.

483
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,582
Let her,
we have nothing to hide.

484
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,052
All right, I just wanted you
to make the call.

485
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:12,421
Cooperate, it's better.

486
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,623
All right.

487
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,383
You ready to make me some money,
yet?

488
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:43,719
Uh-huh.

489
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,342
I don't get it.

490
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:10,712
She's not answering her phone,
she's not here.

491
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,248
Look, I'm really sorry, but

492
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:15,351
I'm sure she just left
with some guy.

493
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:17,818
Trust me, it happens
all the time.

494
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,653
Well, here is my card.

495
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:23,057
Call me if you find anything
or if she turns up.

496
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,393
Sure thing.

497
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:25,594
Hey,

498
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:27,028
I assume those work?

499
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,699
Yeah, they should.

500
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:31,966
Do you have them
all around?

501
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,370
Yeah, we got pretty good
coverage.

502
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:36,939
I'd like to see the footage.

503
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:40,108
Of course, but not tonight.

504
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,776
Unfortunately,
Mikhail's the only one

505
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:43,879
who has access
to the security room.

506
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,314
I'd like to set that
up as soon as possible.

507
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:47,917
Yeah, I'll give him a call.

508
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:51,120
You ladies have a good night.

509
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:54,824
You, too.

510
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,767
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>We got a problem.</i>

511
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:11,373
- Good morning, Laura.
- Good morning.

512
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:14,375
Did you get any messages
from my daughter this morning?

513
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,277
No, no sir. Um,

514
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:18,580
let me double check
the voicemail.

515
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,881
Thanks.

516
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:28,623
- Sir?
- Yes?

517
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:30,693
Nope, no message.

518
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:40,335
Mayor Alderman's office,
Mrs. Moore speaking.

519
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:42,236
<i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>

520
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:43,906
<i>Wait, it's Sandra Miller.</i>

521
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,774
Marie's friend. Is Donald in?

522
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:49,176
Yes, are you with Marie?

523
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,479
No, that's why I'm calling.

524
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,882
Okay, um, hold on.

525
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:56,785
- Mayor Alderman?
- Yes?

526
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:59,154
It's, uh, Sandra on the phone
for you.

527
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:00,522
Sandra?

528
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:02,557
Yes, Marie's friend,
Sandra Miller.

529
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,093
Oh, okay, thanks.

530
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:16,672
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>

531
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,041
Have you seen
or talked to Marie today?

532
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:20,274
Sandra...

533
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:23,645
no, uh, we were supposed
to have breakfast this morning

534
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:24,980
but she didn't show up.

535
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:28,283
Yeah, I don't know
what to do here.

536
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:30,451
We kind of lost track
of each other

537
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:31,620
at Foxtrot last night.

538
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:34,756
Foxtrot,
you mean Kovalchek's place?

539
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:35,923
<i>Yes.</i>

540
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:37,492
Whose idea was that?

541
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:40,996
Sir, it wasn't my call.
I showed up later.

542
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:43,932
I'm sorry, no, just...
What else were you gonna say?

543
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,734
Well, she just vanished.

544
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:50,305
I don't like this.

545
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:52,074
I know, neither do I.

546
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:54,009
I'm heading over
to Foxtrot at 11

547
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:57,813
to go over surveillance videos
and see if I can find anything.

548
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,580
Let me know of anything
you find.

549
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:01,448
I'm still hoping it's nothing,
but...

550
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:03,251
<i>So do I.</i>

551
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,558
But...

552
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:12,928
...never mind.

553
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:32,815
She's awake.

554
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:35,550
Wake up!

555
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:37,719
Can you hear me?

556
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:43,091
- Where am I?
- I'm here to check on you.

557
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:44,559
What?

558
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:47,694
Where am I?

559
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,964
Just relax
so I can check you out.

560
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:50,933
No!

561
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,134
Listen,

562
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:54,902
you're gonna do what I say.

563
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,973
I can make your life very
unpleasant if you don't listen.

564
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,277
Am I clear?

565
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:05,647
You don't have to do this.

566
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:11,020
Mikhail said
careful with this one.

567
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,257
Are we clear?

568
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,098
Settle down!

569
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:28,236
Calm down
or I put you to sleep again.

570
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:33,808
Why are you doing this?

571
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,978
I have money,
I can get all kinds of money!

572
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:39,614
Please,
you don't need to do this!

573
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,727
Goodnight.

574
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:38,573
No, as of right now
we don't have anyone in custody,

575
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,509
but we're working several leads.

576
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:42,878
Excuse me,
Mayor Alderman, sir?

577
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,279
What are you doing
to combat this epidemic?

578
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,049
We have a task force

579
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:52,087
that's, uh, being led by two
of our very best detectives

580
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,156
and we have four...

581
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:57,125
four very good officers
supporting them.

582
00:38:57,991 --> 00:39:01,095
Excuse me,
I hear another body turned up.

583
00:39:01,428 --> 00:39:02,797
Can you confirm that?

584
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:04,732
Uh...

585
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:11,939
Yes...

586
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,042
unfortunately we've been told

587
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:19,780
about, uh, the finding
of a woman's body

588
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:23,285
and yet, uh, at this moment
we have no more information.

589
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:25,988
Okay, last question.

590
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:28,522
There are rumors
surrounding a certain individual

591
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,091
who both attended and donated

592
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:31,960
to your charity
at your last event.

593
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,830
The rumors involve this person
having ties to

594
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:38,500
these disappearances. Mr. Mayor,

595
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,502
are you aware of any ties?

596
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:43,005
Well, this is news to me.

597
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,341
Um, I just want you to know

598
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:49,377
I won't turn down any offers
to my charity.

599
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:54,616
But to answer your question,
the facts are that

600
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:57,217
no, there's... there's no...

601
00:39:57,884 --> 00:40:00,921
no evidence of any of our donors
in any way

602
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,926
being associated
to these abductions.

603
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:09,263
All right, listen, I appreciate
your questions but I have to go.

604
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,100
<i>I will let the Chief take over.
Thank you.</i>

605
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:15,870
That's a good boy.

606
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:19,440
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

607
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:20,874
<i>All right,
you heard the mayor.</i>

608
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,811
<i>We'll keep you updated
as we learn more.</i>

609
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:24,511
- You did good.
- <i>Trust me,</i>

610
00:40:24,913 --> 00:40:26,447
we're putting in the resources.

611
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,583
We will get to the bottom
of this.

612
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,185
Thank you for your time.

613
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:01,984
Detective.

614
00:41:03,116 --> 00:41:06,888
I apologize,
but it seems like our cameras

615
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:09,257
weren't working
properly last night.

616
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:12,060
They weren't working properly?

617
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:16,631
Sometimes they short
and we have to reset

618
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:19,034
for them to work properly again.

619
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:22,304
Huh.

620
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:25,973
I mean do you...

621
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,911
You do realize how
bad that sounds?

622
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,247
Someone's missing,

623
00:41:32,848 --> 00:41:35,384
last seen at your club and

624
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:39,921
the security system's
conveniently off.

625
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:43,690
Look...

626
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:47,260
the surveillance system
is to protect my property,

627
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:50,532
not to catch women
leaving the club with men,

628
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,167
leaving their friends behind.

629
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,902
Are you saying she
left with someone?

630
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:57,405
What else?

631
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:00,241
I don't know.

632
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,310
But...

633
00:42:03,977 --> 00:42:06,380
it's not like Marie
to just vanish.

634
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,883
If you know what is like Marie,

635
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:12,554
maybe you shouldn't work
the case.

636
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,388
You're very confident.

637
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:20,062
I bet you think you're smarter
than all of us. That...

638
00:42:20,828 --> 00:42:22,129
you'll get away with this,

639
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:24,065
but your days are numbered.

640
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,205
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Detective?

641
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:33,373
No...

642
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:36,011
I think I have everything
that I need.

643
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:39,014
See the detective out.

644
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,350
I can show myself out. Thanks.

645
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,318
Okay.

646
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,607
Hey, what's up?

647
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,376
<i>It's him, Mikhail.</i>

648
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:10,244
What?

649
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:12,779
He had some footage
from outside the club.

650
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:15,316
<i>He said the cameras
sometimes glitch.</i>

651
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:17,484
And I take it
you don't buy that?

652
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:20,054
Not for a minute.

653
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:23,358
<i>He was enjoying it.
I'm gonna put this fucker away.</i>

654
00:43:24,024 --> 00:43:25,126
I hear you.

655
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:26,794
We have to be careful.

656
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,029
One screw-up and he could walk.

657
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:32,434
Yeah, I know.
Look, I need to tell the mayor.

658
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,003
Okay.

659
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,174
It hasn't been that long, Mayor.

660
00:43:41,808 --> 00:43:45,279
I still remember not having to
lock our doors when I grew up.

661
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:47,048
Please...

662
00:43:48,515 --> 00:43:50,084
this reality is now...

663
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:54,388
and it's not happening just
here, it's happening everywhere.

664
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:57,925
I don't care about everywhere
else. I care about here!

665
00:43:57,993 --> 00:44:00,594
- I understand, sir.
- Do you?

666
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:03,931
My daughter's best
friend is missing.

667
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,667
She's been gone
for over two weeks

668
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,636
and she's not the only one!

669
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:11,672
- What's it gonna take?
- Listen, sir

670
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,308
I've activated a task force

671
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,278
with a specific focus
on trafficking

672
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:19,881
and it has my full support.

673
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:24,551
The two detectives? How is that
gonna change anything?

674
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,156
Each of those officers
are the very best.

675
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:31,026
And together, believe me...

676
00:44:31,725 --> 00:44:34,428
they're much better than none.
And they have the support

677
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:37,364
of four,
four experienced officers

678
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:40,736
who also have the support
of our full force.

679
00:44:41,301 --> 00:44:42,002
Please!

680
00:44:42,303 --> 00:44:43,337
That's not good enough.

681
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:46,041
We're losing our daughters here,
sir!

682
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,542
Good.

683
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,446
You'll have to excuse me
I have to take care

684
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:55,716
- of some other business, please.
- Look at these girls!

685
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,552
Look at them!

686
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:59,386
What is it gonna take?

687
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:03,357
Does it have to be one of yours
for you to take this seriously?

688
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:06,161
I am sorry, sir.

689
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:08,763
I'm so sorry.

690
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,732
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

691
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:14,169
But I think the
Russians took her.

692
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:18,573
What?

693
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:21,642
It's just too many things
not adding up.

694
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:25,645
Look, I'll update you
with more details, but,

695
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:28,116
after meeting with Mikhail
and finding out

696
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,984
that the outside footage
is missing

697
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:32,687
from a perfectly good
surveillance system,

698
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:34,588
I've determined
that it's likely them,

699
00:45:34,656 --> 00:45:37,125
- or they're in on it.
- Listen, Sandra.

700
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,361
You have to find her.

701
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:42,431
You know what these animals,

702
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:45,634
you know what these animals do
to girls.

703
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,667
I know.

704
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:49,136
I'm on it.

705
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:55,076
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Just find her!

706
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:02,250
Damn.

707
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:29,343
- This is her?
- Yes, that's her.

708
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:32,946
- But, she's not blond.
- Look, blond.

709
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,549
It's colored,
her roots are dark.

710
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:39,821
For 10,000 dollars
you don't get genuine blond.

711
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:40,922
You know this.

712
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,225
- But, seriously, we...
- We'll take her.

713
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:48,229
Do you have any
higher end girls?

714
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:49,530
Maybe younger?

715
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:52,866
Of course, how young?

716
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:56,138
Teens, virgins? Let's say...

717
00:46:56,904 --> 00:46:57,839
100,000 dollars?

718
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:08,450
I'm sure we can find
something you'll like.

719
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:11,218
Get this one ready.

720
00:47:11,652 --> 00:47:14,556
Let me see what else we have.

721
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,572
- You're sure it's him?
- <i>Who else?</i>

722
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:34,808
And even if he didn't,
I'm sure he's connected.

723
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,109
- I'm certain.
- <i>Oh.</i>

724
00:47:36,743 --> 00:47:38,912
Any chance he'll give
her up if he has her?

725
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,181
I doubt it,

726
00:47:40,881 --> 00:47:42,450
maybe just to save his own skin.

727
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:46,254
Uh, if I go poking at Mr. Stone
I need backup.

728
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,792
It's a higher risk
engagement, so to speak.

729
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:51,859
Whatever you need.

730
00:47:52,426 --> 00:47:54,094
<i>It's my daughter,
for Christ's sake!</i>

731
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:57,265
Enough to at least get
someone to watch my back.

732
00:47:57,631 --> 00:47:58,732
Ideally, two.

733
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:01,802
But it's not gonna be
cheap or easy to find them.

734
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,970
Like I said,
whatever you need.

735
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:05,406
All right...

736
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,841
if I had about a quarter,
I'd be set.

737
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:08,944
<i>You got it.</i>

738
00:48:10,076 --> 00:48:12,078
All right, well,
let me make a few calls

739
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:14,448
and, uh, don't worry, I'm on it.

740
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:15,450
Good.

741
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:18,553
Good.

742
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:32,701
Hey, you.

743
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:36,805
Come here.

744
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:39,740
<i>Nyet.</i>

745
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:42,643
Please.

746
00:48:47,214 --> 00:48:48,683
Please talk to me.

747
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:52,353
We both noticed each
other at the club.

748
00:48:58,493 --> 00:48:59,728
Noticed each other?

749
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,331
Yeah.

750
00:49:08,268 --> 00:49:09,370
Just...

751
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:12,506
help me outta here and, uh,

752
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:15,010
I'll take care of you.

753
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:19,047
That's not going to happen.

754
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,919
Let me out of these
for a little bit?

755
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:29,823
Why?

756
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:33,794
So, I can show you.

757
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:54,549
Show me what?

758
00:49:57,051 --> 00:49:57,951
Something.

759
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:05,392
I have... I have a thing
for tough guys like you.

760
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:21,475
Better?

761
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,611
Better.

762
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:29,017
So show me.

763
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:47,435
What's gonna happen?

764
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:50,437
I just wish we could leave.

765
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:51,939
Well, we can't...

766
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:54,107
so come on.

767
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:55,609
- Okay.
- Yes.

768
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:57,444
Okay.

769
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:09,657
Okay, get in.

770
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:11,826
What's going on?

771
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:14,396
I just asked for water.

772
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:16,797
Don't be stupid, Marie.

773
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:18,065
Be good,

774
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:20,401
or you will end up dead
in a ditch

775
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,469
after they all take a turn
on you.

776
00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:26,408
- Karpov!
- <i>Da?</i>

777
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,276
Don't fuck this up!

778
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:32,113
Or I swear I will have Mikhail
use you as shark bait

779
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,748
the next time he goes fishing!

780
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:34,848
What?

781
00:51:35,183 --> 00:51:38,085
And keep your little
worm in your pants, okay?

782
00:52:13,286 --> 00:52:15,223
Eight ball, corner pocket.

783
00:52:25,265 --> 00:52:26,166
Fuck.

784
00:52:28,236 --> 00:52:29,170
You hustled me!

785
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:30,971
And I ain't paying nobody
to play me!

786
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:37,010
Listen, never touch my clothes.
In fact, never touch me, period.

787
00:52:37,745 --> 00:52:40,614
- Am I clear?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,785
Now use your other hand
and give me my money.

789
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:55,196
What can I get for you?

790
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:16,850
- Talk to me.
- <i>I need you.</i>

791
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:24,658
And his opponent, you all
know him, still undefeated,

792
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:28,428
a man who goes by one name only.

793
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:34,835
Here is Alpha!

794
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:50,018
Again, a man who goes by
one name only.

795
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:56,557
Here is Alpha!

796
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:03,064
Gentlemen, center.

797
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:09,002
One of the rules of locker room,
there are no rules. Separate.

798
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,174
Let's fight!

799
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:21,848
Let's fight!

800
00:54:22,149 --> 00:54:23,151
Oh!

801
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:04,759
Can we subpoena
the video cameras

802
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:06,393
and see if they were tampered
with?

803
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,660
We can.

804
00:55:07,962 --> 00:55:09,263
- Then we should.
- Yeah.

805
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:13,834
I just don't understand
how they could have snatched her

806
00:55:13,899 --> 00:55:15,335
right from under your nose.

807
00:55:20,973 --> 00:55:22,910
It must have been in
the commotion with Brad.

808
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:28,882
I saw Kovalchek leave with
one of his goons in a van.

809
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,152
It was a windowless white van.

810
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:32,687
All right,

811
00:55:33,187 --> 00:55:35,622
we can check gas stations
with road views on either side,

812
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:37,058
see if we can get a plate.

813
00:55:38,058 --> 00:55:40,128
Or stake it out,
see if it comes back.

814
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:41,995
Yeah, we could stake out
the club

815
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:43,665
and see if it pops up again.

816
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:45,365
Yeah.

817
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:48,969
- Let's check in with Chief.
- Good idea, let's go.

818
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:53,040
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?

819
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:54,241
We have something.

820
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,176
All right, talk to me.

821
00:55:56,643 --> 00:55:58,912
We should be able to subpoena
the video with a search warrant.

822
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:01,614
Let me see if I can get
Judge Reinhold on the phone.

823
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:04,786
Also, I saw a white
windowless van leave the scene.

824
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:06,254
Can we put out an APB?

825
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,323
Why don't you stake the place
out and see if they come again?

826
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:10,491
Let's do both.

827
00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:13,261
- All right, sounds good.
- Thanks, Chief.

828
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:14,862
Yep.

829
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,600
All right,

830
00:56:20,968 --> 00:56:22,469
I'll check the parking lot,
you check the club.

831
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:24,004
Okay.

832
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:38,986
- Hey.
- Hey.

833
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:44,958
Uh, sorry I was so short
last night.

834
00:56:47,593 --> 00:56:49,329
Your boss wasn't very nice.

835
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,132
It's fine, I understand.

836
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,502
And thanks for stepping in
with Brad.

837
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:58,105
It's okay, just doing my job.

838
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,210
Can I buy you a drink?

839
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:05,946
Uh, sure.

840
00:57:08,982 --> 00:57:11,352
So, how did you end up
with these guys?

841
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:13,853
What, how did I end up
with the owner

842
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:15,756
and the crew managing this bar?

843
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:18,159
You know what I mean.

844
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,627
It's a good gig.

845
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:24,966
Mikhail, he, he looked
after me for a while.

846
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:29,136
He was friends with my dad
when he passed, and...

847
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:33,140
my mom, she OD'd
a few years earlier, so,

848
00:57:33,806 --> 00:57:36,209
I was on the streets
fending for myself.

849
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,211
When he found out...

850
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:40,347
he took me in.

851
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:43,382
But now he's using you.

852
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,888
Your chief uses you
like any boss uses an employee.

853
00:57:47,821 --> 00:57:49,123
What's the difference?

854
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,094
You're smarter than that.

855
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:57,031
You know the difference
between right and wrong

856
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:59,700
and a false sense of loyalty

857
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:02,068
has you working
against who you are.

858
00:58:03,669 --> 00:58:04,938
What do you want me to say?

859
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:06,673
How I feel stuck?

860
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,375
Or how I regret crossing
to the dark side?

861
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:12,513
Or how I live in fear?
Something like that?

862
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:16,517
I'm gonna tell you something.

863
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:21,488
There's no dark side,
there's no light side.

864
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:23,357
There's just shades of gray.

865
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:33,600
Well, I'd like you on my side.

866
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:36,837
Shade of gray.

867
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,375
You seem like a good man.

868
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:46,146
No?

869
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,282
That about it, detective?

870
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:51,419
I guess so.

871
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:53,955
It's on the house, by the way.

872
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:15,009
Anything?

873
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:17,577
Nope, not a thing.

874
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:20,347
You?

875
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:21,549
Nada.

876
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:31,424
Hey, man.

877
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:39,033
How's business?

878
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,102
Business is good, as always.

879
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:43,536
That detective...

880
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:46,274
she came by again.

881
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,913
- Don't worry about her.
- I'm not, they just left.

882
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:56,250
Karpov, go check if
they're still here.

883
00:59:56,982 --> 00:59:57,883
They left.

884
00:59:58,118 --> 01:00:00,187
- Check anyways.
- All right.

885
01:00:04,091 --> 01:00:05,259
What did she say?

886
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:07,727
I don't think
they have anything,

887
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:10,598
but she seems pretty determined
it's you who took her.

888
01:00:15,402 --> 01:00:17,504
The baggage will be gone
tomorrow.

889
01:00:18,272 --> 01:00:19,172
That's good.

890
01:00:48,468 --> 01:00:49,369
Welcome.

891
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:54,075
Hey, you, wake up!

892
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:02,049
Fuck you.

893
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:05,753
I was trying to be nice.

894
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:10,290
Okay.

895
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:13,326
Here we go.

896
01:01:15,495 --> 01:01:16,463
First question.

897
01:01:18,598 --> 01:01:20,767
Did you take
Mayor Alderman's daughter?

898
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:26,207
I took your mother.

899
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:36,416
I'll ask you one more time.

900
01:01:38,518 --> 01:01:40,421
Did you take the
Mayor's daughter?

901
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,259
Fuck you.

902
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:51,832
Is that the best you've got?

903
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:53,533
What do you think, I'm a cop?

904
01:01:57,603 --> 01:01:59,105
You think I have rules?

905
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:03,611
Cash.

906
01:02:20,893 --> 01:02:23,263
Kill me, I'm not talking.

907
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:25,199
Where's the fun in that?

908
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,275
Fuck you!

909
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:36,343
Nails grow back.

910
01:02:38,645 --> 01:02:40,181
We're not finished yet.

911
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:43,217
Where is she?

912
01:02:44,884 --> 01:02:46,687
In your mother's bed.

913
01:02:48,388 --> 01:02:50,324
After I fucked them both...

914
01:02:51,558 --> 01:02:55,228
- they needed the rest.
- This guy's a real dirt bag.

915
01:02:58,899 --> 01:02:59,799
Level two.

916
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:04,270
Level two,
now I'm scared.

917
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:18,484
I'll take it to the grave.

918
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:21,322
See, I know you're in
a hurry to get there...

919
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:23,891
but if you don't talk...

920
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:27,795
I can make this last forever.

921
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:31,832
Okay.

922
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:36,436
Let's try this one more time.

923
01:03:39,105 --> 01:03:40,607
Hey, you know what, Cash?

924
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:43,144
He don't look ready.

925
01:03:44,477 --> 01:03:47,313
Why don't you take another
one before I ask him again?

926
01:03:48,082 --> 01:03:49,183
Pleasure.

927
01:05:10,296 --> 01:05:14,368
Help. Help me, please!
Help me!

928
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:17,471
Please, save me.

929
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:20,808
No!

930
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:22,977
No!

931
01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:25,613
No!

932
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:28,448
Please, save me.

933
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,528
Where's Karpov?

934
01:05:43,096 --> 01:05:44,465
I don't think he's here.

935
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:45,932
Go find him.

936
01:05:46,767 --> 01:05:47,667
All right.

937
01:06:05,852 --> 01:06:06,786
I can't find him.

938
01:06:08,488 --> 01:06:10,256
What you mean
you can't find him?

939
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:12,593
I mean I can't find him,
he's not here.

940
01:06:27,507 --> 01:06:31,844
Oh, what do we got here?

941
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:35,548
Hello?

942
01:06:36,116 --> 01:06:37,017
Who is this?

943
01:06:37,283 --> 01:06:40,219
I'm just babysitting this phone.
Who are you?

944
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,822
<i>Listen motherfucker,</i>

945
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:43,857
<i>you put Karpov on the phone
right now.</i>

946
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,393
Okay.

947
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,795
Hey Karpov...

948
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:51,864
you got a phone call.
I think it's your boss.

949
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:53,500
I'm all right.

950
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,536
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

951
01:06:56,468 --> 01:06:58,571
Actually,
he's not doing so hot.

952
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:03,609
Look, I will find you
and when I find you

953
01:07:03,676 --> 01:07:05,511
I will cut you up
into little pieces, you p...

954
01:07:05,578 --> 01:07:08,015
Hey, shut up and listen
for a second!

955
01:07:10,283 --> 01:07:11,551
<i>What do you want?</i>

956
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:13,819
Simple.

957
01:07:14,553 --> 01:07:18,090
I trade you one barely alive
Russian piece of shit

958
01:07:18,457 --> 01:07:19,926
for the mayor's daughter.

959
01:07:22,328 --> 01:07:24,864
- What?
- <i>Better hurry it up.</i>

960
01:07:25,732 --> 01:07:27,801
He's not gonna be alive
much longer.

961
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:34,375
Fuck you, you can have him.
I have lots of Karpovs.

962
01:07:38,444 --> 01:07:40,080
I think you just got fired.

963
01:07:43,382 --> 01:07:45,018
So you're just gonna let them
kill him?

964
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:48,888
- He's as good as dead.
- But he's not dead yet!

965
01:07:50,556 --> 01:07:52,825
He is already dead!

966
01:07:55,294 --> 01:07:56,462
Fuck!

967
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:00,834
What the fuck you looking at?

968
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:22,956
Oh, my God, she's gone!

969
01:08:23,622 --> 01:08:26,626
Bring her to me!

970
01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:31,899
- She's gone!
- <i>What?</i>

971
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:34,334
Marie is gone!

972
01:08:35,234 --> 01:08:37,270
<i>And there
was another drive-by...</i>

973
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:43,544
- Yeah?
- She got out.

974
01:08:44,144 --> 01:08:45,045
<i>What?</i>

975
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:48,315
She got out.
I don't know how, but...

976
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:53,019
she couldn't have made it far.
Well, I think you should know.

977
01:08:57,023 --> 01:08:59,960
The mayor, yeah,
talk to the mayor for me.

978
01:09:00,559 --> 01:09:01,861
Where's your daughter?

979
01:09:03,063 --> 01:09:04,564
Fuck.

980
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:07,066
<i>...found last
week in the river...</i>

981
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:13,005
Yeah, that's right.

982
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:21,915
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, go check on my credit.

983
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:24,151
Jack, you stay here.

984
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,252
Come on, Stone,
you're smarter than that.

985
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:10,531
Does that hurt?

986
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:13,099
Yeah, it looks painful.

987
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:19,639
You know...

988
01:10:20,273 --> 01:10:23,176
I wonder how long it would take
you to bleed to death?

989
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:28,081
I'd say five hours, maybe six.

990
01:10:28,982 --> 01:10:34,254
Without help, without care,
you're a dead man.

991
01:10:37,723 --> 01:10:40,993
What do you want from me, hmm?

992
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:44,698
Where's the mayor's daughter?

993
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:47,232
School? I don't know!

994
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,604
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

995
01:10:54,273 --> 01:10:55,642
Wrong answer.

996
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:08,020
Mom?

997
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:11,223
Mom?

998
01:11:11,357 --> 01:11:13,792
Sandra, Sandra!

999
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:16,728
- Oh, shit, shh!
- Sandra, don't let them find me.

1000
01:11:16,996 --> 01:11:20,000
There's no one here,
let's get you home.

1001
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:26,006
I give up, don't shoot!

1002
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,675
I'm unarmed.

1003
01:11:30,343 --> 01:11:31,077
Come slowly towards me

1004
01:11:31,211 --> 01:11:33,180
with your hands on top
of your head.

1005
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:50,162
Just give me the location.

1006
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:51,898
It'll be over.

1007
01:11:52,331 --> 01:11:53,366
I'm bleeding out.

1008
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:57,004
I'll be gone soon anyway.

1009
01:11:58,304 --> 01:11:59,772
Ah, I can fix that.

1010
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:11,183
See?

1011
01:12:11,585 --> 01:12:12,919
Now we have time.

1012
01:12:14,586 --> 01:12:16,756
We just went from hours left...

1013
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:19,992
to several days,
maybe even weeks.

1014
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:23,663
But if I get the address...

1015
01:12:24,764 --> 01:12:26,800
I'll put a bullet in your head
and it's over.

1016
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:31,270
Yeah, a big part of me really
wants...

1017
01:12:32,272 --> 01:12:33,372
you to reveal it...

1018
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,709
but the other part of me...

1019
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,443
is curious.

1020
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,446
How long will you last?

1021
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,949
Hey, pretty elaborate, isn't it?

1022
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,118
So what do you say?

1023
01:12:46,486 --> 01:12:48,087
Address or this?

1024
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:50,089
I am curious

1025
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:52,291
so I don't mind giving this
a try.

1026
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:56,696
Oh, the strong, silent type.

1027
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,100
Okay, Cash...

1028
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:02,736
give him a little taste.

1029
01:13:09,709 --> 01:13:10,844
All right, enough.

1030
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:16,249
You already know,

1031
01:13:16,849 --> 01:13:19,119
I won't talk so...

1032
01:13:21,854 --> 01:13:23,255
Let's end this.

1033
01:13:23,922 --> 01:13:25,492
No, no, no, no. Don't you see?

1034
01:13:25,992 --> 01:13:27,560
That's the beauty of this.

1035
01:13:27,827 --> 01:13:29,896
You decide how much pain
there will be.

1036
01:13:31,063 --> 01:13:33,032
I've offered you a way out.

1037
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:36,937
Look at me.

1038
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,110
I don't know...

1039
01:13:44,109 --> 01:13:45,245
where it is.

1040
01:13:47,179 --> 01:13:48,080
That's it.

1041
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:51,351
The truth...

1042
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,921
is closer to you
than your breath.

1043
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:02,594
Hit him up.

1044
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:09,835
Now...

1045
01:14:11,104 --> 01:14:13,273
why don't you tell
the big, bad wolf...

1046
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,443
what he needs to hear?

1047
01:14:18,144 --> 01:14:20,013
Looks like I get two for one.

1048
01:14:25,984 --> 01:14:27,554
Pretty for a detective.

1049
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:37,531
Don't even fucking touch me,
you pig!

1050
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:40,132
Did you radio your location?

1051
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,269
Fuck you!

1052
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:48,107
Don't you fucking touch her!

1053
01:14:54,915 --> 01:14:57,082
You're already dead
and you don't even know it.

1054
01:14:57,215 --> 01:14:58,550
Fuck you!

1055
01:15:03,089 --> 01:15:07,593
- Did you radio your location?
- Don't you fucking touch...

1056
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,104
Let's relocate.

1057
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:22,209
You better not be lying.

1058
01:15:28,346 --> 01:15:29,248
Liar,

1059
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:32,518
liar, liar, liar.

1060
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:35,055
Liar, I'm a...

1061
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:38,224
liar.

1062
01:15:43,763 --> 01:15:45,098
Liar, liar...

1063
01:15:45,864 --> 01:15:48,033
pants on fire.

1064
01:15:59,377 --> 01:16:00,346
Look at you.

1065
01:16:02,948 --> 01:16:04,951
You should have
chosen more wisely.

1066
01:16:05,451 --> 01:16:06,653
Carlos.

1067
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:11,156
Nice to see you, Carlos.

1068
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:13,660
It's not too late.

1069
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:15,961
Join me...

1070
01:16:16,562 --> 01:16:17,663
and I let you go.

1071
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:23,470
No, no, no.

1072
01:16:25,237 --> 01:16:26,138
No?

1073
01:16:26,672 --> 01:16:29,442
I'm not joining you.

1074
01:16:36,381 --> 01:16:37,917
I decided.

1075
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:40,652
I

1076
01:16:41,053 --> 01:16:44,157
don't want...

1077
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,091
Okay.

1078
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,630
Oh, a gun?

1079
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:54,233
Bye, bye.

1080
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:13,987
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

1081
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:16,723
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1082
01:17:16,822 --> 01:17:17,957
Just trust me.

1083
01:17:18,523 --> 01:17:19,591
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1084
01:17:24,663 --> 01:17:25,697
I'm getting you outta here.

1085
01:17:26,232 --> 01:17:27,701
I'm getting you all outta here.

1086
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:42,614
It's okay, he's on our side.

1087
01:17:42,814 --> 01:17:44,183
You gotta be quiet. Okay?

1088
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:47,118
I'm getting you outta here,
okay?

1089
01:17:47,286 --> 01:17:48,955
- I'm getting you outta here.
- He's on our side.

1090
01:17:51,157 --> 01:17:52,525
He's getting us out of here.

1091
01:17:53,859 --> 01:17:56,228
Shh, it's okay.

1092
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:09,308
I got you, okay, shh!

1093
01:18:10,343 --> 01:18:11,944
I'm getting you
outta here, okay?

1094
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:16,015
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
All right. It's gonna be okay.

1095
01:18:21,287 --> 01:18:22,188
Okay.

1096
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,028
Come here, okay.

1097
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:43,475
Hey, man.

1098
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:46,211
Everything's good out there?

1099
01:18:46,412 --> 01:18:48,047
Yeah, they're just getting
the bodies out of the way.

1100
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:49,515
So they're out there now?

1101
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:51,084
No, I think
they're dumping them.

1102
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:53,919
Okay, let's hope that's it
and no more are coming, right?

1103
01:18:54,153 --> 01:18:56,356
Yeah, man, no shit.

1104
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:27,487
- I'm not leaving you, Jessie!
- Please, go.

1105
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:30,255
I want you to live!

1106
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:32,924
- We gotta go now!
- No, I'm not leaving her!

1107
01:19:32,992 --> 01:19:35,495
Do you wanna fucking die here?
Come on!

1108
01:19:45,403 --> 01:19:46,872
Wait, wait,
wait something's wrong!

1109
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:49,174
We don't have time for this!

1110
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:53,112
We gotta move!

1111
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,020
Listen up,

1112
01:20:02,587 --> 01:20:05,358
these bastards will be locked
and loaded on their home turf.

1113
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:07,594
Watch your sixes.

1114
01:20:08,961 --> 01:20:10,295
We work together...

1115
01:20:10,929 --> 01:20:11,830
as one.

1116
01:20:12,598 --> 01:20:13,299
Hell, yeah.

1117
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:16,135
- Team work.
- Yeah, there's no I in team.

1118
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:18,638
- Semper fi.
- That's right.

1119
01:20:22,407 --> 01:20:23,508
Move the other girls.

1120
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:26,010
We need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

1121
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:27,313
Okay, boss, where you going?

1122
01:20:27,712 --> 01:20:30,750
- I need to take care of things.
- Remember, they can be off IV's

1123
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:34,019
for maybe an hour before
they start clearing up. Okay?

1124
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:35,288
See you at back up.

1125
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:38,490
If you see Darryl,

1126
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,192
I want him alive.

1127
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,242
I can't do this.

1128
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:58,810
What?

1129
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,412
But you helped us.

1130
01:21:00,712 --> 01:21:03,014
Of course,
we're not gonna turn you in!

1131
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:04,649
No, you see,

1132
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:07,319
I don't think I can stay out
of Mikhail's reach.

1133
01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:10,523
I gotta do this the only way
I know how.

1134
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:12,892
What do you mean?

1135
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:15,528
I gotta face him.

1136
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:20,866
- That's suicide, Darryl.
- Turning myself in is suicide.

1137
01:21:21,132 --> 01:21:22,035
Come on.

1138
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,906
- We have programs that...
- Sandra, you know what I mean!

1139
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,509
You know how our world works.

1140
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,779
I'm gonna be looking
over my shoulder

1141
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:34,614
for the rest of my life.

1142
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:39,618
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be short lived.

1143
01:21:40,586 --> 01:21:41,653
Sandra...

1144
01:21:43,288 --> 01:21:44,623
...can't they help him?

1145
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:56,336
He's right.

1146
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,308
I hate to say it,
but he's right.

1147
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:40,812
Go to the car.

1148
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:54,326
This is your loyalty?

1149
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,228
Don't you fucking talk to me
about loyalty

1150
01:22:56,295 --> 01:22:58,130
after you let them kill Karpov!

1151
01:22:58,563 --> 01:22:59,831
He was already dead.

1152
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:02,902
You really think
they would let him go?

1153
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:04,670
You should have traded!

1154
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,471
We would all be dead.

1155
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:08,607
Listen to me.

1156
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,477
I'm out, okay?

1157
01:23:11,743 --> 01:23:14,346
What do you want, my blessing?

1158
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:16,614
I want your word,

1159
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:18,651
that if I help you
take these guys out

1160
01:23:18,783 --> 01:23:20,051
I don't have to look
over my shoulder

1161
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:22,086
for the rest of my life
wondering if I'm gonna be

1162
01:23:22,153 --> 01:23:23,755
at the receiving end
of your gun.

1163
01:23:30,194 --> 01:23:32,431
Okay, deal.

1164
01:23:36,734 --> 01:23:37,703
I trust you.

1165
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,108
Time I go see this mayor.

1166
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:44,210
Okay...

1167
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:45,745
I'll check on Stone.

1168
01:23:57,488 --> 01:23:58,991
They're on their way.

1169
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:01,760
Good.

1170
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:03,595
How you feeling?

1171
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:05,898
I don't feel so hot.

1172
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:10,536
You?

1173
01:24:12,237 --> 01:24:14,940
I feel sick,

1174
01:24:15,808 --> 01:24:16,743
drained.

1175
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:22,448
Where is she? Marie!

1176
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,886
- Dad!
- Marie, sweetie!

1177
01:24:27,452 --> 01:24:28,588
Sweetie, I'm here!

1178
01:24:29,255 --> 01:24:30,355
Are you okay?

1179
01:24:30,589 --> 01:24:33,859
Oh, poor baby!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry!

1180
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:37,662
How is it?

1181
01:24:38,462 --> 01:24:41,834
Are you in pain?
Sweetie, you okay? Is it...

1182
01:24:43,268 --> 01:24:44,404
Oh, God.

1183
01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:51,343
Did we get them yet?

1184
01:24:51,577 --> 01:24:53,413
No, not yet,
they're on their way.

1185
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:54,379
Yeah?

1186
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:58,116
I can put every one
of those fuckers in jail

1187
01:24:58,184 --> 01:24:59,619
for their rest of their life!

1188
01:25:00,452 --> 01:25:03,488
But I want you to take him out.
Do you understand?

1189
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,690
Do you understand?

1190
01:25:10,996 --> 01:25:11,697
Chief?

1191
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:14,632
- Yeah?
- I'd really like to be there.

1192
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,835
No, Sandra, not an option.

1193
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:19,572
Sir, they killed my partner.

1194
01:25:20,404 --> 01:25:22,541
And I'm not losing
you both tonight!

1195
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:25,410
You're recovering,
you go home, rest.

1196
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:29,482
I'd tell you to go to
the hospital, but I know better.

1197
01:25:30,116 --> 01:25:32,484
Go home, I'll keep you updated.

1198
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:36,221
Hey, can we get outta here?

1199
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,625
Yeah, but she's been drugged.
She needs to be examined.

1200
01:25:39,692 --> 01:25:41,225
I know, I know.
She's got a doctor

1201
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:42,627
coming to the house,
don't worry.

1202
01:25:42,995 --> 01:25:45,997
- She needs some help.
- Listen, you just take him out!

1203
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:50,703
I hope that's all she needs.

1204
01:25:54,672 --> 01:25:56,041
Cash, how you feeling?

1205
01:25:57,975 --> 01:25:59,010
I don't know, man.

1206
01:26:00,379 --> 01:26:01,747
I don't like this at all.

1207
01:26:02,715 --> 01:26:04,984
It feels like we're just
sitting ducks out in the open.

1208
01:26:06,419 --> 01:26:07,586
Just breathe.

1209
01:26:08,886 --> 01:26:11,224
Just keep breathing.

1210
01:26:12,491 --> 01:26:13,593
Truth.

1211
01:26:17,528 --> 01:26:18,630
All right...

1212
01:26:19,497 --> 01:26:20,632
let's roll.

1213
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:25,136
Show time.

1214
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,974
Boom.

1215
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:42,187
Dr. Spellman said
he'd be here in a few minutes.

1216
01:26:45,389 --> 01:26:46,791
I feel sick.

1217
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,196
It's the drugs. You're...

1218
01:26:51,764 --> 01:26:53,866
probably gonna have
a few rough days.

1219
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:57,068
But you're gonna be okay.

1220
01:26:58,703 --> 01:26:59,904
You're gonna be all right.

1221
01:27:00,872 --> 01:27:04,109
I just wanna wake up
from this nightmare, Dad.

1222
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:07,212
I understand.

1223
01:27:09,114 --> 01:27:10,550
Hey, you're a champ.

1224
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:15,588
That's the doc.

1225
01:27:31,903 --> 01:27:35,306
- How dare you fuck with me!
- What are you doing?

1226
01:27:35,773 --> 01:27:37,274
What are you doing?

1227
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:40,411
- You bring in the cartel!
- What, they pay you more?

1228
01:27:40,478 --> 01:27:42,081
What are you talking about?

1229
01:27:43,715 --> 01:27:47,318
You tell me everything you know
and you tell me now.

1230
01:27:47,385 --> 01:27:48,419
No, please!

1231
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:50,188
Don't, you know the police
are coming here!

1232
01:27:50,688 --> 01:27:53,357
- You can't stay here!
- Why are you here?

1233
01:27:53,757 --> 01:27:54,926
- No!
- She's a great fuck.

1234
01:27:54,992 --> 01:27:57,263
- Help me!
- Don't you dare!

1235
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,599
- You!
- Now you tell me everything

1236
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,768
or I will fuck her right
in front of you

1237
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:06,872
and I will tape your eyes open
so you have to watch!

1238
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:08,174
No, please!

1239
01:28:09,175 --> 01:28:10,076
Please, don't!

1240
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:11,876
You tell me.

1241
01:28:16,349 --> 01:28:18,017
Last warning.

1242
01:28:19,518 --> 01:28:20,620
God!

1243
01:29:24,649 --> 01:29:26,151
I don't need you anymore.

1244
01:29:26,218 --> 01:29:28,386
I can get you out!
I can stop them!

1245
01:29:28,453 --> 01:29:32,590
I can shut down the cartel!
I can stop the police right now!

1246
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:35,394
You and her,
you gotta save yourselves!

1247
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:37,730
I can help you right now! Don't!

1248
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:40,398
I convict you
of treason, Mayor.

1249
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:44,102
Oh, my God!

1250
01:30:20,705 --> 01:30:21,806
Cash!

1251
01:30:25,477 --> 01:30:27,747
Freeze!

1252
01:30:34,553 --> 01:30:35,520
Officer...

1253
01:30:36,688 --> 01:30:38,022
we're not with them.

1254
01:30:39,558 --> 01:30:41,493
We're here to get
Marie back safely.

1255
01:30:43,394 --> 01:30:45,397
Well, you're too late.

1256
01:30:46,764 --> 01:30:48,099
She's at home with her father.

1257
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,502
That's good.

1258
01:30:51,403 --> 01:30:52,772
You mind if I verify that?

1259
01:30:53,438 --> 01:30:54,339
Go right ahead.

1260
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:57,443
Keep those guns down.

1261
01:31:12,257 --> 01:31:13,792
Well, no answer.

1262
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:23,434
Freeze!

1263
01:31:36,715 --> 01:31:39,518
Fuck!

1264
01:31:43,421 --> 01:31:44,656
- Darryl?
- Yeah?

1265
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:48,324
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

1266
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:50,462
I can never trust
you again.

1267
01:31:58,903 --> 01:32:01,005
Sounds like you are out
of bullets.

1268
01:32:01,407 --> 01:32:02,875
I count nine.

1269
01:32:03,974 --> 01:32:05,910
Sounds like you don't have
any more either.

1270
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:09,415
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

1271
01:32:13,117 --> 01:32:14,053
Okay.

1272
01:32:16,688 --> 01:32:17,623
Let's...

1273
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:19,558
find...

1274
01:32:20,759 --> 01:32:22,461
out.

1275
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:25,129
I am not afraid of you.

1276
01:32:29,033 --> 01:32:30,469
Let's settle this...

1277
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:33,005
a different way.

1278
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:41,279
Your muscles make you slow.

1279
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:45,451
Your lack of
muscles make you weak!

1280
01:33:11,643 --> 01:33:12,578
Jesus, Mikhail...

1281
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,482
you're done.

1282
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:20,685
It's over!

1283
01:33:22,955 --> 01:33:24,555
The cops are on their way.

1284
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:27,926
It's done!

1285
01:33:32,096 --> 01:33:34,099
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

1286
01:34:29,153 --> 01:34:30,421
How about a drink?

1287
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,525
Sounds good.

1288
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:22,493
