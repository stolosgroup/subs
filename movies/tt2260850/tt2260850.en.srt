00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,490
So, did you like the movie?

3
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,660
- So so.
- I did liked it.

4
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,150
- You don't know, you didn't even see it.
- Of course I did.

5
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,480
You went outside for half an
hour to be on the phone.

6
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,970
There was something urgent from
the office I had to take care of.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,130
I just don't get it. why do we come to the movies
if you never get to see the whole thing.

8
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,160
What should I do then? Stop talking
phone calls even though it's urgent?

9
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,980
Let's just stop talking.

10
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,410
You have a Playstation, don't you?

11
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,740
Yes, If you want we can play
Street Fighter when we get home.

12
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,140
- Do you have the new one?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,920
Are you always the last
one to get picked up?

14
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,570
No, I do not know why they're late
today. Sometimes I walk home.

15
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,500
What Street Fighter character
do you pick to play?

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,490
- Honda.
- Nobody picks Honda.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,570
- Which one do you pick?
- Chun Li.

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,340
- That's gay. It's a girl, dude.
- So what?

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,430
She's fast.

20
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,370
- Hi.
- Hi...

21
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,820
It is you, right?

22
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm Adolfo, and you?

23
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,400
You cocky Fito. I'm Leo
from Tepic, dude.

24
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,430
- How are you?
- How are you?

25
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,700
4 MOONS

26
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,640
So you guys knew each other?

27
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,750
Yes since we were kids. We lived
two blocks away from each other.

28
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,320
And I just ran into him.

29
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,260
- So, you're from Tepic too?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,900
Another one? Dammit, these
tepiqueans are invading us.

31
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,930
We're not called tepiqueans, fucker.

32
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,020
Don't listen to him,
he's always like this.

33
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,720
You always want to find other people from
Nayarit so you won't be the only weird one.

34
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,350
Shut up, dude.

35
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,550
This is a big deal. He was my best friend
when we were eight years old.

36
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,320
- We used to hang out every day.
- Yeah, we went to school together.

37
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,553
And so? You got into a fight
with eachother or what?

38
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,740
No, but my dad got a job here. And we said
We were going to stay in touch but...

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,870
Yeah, that usually happens...

40
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,540
You meet cooler friends and
then you forget old ones.

41
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,590
Hey ...

42
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,600
- This is not the cool one.
- Why not?

43
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,410
This is the regular one.

44
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,030
There is a "super" version now that came
out and it has six new characters.

45
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,640
I didn't know that.

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,630
- But you still want to play, right?
- Yes.

47
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,720
Kids, lunch will be
ready in ten minutes,

48
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,170
so you guys come on
down then, okay?

49
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,580
Yes tell me...

50
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,720
Very good.

51
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,320
I will tell the teacher and
we'll call you back.

52
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,320
Have a nice day and
thank you very much.

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,630
- Who was that?
- From the Santa Catarina University.

54
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,610
They want to hold a ceremony,
to pay homenage to you.

55
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,100
Which one is that?

56
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,760
My dear, I don't know. But it's a
homenage, just for you.

57
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,800
And they want to read
some of your poems.

58
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,230
No, no...

59
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,750
- No.
- Yes. It would be so nice.

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm going to fix up your suit,
you'll look so handsome.

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Hi...

62
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Do you change?

63
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,970
- How much?
- 1500 pesos.

64
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,470
- Why so much?
- That's the price.

65
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,010
And no, it's not for anyone.

66
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,410
Don't you talk to me like that.

67
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,440
You're not even that hot,
fucking stupid.

68
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,010
Fucking poor.

69
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,570
Isn't that one that
tasted funny last time?

70
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,170
No, it was good.

71
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,610
Remember it's for everyone,
not just for you.

72
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,800
You know Andrיs? It's so annoying that
everything I choose is wrong for you.

73
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,060
- What did you pick?
- I can't think of anything.

74
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,160
Really, it's not necessary.

75
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,600
Come on, Fito, we're going
in the same direction.

76
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,440
Okay, but drop me off
somewhere in your route.

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,760
Nah, right to your doorsep,
like a pizza.

78
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,410
Well, more like a cold pizza, we're not
gonna make it in less than half an hour.

79
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,280
So I'll have chance to say hello to your
parents. Let's see if they remember me.

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,860
My dad died.

81
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,220
I'm so sorry.

82
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,110
- Hi Mom.
- Hi.

83
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,720
- How was your day?
- Fine.

84
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,240
Guess whom I ran into
at school today.

85
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,700
No way, I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't want to think about that.

86
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,350
I just don't.

87
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,960
Look, we're not going to be this
young and beautiful forever.

88
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,690
Well, by young I wasn't
meaning Danny.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,680
For starters, we need to make a selection
of the people that will be there, right?

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,861
Something like a casting.

91
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,770
No trashy people.

92
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,810
And there has to be a creek.

93
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,190
Yes, yes.

94
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,200
Tell me something, does this retirement
community have a name?

95
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,570
Yes, I have one, I hope you like it...

96
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,920
- WonderVille.
- Yes, I love it, I love it.

97
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,220
Because the houses in the village have
to be super luxurious, super fancy...

98
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,780
You moron, are you doing the
cleaning everyday or what?

99
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,170
No, you're the the moron. I'm
not doing any cleaning.

100
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,780
We should have waiters to
bring food to the houses.

101
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,140
Or how about a sushi-go-round?

102
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,800
That's a good idea, that way the
sushi can go through each houses.

103
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,500
and you try it, if you don't like it,
you can just let it go through.

104
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,500
You spit it out and on to
the next house. Gross!

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
And drinking fountains!
Not with water...

106
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,787
but with wine or scoth, right?

107
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Or with fondues. Drinking
fountains of foundues!

108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,950
- Yes of course. Chocolate fondue.
- No, not chocolate.

109
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,300
I mean cheese fondues.

110
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,856
Not too hot so we don't
burn our tongues.

111
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,150
I'd also like to have a movie theater in my
house. You know I love movies, right?

112
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,360
And also to have a huge staircase
where I could place a picture...

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,280
for every year Hugo and I
have been together.

114
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
How long have you
guys been together?

115
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,670
- Almost eight years now.
- Ten...

116
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,680
Ten?

117
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,450
Well, and we'll need a nurse to
give this sir his memory drugs.

118
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,140
Oh yes, drugs!

119
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,280
Another kind of drugs for the rest of us.
How do you like that?

120
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,180
Yes, drugs, drugs!

121
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,130
Cheers. To the community.

122
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,160
To the oldness.

123
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,200
Are you sure you're
okay in this one?

124
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,670
I can sleep in this one and you
can take my bed if you want.

125
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,160
No, this one's fine, thanks.

126
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,850
There's barely any room left.
I'll have to buy a bigger fridge.

127
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,860
They're so much. You have such a
huge collection. Congratulations.

128
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,360
Thanks.

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,520
It's been a long time
collecting them.

130
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,230
You know what? I have some very
nice frigde magnets at home.

131
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,500
- I'll bring them to you.
- Really? Thank you so much.

132
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,560
And thanks for coming.

133
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,820
Hey, baby.

134
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,460
- I'm kind a drunk.
- Yes, I can see that.

135
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,711
I laughed a lot.

136
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,437
I hadn't laughed like
that in a long time.

137
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:42,419
- They were laughing a lot too.
- Yes, they were laughing a lot. At you.

138
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,528
No, with me.

139
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,002
- Is that what you think?
- Come on, baby.

140
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,397
Hey, baby...

141
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,110
- I want you to do things to me.
- I don't feel like it.

142
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,940
Baby, do me.

143
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Do things to me.

144
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,950
- Don't you want some of this?
- Andrיs I'm tired.

145
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,910
Do you remember what we've
talked about your mannerisms?

146
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,660
- What?
- That I like manly guys.

147
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,784
I don't know if you realize it, but when we're
with our friends you act too feminine...

148
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:34,540
and I don't like it.
I see they all notice it.

149
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,400
I think you could take
it down a notch.

150
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,970
Oh, it bothered you.

151
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,480
Fine then, if you prefer,
I'll say no more.

152
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,070
You go out and keep
being the funny queer.

153
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm just saying I don't feel like having
sex with someone like that.

154
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,430
And I didn't want to say this but it's very
embarassing how keep the fridge.

155
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,650
It's too faggy.

156
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,870
The house has great sense of style
to have something like that ruin it.

157
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,920
Hיctor, breakfast is ready.
Sit down, I'll fix it for your.

158
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,850
No, I'm late. Isaac
is picking me up.

159
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,390
- Bye, son.
- Bye.

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Be good, okay?

161
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,380
You guys are late too. Hurry up.
Are you done?

162
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,990
- Yes.
- Almost.

163
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,430
Oliver, go get your stuff.

164
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,510
Mau pick up your plate when you're
done. I'll go take the car out.

165
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,740
What are you doing?
Are you done?

166
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,190
Yes, I was just...

167
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,230
Hey wait. Here's
your backpack!

168
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,450
Well, you fucking drunks,
I'm outta here.

169
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,560
- Does anybody want a ride?
- I do, "Furry".

170
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,650
Fito...

171
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,100
Do you want a ride?

172
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
No thanks. It's a ten
minute walk to my house.

173
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,540
- Damn it!
- What?

174
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,060
Fuck! I forgot the damn keys
and there's no one home...

175
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,580
they all went to Cuernavaca.

176
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,240
- Really?
- Yes.

177
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,970
- You can stay at my place.
- Really?

178
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,860
Sure, no problem.
There's enough room.

179
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,450
Alright, cool, we're
all set up then.

180
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,880
Take care. See you.

181
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,380
Damn. You were like this
when I met you.

182
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
- It's funny, isn't it?
- Yes.

183
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,220
- Now I'm all emotional.
- Moron.

184
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,670
Well, I'll leave you now.

185
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,240
- Make yourself at home.
- What about you?

186
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll sleep on the couch,
in the living room.

187
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,180
Come on dude. Stay here for a
while, so we can catch up.

188
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,983
Weren't you sleepy?

189
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,210
Well, yes but not
anymore. And you?

190
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,540
I wasn't sleepy at all.

191
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,580
- Do you want to borrow a T-shirt?
- Yes, please.

192
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,220
Wait.

193
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,120
Why did you come
to Mexico City?

194
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,990
- When my dad died...
- No, sorry. I didn't mean to...

195
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,590
My dad has been sick
for several months.

196
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,860
With medication and the hospital
there were lots of bills to pay.

197
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,550
When he died, my mom didn't
have a job or any money.

198
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
She couldn't find a job there...

199
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,380
so my aunt who lives
here, got a job for her.

200
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,320
Fito, seriously, if it's painful you
don't have to tell me anything.

201
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,550
I got the scholarship for college.

202
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,800
I've been telling my mom that I'm gonna
hurry up and finish so I can help her.

203
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,090
She tells me it's all fine
but I know it's not.

204
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,920
Things are pretty bad.

205
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,820
And my dad death...

206
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,260
still hurts a lot for both of us.

207
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm sorry...

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,570
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm such an idiot.

209
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,960
When my dad died I didn't
have any friends...

210
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,990
nothing...

211
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,820
Dummy, you should've called me.

212
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,340
It would've helped me a lot.

213
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,420
It's alright. Don't cry...

214
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,470
I didn't mean to get like this.

215
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,650
Don't be silly.

216
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm fine. Are you comfortable?
Or am I holding you too tight?

217
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,010
I'm fine. I'm really comfortable.

218
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm fine too.

219
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,870
Very comfortable.

220
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,780
Sleep now...

221
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,550
Did you sleep well?

222
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,850
Didn't crush you
or bothered you?

223
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,250
You have such nice skin.

224
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,130
Seriously.

225
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,210
It looks super smooth.

226
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,730
I even feel like kissing your cheek.

227
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,890
What?

228
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,660
You tickled me.

229
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,100
I can tickle your lips?

230
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,330
Are you gay?

231
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,960
I don't know.

232
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,090
But you liked it, didn't you?
Kissing.

233
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,950
Yes, a lot.

234
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,410
And you?

235
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,350
- Are you gay?
- No.

236
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,540
But you liked it...

237
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,960
Don't you think your
mom may have noticed?

238
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,990
Not at all. She
sleeps in on Sundays.

239
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,870
Okay, see you, then.

240
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,980
- Good to see you.
- Listen, I want a favor...

241
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,700
I don't want anyone to
know what happened.

242
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,070
I won't tell anybody.

243
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,830
Fine, dude. See you.

244
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,590
I want to buy the new
"Street Fighter" game.

245
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,610
- That's the one we just bought, isn't it?
- No.

246
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,290
I have the old one. There's a better one
now and it has six new characters.

247
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,970
But isn't it the one you wanted?
The one you were asking for?

248
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,450
Yes but I didn't know there
was another one coming...

249
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,980
and it's a special edition.

250
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,311
Those things are very expensive, son.
I can't right now.

251
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:45,050
- But mom, I really want it.
- What's your problem?

252
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,930
Don't you get it?

253
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,520
I don't like it when you
throw a tantrum. I said no.

254
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,090
Stop bothering me.

255
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,400
But I get good grades ...

256
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,690
Why dont you sell the one you already
have and save the rest of the money?

257
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,390
How am I supposed to save money? And
besides, who's gonna buy the old one?

258
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,950
Well, if you help me out with some
chores in the house, I could...

259
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,700
Not in the house...

260
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,850
There is the utility room.
It needs to be tidied up.

261
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,230
You can help with that.

262
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,730
How much?

263
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,190
I don't have a lot.

264
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,050
- Two thousand.
- How come?

265
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,250
Yesterday you said
fifteen hundred pesos.

266
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,320
Yesterday it was fifteen hundred.

267
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,660
Don't be a jerk.

268
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:27,063
- Is he coming?
- Yes, yes...

269
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,470
Do you like it, fucker?

270
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,680
What's going on?

271
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,620
I've met someone.

272
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,990
I wanted to tell you but
I didn't know how.

273
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,000
What are you saying?

274
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,310
It is not just sex, is it?

275
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,050
What is it then?

276
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,070
Hugo...

277
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,930
Look at me in the eye.

278
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,660
Hugo, look at me.

279
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,690
Hugo...

280
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,550
I love you.

281
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,000
And I love you very much.

282
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,780
I know.

283
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,730
And I'd like to know
what to do, but I don't.

284
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,230
Just tell me one thing...

285
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,670
Tell me you won't go,
tell me you're not leaving me.

286
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,520
Tell me you're not
going to leave me...

287
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,230
that you'll stay here with me.

288
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,180
I can't.

289
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,620
I wish I knew what to do.

290
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,530
I do know.

291
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,470
You're confused, Hugo.

292
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,840
This is just a matter of time.

293
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,030
I want you to do me a favor.

294
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,100
Give me a chance.

295
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,980
I don't know if that's
going to fix this.

296
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,670
I just need you to stop seeing him...

297
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,860
and to stop talking to him,
for two weeks.

298
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,780
- Please.
- I can't.

299
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,420
Please.

300
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,600
Please, please...

301
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,700
What if nothing changes
in two weeks?

302
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,700
Then I leave.

303
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,240
Just like that.
No complains, nothing.

304
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,330
Yes?

305
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Hi.

306
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,490
Hi.

307
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,340
Look what I made for you.

308
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,820
What is it?

309
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,970
It's a board.

310
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,000
Something like a schedule,
I made for you.

311
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,930
Everyday of the week we'll
do an activity you like.

312
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,340
Today, for example,
I'll give you a massage.

313
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,860
You always say I don't want to give you
massages. Well, I'm giving you one today.

314
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,260
Tomorrow night
a special dinner.

315
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,310
And that's how it works.
What do you think?

316
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,050
It's fine.

317
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,360
"What bookworm!"

318
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,110
- Hey, what's up?
- How are you?

319
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,770
- Ready to go?
- Yes.

320
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,840
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.

321
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,670
I do not like mushrooms.
Do you want some salad?

322
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,450
No I don't eat olives,
but thanks.

323
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,090
So, what kind of music
do you like?

324
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,810
Electronic. You?

325
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,580
You'll say I'm such a nerd.

326
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,150
I like pretty much anything. Nothing too
trashy, though, like reggaeton.

327
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,080
I can't stand it anymore.

328
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,630
But my favorite music are pop
ballads from the 50's and 60's.

329
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,320
- Also latin rock. That's it.
- Cool.

330
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,730
Books?

331
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,990
What books do you like?

332
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,830
I love reading Oscar Wilde...

333
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,730
but my very favorite book since
I was a child is "The Little Prince".

334
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,760
- Have you read it?
- Yes.

335
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,230
I love it.

336
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,700
Hail Mary.

337
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,210
Full of grace.

338
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,960
Tell me your sins.

339
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,920
Tell me...

340
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,910
I believe I am a bad person,

341
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,810
because I do bad things ...

342
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,420
And I thinking of ugly things that
are going to hurt Jesus a lot.

343
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,290
Is it a sin to be a homossexual?

344
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,860
Don't you worry.

345
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,880
It's not a sin?

346
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,850
I mean, it does constitutes
a sin, and a very grave one.

347
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,790
But you have nothing
to worry about.

348
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,200
You're not a homossexual, Mauricio.
How could you be a homossexual?

349
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,000
... Cry no more,

350
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,700
that from now on,

351
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,700
I will never...

352
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,800
... make you cry.

353
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Sleep and don't cry.

354
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,400
my sweet Jesus.

355
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,300
Sleep and don't cry.

356
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,500
My sweet love.

357
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,400
My girlfriend brought strange.

358
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,994
- What do you mean?
- We were making out, the usual stuff...

359
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:54,144
"Draw me a sheep ..."

360
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:23,764
"In the very moment when you
read this, whenever that is....

361
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:27,084
you can be sure
I'm thinking of you".

362
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,884
I made your favorite.

363
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,664
To us.

364
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:05,344
How are you feeling today?

365
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,404
How am I doing?

366
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:13,594
How are we doing?

367
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:17,704
Fine.

368
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,434
May I?

369
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:50,504
Otherwise he won't stop calling.

370
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:56,844
Don't take long or it will get cold.

371
00:37:58,154 --> 00:37:59,674
Do you want to?

372
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:02,434
Yes. Do you?

373
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,834
- But who does what?
- I'm doing you.

374
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:10,794
What if it hurts?
I better do you.

375
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,724
Fine.

376
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,934
Alright, if you want,
you can do me.

377
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:24,164
No?

378
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:27,904
Lower or what?

379
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:31,024
I think you need to be higher.

380
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:33,814
Try with the pillow.

381
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,424
Hold on, lift it up.

382
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:40,964
there, like that.

383
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,784
- There it is.
- Okay.

384
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,234
What?

385
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:56,804
- Easy, dude!
- I think it's not slipping in.

386
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:01,574
- Got any lube?
- No...

387
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:05,004
Some vaseline...
or cream?

388
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:18,724
- Be careful, please.
- Yes.

389
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,234
Wait.

390
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:33,614
- I think it's going in this time.
- Damn ...

391
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:40,194
It feels so good, but I don't
know if I'm hurting you.

392
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:44,084
It does hurt but I kind
a like it too.

393
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:46,744
Wait ...

394
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,154
- Try again.
- Wait, I'm going soft.

395
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:54,944
Fuck, it's so complicated.

396
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,664
Okay, there it goes...

397
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,614
- I like this very much.
- Me too.

398
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,784
- You're not liking it at all, are you?
- No.

399
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:22,244
But keep going.
I might get used to it.

400
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:33,394
Do you rather want me to
pull it out and jerk off?

401
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,134
Take it out and I'll kick
your ass, motherfucker.

402
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:45,964
Hey...

403
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,234
I want to tell you something,
but I'm a bit afraid.

404
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,364
Tell me...

405
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:56,854
I don't bite... I just fuck.

406
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,644
And really good.

407
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:05,644
I don't want you to
freak out, okay?

408
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:08,354
Oh, boy! What are you
gonna tell me?

409
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,954
That I'm falling in love with you.

410
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:22,064
Dude...

411
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,984
I thought you were going to
tell me something harsh...

412
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,284
like  "I don't like you anymore"
or something like that.

413
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:29,184
You're such a moron.

414
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,564
Not you're the moron.

415
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:34,924
You know what?

416
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,494
I'm falling in love with you too.

417
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:48,894
So, I'll bring the salt cod, mom...

418
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:51,274
but ask Marianna to
pick up the turkey.

419
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:53,434
Yes please, because
it's hard for me now.

420
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,264
Yes I'll go.

421
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,194
But the spaghetti
I'm making it for sure.

422
00:41:57,624 --> 00:42:00,174
So we agreed we're having
secret Santa, right?

423
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:01,664
Yes.

424
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,514
Fine, but you'll give something
to your grandkids, right?

425
00:42:05,714 --> 00:42:08,464
Just to little ones. We're going to
give money to the older ones.

426
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:12,084
Because, as I said told your dad, they
don't really like what they get.

427
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,514
Yes, mom. don't worry.
Some cash is fine.

428
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:16,964
Yes, some money is perfect.

429
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:20,844
Hey Dad, why are you so quiet?

430
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:24,694
Dad, why so quiet?

431
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,954
It's still a long time before
Christmas. Too long.

432
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:32,104
No wait. That's not what
your dad is excited about...

433
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:34,754
He's excited about
something else. Tell them.

434
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,754
What? What is it?

435
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:40,684
There's going to be a ceremony
to pay homage to him.

436
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,024
Oh, Dad!

437
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,414
Wow! They had taken
too long, though.

438
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:47,434
I bet they'll soon have more
ceremonies for you.

439
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,394
From your lips to God's ears.

440
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,504
And while he's still alive,
which is what matters.

441
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:52,824
Mom!

442
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,304
What's the point of doing it
afterwards, when they're dead?

443
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:58,454
- Mom!
- Don't you start crying.

444
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:00,924
Mom, where is
this happening?

445
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,704
At some University...

446
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:06,214
The University of... What?

447
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,334
- I wrote it down somewhere.
- Santa Catarina!

448
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,034
- Yes that's the one.
- Yes.

449
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:16,994
It is a very good college.

450
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:19,374
Very prestigious, right?

451
00:43:19,994 --> 00:43:21,444
- Sounds very good.
- Yes.

452
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:24,454
We'll be there with you, dad.
Count us in.

453
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,594
Hey ...

454
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:44,204
Just asking...

455
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:48,954
Are you guys a couple?

456
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:53,064
- What is that, fucker?
- Nothing, just saying...

457
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:56,914
I think it is pretty cool
when there is love.

458
00:43:57,314 --> 00:44:00,424
When there's fear it's not so cool.

459
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,644
But if you guys are gay, that's great.

460
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:06,004
- I 'm cool with...
- No, asshole.

461
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,434
Cut the crap.

462
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,964
Alright. No, then.

463
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:23,654
All I'm saying is why the
hell does he care?

464
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,074
I'm not saying anything.

465
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,774
- Listen, this isn't about you.
- I'm not saying it is.

466
00:44:30,394 --> 00:44:32,274
What is it Fito?

467
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:40,104
It just doesn't feel nice that when a friend
or ours notices and talks about it...

468
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,284
you get like this.

469
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:47,114
You and I talked about this already
I don't want anyone to know.

470
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:51,934
I know, Leo, that's why
I'm not complaining.

471
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:54,400
Do you really want
everyone to know?

472
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,000
So everywhere you go people will point
at you saying: "there goes the fag"?

473
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:04,700
- I don't know anymore.
- What do you mean?

474
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:07,000
I just do not know.

475
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,000
A lot has happened in the
last two weeks, Leo.

476
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,700
- I'm starting to see things differently.
- Anyway you put it...

477
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,300
Fine.

478
00:45:27,804 --> 00:45:29,474
Mom?

479
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:35,000
Could you turn down the volume
during the commercials?

480
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
What for, son?

481
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,300
I want to tell you something.

482
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,800
Mom.

483
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,000
Commercials...

484
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,200
I've been thinking a lot.

485
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
and with everything that has
happened, my dad and all that...

486
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, I don't like that there's stuff
I can talk to you about.

487
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm really scared about telling
you what I have to say...

488
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,300
Adolfo, please, don't.

489
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,000
What do you mean? What is it?

490
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,600
That what you have to tell me...

491
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,400
I beg you not to.

492
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,700
I don't understand.

493
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,700
Your dad is gone.

494
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,800
and there are certain things...

495
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,900
I can't handle by myself.

496
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,600
Things I don't like.

497
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,300
What should I do then?

498
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,900
Keep them for yourself...

499
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,600
and let me out of all that.

500
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,300
It's starting now.

501
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,100
I am here.

502
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
And I do want something
serious with you.

503
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,200
So do I, Sebastiבn.

504
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
But people are not like tissues which you
get to use and throw away just like that.

505
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,500
- Don't give me that bullshit.
- I've been with him for ten years now.

506
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,900
And how many of those
have been wort it?

507
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,300
But he asked me to give him time and
he's always been loyal with me.

508
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,380
I owe it to him.

509
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,700
You let me fall for you.

510
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,900
- Yes, I know. I'm an asshole.
- You didn't tell me you were with someone.

511
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,600
Alright, take your time.

512
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,100
But you know what? I'm a hot
guy and people come to me.

513
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,900
No, asshole. I'm just asking
you to give some time.

514
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,900
You are the asshole.

515
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,200
You can be with him...

516
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,000
and I have to be here, waiting
for you, like I'm your whore.

517
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,500
I'm sorry.

518
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Sebastiבn was upset that I
hadn't called him and...

519
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,700
- We had an agreement.
- I know, I know...

520
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,200
It won't happen again.

521
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,300
Promise?

522
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I promise.

523
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,050
Come to bed, here with me...

524
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,750
But take a shower first, you stink.

525
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,450
I've got the money.

526
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,150
I could only get fifteen
hundred pesos.

527
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:54,350
No, I told you two thousand.

528
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,050
- That's all I have.
- Then no.

529
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,650
You really have no idea.

530
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,750
You treat me like garbage...

531
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,050
But you don't know me.

532
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,400
I'm an important person.

533
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,850
People even hold ceremonies
to pay homage to me.

534
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,850
Don't be a jerk.

535
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,650
I got fifteen hundred.

536
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,550
But we'll do it my way.

537
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,750
Yes.

538
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,850
Let's go to the locker room
and I'll give it to you.

539
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,750
- But it will happen tomorrow.
- Why?

540
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,050
I just gave service. I can't do it
twice in a row. It hurts.

541
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:56,950
- I'll pay you tomorrow then.
- Look, man...

542
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,850
If you don't pay me today, I can't
warranty anything for tomorrow...

543
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,550
if somebody else comes before you.

544
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,350
Alright, then.

545
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,750
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

546
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,150
- My aunts are over there.
- So what?

547
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,050
If they see me here, what
am I supposed to say?

548
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,750
That you came to see a show.

549
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,850
- Yes, a show for gays.
- Of course not, don't be silly.

550
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,650
What if they tell my mom that
they saw me here, with you?

551
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,850
They are here. What are they?
Lesbians?

552
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,450
- I feel really uncomfortable.
- Just because they're over there.

553
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,450
Maybe for you this is dumb,
but it really frightens me.

554
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,950
- Well, what should we do then?
- Let's go.

555
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,450
But it hasn't even started yet.

556
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,650
This was supposed to be our celebration.
Besides it took me a lot to save for the tickets.

557
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,350
Are you seriously going
to mention the money?

558
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,850
You're not in a gay bar, it's a theater.

559
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,050
I don't want my family to suspect
anything, not even the tiniest clue.

560
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,450
And what's the point of staying
if I'm not going to enjoy it.

561
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,650
I'm uncomfortable.

562
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,550
Mom, did I do well?

563
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,650
You did very well.

564
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,550
Your aunt and uncle are here, Mau.
Would you open the door, please?

565
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,050
- Hi, Mauricio, how are you?
- Hi, uncle.

566
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,750
- Hello.
- How are you doing, boy?

567
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,350
- Hey, cousin!
- What's up?

568
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,850
I have something to show you.

569
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,050
I almost thought we were
gonna wait until breakfast.

570
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,700
What's up, boy?

571
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,550
My friend, what's up?

572
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,750
This is now how I imagined
this night would be.

573
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,450
My parents have worked really
hard to give me everything.

574
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,350
- And I will not upset then like this.
- Upset them...

575
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:36,050
I'm not ashamed about this.
I'm proud of being with you.

576
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,450
- I even told my mom already.
- What?

577
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,450
What did you tell her?

578
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,850
Why the fuck it is so hard for you to
understand that I don't want anyone to know.

579
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,550
I can't go back to your house now.

580
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,050
I hope your aunts don't come out right now so they
don't see the little gay husband scene you're making.

581
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,950
God dammit, motherfucker.
Stop pushing me.

582
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,950
I love you but I am not
going to hurt my family.

583
00:53:59,055 --> 00:54:01,850
I'm sorry, but I just won't.

584
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,650
How much was it? A thousand
for both, right?

585
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,050
Here.

586
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,400
So you're going to Quebec?

587
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,250
Yes, to spend Christmas with my mom...

588
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,950
and we're staying for
a few more days.

589
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,550
So you're spending New Year's Eve there?

590
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,350
Yes, we'll stay there for some
days, then we'll come back.

591
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,950
How nice.

592
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,650
-It's going to be pretty cold, right?
- That's true...

593
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,350
But with some wine we can
keep ourselves warm.

594
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,800
I've been asking and...

595
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,950
by Christmas, we'll be at least fifteen
or twenty degrees below zero.

596
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,150
No kidding!

597
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,550
- Guess what?
- What?

598
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,050
- Look! I got it.
- It's cool.

599
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,550
Do you want to play?

600
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,600
- No! How do you do it, dude?
- Pratice.

601
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,950
- This one is cool.
- Yes.

602
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,250
- You can borrow it if you want.
- No, I rather buy it later.

603
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,350
To be honest, I don't
play much. Take it.

604
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,550
But I don't know when
I could give it back to you.

605
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,850
It's fine. That way you'll get to pratice.

606
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,850
so you can beat me next time.

607
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,350
So, how's school?

608
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,550
Fine, I guess.

609
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,650
Hey...

610
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,750
Can I ask you something?

611
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,050
Do you know what
circuncision is?

612
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:05,350
- Are you circumcised?
- Yes.

613
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,050
I'm not.

614
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:14,050
So? Re-match?

615
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:23,850
Have you seen an
uncircumcised one?

616
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,750
Yes, at the club. In the showers.

617
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,350
I've never seen a
circumcised one.

618
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,050
Come on, let's play.

619
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,450
Hey...

620
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,450
Would you show it to me?

621
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,250
What for? Don't be a fag.

622
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,650
Just saying...

623
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,850
If I show mine,
you show me your?

624
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,850
Alright, then.

625
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,250
There.

626
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,750
Your turn.

627
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,550
Lock the door.

628
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,550
It's locked.

629
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,650
There it is.

630
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,250
Well, it looks prettier that way.

631
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,550
It's the same.

632
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,150
Hey...

633
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,950
Can I touch it?

634
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,100
Don't be a fag.

635
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,950
Look how it got.

636
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,850
You're such a fucking faggot.

637
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:22,250
If you want to do military service
before your time, you can.

638
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:23,750
That's what I did

639
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,850
- So, that's what they call "advanced".
- I did it at seventeen instead of eighteen.

640
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,950
That's advanced.

641
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:32,350
They call for your generation,
people born the same year as you.

642
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,650
But when he was told "turn left"...

643
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,550
- ...he went to the right.
- Of course.

644
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,650
"Of course", he say proudly.

645
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,250
But I wasn't the only one,
I felt protected.

646
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,350
I said very ugly things...

647
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:48,350
I was rude.

648
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,550
I freaked out and I didn't
know how to react.

649
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,950
Can you forgive me?

650
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,650
Well, yes.

651
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,650
My parents would prefer
me to be anything but a fag.

652
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,250
I get really scared.

653
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,250
We all get scared.

654
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,250
I've got an idea. Every year
my family throws a party...

655
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,650
lots of people come.

656
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,150
Would you like to come?

657
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,450
Are you awake?

658
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,100
Are you feeling alright?

659
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,950
Yes, why?

660
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,150
You've been restless all night.

661
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,650
I don't feel sleepy, that's all.

662
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:53,750
You've haven't been taking your medication,
you always forget about it.

663
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,350
It's because you're nervous, right?

664
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:02,450
is it about the homage?

665
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,950
Don't be silly, woman.

666
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:09,250
Sleep already, sleep.

667
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,700
Sweetie, do you love me?

668
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,050
You say such nice things to me.

669
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,650
Hi, Mau. How was your day?

670
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,650
Is the tie fine?

671
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,450
What a fancy party.

672
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,750
No, it won't work.

673
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,950
This one was your dad's

674
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:15,350
He was very good at choosing ties.

675
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,150
What time are they picking you up?

676
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,850
At 7.

677
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,050
It's already, isn't it?

678
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:16,050
It's 7:20, but I'm sure
they'll be here soon.

679
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,950
I'm not going out...

680
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,850
why don't you take the car
so you don't have to wait?

681
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,050
No.

682
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:30,150
They'll be here soon.

683
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,350
I've been waiting for you
for over two hours.

684
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,850
What took you so long?

685
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,750
I'm here now. Do we get
a room or what?

686
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:54,850
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go.

687
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,250
I liked it very much.

688
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:26,250
Next time, it's gonna
be two thousand.

689
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,350
And hurry up, I'll be gone soon.

690
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,250
I don't think I can get it.

691
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,450
You had it this time.

692
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,150
Yes...

693
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:41,150
but I paid you with the
money for my gandkids...

694
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,350
or their Christmas gifts.

695
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:52,750
What about you?
Where will you go?

696
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:59,750
I'm saving money to
get across the border.

697
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,050
My wife and my baby stayed there.

698
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,350
How come? Then...

699
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,050
You don't like men?

700
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,250
No.

701
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,500
- I think I should go now.
- No, no...

702
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,400
I need a favor.

703
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,600
I write, poetry.

704
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,000
And they're having a ceremony
to pay homenage to me.

705
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,400
The first one...

706
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,600
And the last.

707
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,700
Why?

708
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm sick, everything in my
body is shutting down.

709
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,400
What I want ask you is how much
would you change me to attend?

710
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,700
A thousand pesos.

711
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,300
Fine.

712
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,500
Then you go and, when it's finished...

713
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,900
I'll pay you.

714
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,100
No one can suspect a thing.

715
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,300
My wife and everyone
is going to be there.

716
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,700
And they can't know.

717
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,700
Alright, my friend. I get it.

718
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,100
Dear, It's almost 9.

719
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,300
Why don't you call then again?

720
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,100
Hello?

721
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,600
What's up? Yes, yes...

722
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,300
So, you're downstairs already?
Okay, I'll be right out. See you.

723
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,500
Mom, they're downstairs already.

724
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,400
I'm leaving now.

725
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,300
- Have fun.
- Bye. Thanks.

726
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,700
"I'm sorry".

727
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,100
Easy...

728
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:02,500
You're way too good for this.

729
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,600
If he isn't the one...

730
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,300
There's going to be someone else
who will appreciate you, son.

731
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,600
I will support you.

732
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,800
And I will accept
whomever you love.

733
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,200
But make sure he
loves you back.

734
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Because who doesn't love
you, doesn't deserve you.

735
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,600
Remember that.

736
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,700
This feels nice, doesn't it?
You, holding me tight.

737
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,500
I told you it was just
a matter of time.

738
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,900
I love you, kiddo.
I love you.

739
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,900
I love you too, so much...

740
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,700
I love it when you call me "kiddo".

741
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,800
I want you to make love to me.

742
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,900
As soon as we get home.

743
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,900
Hang on, let me brush my teeth.

744
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,900
Is everything alright?

745
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,200
Yes, everything's fine.

746
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:01,500
I just got a message from Sebastiבn
telling me something urgent came up.

747
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,500
Give me five minutes to
see what happened.

748
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,600
I just wanted to tell you
I'm with someone.

749
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,400
Why are you telling me this?

750
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,500
I thought it was fair to
let you know first.

751
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,800
You said you were going
to wait for me.

752
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,600
Come on, man, don't be an ass.
We agreed on something.

753
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,800
Go fuck yourself, you fucking
faggot, piece of shit!

754
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,900
I gotta go.

755
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,100
Don't you fuck him,
son of a bitch. Don't...

756
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,900
I'm fine, Andrיs...

757
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,700
- Calm down, please...
- I'm fine, Andrיs...

758
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,400
Andrיs, leave me alone! I'm fine...

759
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,600
Leave me alone!

760
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,400
- Fuck!
- Calm down!

761
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,900
Calm down already!
Calm down... Calm down...

762
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,500
Easy now, please...

763
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,800
He's a son of a bitch.

764
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,800
There... There...

765
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,500
Easy, please... Easy...

766
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,600
Calm down...

767
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,500
- Forgive me.
- Easy, Don't say anything...

768
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,100
I didn't know you had an
agreement with him to wait for you.

769
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,800
It was just an expression,
Andrיs. I was really pissed...

770
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,700
I'm going to take care of you...

771
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,700
I'm going to take a very
good care of you...

772
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,000
This is my home, isn't it?

773
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,800
This one right here, with you...

774
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,200
This is your home... I am your home.

775
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,900
I don't know how you can
love someone so stupid...

776
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,000
That's what I'm afraid of, Hugo...

777
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,800
That some day, just like
that, I'll run out of love...

778
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,500
That I won't know how
to love you anymore.

779
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,100
- Hey! How're you doing, dude?
- What's up?

780
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,700
- What's up?
- Not much, just hangin'...

781
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,400
What are you doing here? I thought
I was the only one who had to come.

782
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,900
No, me too.

783
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,100
Everyone else is on
vacation already...

784
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,300
Hey, have you seen Fito?

785
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,000
I think he's mad at me and I haven't
heard from him in a while...

786
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,800
I haven't seen him in a while...
Do you want some?

787
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,400
No.

788
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,200
I remember now, I just saw him...

789
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,900
- He's gay...
- Fito?

790
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,400
- What?
- He told us...

791
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,300
- He didn't tell you?
- No...

792
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,700
That's weird.

793
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,100
Yes, he came out of
the closet for good.

794
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,200
He goes to gay places now
and has new friends...

795
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,600
He's going out with a guy already.

796
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,400
It sucks, you know? Because I think
you guys made such a nice couple...

797
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,600
Oh, no, but you're not gay...
I was kidding, sorry.

798
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,100
No, you're straight, dude.

799
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,200
- Everything alright?
- Yes, yes...

800
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,700
- This one's cool, isn't it?
- Are you sure?

801
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,000
- Yes, I like it.
- No. I mean, who was that?

802
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,900
- Nobody.
- Sure?

803
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,100
Really, it was nobody.

804
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,800
"Exclusive intimate party (Men only)"

805
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,400
- What's wrong, Fito?
- Nothing...

806
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,300
You're not getting it because you
missed the soap opera yesterday.

807
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,300
And it will end this week.

808
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,100
What happened yesterday?

809
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,700
That dumb Rosita is
marrying Ricky...

810
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,400
But she doesn't love him.

811
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,700
How do you know?

812
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:50,800
because it's obvious,
you can tell...

813
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,900
She's still in love with Lalo...

814
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,200
That's why I don't like her...

815
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,200
She's very pretty but
sometimes she's really dumb.

816
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,700
And what's with that Ricky anyway?

817
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,300
She's with him just because
she doesn't want to be alone...

818
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,700
Poor thing...

819
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,400
But you'll see they're
getting back together.

820
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,500
And they better. I've been
here just for them...

821
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,800
those Lalo and Rosa...

822
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,700
They better end up together.

823
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,700
Morons...

824
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,100
Why do you go to the
men's restroom?

825
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,100
You should do to the
woman's, or fag's...

826
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,800
You went to the men's restroom to see if
you could grab it to someone, right?

827
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,100
Do you wanna grab it to me or
you rather jerk one them off?

828
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,200
I'm talking to you faggot.

829
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,300
You hear me, fag?

830
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Leave me alone...

831
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,000
- Leave me alone!
- Leave me alone, you said?

832
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,800
Let go me. Leave me!

833
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,800
Fucking faggot!

834
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,200
Oliver, did you hit him?

835
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,000
Yes.

836
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,900
But ask him why.

837
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,900
Why?

838
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,200
Why, son?

839
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,600
Because he's a fag...

840
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,500
He's a faggot, that's
why we hit him.

841
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,000
Why do you accuse him?
Why are you saying that?

842
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,300
Ask him. He knows why...

843
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,600
Mauricio, why is
Oliver saying that?

844
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,300
Tell them...

845
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,300
Tell them what you did to me
that day in your house.

846
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,800
Mauricio?

847
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,200
- I think we should end this now, shouldn't we?
- Yes, please. Can we...?

848
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
Mauricio!

849
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,000
He grabbed me, down there...

850
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,000
Tell then how you grabbed it,
all the stuff you were doing to me...

851
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,200
But he wanted it too...

852
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,100
Dad, he wanted it too...

853
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,200
Oliver, let's go.

854
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,500
- I already have the tickets for the play.
- That's good. Where do we meet?

855
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,900
If you want I can meet you there, because
I'm pretty close from the theater.

856
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,500
- Should we meet around 8?
- Sounds perfect.

857
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,500
- Okay, kisses.
- Bye.

858
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,500
It's an honor for us
to pay this homage,

859
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,700
humble yet very honest
to Professor Cobo,

860
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,600
- whom we admire and respect greatly.
- Thanks.

861
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,400
Here, at the University of Santa Catarina...

862
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:19,200
we believe he hasn't been given
the place he deserves...

863
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,800
amongst the greatest mexican authors.

864
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:24,300
That's why we're having this
ceremony in his honor...

865
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:28,420
so we can give recognition to
his work in our humble abode.

866
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,120
It makes me very proud...

867
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,000
to be able to read some of
his best-known poems,

868
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,000
like "Northen lights",
"The Caterpillar"...

869
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,100
" In Paradise"...

870
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,400
Oh, and a new one...

871
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,300
he wants to share with us tonight.

872
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,400
I have it here.

873
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:57,000
"Fly within, golden feathers that
follow the sun.

874
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,800
The one that never was. Sudden
night dressed in moons.

875
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,700
Feathers pour down as
they follow the sun.

876
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,500
Fly away, I will smile.

877
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:13,400
Anywhere. May it be North.
May it be East.

878
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,600
Anywhere as long
as you fly within me.

879
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,600
Fly away, golden feathers,
bits of sun.

880
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,000
Meanwhile I will dream.
The night is here.

881
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,300
May your wings not
fall while I sleep.

882
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,300
I love keeping you in.

883
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,400
Are we going to have dinner?

884
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,000
I'll be back in a minute...

885
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,600
Congratulations.

886
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,900
You bought it?

887
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,700
Sign it for me.

888
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,900
I don't know your name.

889
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,400
Gilberto.

890
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,400
I already have what I needed.
I'm leaving for Tijuana tomorrow.

891
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,900
- But we said...
- Its okay.

892
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,600
Thank you.

893
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,200
Thanks to you, man...

894
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,000
I will read it on the road.

895
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,100
Hיctor...

896
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:26,500
Mauricio is still in pain...

897
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,400
- I don't know if we should...
- Leave him.

898
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,300
Why?

899
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,500
He's fine...

900
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,800
- Let him hurt.
- How can you say that?

901
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,500
Look at the big deal you're making
about a fucking headache.

902
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,600
That's why he's a fag, because
of those things you do.

903
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,500
Hיctor, you should sleep now.

904
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,500
I really can't hear you say that.

905
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,000
Hello? Hi.

906
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,100
It's one hundred pesos.

907
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,900
Your name?

908
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,400
Javi... Javier.

909
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,700
Let's get out of here.

910
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,700
I've got something to do
and I really have to go.

911
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,100
Why did you come then?

912
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,900
To get out of here. Let's go.
Seriously. I have to go.

913
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,100
And then?

914
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,300
You're going to leave.

915
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,800
I really have to go.
And so do you.

916
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,300
Please, do it for me.

917
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,000
Ask me to be your boyfriend
and then yes...

918
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,100
I will go with you anywhere you want.

919
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,800
You, imbecile...

920
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,800
Alright, stop.

921
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,000
Stop now, dude. Stop now.

922
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,800
- Didn't you hear him say stop?
- No, no...

923
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,800
No, no, no. Don't...

924
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,400
Andrיs...

925
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,300
I had a problem. Please,
come pick me up.

926
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,300
Alright...

927
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,000
No, he's lying down
but he can't sleep.

928
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,600
No, he doesn't have a
fever, he's just in pain.

929
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,100
Very well...

930
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,600
and, if it doesn't I'll call
you again, yes...

931
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,300
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Have a good night.

932
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,200
What did he say?

933
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,900
We have to give him some
medication and ...

934
01:33:56,901 --> 01:33:59,400
see how he's feeling in
the morning.

935
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,100
Give it to me.

936
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,500
Give it to me, I'll go...

937
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,500
Andrיs...

938
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,000
I'm home...

939
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,300
Are you feeling better?

940
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,600
Well...

941
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,400
Keep resting...

942
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,300
Mom?

943
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,700
Why are you crying?

944
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,900
You are sad because I am
like this, aren't you?

945
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,300
No, no...

946
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,100
No, I swear.

947
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,900
I love you any way you are.

948
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,900
Is my dad very angry?

949
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,500
With me?

950
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,400
No...

951
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,500
He's angry but...

952
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:04,100
He doesn't know with whom.

953
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,000
Not with you.

954
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,300
Give him some time.

955
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,800
Your aunt's!

956
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,700
Bravo!

957
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,600
Unwrap it! Unwrap it!

958
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,400
- How nice.
- Wear it...

959
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,000
Wear it... Eat it...

960
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,900
Mauricio!

961
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:12,000
Mauricio!

962
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,300
Come here...

963
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,700
Listen to me.

964
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,200
About what happened, I don't
want it to happen to you again.

965
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,500
I don't want you to be the
first one to punch either...

966
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,500
But if they do it, you have to learn
how to defend yourself, okay?

967
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,700
- Listen...
- Don't speak. Hit it...

968
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,300
Harder.

969
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,700
No, look...

970
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:53,900
This is face of the one
who punched you.

971
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,000
Like that.

972
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,200
What's up?

973
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,400
- I want you to be with me again...
- I can't.

974
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,800
- Because you're with that guy?
- I can't because I can't...

975
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,900
Because I just don't feel
like hiding anymore.

976
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,900
I miss you very much, Fito.

977
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,300
You miss me because you
saw me with someone else.

978
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,900
I came here to invite you to
have dinner at my house.

979
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,700
Thank you, but no, thanks.

980
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,000
I won't let you down...

981
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:39,100
I told them already.

982
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,500
- And what happened?
- They didn't throw a party about it...

983
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,900
And there were a couple
awkward days, but...

984
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,900
My mom knows she has to place one
more plate on the table for you.

985
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,400
Thanks.

986
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,800
There is one condition, though...

987
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,200
That I want to introduce
you as my boyfriend.

988
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,500
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

989
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,300
Do people still say that?

990
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,500
You're such an asshole...

991
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,900
You know I do.

992
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:49,100
Good morning, Love.

993
01:44:57,270 --> 01:45:13,300
4 MOONS.

994
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,500
For TRAPI (My House),
With all My Love.
