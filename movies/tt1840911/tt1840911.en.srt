2
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:15,724
Go, girls!

3
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:55,815
What are you up to?

4
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,696
- Let me go.
- What are you up to?

5
00:02:58,335 --> 00:02:59,295
What are you up to, kid?

6
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:01,690
He's robbing him!

7
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:06,284
Get outta here.

8
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,364
Are you alright?

9
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,129
This is yours.

10
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,087
Oh, fuck. Thanks.

11
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,486
- Take it easy.
- Careful.

12
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,047
Up. That's it.

13
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:28,292
I'll call him now. Dad.

14
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,723
He's always the same.

15
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:32,688
Your father can't let it go.

16
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:36,294
- Do you think Bruno's coming?
- I'll call him now.

17
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,414
What do you bet
the bad guy's still alive?

18
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,255
What? They stuck
an iron bar in his chest,

19
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:54,650
shot him
and threw a bomb at him.

20
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

21
00:03:58,335 --> 00:03:59,165
What's up?

22
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:04,766
Hi.

23
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:07,531
What's up?

24
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,769
This is the good bit.

25
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,887
- What's up, Rai?
- What's up, kid?

26
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:18,209
- You alright?
- Just a bit woozy.

27
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,087
Sure you don't want to
go to hospital?

28
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,774
No, I just want to call my girl.

29
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
I'll charge your mobile.
But get that cut cleaned?

30
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,089
Want me to bring you back
an "ensaimada"?

31
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:42,795
What?

32
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,567
I'm going to lbiza tomorrow
to cover the electronic festival.

33
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,735
- I could get you an "ensaimada".
- Wait a second.

34
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:48,771
We're in the red, Dani.

35
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:51,051
- This is no good.
- I'm not getting you anything.

36
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,890
Relax, I'm DJ-ing next week.

37
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,006
- 'Bye.
- I'll pay back the money.

38
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,885
Shit! Anyone heard from Bruno?

39
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,164
Did he call here?

40
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,055
Weren't you having lunch
with your parents?

41
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,048
Yes, but we waited an hour
and he didn't turn up.

42
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,291
- It's weird.
- No, it's called being stood up.

43
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,125
You think your girl's mad at you?

44
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:20,252
No, but I bet she's worried.

45
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,164
It's her parents that'll be
fucking pissed off.

46
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,843
- Do you know them?
- Yeah.

47
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,410
Carla and I have been together
since we were 16

48
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,048
and shacked up for 3 years.

49
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
But they live in Sitges
and I hardly ever seen them.

50
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,450
- Her dad can't stand me.
- Why?

51
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,213
He'd rather Carla went out
with an architect or something.

52
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,326
- He's French.
- Fuck him.

53
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,366
The bad thing is
they're in Barcelona today.

54
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:52,127
- And they've taken over your place.
- Well, it's actually "their" flat.

55
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,134
Fuck.

56
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:57,768
If I were you,
I wouldn't go there tonight.

57
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,449
I've got to apologize in person.

58
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:03,931
Stop it, Mum,
you're worrying me even more.

59
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,852
Guess where I'm going tomorrow!

60
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,533
To lbiza, to cover the festival.

61
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,329
And to get away from you,
It's as if we're an item.

62
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,849
Chill out, it's all-expenses-paid.

63
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,366
If you leave home
and check in together,

64
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:24,806
probably on the plane
you'll be sitting... together.

65
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,729
Fuck no! Not lbiza!

66
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,374
We'll talk later, okay?

67
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:33,565
Hello?

68
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,449
Yeah, Bruno.

69
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,046
She's right here.
I'll put her on.

70
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:40,411
'Bye.

71
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:43,525
- What happened to you?
- You wouldn't believe me.

72
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,010
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

73
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:50,493
No, no. I feel bad that you
had to take the fallout alone.

74
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:55,131
Alright.

75
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:57,691
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,247
'Bye. Big kiss.

77
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,091
Everything okay?

78
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,047
I've got an amazing girlfriend.

79
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,611
She says not to go home tonight
to avoid a row with her parents.

80
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,564
Stay here if you like.

81
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,448
No, I've bothered you enough.

82
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,892
People crash here every day.

83
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:19,615
I am getting tired.

84
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:22,887
I don't know if it's the bump
or the spliff.

85
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,655
Here.
In case you want to change.

86
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:33,604
Thanks.

87
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:50,814
Fine, alright. See you later.

88
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,212
Your father.
He's tied up at the meeting.

89
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,848
We're not to wait up.

90
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,414
If I'd known that...

91
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,935
First he stands us up for dinner,
now he's not even coming.

92
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:06,724
He's working.
Bruno's the one who's got a nerve.

93
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,368
He lives here in our house,

94
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,890
and doesn't say hello
or even apologize.

95
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:12,494
Mum, he had an accident.

96
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,731
Yes, as if I believe that.

97
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,532
He just doesn't want to see us.

98
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:24,850
Don't start.

99
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:29,084
- What's that pill for?
- To sleep. I've got insomnia.

100
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,248
You? You sleep like a log!

101
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,252
Because I take the pill.

102
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,408
It's for depression.

103
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,492
You always struck me as...

104
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:46,489
melancholic.

105
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:53,648
He won't let it go.
That's good reflexes.

106
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,928
He's really cute.

107
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,813
Grab it, he'll burn himself.

108
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,005
What are you people doing here?

109
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,365
Daddy, she's naked.

110
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,691
Guys, guys, get up!

111
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,124
Let's call the police.

112
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,206
Rai! Rai!

113
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,691
Rai, c'mon. We've got to go.

114
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,573
- What's going on?
- The cops are coming.

115
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,208
Hey, wake up!

116
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:09,565
Shit, let's go!

117
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,886
Hey, let's go.

118
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,132
Hey, Rai, help me!

119
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:24,456
Maria, take her on you bike.

120
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:25,207
Go!

121
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,536
We gotta go, the cops are coming.

122
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,571
- What do I do?
- Take that.

123
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,289
Out the window!

124
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,732
Wait, wait, wait.

125
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:53,604
I'm getting the Metro.

126
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:58,733
Well, we say goodbye here.

127
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,689
I'd ask you home,
but you know how things are.

128
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,044
Relax.

129
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,524
I'll take a walk around.

130
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,771
When I get a mobile, I'll call you
and give you back the T-shirt.

131
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,931
It's a gift... but call me.

132
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,254
And get that cut seen to.

133
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:20,169
Hey, would you mind
changing neighbourhoods?

134
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,928
- What?
- Follow me.

135
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,094
Let's go.

136
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,851
We pay them the months we owe
or they throw us out.

137
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:32,808
- It's not my fault.
- I'm sick of telling people.

138
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,886
We publish a free college rag,

139
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:37,853
we're almost broke,
but he wants it all high-quality,

140
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,647
the printing, whatever.

141
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,407
Plus we buy tickets to lbiza,

142
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,203
the magazine goes belly up,
and I look like the bad guy.

143
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,326
Where are the cartridges
for the printer?

144
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,090
Marta's got them.

145
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,008
- Why do you want them?
- Why else? To print.

146
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,735
Yes, but is it for personal use?

147
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,290
Shit, it's for college.

148
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,974
I don't earn a cent here

149
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,927
and you tell me
I can't use the printer?

150
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:03,695
We've only got two cartridges left
and we won't get any more!

151
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,363
From now on, the money
comes out of our pockets.

152
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:09,486
They say we're stingy,

153
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,811
but you're not from here
and you're such a tightwad.

154
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,573
- People are living here. Let's go.
- Carla?

155
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:49,327
Let's go!

156
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,366
I'm at Adrian and Dani's place.

157
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,454
You bastard.

158
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,569
No, I haven't seen them.

159
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,572
They must've gone to lbiza.

160
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,372
Yeah, through the patio door,

161
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,293
the one they're always about to fix.

162
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,493
No, I'm with a friend.

163
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,529
Yes, the one who helped me.

164
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:16,127
He's flat-hunting, so I thought
he could stay here meanwhile.

165
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:22,924
Hold on.

166
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:25,291
Don't look at me like that.
What can I do?

167
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,133
Just give me one.

168
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,890
Who where you talking to?

169
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,846
Why'd you cover the phone again?

170
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:45,484
Yeah, I bet he's flirting
with you, as usual.

171
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,445
Don't get mad. I just wanted to know
if your parent's had gone.

172
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,566
Fine, Yeah, yeah. 'Bye.

173
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,454
Jealousy.

174
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,168
I don't think she's cheating on me.

175
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,567
What bugs me is that
she might fancy other guys.

176
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,887
Does that happen to you?

177
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,609
Yes.

178
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,933
But I put up with it.
Otherwise, what's love all about?

179
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,045
It's about sharing ideas...

180
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,925
wishes, experiences.

181
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,813
But it doesn't put limits
on your life.

182
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:21,656
Still less on the lives of others.

183
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:26,205
But if there are no limits,
you're not a real partner...

184
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,128
just another person.

185
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,963
The couple should find
their own limits.

186
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,651
Sticking to the typical rules
doesn't improve the relationship.

187
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,250
That's what I think.

188
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,169
In a couple you have to be
special for the other person.

189
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,569
That's something else.

190
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:45,610
You and I...

191
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,009
We just met...

192
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,647
and you're already special to me.

193
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,605
When couples hide things,
it's all over.

194
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:04,335
Your father knows I'm depressed,
I don't hide anything from him.

195
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,253
Mum, you should live your own life.

196
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,446
He does,
and without considering you.

197
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:10,134
He's just busy all the time.

198
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,893
Yes, with another woman.

199
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:14,893
The woman you're talking about
is his architect, that's all.

200
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,608
Why don't you separate?

201
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:18,814
And be left alone?

202
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,767
Mum, you're already alone.

203
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,249
That's not true.

204
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,767
Your father and I love each other.

205
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,008
What's up?

206
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:32,244
Marta said you were here
with your mother.

207
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:33,650
Let me see...

208
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,610
- It's sexy.
- Yeah.

209
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:39,884
Hello, Nuria.

210
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:42,726
Forgive me...

211
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,050
for yesterday.

212
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:44,892
Hello, Bruno.

213
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,690
- What happened to you?
- Mum, I told you!

214
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,125
I'm sorry. I fainted,
I lost my mobile...

215
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,853
No, please. Forgive "me".

216
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,816
I thought it was an excuse
not to see us.

217
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:56,965
I love seeing you.

218
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,053
- Where's Gerard?
- Busy.

219
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,814
What are you doing?

220
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:44,765
Wait, no.

221
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:47,525
Wait.

222
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:49,285
Wait, no.

223
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:05,210
Morning, babe.

224
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,643
Good morning.

225
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,166
You do me in two minutes,
and it's goodbye?

226
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,206
When you're in a hurry,
you do the same thing.

227
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,610
Where are you going?

228
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,615
To fix breakfast.
I want to study.

229
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,726
- I've got an exam next month.
- Next month!

230
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:31,450
Yes, my scholarship's at stake,
not like some people.

231
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:34,211
Stay.

232
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,407
One, two, three!

233
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:54,808
One, two, three!

234
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,567
One, two, three!

235
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,130
More focus!

236
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,088
One, two, three!

237
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:04,172
With a yell!

238
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,764
One, two, three!

239
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,807
One, two, three!

240
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:13,365
Focus!

241
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,003
Ready position!

242
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:19,815
Stance with feet out!

243
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,534
- Hi.
- How are you?

244
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,493
Carla really wants to meet you.

245
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:44,364
She's with a friend now,
so we'll hook up later.

246
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,253
I don't feel like going out.

247
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:13,964
No, that doesn't cut it.

248
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:15,731
Let's go!

249
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,496
Let's leave it right there, okay?

250
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,566
But you followed me
all over the island!

251
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,533
And on the beach? You turned up
with your thingy in the air.

252
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,651
- They said it was a nudist beach.
- Nudist...

253
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:12,209
- Hi.
- Hey, Bruno.

254
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:17,973
- How are you?
- Great.

255
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,450
- Hi.
- You must be Rai.

256
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:20,849
- How are you?
- I'm Dani.

257
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,648
And you're... Adrian.

258
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:25,571
Thanks for the place.
I'll get my stuff and go.

259
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,323
There's no need.
Stay as long as you like.

260
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:31,124
We can empty the junk room,
right, Adrian?

261
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,373
Yes. Why not?

262
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:34,690
Thanks a lot.

263
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:36,813
Is she serious?

264
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,088
No, we'd love to.

265
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:43,371
Okay, we'll talk later.

266
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,294
See you soon. Thanks.

267
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,286
Yes!

268
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,811
We're doing a piece
on Virginia Dalmau.

269
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,694
- Can I take shots of her?
- Sure!

270
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,208
They say she's got a temper...

271
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,406
I love her!
She's such a diva, such a queen.

272
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,170
Why the long face?

273
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,173
This may be our last article,

274
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,569
do you realize that?

275
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,887
We'll have to close before summer.

276
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,486
The boss of the film distributor
that asked us to do the report

277
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:10,244
on Dalmau's movie was my boss
on the last paper I worked for.

278
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,491
And he says...

279
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:15,569
he's interested in investing
in our magazine.

280
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:16,235
What?!

281
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,565
But only if he likes the article,

282
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,369
especially the photos,
so there's a lot at stake.

283
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:41,254
Are you sure your friend's coming?
Otherwise I'm ditching the high heels.

284
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,207
I know all the Journalism students.

285
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,135
Yeah? And you don't want to
do any of them again?

286
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,133
I'm the "mojito" king!

287
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,172
So, are you dressed to kill?

288
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:54,487
Yes, but don't worry,
you're not on my list.

289
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,454
Fine, and don't get your hopes up.

290
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:06,286
Hello.

291
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:09,250
Hello, Carla.

292
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:11,372
Rai?

293
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,288
- How are you doing?
- Good.

294
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,450
Nice to meet you.

295
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:17,491
- This is Maria.
- Nice to meet you.

296
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,975
- Carla, Bruno's girlfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

297
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,053
- Rai!
- Hey there!

298
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,893
- How are you doing?
- Great.

299
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,369
- How's your eyebrow?
- Fine.

300
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,886
- Bruno.
- Maria, you're still alive.

301
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:33,771
- This is Carla, my girlfriend.
- Yes, we've been introduced.

302
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:35,846
- Want to put your things away?
- Yes.

303
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,966
- Hey, how are you?
- Great.

304
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,448
I just fell in love.

305
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:42,890
Introduce him to me.

306
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:46,048
Hold on, they just got here.
I'll introduce you later.

307
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,207
- Like the place?
- Yeah.

308
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,409
He's coming, he's coming.

309
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,326
- For you.
- For me?

310
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:07,965
It's Berlin, I was dancing there
with a friend.

311
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,848
I don't know what to say.

312
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:12,411
Like it?

313
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,004
Of course! Thanks.

314
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:17,851
I saw some of your photos
in the magazine.

315
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,770
Most are just decoration.

316
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,843
Sometimes I put in
more personal ones.

317
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,693
You've got a special style.

318
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:27,805
I like it.

319
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:37,934
Your girlfriend's very cute.

320
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,446
You should watch out.

321
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:44,814
Yeah, so should you,
You're a bit wasted.

322
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:48,408
Not wasted enough.

323
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:27,928
Is she drunk, or what?

324
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,409
- Maria, are you okay?
- Yes.

325
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:33,885
Let's go home.

326
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:35,371
Shall we?

327
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,610
Rai's wicked.

328
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,809
Marta's crazy about him,
and so am I.

329
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:41,324
Oh, yeah?

330
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:48,372
Guys, we're going.
She's spinning out.

331
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:49,775
I'll take her on her bike.

332
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,089
Is she his girlfriend?

333
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:58,207
They did go out,
but now they're just friends.

334
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:01,011
Look.

335
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:10,133
You're getting off with Adrian!

336
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,572
Oh, fuck.
They forgot their helmets.

337
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:28,605
The helmets. Wait here.

338
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:38,531
Thanks.

339
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:43,488
I like Carla.
She's a fucking great girl.

340
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,088
It sucks that you have to go.

341
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,014
You can see the shape Maria's in.

342
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,084
We didn't get a chance
to hang out together.

343
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:31,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:34,573
I came to give you back
the T-shirt you lent me.

345
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,002
I gave it to you.
But if you don't want it...

346
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:48,172
I made some coffee.

347
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:53,689
How's Maria?

348
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,089
Not too good.

349
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:58,363
She takes too much shit.

350
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:02,488
I convinced her to go to
a country house her sister's got.

351
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:09,411
Come in.

352
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:12,209
No, I'm going. I'm in a hurry.

353
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:19,889
Listen, Rai...

354
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:23,051
- About yesterday...
- Don't worry.

355
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:24,528
It won't happen again.

356
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:29,768
Unless you want it to.

357
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:23,567
Yes, put the green one on him.

358
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:30,087
It's all under control.

359
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:33,366
It better be. You've no idea
how neurotic Virginia is,

360
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:34,523
and how bossy!

361
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:35,855
She's only missing a willy.

362
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,603
Yes! No, we'll wait.

363
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,362
That's right.

364
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:43,371
Thanks.

365
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:45,053
See you soon. 'Bye.

366
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,850
Virginia won't be here
for three hours or more.

367
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:53,964
Shit! Why's that?

368
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:55,766
She's a diva.
What did you expect?

369
00:28:55,974 --> 00:28:58,124
I might go to the pool
and see Bruno.

370
00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:00,325
I've been wanting to take
some photos of him swimming.

371
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,205
Go on.

372
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:06,889
Shall we have some coffee
and talk about the meeting?

373
00:29:07,654 --> 00:29:09,963
Listen, just because we got off
the other day

374
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:11,766
doesn't mean we're an item.

375
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:12,571
Okay?

376
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,288
You're an idiot!

377
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,530
I wanted to get off with Rai,

378
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,531
but he split, I was horny...

379
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:26,685
Next time you're horny,
use your fingers.

380
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:54,572
Look at that guy swim.
Those arms!

381
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:57,808
His arms around you
must be... Olympic.

382
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,049
Look.

383
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:11,284
- We'll wait for him outside. Hurry!
- Relax.

384
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,971
While he's in the shower
we can enjoy the world of sports.

385
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,290
Did he go out some other way?

386
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:32,007
Hang on.
I'll see if he's still inside.

387
00:31:56,054 --> 00:31:57,009
What's wrong?

388
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:02,122
They were together.

389
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,493
Together? Who?

390
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:06,372
Bruno and Rai...

391
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:08,613
in the shower.

392
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:09,884
But...

393
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,450
Don't tell anyone, please.

394
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:20,606
The photo session with Virginia!

395
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,883
Don't forget!

396
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,003
Yes.

397
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:33,411
No, I realize that.
No way, impossible.

398
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:36,770
Yes. I'm asking you, please...

399
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:38,089
Alright, alright.

400
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,489
Alright, alright.

401
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:42,093
Thanks. 'Bye.

402
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:44,612
What the fuck happened?

403
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,206
Virginia's agent says
the photographer stood her up.

404
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:50,970
Where's Carla?
I hope she's in the hospital.

405
00:32:51,174 --> 00:32:52,050
Watch it.

406
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,652
We tried the hospital excuse
on Virginia

407
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,414
- and she didn't buy it.
- She tore strips off me.

408
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,610
The magazine depends on this job
and she can't even call!

409
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:01,644
What's her deal?

410
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,733
She should ask herself
if she really wants to stay with us.

411
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:06,934
No, we should ask ourselves
if we want her to stay.

412
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,922
She's going through
some tricky personal stuff.

413
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:12,090
- Oh, yeah? You don't say!
- Yes.

414
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,568
And it's pretty heavy.

415
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,286
But I can't tell you.

416
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:22,283
Are you a homosexual?

417
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:23,603
No, I'm not a homosexual.

418
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:26,806
Bruno, this is rough on me
but you have to accept it.

419
00:33:27,094 --> 00:33:29,369
Carla, I like women.
I like you!

420
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:32,334
- Are you fooling me or yourself?
- No, I'm telling you the truth.

421
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:33,531
I love you.

422
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:35,770
Why didn't you tell me
if you love me so much?

423
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:38,888
Didn't you think about me?
About us?

424
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:43,524
I've put up with your fucking jealousy
all my life,

425
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,611
and now you cheat on me!

426
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:48,487
- Piss off!
- Fuck... I'm sorry.

427
00:33:49,414 --> 00:33:51,291
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy.

428
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:55,091
I didn't plan any of this.

429
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,406
But I couldn't help it either.

430
00:33:59,334 --> 00:33:59,971
I don't know.

431
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,611
I thought about not seeing Rai,
but I felt this unbearable anxiety.

432
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,771
You sound like you're in love.

433
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:08,213
No, this Rai thing is different.

434
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:11,004
He's my friend.
I need to see him!

435
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:14,327
It's like a drug.

436
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:15,930
Is it sexual?

437
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:21,130
Yes, it's sexual.

438
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:24,805
Look, if I keep seeing him,
I'll get over it, and then...

439
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,163
Then what?

440
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:28,367
You fall for another guy?

441
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:29,973
I told you, I'm not interested
in other guys!

442
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:32,130
- How do you know?
- This Rai thing is different!

443
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:39,088
It's not just sexual.

444
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:45,369
You've fallen in love.

445
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:47,565
No, I'm in love with you.

446
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:51,893
I want to stay with you.

447
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,090
Then don't see him again.

448
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:02,524
If you love me,
don't see him anymore.

449
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,289
I promise.

450
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,966
- Hi.
- Hi.

451
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:34,092
This is too heavy.

452
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,284
It's fucking up my life,
and my head.

453
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,607
Carla's the most
important thing to me.

454
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:48,326
She's where I belong.

455
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,765
We can't see each other any more.

456
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,244
Okay.

457
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:01,208
Okay, take it easy.

458
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:09,729
I couldn't.

459
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:10,885
What?

460
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:14,489
I tried to, but I couldn't.

461
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:24,645
Get your things and go.

462
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,687
Fold you T-shirts right,
or they take up more space.

463
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:52,850
I know I have to go,
but I already miss you.

464
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:57,173
Where will you go?
What'll you do?

465
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,205
- Do you need money?
- No, no...

466
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:01,604
I just need one thing.

467
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:03,969
- Please hug me...
- No, no! Go!

468
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,164
Hello.

469
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,454
Couldn't keep your mouth shut?

470
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,282
I was sticking up for you.

471
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:38,609
Forgive me.

472
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,682
If you couldn't work,
you should've said so.

473
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,328
We would've worked it out.

474
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:46,165
What happened is very serious, Carla.

475
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:48,174
We work on the magazine
for the love of art,

476
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:50,046
and we do what we can to get by.

477
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,728
We had a great chance,
but it's gone.

478
00:38:55,694 --> 00:38:59,607
I'll call the distributor.
I'll talk to Virginia somehow.

479
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,163
I'm sorry...

480
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,370
but don't turn your backs on me now.

481
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,130
Don't you leave me too.

482
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:10,526
No one's turning their back on you.

483
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:15,924
Where's Bruno? At your place?

484
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:16,850
No.

485
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,931
When we said we'd kicked Rai
out of the flat, he got mad and left.

486
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:23,012
- Where to?
- We don't know.

487
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:24,768
He won't answer his phone.

488
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:26,852
You should forget Bruno.

489
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,774
He's out of the closet now,
so there'll be no stopping him.

490
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:31,164
Give it time.

491
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:33,524
Come here.

492
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,970
My sister and her family
only come on some weekends.

493
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,253
Stay as long as you like.

494
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:12,486
This is beautiful, Maria.

495
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:15,449
Yeah, beautiful, and very boring.

496
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:17,292
That's before we got here.

497
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:33,607
What do you think?
It's the perfect place to study.

498
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:35,167
Even the phone's out of range.

499
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:43,883
Do you regret it?

500
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:45,692
And what'll you do here?

501
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,173
We're in this together, right?

502
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,845
And I'll keep Maria under control.

503
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:53,405
But you need to work.

504
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:56,485
I told you,
the gym gave me a week.

505
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:58,209
Then we'll see.

506
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,893
Besides, Barcelona's close by.

507
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:07,764
What's wrong?

508
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,291
I'm all mixed up.
About Carla and about you.

509
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:32,333
What I don't get is that
you didn't notice he was gay.

510
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:33,888
Mind you, he isn't camp at all.

511
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:37,453
We've always been great sexually.

512
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,726
And guys can't fake orgasms.

513
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,164
Then it's obvious: He's bisexual.

514
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:46,767
I really turn him on,

515
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:49,051
but if he needs to be with a guy

516
00:42:49,414 --> 00:42:50,733
and I'm not a guy...?

517
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:52,526
Since you're so open,

518
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:54,491
let him have the occasional fling,

519
00:42:54,894 --> 00:42:55,963
and that's that.

520
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,523
Are you making fun of me?

521
00:42:58,254 --> 00:43:00,404
No, but you say you're so liberal...

522
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,094
and in the end,
you're like everybody,

523
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:03,527
you can't stand infidelity.

524
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:04,883
It's not the same thing!

525
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:07,369
Sleeping around is not the same

526
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:09,405
as being with the same guy.

527
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,768
So for you, his mistake was
sticking to the same guy.

528
00:43:13,614 --> 00:43:15,047
All this isn't going to fit!

529
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:17,210
You brought too many clothes.

530
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:19,093
It's only a few days.

531
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:22,167
I'm going for a walk.

532
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:25,126
- I'll come with you.
- No, Rai.

533
00:43:25,294 --> 00:43:26,647
I'd rather be alone.

534
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,854
I think this game
is slipping through your fingers.

535
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:38,929
What game?

536
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,691
I know you.
It's seduction than turns you on...

537
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:45,814
and by now
you must be tired of it.

538
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:48,607
- What if I'm not tired of it?
- That's worse.

539
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:52,132
You're miserable.
I don't recognize you.

540
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:53,932
I'm the same as ever.

541
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:56,327
I'm not so sure.

542
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,723
I've never seen you worried
about one of your lovers.

543
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:02,806
Sure, I only have to worry
about you, right?

544
00:44:30,174 --> 00:44:31,926
I'm sorry, I'm busy!

545
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,172
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.

546
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:36,490
- Did something happen to Bruno?
- No, relax.

547
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,254
We're with Maria in the country.

548
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:42,451
- He doesn't know I came to see you.
- I've got nothing to say to you!

549
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:49,323
I think you do.

550
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,973
Just give me one minute.

551
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:00,809
Please.

552
00:45:25,134 --> 00:45:26,249
Alright...

553
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:51,209
Shift your leg.

554
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:54,249
Does it hurt?

555
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:55,844
Here?

556
00:45:56,974 --> 00:45:58,123
It starts here.

557
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,163
Leave me alone!

558
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:24,574
You and Bruno love each other.

559
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:29,289
- Why are you apart?
- What do you care?

560
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:31,253
Are you bored with him?

561
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,052
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

562
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:37,374
It hurts me to see him so down.

563
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:38,729
He misses you.

564
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:46,244
You're asking me to take him back?

565
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:47,443
Yes.

566
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:49,572
And you? Would you disappear?

567
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:52,443
We'd carry on as before.

568
00:46:54,414 --> 00:46:55,927
If you hadn't seen us together,

569
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,127
would Bruno have seemed
any different to you?

570
00:46:58,334 --> 00:46:59,369
Of course not.

571
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:01,332
So I'm not taking anything from you.

572
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:05,524
Think about it.

573
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:13,450
Hi.

574
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:28,364
<i>You and I are free,
I believe in you and me,</i>

575
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:30,929
<i>Come back...</i>

576
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:54,009
This isn't healthy, girl.

577
00:47:55,094 --> 00:47:56,607
I'm taking you out tonight,

578
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,691
If I have to drag you by the hair!

579
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:10,048
I can't take any more.

580
00:48:11,414 --> 00:48:13,882
Four days and not a trace
of that prick.

581
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,084
Forget him.

582
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:19,082
How? Every step I take
I find something of his.

583
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:24,534
His tracksuit! His books!

584
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,527
His travel card! His lD card!

585
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,044
It's like he's here but he's not!

586
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:34,054
He won't come back
or take his stuff away!

587
00:48:36,854 --> 00:48:38,446
I'm going crazy!

588
00:48:38,934 --> 00:48:41,135
If he hasn't come back for it,
he doesn't care about it.

589
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:43,333
So you shouldn't.

590
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:45,889
Let's throw all his stuff out!

591
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,929
- Where are the garbage bags?
- Don't go overboard.

592
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,725
How can I do that to him?

593
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,768
There's a new bar with great music.

594
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,688
I know one of the barmen.
He'll stand us a drink.

595
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,286
I don't need Bruno for anything.

596
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:33,445
The best thing
is a good clean-out.

597
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,726
Get away from negative stuff.

598
00:49:35,894 --> 00:49:38,010
Don't get carried away by feelings.

599
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:41,970
Taxi!

600
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:49,729
I'm going home. Sorry.

601
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:52,528
- Are you sure?
- I feel like a quiet night.

602
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:56,167
But you have fun. Don't worry.

603
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:18,654
Have you seen the T-shirt
I wear around the house?

604
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:26,245
Wait up!

605
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:28,046
I just want to talk to you.

606
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:35,769
Wait!

607
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,973
Stop! Stop!

608
00:50:43,814 --> 00:50:46,248
Stop, please, stop!

609
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:49,644
Why didn't you answer my message?

610
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:52,248
There was no signal.
I only got it two hours ago.

611
00:50:52,454 --> 00:50:55,764
- I thought it was better I came.
- All your stuff's been taken away.

612
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:01,333
I threw it all out.

613
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:03,083
No, no, it's fine.

614
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:09,090
Everything?

615
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:10,893
Well, not everything.

616
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:36,330
Very well.

617
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,004
Alright.

618
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:41,044
'Bye.

619
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:44,808
It's just your dad,
the meeting's dragging on.

620
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,335
We're not to expect him for lunch.

621
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,413
Did you really think he was coming?

622
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:49,889
Don't start.

623
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:55,763
By the way, how is it with Bruno
after his little... fling?

624
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:57,283
Better than ever.

625
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,565
But are you sure
they're not seeing each other?

626
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:01,526
- I'm sure he is.
- What?!

627
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,611
It's part of our deal as a couple.

628
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,442
We're open people.

629
00:53:05,654 --> 00:53:08,646
So he's still seeing that girl
and you don't mind.

630
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:11,483
It's not a girl, it's a boy.

631
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:17,605
And you're fine with that?

632
00:53:17,814 --> 00:53:20,851
What's not fine is my father
has a thing going

633
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:23,932
with his architect
and you pretend you don't know.

634
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,694
It was a fleeting thing.
It's in the past.

635
00:53:26,894 --> 00:53:28,771
He's been with this woman
for five years.

636
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:30,805
He comes to Barcelona to see her,
that's why he's not here!

637
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:33,244
- Everyone knows!
- Do you want us to separate?

638
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:35,570
Hello. First course is...

639
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:36,934
I want a whisky on the rocks.

640
00:53:37,374 --> 00:53:38,284
Same here.

641
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:41,405
What, isn't it allowed?

642
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:43,765
Look at my face, I'm old enough.

643
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,969
I'm old now, but you're young.

644
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:57,491
Leave Bruno.
There are tons of terrific guys.

645
00:53:57,694 --> 00:54:00,925
Why? I'm happy with him.
I feel good.

646
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:02,647
I don't believe you.

647
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:14,647
Where are you off to so early?

648
00:54:14,854 --> 00:54:15,764
The gym.

649
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:19,364
I don't have class till midday.

650
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:22,892
- Why don't you go later?
- No...

651
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,732
I'd rather go now.

652
00:54:25,654 --> 00:54:27,212
C'mon, don't be a bad girl.

653
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:28,774
We're going to the pool.

654
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:31,054
- I'll go get my stuff.
- No, Carla...

655
00:54:33,214 --> 00:54:34,966
- I've got a karate class.
- With Rai?

656
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:36,892
Sure. He's the teacher.

657
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,088
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you'd get mad.

658
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:42,290
Whatever I do, you get mad.

659
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:45,573
What are you doing tonight?

660
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:47,403
Any plans?

661
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:49,047
I don't know.

662
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:51,294
I just got up and you ask me
what I'm doing tonight!

663
00:54:51,814 --> 00:54:53,293
In case you were staying with Rai.

664
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,927
If I were, I'd call to tell you.

665
00:54:55,134 --> 00:54:57,648
I don't spend every night with him!
This is crazy!

666
00:54:57,854 --> 00:54:59,014
It's just to organize myself!

667
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:01,125
I might meet Marta
after the magazine closes up.

668
00:55:01,294 --> 00:55:02,727
Do what you want!

669
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:04,734
Stop fucking hovering
around me all the time!

670
00:55:10,134 --> 00:55:12,364
Shit. I'm sorry.

671
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:15,412
C'mon, c'mon...

672
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,526
We're so tied together,
we've become too dependent.

673
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,928
That's not good.

674
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:25,053
I need you.

675
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:26,888
I don't need you.

676
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:29,934
- I'm with you because I want to be.
- You didn't talk like that before.

677
00:55:32,414 --> 00:55:34,052
'Cause I'd never thought about it.

678
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:37,172
I feel the same way about you.

679
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:39,727
No, no...

680
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:41,523
It's much stronger.

681
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,533
I love you even more.

682
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:46,690
Because you try to
accept me the way I am.

683
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:48,563
It's not easy.

684
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,804
I'll be back tonight.
If you're not meeting anyone

685
00:56:12,014 --> 00:56:13,606
after work, I'll be here.

686
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:14,731
'Bye.

687
00:56:24,254 --> 00:56:25,846
We're been waiting an hour!
What if we just go?

688
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:26,884
No way.

689
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:29,967
Maybe you think it's easy
to get time with Virginia Dalmau.

690
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,051
I'm losing the urge to apologize.

691
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:33,575
Do you want the magazine to fold?

692
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,448
You'll kneel if you have to!

693
00:56:35,654 --> 00:56:36,494
What do I say to her?

694
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:38,926
The truth. What happened.

695
00:56:39,334 --> 00:56:41,052
Sure, the shower thing?

696
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:42,295
I'm sure she'll understand.

697
00:56:43,094 --> 00:56:45,847
But don't tell her you let them
shower together now,

698
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:47,811
or she'll laugh her head off.

699
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:54,210
If you love someone,
you don't inhibit or shackle them.

700
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,889
Besides, if he's seeing Rai,
Bruno tells me.

701
00:56:57,134 --> 00:57:00,012
Deep down you're like your mother:
Resigned to it.

702
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,290
I accept this situation
because I want to!

703
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:03,210
I'm free!

704
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:06,292
My father ignores my mother.
And me!

705
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:08,610
Bruno doesn't ignore me.
He loves me!

706
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:11,282
Why wouldn't he?
With all this understanding?

707
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:14,569
You know what I think?

708
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,850
When someone's that open,
they're not in love.

709
00:57:17,054 --> 00:57:19,522
But it's comfortable to have
company, sex...

710
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:21,531
- I'm fine with it.
- Yes, you are...

711
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:22,803
and he is even more.

712
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:24,454
But you don't look fine.

713
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:26,365
If you want to kid yourself,
It's up to you.

714
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:29,407
You're kidding yourself with this
I-don't-want-a-partner stuff,

715
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,764
and the fact is you can't get one!

716
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:32,645
What's that?

717
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:34,731
You act all slutty
because you refuse to admit

718
00:57:34,894 --> 00:57:36,805
that you're desperately
looking for someone!

719
00:57:37,014 --> 00:57:39,733
And you end up shagging Adrian,
who you think is an idiot!

720
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,852
A bit over the top, aren't you?

721
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:36,771
Thanks for coming.

722
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:42,492
I'm so sorry for what I said.

723
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:45,604
It may be true,
but you're very cruel, girl.

724
00:58:46,134 --> 00:58:47,806
I've got feelings too, you know?

725
00:58:48,814 --> 00:58:49,485
Forgive me.

726
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,889
I'm not a wall you throws rocks at
and they bounce off.

727
00:58:53,774 --> 00:58:55,534
I feel terrible
and I'm taking it out on you.

728
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:58,124
I've got problems too,
but I solve them on my own

729
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,733
and I don't blame anyone.

730
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:11,486
You're so sensitive,
I can't say anything to you.

731
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:17,047
You can sleep at my place,

732
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:19,171
but as you know,
it's a family environment.

733
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:24,683
You know what?

734
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:28,614
We're got a photo
and interview session with Virginia.

735
00:59:28,974 --> 00:59:30,885
What? Fucking brilliant!

736
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:34,564
Lighten up, girl.
Dani and Adrian are coming.

737
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:36,173
Wait till we tell them!

738
00:59:37,814 --> 00:59:39,213
Why'd you ask them to come?

739
00:59:39,414 --> 00:59:41,132
We were already meeting up.

740
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:43,573
I had to let off steam with someone.

741
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,443
What did you tell them?

742
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,849
They knew Bruno and Rai
were still together.

743
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:53,373
Dani saw them and...
I explained the situation.

744
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,454
I'm going to the bathroom,
my stomach's upset.

745
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:00,452
If you'd only seen it...

746
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:02,892
They looked so happy...

747
01:00:04,294 --> 01:00:05,932
When you left me there...

748
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,493
I swear to you...

749
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:32,809
Where have you been?

750
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:34,530
Around.

751
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,006
- Who were you with?
- You're asking me for explanations?

752
01:00:41,614 --> 01:00:43,775
No, no. You always tell me,
but if you don't want to...

753
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:57,651
I was with someone who suggested
I sleep at their place.

754
01:01:01,814 --> 01:01:02,883
But I didn't want to.

755
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:08,010
Because you didn't fancy them?

756
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:17,369
Hello, Marta.

757
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:22,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

758
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:23,842
She's right here.

759
01:01:24,534 --> 01:01:26,968
You left your bag
and camera... in the bar.

760
01:01:35,134 --> 01:01:36,362
Yes, don't worry.

761
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:38,611
I didn't feel like talking.

762
01:01:40,694 --> 01:01:42,525
See you tomorrow. Big kiss.

763
01:01:54,574 --> 01:01:56,246
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

764
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:03,169
Sometimes I get the feeling
everyone's laughing at me.

765
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,328
Especially you.

766
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,333
You're not pathetic.

767
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:20,244
You're the most
wonderful person I know.

768
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:23,605
And I'm so lucky you're with me.

769
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:27,602
Do you really think so?

770
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:55,532
What are those shelves?

771
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:58,934
Surprise! Didn't you need some?

772
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:00,493
Where'd you get them from?

773
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:03,364
The gym,
they were throwing them out.

774
01:03:06,934 --> 01:03:07,684
I don't want them.

775
01:03:09,254 --> 01:03:11,006
Nor do I want Rai coming here.

776
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:13,049
This is our place,

777
01:03:13,614 --> 01:03:14,933
my parents' place!

778
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:27,212
- It was a real pleasure.
- Thank you.

779
01:03:28,574 --> 01:03:29,529
Yeah.

780
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:34,530
At first I was a bit intimidated,
but in the end we connected.

781
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:36,287
I'm so happy.

782
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,691
Thanks, Mum.

783
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:44,011
I'm going. Big kiss.

784
01:03:46,134 --> 01:03:47,094
What are you doing here?

785
01:03:47,174 --> 01:03:48,163
I came to apologize,

786
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:50,974
for being at your place
when you weren't there...

787
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,374
to put up the shelves.

788
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:55,770
We're not here to discuss our lives,
we're working.

789
01:03:56,094 --> 01:03:58,289
Sorry, They said you'd finished.

790
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:01,493
Can I help in any way?

791
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:04,690
You've got a volunteer
to help tidy up.

792
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:06,243
See you tomorrow.

793
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,251
See you.

794
01:04:20,454 --> 01:04:22,092
Why do you tell him
what we talk about?

795
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:24,565
I only told him you got mad
about the shelves

796
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,054
and didn't want him
to come here.

797
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:28,290
- What else?
- Nothing.

798
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:30,849
It's hard not to talk about you.
I live here, with you.

799
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:33,290
I don't want you talking
about me again, alright?

800
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:35,172
Fine, as you wish.

801
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:46,812
I think this is yours.

802
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,203
Thanks.

803
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:51,489
May I?

804
01:04:57,454 --> 01:04:58,284
Bruno!

805
01:04:59,654 --> 01:05:00,534
How are you, handsome?

806
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,128
What are you doing here?

807
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,252
I came to take you both to lunch.

808
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:10,050
I'm buying.

809
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,006
I'd rather study some more.

810
01:05:12,614 --> 01:05:13,763
Then we'll wait.

811
01:05:14,774 --> 01:05:15,684
It's early.

812
01:05:19,454 --> 01:05:21,410
We should forget lunch?

813
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:26,729
Shall you and I go?

814
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:29,050
What?

815
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:31,770
If Bruno wants to study,
let him study.

816
01:05:35,494 --> 01:05:36,813
Tell him to go away.

817
01:05:42,014 --> 01:05:43,367
She doesn't feel like it either.

818
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:44,091
Right?

819
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:46,084
Yes.

820
01:05:47,254 --> 01:05:48,482
I do feel like it.

821
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:49,365
Shall we go?

822
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:51,123
Then let's go.

823
01:05:51,654 --> 01:05:53,724
No, you stay here and study.

824
01:06:02,974 --> 01:06:05,932
Don't think for one moment
we're going to be friends, okay?

825
01:06:06,774 --> 01:06:10,608
I'm just doing it to annoy Bruno
and to set some things straight.

826
01:06:10,814 --> 01:06:13,089
Fine. I'll get the food.

827
01:06:13,774 --> 01:06:14,843
I said I was buying.

828
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:18,567
- Hi.
- How are you?

829
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,810
- Where's Pau?
- Doing exams.

830
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:29,690
Hello.

831
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,844
You must be used to this stuff,
but I don't like it at all.

832
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:46,528
You'll love it.
It's all delicious here.

833
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:04,489
Let's go.

834
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:10,012
- See you.
- See you.

835
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:24,773
Hey! Hey! You forgot something.

836
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:27,773
Yes, to pay...

837
01:07:27,974 --> 01:07:28,963
No, not that.

838
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:32,813
She thinks I'm shoplifting.

839
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:34,449
Tell her I'm a good guy.

840
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:36,888
You're giving this to us?

841
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:39,370
On the condition
that you eat it today.

842
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:40,730
Why?

843
01:07:41,094 --> 01:07:42,288
Because it expires tomorrow.

844
01:07:43,214 --> 01:07:45,055
Or do you think these people
like losing money?

845
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:46,764
You bastard.

846
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:48,335
I might not let you have anything.

847
01:07:51,894 --> 01:07:54,613
- You know him?
- I'm karate teacher to his son.

848
01:07:56,334 --> 01:07:58,211
And everything we took
expires tomorrow.

849
01:07:58,414 --> 01:08:00,609
Jackpot! You've won...

850
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:02,447
a jar of foie-gras.

851
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,054
Are you going to tell me
where we're going?

852
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:09,724
That's them.

853
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:21,090
Look at him, the missing piece.

854
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:31,849
C'mon, Rai!

855
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:34,729
This is Carla.

856
01:08:49,094 --> 01:08:51,289
- Go, Rai!
- Go for it!

857
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:27,087
It's a bit risky, isn't it?
You could kill yourself.

858
01:09:31,014 --> 01:09:33,369
If you don't take risks in life,
you're already dead.

859
01:09:33,814 --> 01:09:34,929
How about that food?

860
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:38,492
- Ham?
- Yeah.

861
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:40,732
How did you get into dancing?

862
01:09:41,494 --> 01:09:44,645
As kids we'd meet here
and imitate videos we saw on TV.

863
01:09:45,454 --> 01:09:47,012
I used to imitate Madonna.

864
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:51,691
- Did you live here?
- I'm from Galicia.

865
01:09:52,414 --> 01:09:54,803
But when I was 11 my dad died,

866
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:57,006
so my mum and I came to Barcelona.

867
01:10:00,054 --> 01:10:01,254
So this is your neighbourhood?

868
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:03,530
Well, it's the place where
I spent the most time.

869
01:10:04,214 --> 01:10:06,569
- We left here later.
- Where to?

870
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:08,487
Back to Vigo for a while,

871
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:12,411
we were in Hendaya, Santander,
wherever she got work.

872
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:14,366
Where's your mother?

873
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:17,130
She lives in Cadiz
with her new boyfriend.

874
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:23,525
When I come here and see
my old friends, I feel good.

875
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:29,005
Your breakdancing is great.
If you wanted to...

876
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:30,892
Breakdancers live to dance.

877
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,332
I can't get into just one thing.

878
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:35,523
Just in case I fail.

879
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:39,572
I'd rather nibble everything.

880
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:01,729
At boarding school
I got involved with a guy.

881
01:11:02,534 --> 01:11:04,294
But when I was outside,
I'd score with girls.

882
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:07,964
Did you feel homosexual
or heterosexual?

883
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:11,566
I didn't sweat about it.
It was all sexual.

884
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:14,733
It seemed normal to you.

885
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:16,090
Normal?

886
01:11:18,934 --> 01:11:19,730
Yeah.

887
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:22,092
Until I got beaten up.

888
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:24,243
I was 16.

889
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:27,613
And you signed up for karate.

890
01:11:34,094 --> 01:11:35,732
I like reaching the limit
of my energy,

891
01:11:36,214 --> 01:11:39,445
until I can't move a finger
or think about anything.

892
01:11:40,014 --> 01:11:41,686
It's a kind of sweet death.

893
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:44,255
Hasn't anything like that
ever happened to you?

894
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,289
Yes.

895
01:11:46,774 --> 01:11:48,765
But I was totally high.

896
01:11:49,534 --> 01:11:51,013
The high is always here.

897
01:11:53,654 --> 01:11:55,690
With some people
it's easier to find.

898
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:02,731
Thanks for walking me home.

899
01:12:02,974 --> 01:12:03,884
You're welcome.

900
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:10,084
Hey!

901
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:15,244
Now we're set things straight,
don't think we're going to be friends.

902
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,012
It was just to annoy Bruno.

903
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:43,086
You're angry.

904
01:12:43,454 --> 01:12:44,728
No, I'm studying.

905
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,007
What are laughing at?

906
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:49,643
Nothing.

907
01:12:57,494 --> 01:12:59,007
Did you have a good time?

908
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:02,763
Do you forgive me?

909
01:13:04,574 --> 01:13:06,530
When you're angry
you get really aggressive.

910
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,283
What did you do?

911
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:17,927
Do I ask you what you do
when you're with him?

912
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:34,088
They're letting me crash here

913
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:36,094
in exchange for
doing the maintenance.

914
01:13:37,134 --> 01:13:38,010
Come right in.

915
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:16,564
It's pathetic,

916
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:18,650
She acts all super-sexy,
at her age.

917
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:21,003
That was intense,
Rai turning up all of a sudden.

918
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:23,249
He and Carla are good friends now.

919
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:24,363
What's that?

920
01:15:30,773 --> 01:15:32,809
Have you chosen the photos
we're going to send?

921
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:36,527
You decide, I don't mind.

922
01:15:42,853 --> 01:15:43,683
What's all this?

923
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:45,324
What?

924
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:51,285
- Are you officially on together?
- We have been for ten days.

925
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:52,886
Why didn't you tell me?

926
01:15:53,093 --> 01:15:55,243
'Cause you've been busy lately.

927
01:15:55,453 --> 01:15:58,570
You prefer your boyfriend's lover
to your best friend now.

928
01:16:12,493 --> 01:16:15,246
Bruno has no idea how I feel.

929
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:22,007
I doubt he'd be so understanding
in my place.

930
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:24,451
- Run the test on him.
- What test?

931
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:26,772
What do I do?

932
01:16:28,093 --> 01:16:29,412
Find a lover?

933
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:32,691
You must fancy someone.

934
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:51,883
We're closed.

935
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:54,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

936
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:58,970
It suddenly occurred to me
to come and see you,

937
01:16:59,373 --> 01:17:01,409
but if you're heading out, I'll go.

938
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:03,683
No, I'm just tidying up.

939
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:10,923
- Come in.
- Okay.

940
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:33,211
I'm in your bedroom.

941
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:36,492
I was going to lie down and read.

942
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:40,012
Will you help me make the bed?

943
01:17:42,213 --> 01:17:43,089
Okay.

944
01:18:15,973 --> 01:18:17,088
Sit down.

945
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:24,002
This must be great for your back.

946
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:33,247
Do you ever get a fright at night
from your own reflection?

947
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:35,522
It's got its pluses.

948
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:41,571
It's as if someone just like you
is here, but it's not you...

949
01:18:42,453 --> 01:18:44,284
and you can spy on what he does.

950
01:19:52,853 --> 01:19:53,808
Hello!

951
01:19:57,453 --> 01:19:59,569
I'm having dinner.
Since you were so late...

952
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:03,124
Did you meet for drinks?

953
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:05,168
No.

954
01:20:05,893 --> 01:20:07,292
Were you working late?

955
01:20:07,693 --> 01:20:09,729
Working, no... shagging.

956
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:12,848
With whom?

957
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,087
Who else?

958
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:28,925
No, just kidding.

959
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,132
I'm going to bed.

960
01:20:36,213 --> 01:20:37,692
There's steak in the fridge.

961
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:10,364
- Who is it?
- Maria.

962
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,211
Carla. We're at the pool.

963
01:21:20,813 --> 01:21:22,166
No, I haven't told him.

964
01:21:23,573 --> 01:21:24,722
It's hard for me too.

965
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:30,292
Yes, I know.
I know we have to tell him.

966
01:21:32,813 --> 01:21:33,689
Okay.

967
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,970
I'll call you. Big kiss.

968
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,407
How about that Virginia,
after all that complaining...

969
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:45,809
Give me some.

970
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:47,774
- Here, Carla.
- What are we celebrating?

971
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:50,533
They're buying us!
And they love the photos!

972
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:52,530
We're meeting bosses of
the distributor this afternoon

973
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:53,688
to sign the deal!

974
01:21:53,893 --> 01:21:54,450
That's great.

975
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:00,803
Something wrong?

976
01:22:00,973 --> 01:22:02,122
No. Why?

977
01:22:03,493 --> 01:22:06,166
We've dreamt of this
for a long time,

978
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:08,524
and now we've done it.
How about some enthusiasm?

979
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,164
I'm happy, really.

980
01:22:12,413 --> 01:22:13,402
It's great.

981
01:22:20,453 --> 01:22:21,522
I'm going to the bathroom.

982
01:22:31,733 --> 01:22:33,086
What's wrong?

983
01:22:33,293 --> 01:22:35,761
- You've been weird for days.
- I'm involved with Rai.

984
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:37,049
What?!

985
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:38,242
I'm involved with Rai.

986
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:40,045
How did Bruno take it?

987
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:41,686
I don't dare tell him.

988
01:22:41,893 --> 01:22:44,088
But are you still in love
with Bruno or not?

989
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,761
Yes, I'm in love with Bruno,

990
01:22:47,093 --> 01:22:49,004
but Rai gets me so hot!

991
01:22:52,373 --> 01:22:53,852
What does Rai say about it?

992
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:56,963
We've decided not to
see each other for now.

993
01:22:57,413 --> 01:23:00,405
- You have to tell Bruno.
- I'm afraid he'll leave me.

994
01:23:00,733 --> 01:23:03,327
If he really loves you
he'll accept it, like you did.

995
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:05,922
- And if he doesn't?
- Then he's not worth it.

996
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:13,044
Yeah, I'm involved with Rai!
So what?!

997
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:17,286
Rai, I'm starting to worry.
Why won't you pick up?

998
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,131
They found out at the magazine.

999
01:23:19,853 --> 01:23:21,286
- Can I come in?
- Yes!

1000
01:23:27,013 --> 01:23:28,814
Do you want to go to the movies
or for a walk?

1001
01:23:28,893 --> 01:23:32,488
Marta called,
I have to rush to the magazine.

1002
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:34,530
You're always out late
or busy at night.

1003
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:35,414
They exploit you.

1004
01:23:35,573 --> 01:23:36,642
Yeah, but it's worth it.

1005
01:23:37,373 --> 01:23:38,328
I've got to run.

1006
01:23:46,453 --> 01:23:47,806
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1007
01:23:53,413 --> 01:23:54,892
Stop, stop, stop.

1008
01:24:02,653 --> 01:24:04,014
Weren't you going to the magazine?

1009
01:24:05,533 --> 01:24:09,526
Yes, but I realized I left my folder
and photos here the other night,

1010
01:24:09,733 --> 01:24:11,291
and I need them.

1011
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:12,250
What about you?

1012
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:14,927
You get in so late these days,
I thought I'd visit Rai,

1013
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:16,646
though he's been busy lately too.

1014
01:24:19,213 --> 01:24:19,850
Shall we go?

1015
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:21,728
Let's go, yeah.

1016
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:24,529
Yes?

1017
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:28,367
- Hello.
- Hello.

1018
01:24:29,813 --> 01:24:32,407
Bruno and I met
at the door by chance.

1019
01:24:33,053 --> 01:24:34,532
I was coming for some photos.

1020
01:24:35,773 --> 01:24:37,206
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

1021
01:24:38,013 --> 01:24:38,968
I'll be right back.

1022
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:41,408
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

1023
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:54,081
Going somewhere?

1024
01:24:54,573 --> 01:24:56,131
I'm going to the country
for a while with Maria.

1025
01:24:56,453 --> 01:24:58,333
- Did something happen to her?
- No, she's fine.

1026
01:24:58,733 --> 01:25:00,530
I'm the one who
needs to get away.

1027
01:25:04,893 --> 01:25:06,212
I'm having a drink.

1028
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:09,365
- I'll help you.
- No, I'll help him.

1029
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:18,167
Rai, what's up?
Why are you leaving?

1030
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:19,333
You can't do this to me.

1031
01:25:19,493 --> 01:25:20,721
Can I get the lemon?

1032
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:22,452
Then I'll stay with you tonight.

1033
01:25:22,653 --> 01:25:24,211
I'll have a drink too.

1034
01:25:24,493 --> 01:25:26,165
Weren't you going?

1035
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,768
If Rai's leaving,
we have to give him a send-off.

1036
01:25:28,973 --> 01:25:31,965
There's a bottle of gin.
Can you get it?

1037
01:25:36,813 --> 01:25:37,928
You can't go!

1038
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,891
Bruno will be down at any moment.

1039
01:25:40,213 --> 01:25:41,893
Why not ask him to go out
and buy something

1040
01:25:41,973 --> 01:25:44,168
so you can tell me why
you're going without a goodbye?

1041
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:49,282
- Carla, please.
- You're making a detergent cocktail!

1042
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:50,892
I don't know what I'm doing!

1043
01:25:51,853 --> 01:25:52,842
Rum!

1044
01:25:56,773 --> 01:25:58,286
There's no gin left.

1045
01:25:58,813 --> 01:26:01,008
- What's wrong?
- I'm hot.

1046
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,528
I've been training,
I need some air.

1047
01:26:04,013 --> 01:26:05,162
You haven't got a fever?

1048
01:26:07,853 --> 01:26:09,332
Let me past!

1049
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:14,293
A "mojito" would be great.
Will you make it?

1050
01:26:21,613 --> 01:26:24,571
This can't go on, Carla.
I don't want to deceive anyone.

1051
01:26:24,773 --> 01:26:25,967
Neither do I.

1052
01:26:26,693 --> 01:26:28,172
Let's tell him,
It's the best thing.

1053
01:26:28,373 --> 01:26:29,974
- The best thing is for me to go.
- No...

1054
01:26:33,973 --> 01:26:36,043
Here's the Mojito King with...

1055
01:26:56,013 --> 01:26:58,004
Just listen to me!

1056
01:27:03,693 --> 01:27:05,331
Open up. Please.

1057
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:09,602
I wanted you to feel what I felt.

1058
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,849
For you to know
how much it hurts.

1059
01:27:14,493 --> 01:27:16,563
But I fell for Rai.

1060
01:27:20,613 --> 01:27:22,490
Isn't that what happened to you?

1061
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:25,602
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

1062
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:27,128
I love you,

1063
01:27:29,053 --> 01:27:31,965
and the main thing
is that we're all together.

1064
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:33,891
Open up, Please.

1065
01:28:06,493 --> 01:28:07,767
Goodbye, Bruno.

1066
01:28:58,733 --> 01:28:59,882
It's great to see you.

1067
01:29:04,613 --> 01:29:06,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

1068
01:29:07,653 --> 01:29:08,642
Come in.

1069
01:30:11,293 --> 01:30:13,249
You've got a little surprise.

1070
01:30:41,813 --> 01:30:43,087
Can we talk?

1071
01:30:57,013 --> 01:30:57,843
Forgive me.

1072
01:30:58,893 --> 01:31:00,167
I've been a fool.

1073
01:31:00,933 --> 01:31:03,242
I don't know if it was
selfishness or stupidity.

1074
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:07,086
I feel so ashamed.

1075
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:10,045
After you and Rai...

1076
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:12,405
And I wanted you to be friends.

1077
01:31:12,613 --> 01:31:16,003
But we're more than friends,
you saw that.

1078
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:17,573
Do you still want to be with me?

1079
01:31:18,893 --> 01:31:19,689
More than ever.

1080
01:31:22,253 --> 01:31:24,926
But I don't want Rai to vanish
from my life either.

1081
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,202
- He's important too.
- And to me.

1082
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:31,929
I never want us to part.

1083
01:31:54,013 --> 01:31:56,288
Things are getting
more complicated than usual.

1084
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:58,888
What do you mean?

1085
01:32:00,373 --> 01:32:02,887
You can't resist the temtation
to seduce everyone.

1086
01:32:04,133 --> 01:32:07,808
And now the ultimate challenge:
A couple.

1087
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:09,122
You're jealous.

1088
01:32:10,373 --> 01:32:12,523
I love you,
but I'm not in love with you.

1089
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:13,688
Right.

1090
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,448
And Bruno?

1091
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:18,522
Carla?

1092
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:20,729
Who?

1093
01:32:21,973 --> 01:32:23,008
Both of them.

1094
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:26,008
I love them.

1095
01:32:28,053 --> 01:32:30,123
Enough to get out of the way
and leave them alone.

1096
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,210
Every time you get
too hooked on somebody,

1097
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:35,287
you travel, take a lover...

1098
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:36,970
and run away.

1099
01:32:37,173 --> 01:32:38,526
The only one running away
from it all is you.

1100
01:32:38,733 --> 01:32:40,166
Stop fooling yourself, Rai.

1101
01:32:40,373 --> 01:32:44,161
You're afraid of suffering,
so you're scared of commitment.

1102
01:32:45,173 --> 01:32:48,449
And even more so
when it's not one... but two.

1103
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:55,931
Have I told you
how beautiful are you?

1104
01:32:57,853 --> 01:32:59,525
I love your body.

1105
01:32:59,733 --> 01:33:01,166
I'll never get tired of it.

1106
01:33:10,773 --> 01:33:12,411
- Where's Rai?
- He's gone.

1107
01:33:12,973 --> 01:33:13,962
To Barcelona.

1108
01:33:15,213 --> 01:33:17,363
I just left him on the road
thumbing a lift.

1109
01:33:39,973 --> 01:33:42,123
- To Barcelona?
- Sure. Get in.

1110
01:33:42,893 --> 01:33:43,962
Look, he's there!

1111
01:33:44,173 --> 01:33:45,492
- Rai!
- Rai!

1112
01:33:45,693 --> 01:33:46,728
Wait!

1113
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:50,648
Rai!

1114
01:33:56,813 --> 01:33:57,848
Rai!

1115
01:33:58,453 --> 01:33:59,488
Wait!

1116
01:34:00,413 --> 01:34:02,847
Why'd you go without a goodbye?

1117
01:34:03,053 --> 01:34:04,566
I don't like goodbyes.

1118
01:34:04,733 --> 01:34:06,644
Get out, come to lunch! Please!

1119
01:34:06,853 --> 01:34:08,969
Life alone isn't easy,
with two it's complicated,

1120
01:34:09,173 --> 01:34:10,447
and with three, impossible!

1121
01:34:10,773 --> 01:34:12,206
- What?!
- I'll miss you both.

1122
01:34:12,373 --> 01:34:14,250
- What?!
- I'll never forget you!

1123
01:34:14,653 --> 01:34:16,928
- Rai, stay with us!
- Goodbye.

1124
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:22,968
If you don't take a risk,
you're dead!

1125
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,208
- Stop.
- What?

1126
01:34:40,413 --> 01:34:41,448
Stop, please.

1127
01:34:50,533 --> 01:34:51,727
Wait for me!

1128
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:53,361
Stop! Stop!

1129
01:35:00,253 --> 01:35:01,288
No!

1130
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:09,045
Bruno! Carla!

1131
01:35:15,653 --> 01:35:18,087
Bruno! Carla!

1132
01:35:22,893 --> 01:35:23,723
Bruno!

1133
01:35:33,373 --> 01:35:35,967
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1134
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:37,403
Fuck...

1135
01:35:39,413 --> 01:35:40,528
Where's Carla?

1136
01:35:44,413 --> 01:35:45,323
Where is she?

1137
01:35:48,853 --> 01:35:49,683
Carla!

1138
01:35:58,333 --> 01:35:59,561
Turn her over.

1139
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:14,803
Are you alright?

1140
01:36:20,973 --> 01:36:22,406
Take her arm.

1141
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:26,125
Careful, careful.

1142
01:36:29,893 --> 01:36:30,928
Not your helmet. Careful!

1143
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:33,088
You're okay.

1144
01:36:39,893 --> 01:36:41,963
You can't get rid of us now.

1145
01:38:23,573 --> 01:38:24,608
Come on.

1145
01:38:25,305 --> 01:39:25,258
