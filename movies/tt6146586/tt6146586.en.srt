3
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,071
<i>John Wick, Excommunicado.</i>

4
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,977
<i>In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.</i>

5
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,294
I do hope
that Mr. Wick

6
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,163
finds his way to safety.

7
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,331
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

8
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,801
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

9
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,903
Do you expect him
to make it out?

10
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,771
$14 million bounty
on his head.

11
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,374
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

12
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:36,946
I'd say the odds
are about even.

13
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:57,363
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

14
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:58,532
No way!

15
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:01,836
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

16
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,871
But I know better, man.

17
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,709
I know better.
I know what I'm...

18
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,148
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

19
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,686
Tick tock.

20
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,885
Tick tock.

21
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:22,189
Tick tock. Tick...

22
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,327
No time to dilly-dally,
Mr. Wick!

23
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:41,041
The New York Public Library.

24
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,045
You got it.

25
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:02,933
Change of plan.

26
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,334
To the Continental.

27
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:10,107
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

28
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,842
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

29
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:17,413
Good dog. Good dog.

30
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,455
<i>John Wick, Excommunicado.</i>

<i>In effect, 20 minutes.</i>

32
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,347
Can I help you?

33
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,851
<i>Russian Folktale.</i>
Alexander Afanasyev.

34
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,824
1864.

35
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:12,401
- Level two.
- Thank you.

36
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,989
"Consider your origins.

37

Looking a little
run down there, John.

41
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,140
Ernest. I still have time.

42
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:30,476
It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

43
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,613
You sure this is what
you wanna do?

44
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,481
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

45
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,552
Not if you can't spend it.

46
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,020
Oh, shit.

47
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:07,540
Push it back.

48
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:24,357
<i>John Wick, Excommunicado.</i>

<i>In effect, 10 minutes.</i>

50
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,140
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

51
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:44,680
No help,
no services of any kind.

52
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:59,428
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

53
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,162
Mr. Wick.

54
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,731
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

55
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,500
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

56
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,101
No! I can't.

57
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,571
I still have five minutes!

58
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,242
Please.

59
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:20,149
Come on. Come on.

60
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,058
All right, sit there.

61
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:34,831
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

62
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:36,833
Uh-huh.

63
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,733
Puncture wound.

64
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:43,772
Went deep.
Nicked the artery.

65
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,607
Here you go.

66
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:49,775

00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,667
Doc?

70
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,471
Doc?

71
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,275
Yeah. We're halfway there.

72
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,677
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

73
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,179
<i>John Wick, Excommunicado.</i>

74
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:30,750

<i>One.</i>

77
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,433
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

78
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,967
I know. Rules.

79
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,805
Ah, rules.

And away we go.

84
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,409
Top shelf. On the right.

85
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,678
Yeah. Take four.

86
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,483
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

87
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,527
Mr. Wick?

88
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,464
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

89
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,030
But you did.

90
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,631
They'll know.

91
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,933
Know what?

92
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:29,305
I told you
where the medicine was.

93
00:13:45,753 --> 00:13:47,853
- Where?
- Here.

94
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:49,055
Just below my floating rib.

95
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:50,392
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

96
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,895
Oh, wait!

97
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,766
One may not be enough.

98
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:02,738
Yeah. All right.

99
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:05,605
Be sure not to graze my...

100
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,776
Oh!

101
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,618
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

102
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:20,956
Thanks, Doc.

103
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,000
- Its him.
- Yes, let's go.

104
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,000
Open the door.

105
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,488
Shoot the lock.

106
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,319
- Its him.
- Yes.

107
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,800
Tell them that he's arriving at the corner.

108
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,301
<i>John Wick. Open contract.</i>

109
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:03,873
<i>Increase, 15 million.</i>

110
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:08,576
Where are you going,
Jonathan?

111
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,255
We are closed.

112
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,698
Look who it is.

113
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,995
And the belt.

114
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,492
Take him to her.

115
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,060
See you later.

116
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,297
Yes, yes.

117
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,920
Again!

118
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,217
Again!

119
00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:20,742
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

120
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,814
You present this to me
like an answer.

121
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:31,185
I still have my ticket.

122
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:35,688
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

123
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,190
you think
your ticket is valid?

124
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,359
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

125
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,261
is bound by the High Table,

126
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:45,531
and the High Table
stands above all?

127
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,736
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

128
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:54,375
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

129
00:26:56,244 --> 00:27:00,416
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

130
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:06,036
I am Jardani Jovonovich.

131
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,333
I am a child of the Belarus.

132
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:14,200
An orphan of your tribe.

133
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:17,520
You are bound to help me.

134
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:20,699
You are bound...

135
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,238
And I am owed.

136
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:29,344
Rooney, enough!

137
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:39,471
Follow me.

138
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:03,743
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

139
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:05,945
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

140
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,713
they wish for one thing.

141
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,283
A life free of suffering.

142
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:12,884
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

143
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,156
but as you know,

144
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,425
art is pain.

145
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,830
Life is suffering.

146
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:30,238
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

147
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:33,508
But here you are,
back where you began.

148
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,678
All of this, for what?

149
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,929
For a dog?

150
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,000
It wasn't just a dog.

151
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,500
Bringing back old memories?

152
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,813
Pirouette.

153
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:18,950
Pirouette, pirouette.

154
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:22,824
Sit.

155
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:41,375
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

156
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:44,580
The High Table
wants your life.

157
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:48,313
How can you fight the wind?

158
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,881
How can you smash
the mountains?

159
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,551
How can you bury the ocean?

160
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,287
How can you escape
from the light?

161
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,857
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

162
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,861
But they're in the dark, too.

163
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:07,501
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

164
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,440
Passage.

165
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:14,276
Where did you want to go?

166
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:17,812
Casablanca.

167
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:22,817
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

168
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,755
So be it.

169
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:33,562
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

170
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:36,832
If that's what
you really desire.

171
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:19,807
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

172
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,552
You can never come home again.

173
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:35,090
Take him to the lifeboat.

174
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,958
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

175
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,763
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

176
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:16,765
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

177
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:39,854
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

178
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:42,791
Very well, sir.

179
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,996
The manager is in the lounge.

180
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:56,768
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

181
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,205
If that's so,
we can make this short.

182
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,874
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

183
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,412
And that's the all of it.

184
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:06,745
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

185
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:09,014
Oh, yes.

186
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,149
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

187
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,517
You're mistaken.

188
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,219
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

189
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:16,889
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

190
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:18,224
- Hmm.
- The blood was spilt

191
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,692
on the grounds of
the Continental. Was it not?

192
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:21,861
Oh, yes.

193
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:24,129
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

194
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,064
within these very walls.

195
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,469
I'd like to see it.

196
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,098
Santino D'Antonio.

197
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,233
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

198
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:02,168
slain by Mr. Wick

199
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,474
while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

200
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:13,178
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

201
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,114
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

202
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:18,986
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

203
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:20,819
Yes.

204
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:23,188
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

205
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,494
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

206
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,861
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

207
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:30,795
you stood by
and let him walk away

208
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:33,198
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

209
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,234
I made him Excommunicado.

210
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:38,203
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

211
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,904
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

212
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:42,574
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

213
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:44,944
Where is your fealty?

214
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:47,112
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

215
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:49,281
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

216
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,116
Everything is under the Table.

217
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:52,850
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

218
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,185
but this cannot be overlooked.

219
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:57,855
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

220
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:59,560
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

221
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,194
Excuse me?

222
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:05,033
At such time,
your successor will be named.

223
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,366
There are rules,

224
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:10,101
they are the only things
that separate us...

225
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:12,638
- From the animals.
- Yes.

226
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,308
You have seven days.

227
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:21,346
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

228
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:24,216
you may look for me
in room 217.

229
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:27,254
Enjoy your stay
at the Continental.

230
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,937
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

231
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,185
Welcome to my Mission Control.

232
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:03,721
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

233
00:36:03,723 --> 00:36:05,991
From whence I control
the word on the street,

234
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,192
the way of the world.

235
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:08,726
With pigeons.

236
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:12,701
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

237
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:17,902
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

238
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:21,707
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

239
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,308
Can you get disease from it?

240
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,814
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

241
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:29,882
What the hell do you want?

242
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:31,850
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

243
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,451
Where what didn't happen?

244
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:35,222
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

245
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:37,422
I've always been
under the impression

246
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:40,826
that contracts and
executing them was optional.

247
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:42,831
I have no problem
with John Wick.

248
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:52,705
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

249
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:54,239
knowing that
he intended to use it

250
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:56,111
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

251
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,283
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

252
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,424
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

253
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:15,259
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

254
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:17,763
Seven days for what, exactly?

255
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:19,031
To settle your affairs

256
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:21,366
and find a new home
for your birds.

257
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,938
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

258
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:37,382
Oh, my dear.

259
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:40,284
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

260
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:42,987
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

261
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,357
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

262
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:49,027
Because I am the throne, baby.

263
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:51,166
I am the Bowery!

264
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,766
I am all that you deign
not to look at

265
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,134
when you walk
down the street at night.

266
00:37:56,136 --> 00:38:00,007
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

267
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,875
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

268
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:06,245
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

269
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:08,082
You have seven days.

270
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:49,484
Enough!

271
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,056
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

272
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:01,025
But he's Excommunicado.

273
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:03,564
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

274
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,498
Mr. Jonathan,

275
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,337
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

276
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:32,591
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

277
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:34,596
Thanks.

278
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,665
Mr. Jonathan,

279
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,567
it has been a long time
since our fine city

280
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,372
has been graced
with your presence.

281
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:46,270
I need to talk to...

282
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:48,473
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

283
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:59,317
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan Continental.

284
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,221
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

285
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,422
Right this way.

286
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:07,294
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

287
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,103
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

288
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,536
You a dog person, John?

289
00:41:52,538 --> 00:41:54,575
Sofia?

290
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:02,047
Sofia!

291
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:04,449
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

292
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:07,522
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

293
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:09,690
Nice suit.

294
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:14,058
Good to see you, too.

295
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,460
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

296
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:17,998
I know.

297
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:25,205
Don't you do it.

298
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:29,141
You're Excommunicado, John.

299
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:33,614
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

300
00:42:38,718 --> 00:42:40,721
This is your blood.

301
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:44,089
Your bond.

302
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:48,663
When you needed help,
I was there.

303
00:42:56,636 --> 00:42:57,705
Sit.

304
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:04,212
I was talking to you, John.

305
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:13,317
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

306
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,252
I'm not service anymore, John.

307
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:18,824
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

308
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:21,460
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

309
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:23,795
I just need you
to get me to him.

310
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:26,534
- To who?
- Your old boss.

311
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:30,134
You want to kill Berrada.

312
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,170
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

313
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:34,609
What could he
possibly give to you?

314
00:43:37,243 --> 00:43:38,710
Guidance.

315
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:43,582
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

316
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:44,815
And that deal said

317
00:43:44,817 --> 00:43:47,719
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

318
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:51,156
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

319
00:43:51,158 --> 00:43:54,692
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

320
00:43:54,694 --> 00:43:58,432
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

321
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:03,303
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

322
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,707
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

323
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:13,314
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

324
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:17,618
Do you wanna know
where she is?

325
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:21,620
No. I don't ever wanna know.

326
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:24,524
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

327
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,895
A part of me longs for her.

328
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:33,931
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

329
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:35,602
just to keep her safe.

330
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:45,911
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

331
00:44:45,913 --> 00:44:48,712
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

332
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:50,614
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

333
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:52,819
and that's why I'm fucked!

334
00:44:58,424 --> 00:45:00,560
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

335
00:45:02,462 --> 00:45:04,332
Consequences.

336
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,502
I'm just asking you to try.

337
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:11,272
Either way, you and me,

338
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:13,406
we'll be even.

339
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:25,719
No.

340
00:45:26,886 --> 00:45:32,559
After this,
we are less than even.

341
00:45:36,562 --> 00:45:38,465
We leave in 10 minutes.

342
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:36,656
How can I help you?

343
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:51,505
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

344
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,873
There is a task.

345
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,009
It involves someone
who broke the rules

346
00:46:58,011 --> 00:46:59,413
and stood against the Table.

347
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:03,580
John Wick, you mean.

348
00:47:03,582 --> 00:47:05,549
My students
have not been idle.

349
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:08,786
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

350
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:10,888
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

351
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,625
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

352
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:15,962
A dog, a car.

353
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:18,032
I'm familiar.

354
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:23,036
And I'm interested.

355
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:25,640
Very.

356
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:35,048
Blowfish. Very fatal.

357
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:41,021
No soy.

358
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,401
I have served,
I will be of service.

359
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,102
Stop!

360
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:43,810
Out!

361
00:49:50,517 --> 00:49:53,851
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

362
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:56,920
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

363
00:49:56,922 --> 00:49:57,855
He had a ticket.

364
00:49:57,857 --> 00:50:00,725
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

365
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:03,631
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

366
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:05,131
Now...

367
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:12,605
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

368
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:26,053
I have served,
I will be of service.

369
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:50,945
We're not going in
like the old days.

370
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:54,312
It's just a conversation.

371
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:58,185
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

372
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:03,591
Let's go.

373
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:29,580
Sofia.

374
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:32,216
Always so nice to see you.

375
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:35,989
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

376
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:38,121
Certainly.

377
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,064
Fantastic.

378
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:47,632
Jonathan Wick.

379
00:51:47,634 --> 00:51:50,704
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

380
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:58,176
Come along now.

381
00:51:58,178 --> 00:52:00,147
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

382
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:09,189
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

383
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:12,056
Tell me.

384
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:13,994
Do you come here to kill me?

385
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,564
No.

386
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,944
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

387
00:52:32,678 --> 00:52:35,982
People argue. "Assassin."

388
00:52:37,317 --> 00:52:41,121
<i>Hashasheen,</i>
followers of Hassan-i...

389
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:45,191
Eaters of hashish.

390
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,061
No, thank you.

391
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:52,996
But others contend
it comes from <i>asasiyyun.</i>

392
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:55,667
Meaning, "men who are faithful

393
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:57,270
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

394
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:01,772
You see that coin?

395
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:05,208
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

396
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,745
Next to it, the first marker.

397
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:11,214
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

398
00:53:11,216 --> 00:53:12,750
Now, this coin, of course,

399
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:15,920
it does not represent
monetary value.

400
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:19,056
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

401
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:22,328
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

402
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:25,198
Order and rules.

403
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:28,165
You have broken the rules.

404
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:31,335
The High Table
has marked you for death.

405
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:33,370
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

406
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:37,343
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

407
00:53:42,482 --> 00:53:44,351
I seek to make amends.

408
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,752
To pay for what I've done.

409
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:51,290
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

410
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:59,763
This dog,
I do so love it.

411
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:02,702
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

412
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:07,471
Occasionally.

413
00:54:07,473 --> 00:54:10,908
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

414
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,243
And if he wants me dead...

415
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:15,848
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

416
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,449
I see.

417
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:20,788
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

418
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,296
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

419
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:33,200
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

420
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,101
You fail to understand.

421
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:40,170
The Elder
is not a man you find.

422
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:42,507
He can only choose
to find you.

423
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:44,509
You wish to speak with him?

424
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:48,045
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

425
00:54:48,047 --> 00:54:49,480
Canis Minor,

426
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:52,984
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

427
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:55,051
You follow the brightest star.

428
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,487
Walk until
you are almost dead.

429
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,257
Then, keep walking.

430
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,326
When you are
on your last breath,

431
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:06,300
he will find you...
Or he will not.

432
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,837
I am grateful.

433
00:55:12,337 --> 00:55:13,841
Thank you, sir.

434
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:19,145
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

435
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:24,351
The social contract.

436
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,254
The commerce of relationships.

437
00:55:28,555 --> 00:55:30,922
You have received
a great gift.

438
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:32,159
I have hosted your friend.

439
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:35,129
What do you offer in return?

440
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:42,102
So soft and yet so fierce.

441
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:45,172
I love it, this dog.

442
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,038
I will keep it.

443
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,272
Excuse me?

444
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:51,107
This will be my gift.

445
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:53,611
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

446
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:55,045
No.

447
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:57,281
Surely it's the least
you can do.

448
00:55:57,283 --> 00:55:59,252
No, you cannot keep my dog.

449
00:56:00,352 --> 00:56:01,888
Very well.

450
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,324
Very well.

451
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:08,192
Then I will kill it.

452
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:15,266
I'm sorry, Sofia.

453
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:17,404
This was for you to learn.

454
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:27,180
Don't.

455
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:11,058
Sofia. Don't.

456
00:57:15,995 --> 00:57:17,931
He shot my dog.

457
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,598
I get it.

458
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:25,104
We gotta go. Now.

459
01:04:00,732 --> 01:04:02,268
Here you go.

460
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:09,540
You're gonna die, John.

461
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,643
Whether out here
in this desert,

462
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:15,348
or somewhere else
down the road.

463
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:18,718
But you are gonna die.

464
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:35,768
Consequences.

465
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:41,308
Consequences.

466
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,669
Better get going.

467
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:20,413
Sofia.

468
01:08:01,272 --> 01:08:03,142
Okay.

469
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:10,115
You made your point.

470
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:13,585
You have earned my fealty.

471
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:15,919
Matter of fact...

472
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:17,821
I'm gonna shove so
much fealty up your ass

473
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:19,690
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

474
01:08:19,692 --> 01:08:21,857
You had your chance.

475
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:24,895
Well, since you see it
that way,

476
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,029
I guess it's time I told you

477
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:31,033
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

478
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:33,036
Duly noted.

479
01:08:33,038 --> 01:08:34,837
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

480
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:38,709
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

481
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:41,214
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

482
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,320
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

483
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:51,157
The king is dead.

484
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:58,031
Long live the king.

485
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,118
Drink.

486
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:58,890
Don't worry, your weapon
is still there. Please drink.

487
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:13,335
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

488
01:10:13,337 --> 01:10:14,806
Not lost.

489
01:10:15,873 --> 01:10:17,339
Looking for you.

490
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:19,911
You think
I speak of your location?

491
01:10:21,313 --> 01:10:23,346
Never seen a man fight so hard

492
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,350
to end up
back where he started.

493
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:35,191
So tell me, Jonathan.

494
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:37,162
Why do you wish to live?

495
01:10:37,895 --> 01:10:41,166
My wife, Helen.

496
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:48,739
To remember her.
To remember us.

497
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:51,344
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

498
01:10:53,077 --> 01:10:55,281
At least a chance to earn it.

499
01:10:56,948 --> 01:11:01,218
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

500
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,289
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

501
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:06,923
Complete a task for us,

502
01:11:06,925 --> 01:11:09,058
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

503
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,261
The open contract closed,

504
01:11:11,263 --> 01:11:13,329
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

505
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:16,432
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

506
01:11:16,434 --> 01:11:19,438
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

507
01:11:23,908 --> 01:11:25,310
The choice is yours.

508
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,846
Die here and now.

509
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:32,818
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

510
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:52,201
What must be done?

511
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:55,304
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

512
01:11:55,306 --> 01:11:58,010
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

513
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:00,243
What?

514
01:12:00,245 --> 01:12:03,045
He has forgotten his fealty.

515
01:12:03,047 --> 01:12:05,515
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

516
01:12:05,517 --> 01:12:08,187
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

517
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,820
So if you wish to live,

518
01:12:10,822 --> 01:12:13,557
and if you wish to remember,

519
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:15,394
this is the choice
you must make.

520
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:34,346
I will serve.

521
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:39,481
I will be of service.

522
01:12:39,483 --> 01:12:41,584
Very well, my son.

523
01:12:41,586 --> 01:12:43,587
Cast aside your weakness

524
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:46,459
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

525
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:54,065
Mr. John Wick.

526
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:58,100
I want to see. Show me.

527
01:13:41,979 --> 01:13:43,315
Thank you.

528
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:48,453
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

529
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:08,605
I wish you good luck
on your path.

530
01:14:08,607 --> 01:14:11,410
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

531
01:14:13,178 --> 01:14:14,346
And Mr. Wick.

532
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:22,669
Welcome back.

533
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:57,353
<i>JFK Express
now arriving on platform nine.</i>

534
01:14:57,355 --> 01:15:00,292
<i>JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.</i>

535
01:16:23,207 --> 01:16:24,707
Stick together, kids.

536
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:26,142
Make sure
you're holding the hand

537
01:16:26,144 --> 01:16:29,248
of the person
in front and behind you.

538
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:34,720
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

539
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,759
I wouldn't have stopped.

540
01:16:41,259 --> 01:16:42,761
It's good to have you back.

541
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:51,504
How was your trip?

542
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:56,241
Going to the Continental?

543
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:04,179
He with you?

544
01:17:04,181 --> 01:17:06,452
He was.

545
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:18,261
Nice trick.

546
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,453
Sir! Put your weapon down.

547
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,688
He's Excommunicado.

548
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,960
Unless you wish
to become the same,

549
01:20:35,926 --> 01:20:39,462
I suggest you lower your gun.

550
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:47,473
I'd like to see the manager.

551
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,941
Of course.

552
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:54,647
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

553
01:21:07,692 --> 01:21:09,459
Please take a seat.

554
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:11,630
I will let him know
you have arrived.

555
01:21:46,398 --> 01:21:47,929
I gotta tell you,

556
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:51,033
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

557
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:54,072
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

558
01:21:56,474 --> 01:21:59,478
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

559
01:22:02,846 --> 01:22:05,013
Is that the dog?

560
01:22:05,015 --> 01:22:07,450
He likes you.

561
01:22:07,452 --> 01:22:11,690
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

562
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:13,826
Hey, dog.

563
01:22:16,827 --> 01:22:20,996
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

564
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:23,165
We're not the same.

565
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,702
Yes, we are.

566
01:22:25,537 --> 01:22:28,170
No, we're not.

567
01:22:28,172 --> 01:22:30,740
The manager
is ready for you now.

568
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,511
In the administrative lounge,
sir.

569
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:45,800
We're both masters of death.

570
01:22:47,058 --> 01:22:48,658
Mr. Wick.

571
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:51,796
Sit.

572
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,599
Stay.

573
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:57,001
Good dog.

574
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:55,560
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

575
01:24:03,934 --> 01:24:07,602
We only use this room
on special occasions.

576
01:24:07,604 --> 01:24:11,673
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

577
01:24:11,675 --> 01:24:13,142
under the table.

578
01:24:15,078 --> 01:24:17,215
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

579
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:19,749
Yeah.

580
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:21,918
Well, of course.

581
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,190
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

582
01:24:27,325 --> 01:24:29,558
Isn't that why you're here?

583
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,065
I have served,
I will be of service.

584
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:39,101
But you're having doubts.

585
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:42,871
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

586
01:24:42,873 --> 01:24:44,843
If you feel you must,

587
01:24:47,245 --> 01:24:49,614
put a bullet through my heart.

588
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,753
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

589
01:24:58,755 --> 01:25:00,124
The hour?

590
01:25:00,858 --> 01:25:01,891
The hour.

591
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:04,296
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

592
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,996
Maybe I should have.

593
01:25:07,998 --> 01:25:10,665
Rules and consequences.

594
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,133
Hmm.

595
01:25:12,135 --> 01:25:13,735
It seems like everyone
is suffering

596
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:16,105
from the consequences
of their actions.

597
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:18,544
And you're not stepping down?

598
01:25:20,345 --> 01:25:21,880
No.

599
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:24,813
I don't think I am.

600
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:26,848
So it's war?

601
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:28,987
You're going to war
with the High Table?

602
01:25:29,787 --> 01:25:31,119
Skirmish.

603
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:32,221
Unless you decide to shoot me.

604
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:36,028
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

605
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,261
than that of an enemy.

606
01:25:39,263 --> 01:25:42,033
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

607
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,002
What choice?

608
01:25:46,004 --> 01:25:48,870
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

609
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:53,042
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

610
01:25:53,044 --> 01:25:55,878
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

611
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:00,383
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

612
01:26:00,385 --> 01:26:03,918
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

613
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,892
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

614
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:10,125
The Baba Yaga?

615
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:12,261
The last thing
many men ever see?

616
01:26:12,263 --> 01:26:17,266
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

617
01:26:17,268 --> 01:26:19,971
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

618
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:55,103
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

619
01:26:55,105 --> 01:26:56,808
I am an Adjudicator.

620
01:26:58,242 --> 01:27:00,045
Have you decided to step down?

621
01:27:02,746 --> 01:27:05,448
I think not.

622
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,720
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

623
01:27:12,023 --> 01:27:15,127
No, I don't think I will.

624
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:24,169
Very well.

625
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,176
Administration.

626
01:27:34,178 --> 01:27:36,180
<i>I'd like to
change a designation.</i>

627
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:38,213
Verification?

628
01:27:38,215 --> 01:27:41,450
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.</i>

629
01:27:41,452 --> 01:27:43,518
The Continental Hotel,
New York.

630
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,454
<i>New designation?</i>

631
01:27:45,456 --> 01:27:46,992
Deconsecrated.

632
01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:50,862
Processing.

633
01:27:53,264 --> 01:27:54,366
<i>Administrator.</i>

634
01:27:55,433 --> 01:28:00,005
<i>File. The New York
Continental Hotel.</i>

635
01:28:10,413 --> 01:28:14,920
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

636
01:28:22,193 --> 01:28:24,826
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

637
01:28:24,828 --> 01:28:27,495
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

638
01:28:27,497 --> 01:28:29,798
Since you are refusing
to step down

639
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,235
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

640
01:28:34,237 --> 01:28:36,371
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

641
01:28:36,373 --> 01:28:39,077
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

642
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,280
Good evening, gentlemen.

643
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:49,754
This haven is safe no more.

644
01:28:52,422 --> 01:28:55,193
Are services
still off limits to me?

645
01:28:56,027 --> 01:28:57,325
Under the circumstances,

646
01:28:57,327 --> 01:28:59,395
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

647
01:28:59,397 --> 01:29:00,899
What do you need?

648
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:04,835
Guns. Lots of guns.

649
01:29:23,019 --> 01:29:25,022
Let's make a withdrawal.

650
01:29:49,112 --> 01:29:50,512
Remember, sir.

651
01:29:50,514 --> 01:29:53,082
These will be
High Table forces.

652
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:55,452
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

653
01:29:56,153 --> 01:29:57,386
Why?

654
01:29:57,388 --> 01:29:59,123
Much has changed
during your time away.

655
01:29:59,956 --> 01:30:01,056
Like what?

656
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:03,995
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

657
01:30:12,002 --> 01:30:15,937
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

658
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:18,175
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

659
01:30:29,653 --> 01:30:31,453
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

660
01:30:31,455 --> 01:30:35,057
<i>The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.</i>

661
01:30:35,059 --> 01:30:36,691
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

662
01:30:36,693 --> 01:30:38,863
<i>Please make your way
to the nearest exit.</i>

663
01:30:43,466 --> 01:30:46,302
<i>Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...</i>

664
01:30:46,304 --> 01:30:50,004
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

665
01:30:50,006 --> 01:30:51,539
Your transaction
may now be conducted

666
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,245
on Continental grounds.

667
01:30:59,082 --> 01:31:02,284
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

668
01:31:02,286 --> 01:31:05,256
Cool. Very cool.

669
01:31:10,126 --> 01:31:15,063
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

670
01:31:15,065 --> 01:31:16,968
Serious business.

671
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:21,536
Thank you.

672
01:31:21,538 --> 01:31:23,207
Let us begin.

673
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:12,384
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

674
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:14,786
Of course, sir.

675
01:33:36,172 --> 01:33:38,841
I know you'll do
the Continental proud.

676
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:40,511
I'll see you soon, sir.

677
01:33:43,514 --> 01:33:47,182
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

678
01:33:47,184 --> 01:33:48,353
What's that?

679
01:33:48,885 --> 01:33:50,487
Hunt.

680
01:34:03,818 --> 01:34:05,986
If you want peace...

681
01:34:08,987 --> 01:34:10,900
Prepare for war.

682
01:37:23,934 --> 01:37:27,372
Winston! Winston!

683
01:37:31,474 --> 01:37:33,909
I need more firepower.

684
01:37:56,632 --> 01:37:58,600
Armor improvements.

685
01:37:58,602 --> 01:38:01,639
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

686
01:41:25,826 --> 01:41:28,100
No one kills you but me.

687
01:41:29,045 --> 01:41:31,114
Only by my sword, John.

688
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,727
<i>I know you
believe you can keep this up.</i>

689
01:41:45,729 --> 01:41:46,927
<i>But I assure you...</i>

690
01:45:48,922 --> 01:45:53,158
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Wick.

691
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,300
It's an honor to fight with you, Mr. Wick.

692
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,300
He is getting slow.

693
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:31,800
He is been retired for 5 years.

694
01:46:31,801 --> 01:46:35,200
But he is still... John Wick.

695
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,000
We will see.

696
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,502
Be seeing you.

697
01:49:52,148 --> 01:49:54,685
John, you're incredible.

698
01:49:55,617 --> 01:49:56,687
Exhausted,

699
01:49:57,287 --> 01:49:59,219
outnumbered...

700
01:49:59,221 --> 01:50:00,523
Obviously in pain.

701
01:50:01,724 --> 01:50:04,424
And you still beat
all of my students.

702
01:50:04,426 --> 01:50:06,330
If I didn't
have to kill you,

703
01:50:06,862 --> 01:50:09,365
we'd be pals.

704
01:50:09,832 --> 01:50:11,468
Let's do this.

705
01:50:39,229 --> 01:50:41,732
See? We're the same.

706
01:54:28,523 --> 01:54:31,092
I would like to suggest
a parley.

707
01:54:31,094 --> 01:54:32,826
A parley would be good.

708
01:54:32,828 --> 01:54:34,297
<i>Very well.</i>

709
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,977
Are we in play, sir?

710
01:54:48,711 --> 01:54:49,980
Oh, very much so.

711
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:11,101
Hey, John.

712
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,872
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

713
01:55:19,742 --> 01:55:20,944
Yeah.

714
01:55:50,572 --> 01:55:52,539
Yeah.

715
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:56,009
Don't worry about me, John.

716
01:55:56,011 --> 01:55:58,114
I just gotta catch my breath.

717
01:56:00,015 --> 01:56:01,751
I'll catch up to you, John.

718
01:56:06,956 --> 01:56:08,892
No, you won't.

719
01:56:19,602 --> 01:56:20,668
You gentlemen, of course,

720
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:22,936
realize that was
the first wave.

721
01:56:22,938 --> 01:56:25,539
Merely an amuse-bouche.

722
01:56:25,541 --> 01:56:27,074
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

723
01:56:27,076 --> 01:56:28,875
but it only ends one way.

724
01:56:28,877 --> 01:56:31,544
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

725
01:56:31,546 --> 01:56:33,813
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

726
01:56:33,815 --> 01:56:35,048
Oh, you can take
the Continental,

727
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:36,084
I have no doubt about that.

728
01:56:36,086 --> 01:56:38,752
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

729
01:56:38,754 --> 01:56:41,892
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

730
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:44,493
We are High Table.

731
01:56:44,993 --> 01:56:46,429
And we

732
01:56:47,563 --> 01:56:49,166
are New York City.

733
01:56:50,198 --> 01:56:51,902
Are we negotiating?

734
01:56:53,935 --> 01:56:54,970
Hmm.

735
01:56:55,705 --> 01:56:57,040
I believe we are.

736
01:57:02,845 --> 01:57:03,847
Parley?

737
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:06,049
Parley.

738
01:57:09,652 --> 01:57:11,755
What do you propose we do?

739
01:57:15,892 --> 01:57:17,827
Let me keep my power.

740
01:57:18,294 --> 01:57:19,595
Under the Table.

741
01:57:22,564 --> 01:57:24,097
I have served

742
01:57:24,099 --> 01:57:27,034
and been a beacon
of order and stability

743
01:57:27,036 --> 01:57:29,168
to our industry
for over 40 years.

744
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:31,771
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

745
01:57:31,773 --> 01:57:34,678
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

746
01:57:37,013 --> 01:57:38,614
Winston.

747
01:57:44,153 --> 01:57:45,886
You were
merely showing strength

748
01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:48,492
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

749
01:57:51,961 --> 01:57:54,898
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

750
01:57:56,165 --> 01:57:57,634
But what about him?

751
01:57:59,769 --> 01:58:03,206
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

752
01:58:08,778 --> 01:58:10,547
Oh, he has to die.

753
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,914
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

754
01:58:13,916 --> 01:58:15,182
Don't see any other way.

755
01:58:27,063 --> 01:58:28,896
Very well, gentlemen.

756
01:58:28,898 --> 01:58:32,102
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

757
01:58:33,068 --> 01:58:34,937
Good day to you both.

758
01:58:38,974 --> 01:58:40,676
Well played, sir.

759
01:59:15,978 --> 01:59:18,978
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

760
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:20,750
Oh, should be no time at all.

761
01:59:24,754 --> 01:59:26,654
Mr. Wick is gone.

762
01:59:26,656 --> 01:59:28,355
A true tragedy.

763
01:59:28,357 --> 01:59:29,923
You misunderstand.

764
01:59:29,925 --> 01:59:32,926
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

765
01:59:32,928 --> 01:59:34,093
That seems improbable.

766
01:59:34,095 --> 01:59:35,428
And yet, true.

767
01:59:36,898 --> 01:59:39,866
<i>I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.</i>

768
01:59:39,868 --> 01:59:42,136
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

769
01:59:42,138 --> 01:59:43,870
The last thing
either one of us needs

770
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,108
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

771
01:59:49,045 --> 01:59:51,044
<i>For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it</i>

772
01:59:51,046 --> 01:59:53,312
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

773
01:59:53,314 --> 01:59:57,019
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

774
02:00:08,831 --> 02:00:10,166
Baba Yaga.

775
02:00:22,944 --> 02:00:24,046
Mmm.

776
02:00:41,464 --> 02:00:43,996
How you doing, John?

777
02:00:43,998 --> 02:00:46,736
You look as bad as I feel.

778
02:00:48,437 --> 02:00:51,304
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

779
02:00:51,306 --> 02:00:53,777
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

780
02:00:56,377 --> 02:00:59,312
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

781
02:00:59,314 --> 02:01:01,917
Ain't that a bitch?

782
02:01:07,355 --> 02:01:11,357
Oh, John fucking Wick.

783
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:14,061
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

784
02:01:14,063 --> 02:01:15,462
and you take the fall.

785
02:01:15,464 --> 02:01:16,597
Can't say I blame him.

786
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:19,102
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

787
02:01:20,035 --> 02:01:22,805
But this High Table shit...

788
02:01:25,808 --> 02:01:27,410
Seven cuts.

789
02:01:31,045 --> 02:01:33,782
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

790
02:01:35,483 --> 02:01:38,518
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

791
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,924
you better cut him
to the quick.

792
02:01:45,426 --> 02:01:46,929
So...

793
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:51,201
Let me ask you, John.

794
02:01:51,867 --> 02:01:52,902
How do you feel?

795
02:01:55,403 --> 02:01:59,843
'Cause I am really pissed off.

796
02:02:00,475 --> 02:02:02,441
You pissed, John?

797
02:02:02,443 --> 02:02:03,910
Hmm?

798
02:02:03,912 --> 02:02:05,013
Are you?

799
02:02:14,857 --> 02:02:16,459
Yeah.

800
02:02:19,136 --> 02:02:24,136
