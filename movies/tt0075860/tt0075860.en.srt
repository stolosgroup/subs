00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,378
Are we the first?

3
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:29,837
What do you say?

4
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,960
Are we the first to arrive here?

5
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:33,980
What is he saying?
I don't know.

6
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,585
Are we the first?

7
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:39,694
Yes you are.

8
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,548
We are the first to be here?

9
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,183
Is the interpreter with you?

10
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:19,133
I'm not a professional interpreter.

11
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,389
My occupation is cartography.

12
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,357
I'm a mapmaker.

13
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,812
Can you translate French into English
and English into French?

14
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:30,363
Yes, I explained to the team leader in
Villa Hermosa.

15
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,595
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

16
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,228
Are you Mr Loglin?

17
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:36,188
Laughlin.

18
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,450
Oh, Laughlin. Sorry.

19
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,175
Congratulation.
Thank you.

20
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,668
They're all there! All of them!

21
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,328
Check for landing marks!

22
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
I wants the factory numbers
off the engine blocks!

23
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,233
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks!

24
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,696
M-447148!

25
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:53,442
W-445529!

26
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,936
Number 445529, check!

27
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,494
Approximately, 46 gallons
in the right tank!

28
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,741
447149, check!

29
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:07,666
Will you please tell me something?
What the hell is happening here?

30
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,914
It's flight number 19!
19 what?

31
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,395
It's that training mission

32
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,882
from the naval air
station at Fort Lauderdale.

33
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,796
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

34
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:19,791
Who flies crates like these anymore?

35
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:20,853
No one!

36
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:24,445
These planes were reported
missing in 1945.

37
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:31,531
But it looks brand-new!

38
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,428
Where's the pilot?

39
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,323
I don't understand!

40
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,486
Where's the crew? Hey?

41
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,882
How the hell did it get here?

42
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,207
This is the old man who saw!

43
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,709
No. No I don't understand Spanish.

44
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,892
You speak Spanish?

45
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:15,678
You speak Spanish?

46
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,151
Tell what happened!

47
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:19,055
The old man saw it all last night!

48
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,864
He says this guy's local.

49
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,945
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

50
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,336
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

51
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,636
Tell me what you saw!

52
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,780
What happened?

53
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,746
What happened?

54
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,614
How long are you going
to be sitting here?

55
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,028
Do you live around here?

56
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:47,381
Old man,

57
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:48,506
tell me!

58
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,332
Sunburn?

59
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,750
Look he's sunburnt, poor man.

60
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:02,699
El sol salió anoche y me cantó.

61
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,781
El sol salió anoche y me cantó.

62
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,364
He says the sun came out last night.

63
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,991
He says it sang to him.

64
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:21,352
He says the sun came here
yesterday night.

65
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,882
And sang to him.

66
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,987
<i>TWA 471 contact 134.4.</i>

67
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,610
Harry, keep an eye on that point-out
I gave you.

68
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:55,472
He's on 122.5.

69
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,032
I'll be right back.

70
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,274
<i>Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?</i>

71
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:05,823
Air East 31, negative.

72
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,677
The only traffic I have is a TWA

73
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,398
L-1011 in your,

74
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,940
6 o'clock position,
position range 15 miles.

75
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,059
And an Allegheny DC-9
in your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

76
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,064
Stand by. I'll take a look
at broadband, over.

77
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:24,733
<i>Air East 31 has traffic, 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.</i>

78
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,778
Air East 31, roger.

79
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,526
I have a primary target
about that position now.

80
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,473
I have no known high-altitude traffic.

81
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:34,086
Stand by, one. I'll check low, over.

82
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,228
Vic, will you check low altitude
and see if they know who this is?

83
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,858
<i>Center, Air East 31.</i>

84
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,064
<i>The traffic's not lower than us.</i>

85
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:44,331
<i>He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.</i>

86
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,712
Air East 31, can you say aircraft type?

87
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,202
<i>Negative, Center, no distinct outline.</i>

88
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,245
<i>To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.</i>

89
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:00,694
<i>It has the brightest anti-collision lights.
I think I've ever seen.</i>

90
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,655
<i>Alternating white to red.</i>

91
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,511
<i>Colors are a little striking.</i>

92
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,473
<i>Center, this is TWA 517.</i>

93
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,326
<i>Traffic now looks like
extra-bright landing lights.</i>

94
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:15,194
<i>I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.</i>

95
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,292
It could be a satellite.

96
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:23,103
Air East 31, I have a primary target now in
your 10 o'clock position, five miles, over.

97
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:24,771
<i>Affirmative, 31.</i>

98
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:28,649
The traffic is proceeding northeast.
No altitude readout.

99
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,045
<i>Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he's gonna be a problem.</i>

100
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,131
<i>He's in a descent about
1500 feet below me.</i>

101
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,944
<i>Wait a second!</i>

102
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,819
<i>Stand by, one.</i>

103
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,702
<i>Ok, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.</i>

104
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,403
<i>He's heading right
for my windshield.</i>

105
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,684
<i>We're turning away immediately
and leaving flight level 350 now.</i>

106
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:50,258
Air East 31, descend
and maintain flight level 310.

107
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,382
Break, Allegheny 444,
turn right 30 degrees...

108
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:56,714
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing.
See what the hell they could be testing up there.

109
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:01,240
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

110
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:02,801
<i>Air East 31, roger.</i>

111
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,439
<i>Traffic is quite luminous and exhibiting
non-ballistic motion. Over</i>

112
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,378
Roger. EA31 continue descent
at your discretion. Over.

113
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,349
<i>Ok, Center.
Descent at pilot's discretion is approved.</i>

114
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,071
<i>The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.</i>

115
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,759
<i>And right by us! Right now!
Now that was really close.</i>

116
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,897
<i>Air East 31 is out of 340.
The trafic...</i>

117
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,181
Ask them if they want to report officially.

118
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,487
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

119
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,001
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

120
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,050
<i>Negative. We don't want to report.</i>

121
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,510
Air East 31, do you wish to file a report
a UFO? Over.

122
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:51,085
<i>Negative. We don't want to report one
of those either.</i>

123
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:55,020
Air East 31, do you wish to file
a report of any kind? Over.

124
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,076
<i>I would not know what kind
of report to file, Center.</i>

125
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,638
Air East 31, me neither.

126
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:04,071
I'll try to track traffic to destination, over.

127
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,373
Barry?

128
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:04,869
Honey?

129
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:16,643
Honey?

130
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,881
Barry!

131
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:25,676
Barry!

132
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,677
Barry!

133
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,680
Dad...

134
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,801
do my problems for me.

135
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,985
I don't have to do
your problems for you.

136
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:51,005
You do your problems for you.

137
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,179
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

138
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:57,452
I don't understand these fractions.

139
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:00,987
Alright. What's one-third of 60?

140
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,497
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.

141
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:05,485
Alright, look.

142
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:07,371
Let's say...

143
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:08,869
that,

144
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,760
this boxcar is 60 feet long.

145
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,220
Ok?
Ok.

146
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,146
And one-third is across
this switch here.

147
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:17,593
Alright?

148
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,192
Ok?

149
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:22,925
And now another train is coming.

150
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,302
Now, how far do you have to
move this boxcar off the track

151
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,521
so that the other train doesn't smash it?

152
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,701
Quickly Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

153
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,793
Brad, any answer.

154
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,075
Honey.

155
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,639
Remember last weekend,

156
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:45,091
you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

157
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,461
Honey?

158
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,082
And you also promised Goofy Golf.

159
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,121
Oh yeah.

160
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,290
Roy,

161
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,597
what is all this stuff on my table?

162
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,503
I thought I told you this was
for my stuff this table.

163
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,985
I mean, you can have that table.

164
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,241
I don't want this on my breakfast table.

165
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:12,936
This can cause tetanus!

166
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,905
What is this?
Hey, you know what's playing in town?

167
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,850
Pinocchio!
I don't want...

168
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,275
The kids have never seen Pinocchio.

169
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,879
You guys have never seen Pinocchio.
You're in luck.

170
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:23,734
I don't believe this.

171
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,237
Who wants to go see
some dumb cartoon,

172
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,807
rated G for kids?

173
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,594
How old are you?
Eight.

174
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,526
You want to be 9?
Yeah.

175
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,606
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

176
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,037
Roy, that is a wonderful way
to win over your children.

177
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,305
I'm not serious.

178
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,908
I'm just saying that I grew up
with Pinocchio.

179
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,474
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

180
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,251
Ok.

181
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,249
Ok, I'm wrong. I'm wrong.
I'm wrong Roy, alright?

182
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:53,373
Toby! You are close to death!

183
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:54,871
Come out here!

184
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:00,852
Ok.

185
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:01,966
Now.

186
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,297
I'm gonna give you your choice,
I'm not gonna be biased in any way.

187
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,422
Tomorrow night you can
either play Goofy Golf,

188
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,686
which means a lot of waiting
and shoving and pushing

189
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:12,166
and probably getting a zero,
or you can see Pinocchio,

190
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,548
which is a lot of furry animals

191
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,288
and magic and you'll
have a wonderful time.

192
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:16,260
Ok?

193
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,525
Now let's vote.

194
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,617
Golf!

195
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,350
Alright, everybody to bed!

196
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,564
No way!
Bed.

197
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,925
Dad said we could finish watching
The Ten Commandments!

198
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,314
Flip that, Toby.

199
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,592
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

200
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,479
I told them they'd watch
only five commandments.

201
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,044
Hello.
<i>Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.</i>

202
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,172
Hi Earl.
<i>We got a big problem coming your way.</i>

203
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,039
What?
<i>I need your old man in the field right now!</i>

204
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,364
Oh, you know Roy can't drive
at night without me.

205
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:40,115
<i>Tell him we're experiencing
an overall outage.</i>

206
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,311
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I can't...
Hey honey!

207
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,575
Jiminy Cricket.

208
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,460
It's Earl on the phone.

209
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:53,810
Hello.
<i>Neary.</i>

210
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:57,373
<i>Get into your truck and report
to line A off area 10 in Tolono.</i>

211
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,451
<i>We're losing power
across the grid.</i>

212
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,100
<i>Has the outage hit you yet?</i>

213
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,959
<i>Neary. Neary.</i>
Yeah!

214
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:05,665
<i>Neary.</i>

215
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:15,171
Hey! Lights!

216
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,644
Hey! Hey!
Lights!

217
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:42,870
Barry!

218
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,641
Barry!

219
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:06,829
Help!

220
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,101
I'm lost.

221
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:09,195
<i>Go ahead.</i>

222
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:10,823
<i>Responding in a...</i>

223
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,188
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

224
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,430
Cough up a Tolono or an interstate.
Highway 90.

225
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:19,522
A little familiar landmark of some sort.

226
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,434
<i>Cornbread Road, south of 20.</i>
Cornbread?

227
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,164
<i>Power must have been restored up there.</i>

228
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,569
<i>Couple hundred neighbors in their P.J.s
think it's Saturday night out here.</i>

229
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,176
<i>Dispatch, this is 411.</i>

230
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,741
<i>Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?</i>

231
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,261
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass!

232
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,822
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?

233
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:41,891
Turkey!

234
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,788
A-34... A-34... F-27.

235
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,247
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12.

236
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,975
<i>Ok. Ten-47</i>

237
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,999
It's meaningless so far.

238
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,423
Ok, come on.

239
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,798
Alright, let's see.

240
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,413
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

241
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:34,230
M-Mary-10.

242
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,654
<i>Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...</i>

243
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,265
Oh, shit!

244
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,262
<i>Unit 10-11, I'm back up on the street.</i>

245
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,137
<i>What do you guys got out there?</i>

246
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:38,982
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

247
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,652
<i>My God, it's bigger than a house.</i>

248
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:45,289
<i>Shaped like a barn.</i>

249
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,266
<i>This is absolutely crazy.</i>

250
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,637
<i>Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.</i>

251
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:04,821
Barry.

252
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:07,698
No!

253
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:09,209
Watch it!

254
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,887
<i>I'd say about four football fields.</i>

255
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,093
Oh, my God!

256
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:16,899
Lady!

257
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:17,890
Lady!

258
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,068
Are you ok?

259
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,262
I'm sorry. I... I didn't even see him.

260
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:22,909
He was just standing right
in the middle of the road.

261
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:24,909
Hello.

262
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,119
Oh, my God.
Hello.

263
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:28,316
Here.

264
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,758
What's the matter with you?
Here.!

265
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,502
Play with me.

266
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,840
Barry, come back here.
Come on, now.

267
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,837
Ice cream!

268
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,571
This is nuts.

269
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,422
Wait a minute!

270
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:16,044
What are you guys doing?
Hey!

271
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:18,066
That's Ohio!
That's a quarter!

272
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:25,369
Jesus bro, look at that.

273
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:27,643
Look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road!

274
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:16,870
Wake up!

275
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:18,872
Honey, Ronnie.

276
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:20,513
Wake up! You're not gonna
believe what I saw!

277
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:22,423
Ronnie.
No, don't.

278
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:24,287
Not now.
No listen, Ronnie.

279
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,008
Ronnie. I never would have believed it!

280
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,057
There was this...

281
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:28,939
In the cab there was this whole...

282
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:31,404
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...

283
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,634
It was...
Roy.

284
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,141
Ike called you.

285
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:37,927
And...

286
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,335
McGovern, they want you to call right away.
No, no, no.

287
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,815
They said they couldn't reach you.

288
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:43,162
I turned the radio off.

289
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,497
Shouldn't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.

290
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,964
It woke Sylvia up two times already.

291
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:49,701
And I think you'd better call them.

292
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,930
You know those pictures in
The National Geographic about,

293
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:53,224
the aurora borealis?

294
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,320
This is better than that.

295
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,021
That's is brilliant.
Come on!

296
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:57,857
Come on, Ronnie, get up.
Come on!

297
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,093
No Roy what's wrong?

298
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:01,513
Nothing wrong, I don't know Ronnie.
Get up! I'm not kidding.

299
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,102
Come on! Come on!
Is it an accident?

300
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,841
No it's not an accident.
You wanted get out of the house, right?

301
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,965
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

302
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:08,803
Ronnie.

303
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:11,239
I need you to see something with me.

304
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,123
It's really important.

305
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:14,962
Ok. Alright.

306
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,419
What about the kids?

307
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,310
What? Oh, the kids!
I'll get the kids.

308
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,686
Sylvia. Come on!
We're going on an adventure.

309
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,824
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.
Up! Both. Come on!

310
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,390
It's better than Goofy Golf!
Come on!

311
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,551
I'm going as fast as I can!

312
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:33,789
Come on.

313
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:37,156
Alright. Alright.

314
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,119
Oh, Hi, Mrs. Harris.

315
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,286
Roy, there is Mrs. Harris.

316
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:45,158
There better be a very good reason for us
doing this, because it doesn't make any sense.

317
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:49,631
Alright, Roy. I really think
you've proved your point Roy.

318
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:51,437
Roy!

319
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:52,786
Roy!

320
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,410
Roy! You're sunburned.
Look at you.

321
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,339
Honey, what is that?

322
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:10,476
Roy, what did it look like?

323
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,464
It was like an ice-cream cone.

324
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,134
What flavor?

325
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:18,553
Orange.

326
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:22,000
It was orange and it wasn't like
an ice-cream cone it was...

327
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,562
It was more like a shell.
You know like this.

328
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:26,275
Like a taco?

329
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,430
Was it like, was it like one
of those Sara Lee...

330
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:31,474
moon-shaped cookies those...

331
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,994
Those, crescent cookies...

332
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:44,859
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

333
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:51,260
I remember when we used
to come to places like this,

334
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:52,468
just to look at each other.

335
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,697
Snuggle.

336
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,026
I don't believe it.

337
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,031
I don't believe it!

338
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,566
Here it is.
I don't believe it.

339
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:32,314
It's the Cotopaxi.

340
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:33,428
Why is it here?

341
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,562
Beats the shit out of me.

342
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,763
Is this the bathroom?

343
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,105
Hey. This is not your toy to play with
every time I turn around.

344
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:35,523
He looks like a 50/50 Bar.

345
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,483
Alright, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

346
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,827
I'm. I'm sorry, but you're not
to play with this ever.

347
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,681
Get out!

348
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:44,603
While I clean up your mess!

349
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,316
Thank you very much.

350
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:08,077
Hey Roy, I found this
overnight tanning stuff.

351
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,247
And I want you to spray it
on half your face,

352
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,137
so it's all one color.

353
00:35:12,149 --> 00:35:14,460
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of, Ronnie?

354
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:17,822
Alright, then we'll tell everybody that

355
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,039
you fell asleep under the sun
lamp on your right side.

356
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,257
What for?

357
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:25,860
Dad, can I ask you a question?
What?

358
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:27,327
Are they for real?

359
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,990
That's what for.

360
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,878
No, they are not for real.

361
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,462
Now I want you to go outside
and have a hot dog, ok?

362
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,227
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

363
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:36,431
Roy look,

364
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:39,169
don't talk about this until you
know what you're talking about, ok.

365
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,323
Ronnie, that's crazy.

366
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,404
If I can't talk about it, how
will I know what's going on?

367
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,187
What?

368
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,281
Mom, I believe in them.

369
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,007
I believe in them too.

370
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:50,083
Oh no, you don't.

371
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:51,744
Dad says we do.

372
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,377
No, he does not.

373
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:55,498
Do you, Roy?

374
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:56,754
Ronnie,

375
00:35:57,126 --> 00:36:00,137
all I want to do is, is, is
know what's going on.

376
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:02,558
What's nothing going on!

377
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,892
It's just one of those things.

378
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:06,045
Which things? Which things?

379
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,823
I don't wanna hear about this anymore.
Ronnie this is very important!

380
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,240
I'm not just gonna let it lay here.

381
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:13,175
I'm gonna call somebody about this!

382
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,656
There is nothing...
I'm not listening.

383
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,244
Ronnie.

384
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:17,941
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

385
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,916
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

386
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,358
I'm going out there again
tonight you know.

387
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:30,088
No, you're not.

388
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,001
Yes, I am.

389
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:33,799
No, you're not.

390
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:35,322
Yes, I am.

391
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:38,984
No, you're not.

392
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,068
Do they live on the moon?

393
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:44,648
They got bases on the moon, so at night,
they can come through your window.

394
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,495
You.

395
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:47,637
This isn't a moon burn,
you know goddamn it!

396
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,923
You live on the moon.

397
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,780
I saw, you came through my window last.
You hurt me!

398
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:54,877
You took all my covers.
Roy's not like that.

399
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:56,156
Liar!
He loves his work.

400
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,410
Don't say that!

401
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,975
What did he do?
He was with us all night!

402
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,057
Ronnie, I won't have to go tonight.

403
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,192
He is not like that at all!

404
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,230
I don't believe it.

405
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,193
Stop yelling at me!

406
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,611
Well, can't you tell him about this?

407
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:10,911
Hello?

408
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:13,304
I can't believe it.

409
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:14,347
Roy...

410
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,497
you got fired.

411
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,793
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

412
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:36,403
Where were the sounds coming from?

413
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:02,632
Ask him where come these sounds.

414
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:05,778
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.

415
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,273
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,476
Do you speak French?

417
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:39,898
Well,

418
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:41,763
I beg your pardon,

419
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:43,801
my English is not good too.

420
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,105
I want to share with you now,

421
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:52,038
the breakthrough
that happened in India.

422
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,242
We think it means something.

423
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,249
We think it is important.

424
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,676
To help you learn,

425
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:05,130
I am using the hand sign
created by Zoltán Kodály.

426
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:08,849
Kodály developed these signs,

427
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:11,215
to teach music to deaf children.

428
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:13,979
So this is the first sound.

429
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:15,455
Please first sound.

430
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:25,710
Second sound.

431
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:32,080
Third sound.

432
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:39,932
Fourth sound, this is same thing.

433
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:45,825
And the fifth, who is that the last.

434
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,524
And now all together.

435
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:54,500
Please.

436
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:37,972
Hello?

437
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Hi.

438
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:41,977
Oh hi, how are you?

439
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,174
Hey you came here too?

440
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,746
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

441
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:47,288
Roy Neary. I am sorry about
what happened with the kid.

442
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,134
I didn't realize...
Good night!

443
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:50,340
What?

444
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,694
Look at you.

445
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,773
You got the same burn.

446
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:00,759
Oh, yeah but...

447
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:03,358
You, you it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

448
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,572
I got to tan the other side tonight.

449
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:08,608
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

450
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:10,502
I'll be right back.

451
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,370
Raise up your head
a bit and give me a smile.

452
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:13,439
Come on, son.

453
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:15,781
Hey he's a little
young for a record,

454
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,759
don't you think?

455
00:42:36,899 --> 00:42:37,870
Weird.

456
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,748
I know this sounds crazy,

457
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,115
but ever since
yesterday, on the road...

458
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:47,064
I've been seeing this shape.

459
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:51,230
In shaving cream

460
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:52,874
and pillows...

461
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,451
Damn it, I know this!

462
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,107
I know what this is.

463
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,381
This means something.

464
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,596
This is important.

465
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:26,757
Here they come!

466
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:28,623
Get the camera!

467
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:29,988
Out of the northwest!

468
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:31,384
Jimmy, come here.

469
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:48,362
It's like Halloween for grownups.

470
00:43:50,684 --> 00:43:51,890
Trick or treat.

471
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:24,479
Wait a minute!

472
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:18,771
Here are the patterns.

473
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:21,513
We just received two
15 minute broadcasts.

474
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:22,674
This non-random signals?

475
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:26,340
104 rapid pulses. After a 5 second
interval, 40 pulses.

476
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,111
Another 5 second break,
and 30 pulses.

477
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:32,763
60 seconds of silence and then
an entirely new set of numbers.

478
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:35,749
40, break 5.
36, break 5. 10.

479
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:38,385
104 rapid pulses.
Lord!

480
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,469
Wait 60 seconds and the whole
doggone thing repeats.

481
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:45,446
Where are the signals from?
Right in the neighborhood.

482
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:48,058
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.

483
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:50,031
It's well within the plane of the ecliptic.

484
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,195
Are these non-random
signals here, 40, 36, 10,

485
00:45:54,482 --> 00:45:55,739
in response to that?

486
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:56,797
No they should be.

487
00:45:56,799 --> 00:45:59,222
We've been sending out this
musical combination for weeks.

488
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,183
But all we're getting back
are numbers.

489
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:08,799
This could mean the India sounds...

490
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,651
reached a dead end.

491
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:11,813
They don't mean a thing.

492
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:13,945
There's still so much
that we don't know.

493
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:16,113
How about where
the signals originate?

494
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,141
Excuse me.

495
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:25,511
What letter is 104?

496
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:29,401
Excuse me.

497
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,450
Before I got paid to speak French...

498
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,153
I...

499
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,225
I used to read maps.

500
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,581
This first number is a longitude.

501
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:49,645
Oh yeah.

502
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:51,776
Two sets of three numbers.

503
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:54,955
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

504
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:57,367
And the first number has three digits,

505
00:46:57,644 --> 00:46:59,769
and the last two are below 60.

506
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:03,710
Obviously it's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

507
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:06,951
These have to be Earth coordinates.

508
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,055
Surely somebody help.
There's a globe in the commissary office.

509
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,144
This is what we need.

510
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:16,738
Maybe there is a release pin
underneath here.

511
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:20,481
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you guys doing?

512
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:22,109
It's heavy, watch your feet.

513
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,700
No, the first group.
Ok.

514
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:28,586
Come on, come on.

515
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:29,751
Ok. Easy.

516
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:36,478
Alright.

517
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:39,687
Everybody, quiet down!

518
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,429
Hold it down! Quiet!

519
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:48,555
The antenna. How dumb!

520
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:51,290
Which way's it pointing?
Northeast, Robert.

521
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:53,446
That's Wyoming.
Continuing and...

522
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:02,234
We're going to need a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

523
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:04,333
I want this down to the square yard.

524
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:07,653
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

525
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:14,537
Listen!

526
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:16,132
Listen.

527
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,474
I receive some information now, listen!

528
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:23,213
Listen!

529
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:00,440
Toys!

530
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:03,353
Toys!

531
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:22,429
Oh, my God!

532
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:53,372
You can come and play now.

533
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:56,065
You can come and play now.

534
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:03,085
Come in through the door.

535
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:08,794
One. Two. Three.

536
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:18,784
Oh, honey.

537
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:21,653
Mom, look! The sun's here!

538
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:25,777
Oh, honey.

539
00:52:27,534 --> 00:52:28,828
Oh, my God!

540
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:08,856
Go away!

541
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:34,666
Clean everything up!

542
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:53,044
Mom, let me listen!
Wait a minute. Wait.

543
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:11,902
Mom, look!

544
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:22,619
Come in through the door.

545
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,569
Barry!

546
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,293
Barry!

547
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,970
Jillian! Jillian!

548
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,128
May we have a statement please?

549
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,308
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

550
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,372
We need it for the 6:00 news.

551
00:55:10,396 --> 00:55:11,396
Jillian.

552
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,479
Mrs. Guiler...

553
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:13,981
They got him.

554
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:15,552
What?

555
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:18,264
Is it true you're leaving
the state to look for your son?

556
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,787
Has there been a ransom note?
Where would you start looking?

557
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:26,164
His name is Barry.

558
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,257
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

559
00:55:30,537 --> 00:55:33,633
Miss Guiler, are you involved
in any kind of parapsychologies?

560
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,843
Turn around, please.
We would like you turn around!

561
00:55:36,844 --> 00:55:39,011
Please. Please.
Turn around, please.

562
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:40,964
You gave the police a report.

563
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:43,308
Would you mind repeating
it for the television?

564
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,907
That's very funny. I don't think...

565
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:47,957
Folks, you can go in now.

566
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:49,544
Room 3655.

567
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:51,525
Ladies and gentlemen,

568
00:55:52,134 --> 00:55:53,833
this is a flying saucer.

569
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:55,179
That's the one I saw!

570
00:55:57,996 --> 00:56:01,026
I swear that's the same one!
It's the one I saw!

571
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:03,856
It's made of pewter,

572
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:05,497
made in Japan,

573
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:07,843
and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

574
00:56:10,275 --> 00:56:11,640
I just wanted to point out,

575
00:56:11,642 --> 00:56:14,598
that to you to show that we're not
all polished brass about this thing.

576
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:16,544
And also to make a point that,

577
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:20,532
last year Americans shot more
than seven billion photographs...

578
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:23,756
at a record of $6.6 billion

579
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:25,746
for film equipment and processing.

580
00:56:26,324 --> 00:56:28,155
Now, with all those shutters clicking,

581
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:31,157
where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

582
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:32,412
Major Benchley.

583
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,987
I've been in the news business
for a long time.

584
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:36,398
And our cameras
have never been able

585
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,036
to take a picture of a plane
crash as it actually happened

586
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:41,908
or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

587
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,322
That's right! That's right..

588
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:45,346
They have fancy lights.
I've seen them.

589
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:53,893
Now there are all kinds of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

590
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,726
Mental telepathy...

591
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:57,668
time travel...

592
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,748
immortality...

593
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:02,045
even Santa Claus.

594
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:05,391
I know it's no fun to go home and say,

595
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:07,133
Guess what happened today?

596
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:09,081
I was in the shopping center,

597
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,459
there was this tremendously bright light

598
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,133
and I rushed outside...

599
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:15,963
and it was an airplane.

600
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,211
Excuse me, sir...

601
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:19,315
I didn't want to see this.

602
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:21,729
I sure wish I had.

603
00:57:22,046 --> 00:57:24,247
You know for 15 years
I've been looking,

604
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:26,604
for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

605
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:28,959
I've never found any.

606
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:32,221
I'd like to, because I believe
in life elsewhere.

607
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,703
Why don't you guys just admit that the Air Force
is conducting secret tests in the Foothills area?

608
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:40,253
It would be easy to say yes to that.

609
00:57:41,532 --> 00:57:43,097
But I'm not going to mislead you.

610
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:44,558
This is not the case.

611
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,761
To tell you the truth
I don't know what you saw.

612
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,852
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.

613
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,055
No, no. Hey, no, no.
Come on. Come on.

614
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,243
I saw Bigfoot once.

615
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,424
1951.

616
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:03,471
Back in Sequoia National park.

617
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:04,605
Had a foot on her,

618
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:07,456
37 inches. Heel to toe.

619
00:58:11,476 --> 00:58:14,508
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

620
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,728
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

621
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:26,842
I was sitting on the porch one night,
looking through the screen.

622
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:29,148
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

623
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,811
It turned red and blue and green.

624
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:33,623
And further it got away,

625
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,183
it just kept pulsating
more and more and more.

626
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:39,372
<i>UFOs do not represent
a direct physical threat</i>

627
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:40,922
<i>to national security.</i>

628
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,777
<i>We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.</i>

629
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:27,367
Let's get in touch with the forest service,

630
00:59:27,548 --> 00:59:30,594
or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

631
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:34,967
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

632
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:43,744
If this mission fully develops...

633
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,285
I get white knuckles
thinking about,

634
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:49,658
what might be ahead for those folks.

635
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:53,308
No. No don't say that...
Your flight will be at 20:00 hours.

636
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:56,378
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

637
00:59:57,535 --> 01:00:00,862
And of course the transportation
will be provided on the other end.

638
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,633
I still like the flash-flood idea.
Where you gonna get the water?

639
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:08,115
We've had about two inches of rain...

640
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:10,982
We can do a survey of dams
and reservoirs in the area,

641
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:12,046
and tell them what one's gonna burst.

642
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:14,691
Besides, there is not enough
water in those reservoirs.

643
01:00:14,852 --> 01:00:16,627
Wait, wait. Contaminated water.

644
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:18,486
Affects people, crops, animals.

645
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,374
Disease.

646
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,520
Yeah, epidemic.
What kind of disease?

647
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,893
A plague epidemic.

648
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,383
Nobody's gonna believe
a plague in this day and age.

649
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,499
Anthrax.
Ranching country.

650
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,732
Yes.
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

651
01:00:31,435 --> 01:00:33,103
That's good. That's good.
I like that.

652
01:00:33,104 --> 01:00:36,130
It'll create a panic but
it may not evacuate everybody.

653
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,721
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

654
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,487
What I need is something so scary,

655
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,544
it'll clear 300 square miles

656
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,216
of every living Christian soul.

657
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,937
Help yourself.

658
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:26,315
I hate these potatoes.

659
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:28,796
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

660
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,457
It's ok.

661
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:18,255
Well, I guess you've noticed...

662
01:03:19,603 --> 01:03:20,806
something...

663
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:23,460
is a little strange with Dad.

664
01:03:27,378 --> 01:03:28,721
It's ok, though.

665
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:32,612
I'm still Dad.

666
01:03:38,089 --> 01:03:39,849
I can't describe it,

667
01:03:40,476 --> 01:03:41,831
what I'm feeling...

668
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:43,795
and what I'm thinking.

669
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,519
This means something.

670
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:52,047
This is important.

671
01:04:04,248 --> 01:04:05,388
That's not right.

672
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,045
It's not right.

673
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:14,802
That's not right.

674
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,828
What is it?

675
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,533
What is it?

676
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:57,929
It's not fair.

677
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:05,097
Tell me.

678
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,464
Open the door, please.

679
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:38,721
Please.

680
01:05:39,515 --> 01:05:40,281
Roy.

681
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:41,639
Roy!

682
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:43,811
Open this door!

683
01:05:44,348 --> 01:05:45,848
Open this door!

684
01:05:51,872 --> 01:05:52,872
Alright.

685
01:06:14,642 --> 01:06:17,056
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

686
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:24,828
Look, Roy.

687
01:06:25,632 --> 01:06:26,578
What it is,

688
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:28,426
is family therapy.

689
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:30,115
We. I mean, we all go.

690
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:31,426
We, we all talk.

691
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:32,577
We. No one is singled out.

692
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:35,077
And maybe it's not your fault anyway.

693
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,524
It's waterproof. It still works.

694
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:40,318
Roy! Promise me you'll go!

695
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:42,491
Please. You crybaby!
You crybaby!

696
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,018
You crybaby!

697
01:06:44,057 --> 01:06:46,218
You crybaby! You crybaby!
Get out of here!

698
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,380
Get out!

699
01:06:47,484 --> 01:06:48,987
Get out!
Come on, you guys.

700
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,100
You crybaby!

701
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:51,995
You crybaby!

702
01:06:51,997 --> 01:06:53,598
Be quiet!
Stop it!

703
01:06:53,984 --> 01:06:55,724
I don't understand what this is!

704
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:57,746
Well, neither do I.
Get out!

705
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,698
Go to your room and close the door.

706
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:05,390
Ronnie?
Yes.

707
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:07,208
I'm really scared.

708
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,358
I want you to help me.

709
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,477
All this bullshit!

710
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,685
It's turning this house upside down!

711
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:15,833
Ronnie.
I just hate you, that's why!

712
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:16,886
Ronnie. Ronnie.
No!

713
01:07:16,985 --> 01:07:17,749
Ronnie.

714
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,121
Just hold it.
No.

715
01:07:19,123 --> 01:07:21,433
Just put your arms around me
and it'll really help me.

716
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,739
It'll really help me.

717
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:24,253
Listen, listen, listen!
Ronnie.

718
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,294
Don't you see what's happening?
What's happening?

719
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,451
None of our friends call us anymore!
Ronnie.

720
01:07:28,452 --> 01:07:30,647
You're out of work! You don't care!
Just a small...

721
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:31,991
You're ruining us!

722
01:07:31,993 --> 01:07:33,517
You're ruining us!

723
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,649
Ronnie, just hold on.
No!

724
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:36,659
No!

725
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,722
Hold on.

726
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:40,910
Ronnie.

727
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:43,270
Ronnie.

728
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:48,331
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

729
01:08:23,874 --> 01:08:26,324
<i>Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.</i>

730
01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:33,210
<i>Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.</i>

731
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,475
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

732
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,511
<i>Well, I guess he's had enough.</i>

733
01:08:47,564 --> 01:08:49,384
Are you going to yell at me?

734
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:06,698
Ronnie?

735
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,219
Everything's fine.

736
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,357
All this stuff is coming down.

737
01:09:25,736 --> 01:09:28,160
It's all gonna be like it was.

738
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:38,450
<i>That's the last straw!</i>

739
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:41,300
<i>Now I use my secret weapon!</i>

740
01:10:11,071 --> 01:10:11,798
Roy,

741
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:15,053
I'm sorry about last night.

742
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:16,338
Roy!

743
01:10:18,284 --> 01:10:19,081
Roy!

744
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,292
Roy, what are you doing?

745
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:24,096
Jesus!

746
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:30,707
Roy!

747
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:32,331
Roy!

748
01:10:33,837 --> 01:10:35,709
The plants are fine there!

749
01:10:36,507 --> 01:10:37,971
Roy can you hear me?

750
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,535
Wait!

751
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,447
Wait! What are you doing?

752
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,139
You're gonna love it!

753
01:10:43,347 --> 01:10:45,512
What do you mean?
You'll really love this.

754
01:10:45,983 --> 01:10:48,239
Roy, what are you doing?

755
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:55,853
Oh, Roy!

756
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,860
My God!

757
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:00,830
Come on, men!

758
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:05,931
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

759
01:11:12,842 --> 01:11:13,661
Stop.

760
01:11:14,156 --> 01:11:15,423
Stop it.
Honey!

761
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:18,004
If I don't do this,

762
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:20,512
that's when I'm gonna need a doctor.

763
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,950
Roy! What are you doing?

764
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:27,961
I got it.
What are you doing?

765
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:30,653
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

766
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:31,561
No.

767
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:32,673
Ronnie, look.

768
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:34,530
You ever look at something
when it's crazy,

769
01:11:34,532 --> 01:11:36,737
and then you look at it
in another way and it's not crazy.

770
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:37,989
You know.
No, I haven't know.

771
01:11:37,991 --> 01:11:40,028
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

772
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:42,627
I don't know what you're doing.
It's just, close your eyes for five minutes.

773
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:43,769
Close your eyes and hold your breath.

774
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:45,328
No!
Everything will be really pretty.

775
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:46,655
Roy!

776
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,724
You're scaring us now.

777
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:49,717
Don't be scared.

778
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:51,754
Just don't be scared.
I feel really good.

779
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:53,545
Everything's gonna be alright.

780
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,814
I haven't felt this good in years.

781
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:58,580
Everything's gonna be ok.
I can feel it.

782
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:04,542
Now what else? What else?
Like this? Like this?

783
01:12:05,929 --> 01:12:06,846
Right.

784
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:47,267
Like this?

785
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,458
Chicken wire.

786
01:13:02,286 --> 01:13:04,254
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law!

787
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:06,115
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

788
01:13:06,323 --> 01:13:07,449
I'll pay you for this.

789
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:08,810
Take it. Take it.

790
01:13:08,825 --> 01:13:10,383
I'm perfectly fine.

791
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,954
Let go of this fence, right now.
You come with me.

792
01:13:13,196 --> 01:13:16,029
Do you want me to hit you?
You let go of that fence!

793
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,219
Toby! Listen to me.
Listen to me.

794
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:20,598
Please come on, right now.
We're going.

795
01:13:20,622 --> 01:13:21,803
Come on, come on.

796
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:23,932
I want to stay here!
Let go of the fence! Come on.

797
01:13:42,192 --> 01:13:43,192
Stay!

798
01:13:44,016 --> 01:13:45,016
Stay!

799
01:13:48,332 --> 01:13:49,301
Where we going?

800
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:50,801
Where we going?

801
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:52,768
Where are we going?
Just get in the car.

802
01:13:52,836 --> 01:13:55,166
Where are we going?
Quietly, quickly, get in.

803
01:13:55,168 --> 01:13:57,170
Where are we going?
Get in there, Toby.

804
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:58,883
Quickly.

805
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,313
Dad needs some more help!
Lock the doors! Lock the doors!

806
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:04,814
Honey?

807
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,321
Dad needs some more help!

808
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:07,758
Quiet! Just lock the doors.

809
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,314
Honey!
Roll up those windows.

810
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,478
This is dirt.
Dad needs some more help!

811
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,368
Honey, where you going?

812
01:14:14,558 --> 01:14:16,028
What?
Where are you going?

Hold it.

820
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:39,271
Will you hold it one minute?

821
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,543

The police dragged the river for him.

942

I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't in the river.

948

I don't believe it's real.

Let's get down there.

952

Get some gas and get down in there.

01:24:58,034 --> 01:24:59,665
Look, I guarantee you.

955
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:01,859

01:25:49,715 --> 01:25:51,941
What do you guys want?
Get your hands off me!

959
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,656
How are you feeling?
I feel fine!

960
01:25:56,793 --> 01:26:00,126
According to my birds, the only bad air
out here is you guys farting around!

961
01:26:10,154 --> 01:26:11,236
Going under.

962
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:12,782
Move them out!
What's happening?

963
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:14,096
Let's go!
What do you want?

964
01:26:14,097 --> 01:26:15,897
Where are we going?
Alright. Go to the van.

965
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,277
Where are you taking her?

966
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,301
Hold it!

967
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:19,711
Roy!
Why can't we go together?

968
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:21,216
Watch your step, ma'am.

969
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,358
Roy!

970
01:26:38,951 --> 01:26:41,031
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.

971
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,985
This is Mr. Lacombe.
Hello.

972
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,482
We need answers from you,

973
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,870
that are honest, direct and to the point.

974
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,203
Where is Jillian?

975
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:53,078
Do you realize the danger that
you and your friend have risked?

976
01:26:54,764 --> 01:26:57,426
In coming here,
you've exposed yourself to toxic gas.

977
01:26:58,121 --> 01:26:58,893
Well, I'm alive.

978
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,043
We're talking.

979
01:27:02,376 --> 01:27:03,682
This is true, Mr. Neary.

980
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:08,931
But if the prevailing winds were blowing
from the south instead of the north...

981
01:27:10,362 --> 01:27:12,563
this conversation would not be
taking place.

982
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:13,784
There's nothing wrong with the air.

983
01:27:15,805 --> 01:27:17,046
What makes you say that?

984
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,532
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

985
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:22,059
Go outside and make me a liar.

986
01:27:26,906 --> 01:27:28,892
Look. I wanna talk to the man in charge.

987
01:27:29,694 --> 01:27:31,687
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

988
01:27:32,221 --> 01:27:33,680
He isn't even an American.

989
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:38,939
Mr. Neary, are you an artist or a painter?

990
01:27:40,696 --> 01:27:41,482
No.

991
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:48,328
Have you been hear?
Hearing a persistent, ringing in your ears?

992
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:50,486
An agreeable ringing?

993
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:51,437
No.

994
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:55,058
Having headaches, migraines?

995
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:56,574
Yeah.

996
01:27:58,116 --> 01:28:00,141
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

997
01:28:00,349 --> 01:28:01,130
Yeah.

998
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:05,203
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

999
01:28:08,093 --> 01:28:10,357
And burning on your face
and on your body?

1000
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:11,990
Yes. Who are you people?

1001
01:28:11,992 --> 01:28:13,035
Look at this.

1002
01:28:13,196 --> 01:28:16,024
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?

1003
01:28:17,088 --> 01:28:18,698
I'm thinking...

1004
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:20,978
Yes he knows the mountain.
Yes he knows.

1005
01:28:22,071 --> 01:28:24,106
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

1006
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:28,460
Have you recently had a close encounter?

1007
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:32,596
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

1008
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:37,305
Who are you people?

1009
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:39,615
Mr Neary, please.

1010
01:28:39,952 --> 01:28:41,546
Look at the faces of these people.

1011
01:28:41,574 --> 01:28:42,683
Of these men and women,

1012
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,428
and tell me if you know them.

1013
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,399
These people are strangers to you?

1014
01:28:47,276 --> 01:28:48,573
Yeah. Except for her.

1015
01:28:51,135 --> 01:28:53,439
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

1016
01:28:54,937 --> 01:28:56,107
Yeah, you might say that.

1017
01:28:57,559 --> 01:28:58,995
But what did you expect to find?

1018
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:00,196
An answer.

1019
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:03,778
That's not crazy, is it?

1020
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:08,859
I think we can put them in
the helicopter with others,

1021
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:10,017
I will speak to Major Walsh.

1022
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,495
Maybe we could verify his credibility.

1023
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:15,848
No, I have a hunch, these people
have been chosen at random.

1024
01:29:15,927 --> 01:29:17,289
It was them, not been others.

1025
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:18,228
They are nothing special.

1026
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:20,140
They were in the right place
at the right time.

1027
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:22,771
Ho... Ho... Ho... Hold it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1028
01:29:23,599 --> 01:29:24,508
Is that it?

1029
01:29:25,768 --> 01:29:27,619
Is that all you're gon...
You're gonna ask me?

1030
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:31,783
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions, you know?

1031
01:29:31,947 --> 01:29:33,717
I wanna speak to someone in charge.

1032
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,607
I wanna lodge a complaint.

1033
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:38,884
You have no right
to make people crazy.

1034
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:42,217
If you think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

1035
01:29:43,605 --> 01:29:46,596
If this is just nerve gas, how come
I know everything in such detail?

1036
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:48,762
I've never been here before.

1037
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,603
How come I know so much?

1038
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:54,261
What the hell is going on
around here?

1039
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:56,171
Who the hell are you people?

1040
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:22,999
Is that it? Answer me!

1041
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:27,255
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home!

1042
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:48,161
Don't leave,
don't leave until I get back,

1043
01:30:48,585 --> 01:30:50,185
I want five minutes.

1044
01:30:50,186 --> 01:30:51,942
Five minutes. Five!

1045
01:30:52,922 --> 01:30:54,865
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

1046
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:32,648
You brought in 12 people
to the decontamination camp,

1047
01:31:32,674 --> 01:31:35,595
Instead of the evacuation
centre where they belong.

1048
01:31:35,849 --> 01:31:37,117
Now, I'd like to know why.

1049
01:31:37,157 --> 01:31:39,790
Because this means something.
Because this means something.

1050
01:31:42,134 --> 01:31:44,823
These people have come from
all over their country,.

1051
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:49,986
To a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

1052
01:31:50,853 --> 01:31:51,979
Why?
Why?

1053
01:31:52,189 --> 01:31:56,027
Because somebody could be trying
to subvert this whole operation

1054
01:31:56,029 --> 01:31:59,687
by sending in fanatics and cultists
and Christ knows what all.

1055
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:01,133
Robert.
Yes.

1056
01:32:07,269 --> 01:32:09,129
This is a small group of people...

1057
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:13,918
who have shared a vision in common.

1058
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:15,764
Look.

1059
01:32:19,141 --> 01:32:20,837
It's still a mystery to me,

1060
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:22,258
why they are here.

1061
01:32:22,681 --> 01:32:24,399
Even they do not know why.

1062
01:32:43,173 --> 01:32:44,173
Jillian!

1063
01:32:46,317 --> 01:32:48,120
Jillian!
Don't! You'll be poisoned!

1064
01:32:48,368 --> 01:32:52,055
Listen, there is nothing wrong
with the air around here.

1065
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:56,367
The Army is getting us out of here
because they don't want any witnesses.

1066
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,812
But if the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

1067
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:03,787
We only wanted to see the mountain.
It was such a coincidence when I painted it.

1068
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:05,377
You can take it off!

1069
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:08,385
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

1070
01:33:09,578 --> 01:33:12,964
Listen. Listen. How many of you
people are for getting out of here?

1071
01:33:18,858 --> 01:33:21,962
I don't know what's happening either.
And I must find out what's going on.

1072
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:31,530
I believe that for every one of these anxious,
anguished people who have come here this evening...

1073
01:33:34,456 --> 01:33:38,452
there must be hundreds more touched by the
implanted vision who never made it this far.

1074
01:33:40,234 --> 01:33:42,283
Simply because they never watch
the television.

1075
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,999
Or perhaps they watched it, but never
made the psychic connection.

1076
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,858
It's a coincidence.

1077
01:33:50,435 --> 01:33:52,004
It's not scientific.

1078
01:33:54,414 --> 01:33:56,062
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

1079
01:33:56,692 --> 01:33:58,615
it is an event sociological.

1080
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:19,889
Hey! Wait a minute!

1081
01:34:36,147 --> 01:34:38,464
My name's Neary!
Larry Butler!

1082
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:40,161
How are you doing?
I'm ok and you?

1083
01:34:40,282 --> 01:34:42,113
Fine, fine!
That's good!

1084
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:44,908
Everybody keep their masks on,

1085
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:47,452
until you're out of
here and out of danger.

1086
01:34:47,454 --> 01:34:50,252
Listen, we want to get out of here!
What's the matter with you?

1087
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,320
<i>Major Walsh. Major Walsh.</i>

1088
01:35:09,909 --> 01:35:10,463
Yes, sir.

1089
01:35:10,465 --> 01:35:12,945
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

1090
01:35:13,331 --> 01:35:15,878
<i>Major, I want you to use infrared,</i>

1091
01:35:16,118 --> 01:35:18,643
<i>and get me a photo analysis
of the northern face.</i>

1092
01:35:18,953 --> 01:35:20,584
Yes sir, it's already been ordered.

1093
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:23,196
<i>Major Walsh, listen.</i>

1094
01:35:23,425 --> 01:35:26,952
<i>I don't like to do this. We're in enough
trouble with these cattlemen already.</i>

1095
01:35:27,582 --> 01:35:31,306
<i>But if you can't get these folks off the
mountain and out of the area by 2000 hours,</i>

1096
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:33,631
<i>start dusting with EZ-4.</i>

1097
01:35:34,303 --> 01:35:35,497
What's EZ-4?

1098
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:39,172
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

1099
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,808
Comes out of Riot Control.

1100
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:44,946
They'll sleep for six hours and
wake up with a headache, that's all.

1101
01:35:45,147 --> 01:35:48,759
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people.

1102
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,177
They were invited!

1103
01:35:57,348 --> 01:35:59,148
They belong here more than we.

1104
01:36:07,421 --> 01:36:09,082
I should not have given up jogging.

1105
01:36:09,494 --> 01:36:11,308
You see that notch
in the corner of the mountain?

1106
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,831
We can make that one in no time.

1107
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:14,116
Here come three more.

1108
01:36:17,346 --> 01:36:19,401
<i>The authority in this park,</i>

1109
01:36:19,515 --> 01:36:23,532
<i>has been superseded by
the United States government.</i>

1110
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:26,532
There's a ravine that leads straight up.
I remember from my painting.

1111
01:36:26,556 --> 01:36:28,561
It's an easier climb.
It faces northeast

1112
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:30,447
It's no good. It's no good
when you get to the top,

1113
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:32,224
it's a 300-foot drop straight down.

1114
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:33,262
Get down!

1115
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:35,368
What do you think is down
on the other side?

1116
01:36:36,398 --> 01:36:37,888
There's a box canyon,

1117
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,918
on the other side
with ravines and trails,

1118
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,420
if you take this,
gradual incline to the right.

1119
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:43,860
I never imagined that.

1120
01:36:43,862 --> 01:36:45,650
In my painting
I only painted one side.

1121
01:36:45,652 --> 01:36:47,292
There was no canyon
in the doodles I made.

1122
01:36:47,294 --> 01:36:48,538
Next time try sculpturing.

1123
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,067
They've given us a
hell of a lot of credit.

1124
01:36:50,197 --> 01:36:51,721
That's a good hour's climb up there.

1125
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:52,677
Come on, let's go.

1126
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,714
<i>The authority in this park,</i>

1127
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:05,223
<i>has been superseded by
the United States government.</i>

1128
01:37:05,427 --> 01:37:10,023
<i>You are entering a military
reservation,</i>

1129
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:12,893
<i>and subject to military law.</i>

1130
01:37:13,102 --> 01:37:14,428
Call the bastard.

1131
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:20,425
Bahama, this is pyramid. Over.

1132
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:21,841
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1133
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:24,109
Nothing to report at midstation.

1134
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,296
Up ahead there is thousands
of places to hide.

1135
01:37:28,089 --> 01:37:31,669
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

1136
01:37:32,154 --> 01:37:35,555
<i>Get everybody off the northern face,
and call the dark side of the moon,</i>

1137
01:37:35,557 --> 01:37:37,046
<i>and tell them we're gonna dust.</i>

1138
01:38:03,986 --> 01:38:05,119
Get down!

1139
01:38:06,355 --> 01:38:09,153
<i>You are entering a military
reservation...</i>

1140
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:12,985
<i>and subject to military law.</i>

1141
01:38:42,624 --> 01:38:43,454
Larry!

1142
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,155
Larry, come on!

1143
01:39:03,045 --> 01:39:05,553
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!

1144
01:39:42,084 --> 01:39:43,982
They're just crop-dusting.

1145
01:39:44,577 --> 01:39:46,318
Los Angeles!

1146
01:39:50,335 --> 01:39:52,529
Larry!
Don't stop!

1147
01:39:53,729 --> 01:39:55,152
Don't look back!
Come on, come on!

1148
01:40:19,408 --> 01:40:20,015
Roy!

1149
01:40:26,762 --> 01:40:27,744
Hurry!

1150
01:40:28,013 --> 01:40:29,797
We're only 10 feet from the top.

1151
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:32,871
Just a few more feet!
We can slide down the other side!

1152
01:40:37,427 --> 01:40:38,365
No!

1153
01:40:40,329 --> 01:40:42,957
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

1154
01:40:43,142 --> 01:40:44,142
Don't come down.

1155
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,771
Come on. Come on!

1156
01:40:47,147 --> 01:40:48,592
Don't worry. We'll make it.
Roy!

1157
01:40:49,285 --> 01:40:51,452
Come on. Come on.
Move it. Move your ass!

1158
01:40:51,454 --> 01:40:52,297
Come on.

1159
01:40:57,593 --> 01:41:00,620
Roy, come on. Come on.
Come on. Please, come on.

1160
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,591
Hurry!

1161
01:41:05,834 --> 01:41:06,926
Hold it!

1162
01:41:11,254 --> 01:41:12,312
Jump! Jump!

1163
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:26,667
Do you see that?

1164
01:41:26,892 --> 01:41:27,840
Oh, yes.

1165
01:41:29,175 --> 01:41:29,979
Good.

1166
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:34,128
<i>Is it on? Ok, check the
speaker system here.</i>

1167
01:41:34,329 --> 01:41:35,921
<i>I want this up all the way.</i>

1168
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,820
<i>Is this one live?</i>

1169
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:40,624
<i>Are you reading me on this one?</i>

1170
01:41:40,648 --> 01:41:42,701
<i>One. Two.
How about here?</i>

1171
01:41:42,725 --> 01:41:43,410
<i>Three.</i>

1172
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:45,120
<i>Three on One.</i>

1173
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:47,244
<i>Testing. Testing.</i>

1174
01:41:47,246 --> 01:41:49,206
<i>Ok, one, two, three, four.</i>

1175
01:41:50,246 --> 01:41:51,975
<i>Testing. Testing.</i>

1176
01:41:52,114 --> 01:41:55,208
<i>One, two, three, testing.</i>

1177
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,552
<i>Gentlemen, ladies.</i>

1178
01:42:04,554 --> 01:42:06,497
<i>Take your positions, please.</i>

1179
01:42:07,686 --> 01:42:09,654
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

1180
01:42:10,019 --> 01:42:13,120
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

1181
01:42:14,455 --> 01:42:17,697
<i>Could we have the lights
in the arena down 60%, please?</i>

1182
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:19,797
<i>60%.</i>

1183
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:27,750
<i>I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?</i>

1184
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,218
<i>Ok, watch the skies, please.</i>

1185
01:42:40,264 --> 01:42:44,474
<i>We now show uncorrelated targets
approaching from the north-northwest.</i>

1186
01:43:34,983 --> 01:43:38,290
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

1187
01:43:47,662 --> 01:43:49,114
You see that?

1188
01:43:51,299 --> 01:43:52,459
Yes.

1189
01:43:53,235 --> 01:43:54,259
Good.

1190
01:44:42,826 --> 01:44:44,707
<i>All ground personnel</i>

1191
01:44:44,981 --> 01:44:47,178
<i>not D-class approved,</i>

1192
01:44:47,743 --> 01:44:49,087
<i>please evacuate</i>

1193
01:44:49,089 --> 01:44:51,224
<i>the center approach marker.</i>

1194
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,719
<i>Audio analysis personnel,</i>

1195
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,928
<i>behind the double yellow line.</i>

1196
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:04,622
LTC, stereo, time and resistance.

1197
01:45:05,473 --> 01:45:06,632
Auto ready?

1198
01:45:07,763 --> 01:45:10,543
Tone interpolation on interlock.
Altitude and tabling.

1199
01:45:10,545 --> 01:45:12,329
ARP and interlock now.

1200
01:45:13,081 --> 01:45:15,572
Speed set at seven and a half.

1201
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:18,900
All positive functions, standing by.

1202
01:45:43,511 --> 01:45:44,468
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1203
01:45:45,284 --> 01:45:46,376
Sunset.
Go.

1204
01:45:47,415 --> 01:45:50,009
Ok. Start with the tone.

1205
01:45:57,314 --> 01:45:58,474
Tang.
Go.

1206
01:45:59,261 --> 01:46:00,695
Up a full tone.

1207
01:46:04,433 --> 01:46:05,698
Down a major third.

1208
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:08,000
<i>Now drop an octave.</i>

1209
01:46:13,606 --> 01:46:14,856
Cool blue.
Go.

1210
01:46:15,011 --> 01:46:16,324
<i>Up a perfect fifth.</i>

1211
01:46:19,382 --> 01:46:21,093
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1212
01:46:26,321 --> 01:46:27,365
Give me a tone.

1213
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:30,217
Re to the second.
Up a full tone.

1214
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,290
Mi to the third.
Down a major third.

1215
01:46:32,494 --> 01:46:34,587
Do to the first.
Drop an octave.

1216
01:46:34,796 --> 01:46:36,491
Do up a perfect fifth.

1217
01:46:36,731 --> 01:46:38,392
Sol to the fifth.

1218
01:46:46,016 --> 01:46:47,116
Faster.

1219
01:46:54,516 --> 01:46:55,813
I know that.

1220
01:46:58,586 --> 01:46:59,746
Faster.

1221
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:04,223
Faster.

1222
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,094
Faster.

1223
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,664
Kick that mule!

1224
01:47:18,188 --> 01:47:19,488
What happen.

1225
01:47:20,942 --> 01:47:22,375
Let's go!

1226
01:47:28,996 --> 01:47:30,519
Faster. Faster!

1227
01:47:56,276 --> 01:47:58,947
It's not easy to express it.
Ah yes, yes.

1228
01:47:58,989 --> 01:48:01,059
You understand, 
you understand I think.

1229
01:48:01,071 --> 01:48:02,431
How happy I am.
Yes. Yes.

1230
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:04,214
Yes me too,
I am very happy tonight.

1231
01:48:04,231 --> 01:48:05,620
I'm very happy tonight.

1232
01:48:05,931 --> 01:48:07,816
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1233
01:48:09,315 --> 01:48:11,720
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.

1234
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:32,448
Mr. Lacombe?

1235
01:48:39,387 --> 01:48:41,846
What is it? What's happening?

1236
01:48:42,177 --> 01:48:43,355
What's coming?

1237
01:48:45,774 --> 01:48:47,195
I don't know but is beautifull.

1238
01:49:37,645 --> 01:49:40,160
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1239
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:42,961
Keep down.

1240
01:49:47,484 --> 01:49:48,884
I would like to know?

1241
01:49:49,157 --> 01:49:50,893
They're talking way over my head.

1242
01:51:01,062 --> 01:51:02,256
Duck, duck!

1243
01:51:38,366 --> 01:51:39,697
<i>Photo one.</i>

1244
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:41,360
<i>Fantastic!</i>

1245
01:51:41,362 --> 01:51:43,235
<i>Keep those reloads coming.</i>

1246
01:51:43,438 --> 01:51:45,030
<i>Fantastic!</i>

1247
01:51:51,755 --> 01:51:53,848
You want to see better?
I can see fine.

1248
01:51:54,106 --> 01:51:55,270
We can't stay here.

1249
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:57,061
I can.

1250
01:51:58,052 --> 01:51:58,889
Why?

1251
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:01,648
Because Barry's not here.

1252
01:52:02,557 --> 01:52:03,900
I'm just not ready.

1253
01:52:08,244 --> 01:52:09,866
I can't, I can't stay here.

1254
01:52:09,868 --> 01:52:10,776
I've got to get down there.

1255
01:52:10,938 --> 01:52:12,177
I know.

1256
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,074
<i>This is data control</i>

Oh, my God!

1262

Holy shit.

1263
01:55:28,328 --> 01:55:29,235
Bizarre.

1264
01:57:19,558 --> 01:57:22,127
<i>There is a safety hazard zone...</i>

1265

<i>signify by beeping twice.</i>

1270

If everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon,.

1271
01:57:47,969 --> 01:57:49,561
Play the five tones.

1272
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:01,326
Give her six quavers, then pause.

1273
01:59:02,932 --> 01:59:04,587
She sent us four quavers,

1274
01:59:04,589 --> 01:59:07,888
a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

1275
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:24,881
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

1276
01:59:24,883 --> 01:59:27,826
I hope somebody's taking all this down.
What are we saying to each other?

1277
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:31,246
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

1278
01:59:31,389 --> 01:59:32,986
It's the first day of school, fellas.

1279
01:59:40,748 --> 01:59:43,949
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

1280
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:03,128
We have a translation airlock
on their audio signal.

1281
02:00:03,411 --> 02:00:05,058
We're taking over
this conversation now.

1282
02:01:07,501 --> 02:01:09,332
Let's go! Come on!

1283
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:47,664
I am Claude Lacombe.

02:02:57,878 --> 02:02:59,849
Lieutenant, welcome home.

1288
02:03:00,614 --> 02:03:02,079
This way to debriefing.

1289
02:03:02,887 --> 02:03:04,075
Harry Ward Craig.

1290
02:03:04,101 --> 02:03:06,160
Captain, United States Navy.

1291
02:03:06,527 --> 02:03:08,422
043431.

1292
02:03:08,822 --> 02:03:09,865
Captain,

1293
02:03:10,241 --> 02:03:11,531
would you come right this way?

1294
02:03:13,928 --> 02:03:15,343
Welcome back, Navy.

1295
02:03:15,345 --> 02:03:16,420
Welcome back.

1296
02:03:18,332 --> 02:03:20,077
Craig, Harry Ward.

1297
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:21,924
Captain, United States Navy.

1298

1299
02:03:24,199 --> 02:03:27,023
Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

1300
02:03:29,043 --> 02:03:31,299
Matthew McMichael, Lieutenant,

1301
02:03:31,527 --> 02:03:33,206
United States Naval Reserve.

1302
02:03:33,549 --> 02:03:35,569
0909411.
Lieutenant.

1303
02:03:35,883 --> 02:03:37,510
Good to have you back.

1304
02:03:38,643 --> 02:03:40,680
<i>Furlow, Otis B.</i>

1305
02:03:41,025 --> 02:03:43,926
<i>Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy.</i>

1306
02:03:44,326 --> 02:03:45,730
They haven't even aged.

1307
02:03:46,369 --> 02:03:47,533
Einstein was right.

1308
02:03:47,535 --> 02:03:49,518
Einstein was probably one of them.

1309
02:03:50,064 --> 02:03:52,328
<i>Erickson, David A.</i>

1310

<i>Lieutenant J.G.

1314
02:04:39,713 --> 02:04:40,810
Monsieur Neary.

1315
02:04:41,963 --> 02:04:43,145
What do you want?

1316
02:04:46,476 --> 02:04:47,962
I just want to know that it's...

1317
02:04:48,409 --> 02:04:49,765
really happening.

1318
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:57,236
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

1319
02:04:58,154 --> 02:04:59,967
I saw you going up in the air.

1320
02:05:00,002 --> 02:05:01,488
Did you see me running after you?

1321
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:02,620
Yes.
Yes.

1322
02:05:03,731 --> 02:05:06,144
Find me the executives,
I need to talk to them

1323
02:05:07,389 --> 02:05:09,095
Alright, now we have to talk.

1324
02:05:12,179 --> 02:05:14,513
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

1325
02:05:14,515 --> 02:05:17,109
<i>Swensen, Matthew Daniel...</i>

<i>reported missing April 1976.</i>

1327
02:05:21,722 --> 02:05:24,157
Are they going away?
Yes.

1328
02:05:28,862 --> 02:05:29,954
Wait a second, wait.

1329
02:05:30,197 --> 02:05:34,424
He says these are ordinary people
under extraordinary circumstances.

1330
02:05:35,469 --> 02:05:38,700
<i>Delores, Rudolph E.</i>

Goodbye.

1334
02:06:00,761 --> 02:06:02,100
Monsieur Neary.

1335
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:05,098
I envy you.

1336
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:06,806
Mr. Neary, I'm told we can count on
your complete cooperation.

1337
02:08:06,996 --> 02:08:08,442
What type of blood do you have?

1338
02:08:08,544 --> 02:08:09,588
I don't know.

1339
02:08:09,691 --> 02:08:10,918
What's your date of birth?

1340
02:08:11,489 --> 02:08:12,833
December 4th, 1944.

1341
02:08:12,835 --> 02:08:15,125
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

1342
02:08:15,293 --> 02:08:17,680
Is there any history of liver
disease in your family?

1343
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:20,051
May the Lord be praised at all times.

1344
02:09:20,293 --> 02:09:23,062
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

1345
02:09:23,064 --> 02:09:24,577
Show us Your ways.

1346
02:09:24,698 --> 02:09:26,729
And lead us along Your paths.

1347
02:09:26,754 --> 02:09:30,360
God has given you
His angels charge over you.

1348
02:09:30,637 --> 02:09:34,164
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey,

1349
02:09:34,290 --> 02:09:35,924
and peaceful days,

1350
02:09:36,102 --> 02:09:39,061
so that with Your holy
angel as a guide,

1351
02:09:39,546 --> 02:09:42,655
they may safely reach their
destination.

1352
02:13:24,404 --> 02:13:25,430
Bye!
