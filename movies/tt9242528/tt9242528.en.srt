00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,291
Hertzko! Help me, Hertzko!

4
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,958
<i>Fighting out of
Brighton Beach, New York,</i>

00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>with 13 wins, eight by knockout

<i>Harry Haft!</i>

8
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,250
- Let's go, come on!
- Hit his head!

9
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,500
- Come on, come on, Harry.
- Knock him out!

10
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,125
Come on, Harry, counter punch.
Counter punch, Harry.

11
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,333
Yes, get him!

12
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,666
Kick his ass!

13
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,375
Counter punch, don't let him
smother you.

14
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,458
- Come on, make him chase you.
- Come on out there!

15
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,916
Yes!

16
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,000
Come on, Hertzko. Dig in.

17
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,958
Don't get so tight.

18
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,541
- Get him!
- Come on!

19
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,875
Come on, off the ropes!

20
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,416
- Three, four...
- Clear your head!

21
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,041
- Six...
- Show him your hands.

22
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:03,041
Look him in the eye.

23
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
All right. All right,
all right.

24
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,625
Look what you did, you kike!

25
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
You killed him, La Starza!

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,375
Yeah, smart boy.
What a smart boy.

27
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,583
Busting up your hands like that.

28
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,458
Why don't you hit the walls?
They're a lot harder,

29
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,791
and rattles a lot less.

30
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,791
- Thirty dollars?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,458
And you're lucky to get it.

32
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,208
Got licked again,
didn't you notice?

33
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,416
- Thirteen wins.
- Seven losses. Six in a row.

34
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,791
What the hell's happened
to you, Harry? Huh?

35
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,166
"Pride of Poland," my ass.

36
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,041
I left the scissors
on the table.

37
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,250
See you in the morning.

38
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,833
Hertzko?

39
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,958
Ding, dong, sing along.

40
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,333
- <i>I'm seeing things.</i>
- <i>Seeing things?</i>

41
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,333
I can't help it,
all the old things.

42
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
- The past is the past.
- I don't think

43
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,250
of the past. The past just
comes, one thing or another.

44
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,666
It's this or it's that.

45
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,500
This is why you don't look
so good in the ring now.

46
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,750
I keep thinking it'll go away.

47
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,416
- Why now?
- If I knew, I would know.

48
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,125
You need to forget.

49
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,041
When you forget enough,
then they're all gone.

50
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,666
- You don't think of the past?
- Sometimes.

51
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,916
But I stop it.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,833
Ding dong, ding along.

53
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,375
In you two, there's a lot
of looking going on.

54
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,750
I'm gonna look at your face,
the way it is?

55
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,041
I just haven't seen
that kind of looking before.

56
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,375
Shh. She's singing like a bird.

57
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,083
Harry Haft? Emory Anderson,
I'm a journalist.

58
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,250
- I covered your fight.
- I could've beat La Starza.

59
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,791
I never gave up.
Write that down.

60
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,291
I'm not really interested
in that, but I am interested

61
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,708
- in your story.
- Everybody knows my story.

62
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,333
I'm the survivor of Auschwitz.

63
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,500
Sure, but nobody's asked
how you survived.

64
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,291
You should go, Mr. Anderson.

65
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,458
- How'd you learn to fight?
- Mr. Anderson,

66
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,083
my brother is not interested.

67
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,458
- Think about it.
- Yeah.

68
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,625
Peretz.

69
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:56,416
Again, someone wants to know.
You don't talk about it.

70
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,875
Never.

71
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,125
What if she reads
my name in the paper?

72
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,958
Eight years, Hertzko.

73
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,333
If you haven't
found her by now...

74
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,500
The sword swallower,
the fire eater,

75
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,958
the snake charmer!

76
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,958
You will see it all
with your own two eyes.

77
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:41,166
Let me ask you this, how much
would you pay to see something

78
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,708
that you've never seen before?

79
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,458
Something that you never
will forget,

80
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,458
a memory that will burn itself
into your mind

81
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:53,708
for the rest of your lives!

82
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,708
We're not even open yet.

83
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,875
- I'll wait.
- Mr. Haft,

84
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,666
I told you three days ago,
there's nothing new.

85
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,541
- Go home.
- So be that.

86
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,958
Meir Kri-shin-sky,
Belchatow, Poland.

87
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,166
- Kri-chin-sky.
- Like I said, nothing. I'm...

88
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,833
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,708
- Look again.
- Look again?

90
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,083
Look where?
I've looked everywhere.

91
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,166
- Look here, look there.
- That's...

92
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,458
- Look over there.
- I've looked everywh...

93
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,833
You keep looking
in the same place!

94
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,291
But that's where
we enter these names.

95
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,916
What's in there?
I don't see you looking...

96
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,166
- Mr. Haft...
- ...at anything other than

97
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,708
- right here, over and over.
- This is it.

98
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,750
- I'm looking there...
- I said look again!

99
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,250
But there's nowhere
else to look.

100
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,166
- What's this?
- Put those down, Mr. Haft.

101
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,083
This? Look in there.

102
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,291
- I said, look again.
- Mr. Haft.

103
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
I said look again!

104
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,916
- Get off me!
- I said look again!

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,458
Miriam, call the cops.

106
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,208
Let him go, please.

107
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,125
- Come with me, please.
- You're crazy!

108
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,291
I understand
how frustrating this is.

109
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm just trying to find her!
He doesn't look.

110
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,583
He keeps looking
in the same place!

111
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,375
Mr. Haft! He's doing
everything he can.

112
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,500
- I need some help.
- I promise.

113
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,083
I need some helpfulness.
He is not...

114
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,416
Would you please
shut up for a second?

115
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,333
And calm down.

116
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,041
Your anger
isn't helping anything.

117
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,333
What's your name?

118
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,958
Miriam. Miriam Wofsoniker.

119
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,541
Miriam.

120
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,208
We are trying
to help you find her.

121
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,583
But you have to trust us.

122
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,083
I'll trust only you.

123
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,166
Coming from you, it's quite
a compliment, I guess.

124
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,208
Um...

125
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,000
this Leah, she's a relative?

126
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,208
No.

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,833
Do you know, she was taken

128
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,041
to Ravensbrück,
Belsen, or Auschwitz?

129
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,041
No.

130
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,916
Also...

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,291
your family, do you...

132
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,416
do you know...

133
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,833
if...

134
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,250
My mother, my father,
my sisters, they're all...

135
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
I feel them inside, gone.

136
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,250
- Sorry.
- But not her.

137
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,625
She's alive.

138
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,833
I fight Marciano.

139
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,666
How hard did La Starza hit you?

140
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,500
I could beat him.

141
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,625
Sweet Jesus. Look,

142
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,000
odds are, Marciano is gonna be
the next world champion.

143
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,500
He don't wanna fight you.

144
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,333
You're a tomato can to him,
you understand? A bum.

145
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,166
I'm the survivor of Auschwitz.

146
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,583
Ain't nobody care anymore.
Not when you keep losing.

147
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,583
I'm sorry, kid, but people
don't wanna hear that stuff.

148
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,833
- The war's over.
- Maybe you can't get a fight

149
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,708
with Marciano.

150
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,250
Don't you go getting salty
with me, man.

151
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,916
I can lock up a fuckin' fight
with Marciano,

152
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,166
- but not against you.
- I need a fight, Barclay.

153
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,041
- Why?
- My girl from back home,

154
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,916
she doesn't know that I'm alive.

155
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,250
She doesn't know that I'm here.

156
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,375
But if my name
is in the papers...

157
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,416
Harry, unless she lives
in the tri-state area,

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,791
and loves that sports section,
I don't like your chances.

159
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:20,083
Then, I have to be...
famous across America.

160
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,708
Barclay, I need a fight.

161
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,875
You smoke?

162
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,791
Never.

163
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,375
Not even in the camps?

164
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,541
No, you trade it for food.

165
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,333
- With whom?
- Guards.

166
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,750
They wouldn't just
kill you first?

167
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,916
Not if they wanted
the cigarettes.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,166
You fill yourself first,
then you give the cigarette.

169
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,375
So, you know how to make deals.

170
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,291
You tryin' to make
a deal with me?

171
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,083
I want to fight Marciano.

172
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,166
And you need publicity?

173
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,791
To make Marciano pay attention.

174
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,250
Tell me your story,
how you survived the camps.

175
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,125
Nobody wants to hear
the truth about the camps.

176
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,083
Well, they shouldn't have
a goddamn choice.

177
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,291
Hey, if you're straight with me,

178
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,500
I will plaster your story
all over the East Coast.

179
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,000
Marciano will take note.

180
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,500
Maybe you gotta ask
your big brother first.

181
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,916
We don't talk here.

182
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,541
So, you were taken
to Auschwitz in 1943.

183
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,000
Auschwitz-Birkenau it became.

184
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,583
And you survived there
for six months.

185
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,916
Now, most people didn't last
more than a month or two.

186
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,333
Look, there's always more than
one side to a story.

187
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,916
I want everyone to know yours.

188
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,250
Whatever it is...

189
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,541
you can't shock me.

190
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,166
Jean?

191
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,916
Jean!

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,916
- No, no, no.
- Jean!

193
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,625
Back to work!

194
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,125
I said, back to work.

195
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,291
Hey, I said back to work.

196
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,833
On your knees, Jew.

197
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,083
Jean, Jean.

198
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,750
On your knees!
I said get on your knees.

199
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,500
I let you live. I let you work.

200
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,625
And you crawl
like rabid dogs, yeah?

201
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,375
- Yes, Sturmmann!
- Yes, Sturmmann.

202
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,000
I wasn't talking to you.

203
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,291
Get up. I said get up...

204
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,541
...or I'll throw you
in the fucking pit myself!

205
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,875
Halt!

206
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,791
Halt!

207
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,500
No! No! Don't! Don't.

208
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,208
Obersturmführer, It's my fault,
kill me. Not him.

209
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,375
Kill me, kill me. Please.

210
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,958
Kill me, not him.

211
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,333
It's my fault, please.

212
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,083
Get up.

213
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,791
Please. Kill me!

214
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,541
Not him!

215
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,666
Kill me!

216
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,208
Please.

217
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,541
Follow me.

218
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,750
Your friend, trading his life
for yours, I was impressed.

219
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,583
- You killed his wife.
- Not me.

220
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,166
The machine.

221
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,541
Welcome to Jaworzno.

222
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
One, four, four, seven,
three, eight.

223
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,458
You belong to me now.

224
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,500
- Hertzko.
- Hmm?

225
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,333
Hertzko Haft.

226
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,333
This is my name.

227
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,916
Obersturmführer,
Deitrick Schneider.

228
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,750
<i>So, what was his plan?</i>

229
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,083
<i>He thought I could be
a... an asset to him.</i>

230
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,791
Hit me. That's an order.

231
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,125
Put your hands up.

232
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,916
<i>And so he trained me,
and I have a good right.</i>

233
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,541
You would tear me apart
if you could.

234
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,083
You want a break, Jew?

235
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,791
I want you
to become an entertainer.

236
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,083
Boxing matches on Sundays

237
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,583
to help the officers
pass the time, and...

238
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,000
to make me Reichsmark.

239
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,166
- Against who?
- Volunteers.

240
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
- Jews?
- Correct.

241
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,833
Winner gets special rations.

242
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,041
Do I have a choice?

243
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,916
There's always a choice.

244
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,500
Get in the corner.

245
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,583
Protect your balls.

246
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,916
Remember...

247
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,208
you fight until one man
can no longer get up.

248
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,875
Make sure you're still
standing at the end.

249
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,791
Stay strong. There it is, focus.

250
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,625
Put your hands up.
Hands up!

251
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,416
Put them up! Hands up!
Hands up!

252
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,750
Come. Come.

253
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,750
Come.

254
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,958
Fight, or I won't stop them
doing what they want to you.

255
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,750
Go. Get your hands up.

256
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,208
Hands up now!

257
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,125
Right!

258
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,750
Yes! Yes!

259
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,291
I said the last
man standing wins.

260
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,791
What would you prefer...

261
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,250
a bullet or the gas?

262
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,625
To the corner.

263
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,958
Who do you love most
in this world?

264
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,125
Mother? Father? Brother? Woman?

265
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,041
Is she worth fighting for?

266
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,000
That's enough of that story.
Write your damn story.

267
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,750
I'm gonna sit
and watch the beach.

268
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,916
Okay.

269
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,750
Hey. Beer?

270
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,958
Yeah, thank you...

271
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,458
Come, come, come, come.

272
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,250
You're a fucking traitor!

273
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,125
I told you to stay quiet.

274
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,208
- What... what did it say?
- I told you, you have to learn

275
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,375
to read English.

276
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,958
It says that you made a deal
to survive by fighting.

277
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,041
What else did you tell
to this writer?

278
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,125
- Nothing, the story's done.
- Done?

279
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:07,291
You don't think, Hertzko.
You never have.

280
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,125
This reporter, he digs.

281
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,791
What the fuck
do you think will happen

282
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,333
when he finds out
what you really did?

283
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,041
This is what I did.

284
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,166
<i>I owe you my life.</i>

285
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,458
<i>A hundred times over.</i>

286
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,375
But am I proud
of how we survived?

287
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:52,166
If I could cut every memory
from my head...

288
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,458
I would.

289
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,500
- Read me from what it says.
- I told you what it said.

290
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,041
Yeah, you told me what it says,
now read to me what

291
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,458
- and how it says.
- What?

292
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,916
Am I making it up?

293
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,291
He wrote it.
You didn't write it.

294
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,041
Yes, he wrote it.
But what it says

295
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,458
- is what I'm telling you.
- But what you're telling me

296
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:20,166
- is your words, not his words.
- Enough!

297
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,208
I don't have time to sit here
and read the whole story.

298
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,083
A story that
should have never been written.

299
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,916
I'm not anxious
to read the story

300
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,541
that you should've never
told him.

301
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,750
I'm changing the subject.

302
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,958
I decided to marry Rushka.

303
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,916
- I want you to be my shomer.
- Rushka?

304
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,750
The singer?

305
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Why?

306
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,000
She survived too.

307
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,041
We understand each other.

308
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,833
- There's no questions.
- That's not love.

309
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,583
What are you? An expert of love?

310
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,458
With Leah, that was love.

311
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,083
Leah was just a girl
you fucked as a kid.

312
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,416
You need to learn
to read English.

313
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,875
You're too tight, man.
You're too tight.

314
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,833
Harry, you hear that?

315
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,291
Move to it. Come on,
dance to it.

316
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,583
Harry, come on, come on,
move to it, baby.

317
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,958
Look, stay loose.
Move your body.

318
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:01,125
Kick it all loose,
the head, the legs. Ha!

319
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,708
Harold? This is a crazy man.

320
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,083
Come on. You can hit
if you're loose, baby.

321
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,541
You can hit. You can hit
if you're loose.

322
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay.

323
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,583
Come on, Harry. Come on,
come on. Come on, come on.

324
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,750
Come on. Keep it loose, baby.
Keep the legs loose.

325
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,583
Hold the body. Hear the rhythm?
Listen to the music.

326
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,333
Okay, now try to let your body
go, try to let your body go.

327
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,708
What do you feel,
what do you hear?

328
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,583
I'm very uncomfortable.

329
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:27,750
You're never gonna stay still.

330
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,416
You're always gonna be moving,
all right?

331
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,625
Keep it all loose, keep it
loose, keep it loose. See?

332
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,791
Keep the head loose.
Don't let it all get tight.

333
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,333
Something like that,
create your own rhythm.

334
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,041
You're making
your own rhythm, that's fine.

335
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,541
Don't think too much,

336
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,833
don't think too much, don't.

337
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,291
- Just go.
- Like that?

338
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,166
Come on.

339
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,375
One, two. One, two.

340
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:53,291
Loose. One, two. One, two. Nice.

341
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:55,625
Come on, Harry.
Stay loose, stay loose.

342
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:56,916
That's it, that's it, tiger.

343
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,791
- Are we dancing yet?
- We're moving, Harry.

344
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,166
- You're doing something, baby.
- We're moving. We're moving.

345
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,500
- Face, face face...
- Where's your face?

346
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,000
You gotta go!

347
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,291
That's it, Harry.

348
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,416
Yeah.

349
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,125
The dago is in!

350
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,083
July the 18th. Rhode Island.

351
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,083
You're fighting
Rocky Goddamn Marciano.

352
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,708
Get your ass back to training.

353
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,958
Marciano, huh?

354
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,416
- Let's go, Jew boy.
- Damn straight.

355
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,875
- You're an animal, Harry.
- Yes! Yeah!

356
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,708
Yes!

357
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:28,958
You hear me? Marciano's gonna
fight himself a fuckin' animal!

358
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,583
Harry,
you all right? Hey?

359
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,083
Harry!

360
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,333
There are people here, Rock.

361
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,916
You're making me look bad.

362
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,791
Work your body. Work your body.

363
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,750
You got an audience, work.

364
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,333
I don't recognize you.

365
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,458
They wanna see Rocky,
not your sister.

366
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,291
Hey, you okay, Leo?

367
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,000
Marciano sees you in here,
he'll rip your fuckin' head off.

368
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,333
- Move
- MARCIANO: Come on. Get in here,

369
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,250
help him up. Let's go,
let's get back to work.

370
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,541
I need a sparring partner.

371
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,041
I'm just here to watch.

372
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,291
You think
I don't know who you are?

373
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,291
He's a hell of a writer, poetic.

374
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,875
It's not all truth.

375
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:27,625
Ah, it never is.

376
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:33,750
I've never
seen one up close before.

377
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,708
I'm sorry.

378
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:40,041
I had a lot of family in Warsaw.
They all died in the camps.

379
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,250
It's a sad history
of our people.

380
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,125
We're always
the fucking punching bag.

381
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,291
You're Polish?

382
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,916
I was born there. Long time ago.

383
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,791
- Charlie Goldman.
- Hertzko Haft.

384
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,000
Harry is the name
America gave me.

385
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,750
My real name's Israel,
don't tell nobody.

386
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,791
Listen, Hertzko,
I got some advice for you.

387
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,833
Don't come here again.

388
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,708
- Any advice on the fight?
- Wise guy.

389
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,250
Israel.

390
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,416
You know why I must win.

391
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,750
You can't.
All you can do is survive it.

392
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,416
Um, just to let everyone know,
the office is closing.

393
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,375
Please come back tomorrow,
9:00 a.m.

394
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,000
Hi.

395
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm sorry, we...

396
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,250
we don't have
anything else on Leah yet.

397
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,708
You're still helping me?

398
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,250
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

399
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,625
You read the story.
You know what I did.

400
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,375
I'm going.

401
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll walk with you.

402
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,875
It reminds me of this old joke.

403
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,583
In the camps, we would joke
about the mother

404
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,416
and the young son
walking on the beach.

405
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,916
The... there was a wave
that the young...

406
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,500
You were telling jokes
while in the camps?

407
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,333
Uh, sometimes.

408
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,833
Um, to not think about
what was,

409
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,833
you needed it, to tell jokes.

410
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:12,125
For a few minutes,
you could... smile.

411
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,916
You get to laugh,
to hear others laughing.

412
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,916
Even if the joke
wasn't so funny...

413
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,375
it was still funny.

414
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,291
I... I never
would've imagined.

415
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,625
What?

416
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:29,125
Well, that you would tell jokes
in such a horrible place.

417
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,125
I'm not very good
at telling jokes.

418
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:39,083
Well, many of us weren't so good
at telling jokes,

419
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,541
but it was good enough.

420
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:45,125
You wanna tell me
about this Leah person?

421
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,750
Why?

422
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,083
Maybe I wanna get
to know you a little better.

423
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,333
Are... are you married?

424
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,083
No. I had a fiancé.

425
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,458
He fought in the Pacific.

426
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:04,583
We were gonna get married after
the war, but he never came home.

427
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,458
I didn't have the chutzpah
to marry Steve before he left.

428
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,500
Steve?

429
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah. Not a Jew.

430
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,875
Um, you think he's still alive?

431
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,083
I did for a long time.

432
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,333
Now I know,
and knowing helps. A little.

433
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,083
But you... you think Leah's gone?
Don't you?

434
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:32,416
No. I hope she's alive,
and we'll keep looking for her.

435
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,500
Why do you keep
looking at me like that?

436
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:44,625
Every survivor in this city
passes through my office.

437
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:48,083
I've heard every imaginable
awful thing.

438
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Harry?

439
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,541
You... you think you suffered

440
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,916
because some fucking shegetz
died in the war?

441
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,875
- I know what you're doing.
- You know less than nothing.

442
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,458
You don't wanna
tell me the truth, fine.

443
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,166
But you cannot
talk to me like that.

444
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,958
I'll talk to you any way I like.

445
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:10,333
Why? Because you earned it?

446
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,666
Because surviving something
terrible gives you the right

447
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,333
to be an asshole
to people trying to help you?

448
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,916
Miriam? Miriam?

449
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,458
I want to tell you...

450
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,750
Oh, Harry,
you gotta see this movie.

451
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,083
When the power
of Sampson knocks down

452
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,083
the whole goddamn temple? Jesus.

453
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,375
- What temple?
- What temple?

454
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,041
What, you mean to say
that you don't know...

455
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,708
...the story
of Samson and Delilah?

456
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,083
He's a goddamn Jewish hero.

457
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,833
Yeah, I know the story.
She cuts his hair.

458
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,083
- Yeah.
- I know that one.

459
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,291
The source
of his strength.

460
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,291
Anyway, Samson knocks down
the whole temple,

461
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:01,458
crushing everybody, people
are trapped, they're screaming,

462
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,333
and bye-bye Samson,
adios Delilah.

463
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,500
Why didn't he ask God for help
before he got blinded?

464
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,125
- Take it up with DeMille.
- Who?

465
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,541
Cecil B. DeMille, the director.

466
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,958
- <i>Crusades, Cleopatra?</i>
- What are you doing here?

467
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,291
I just need some photos.

468
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,291
You must be Pepe.

469
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,333
- Yeah.
- Emory Anderson,

470
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,708
I wrote the story
on your fighter

471
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,875
that's got
the whole city talking.

472
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,541
I just need a few photos
before the big fight,

473
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,250
ask some questions.
What do you say?

474
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,500
That's good,
that's good, right there.

475
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,750
By the way,

476
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,583
I heard about you
lookin' for your girl.

477
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,083
You should've told me.
I got contacts

478
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,666
all over the world.
I could help.

479
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,250
Why would you do that?

480
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,416
I've been divorced three times.
I'm clearly a romantic.

481
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,833
That's great, right there,
right there.

482
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,333
I'm gonna come around this way.

483
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,291
Okay.

484
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:03,791
So... tell me about the Nazi.

485
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,416
Oh, come on. He was your coach,
he fed you, right?

486
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,250
He kept you alive.

487
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,083
This is good,
this is good, right here.

488
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,666
Right?

489
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,041
- Nothing more to tell.
- Well...

490
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,458
he made you the most
protected Jew in Poland.

491
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,416
I made him a lot of money.

492
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,625
Right.

493
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,375
Okay.

494
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,958
I was a pet...

495
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,541
trained dog. Nothing more.

496
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,666
But even a beaten dog
loves its master.

497
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,375
All right... Oh, okay!
Hey, I'm sorry.

498
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,333
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
all I'm trying to say is...

499
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,166
Listen to me,
all I'm trying to say is

500
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,875
nothing is
black and white, okay?

501
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,666
That is the sweet spot
of a true story.

502
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,583
The cracks and the common ground
between good and evil.

503
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,041
Nazi and Jew.
That's all I'm trying to say.

504
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,833
Okay.

505
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,916
I heard a story once.

506
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,791
Uh, about a... a prisoner who...
who lost his cap.

507
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,166
Oh, really, what's that?

508
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,208
If you show up for inspection
without the cap,

509
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,333
you can get killed.

510
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,625
So if this man was found
with no cap, he dies.

511
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:35,333
So he quickly goes back
to the barracks, he searches,

512
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:39,375
he looks, he sees someone
else's cap has been left.

513
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:44,708
He takes it, and he runs out.

514
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,250
The other man comes back
to the barracks.

515
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,458
He's looking,
he's looking for his cap.

516
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,125
Frantic. No cap. The man
who took his cap,

517
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,791
goes out to inspection,
knowing what would happen

518
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,000
to the other man
who no longer has a cap.

519
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,333
After inspection, he goes back
to the barracks

520
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,041
and he hears a gunshot.

521
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,333
He knows that
the other man was killed.

522
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,333
Was he wrong to take the cap?

523
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,208
He lived another day.

524
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,791
Now, these are the choices
we made every day,

525
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,958
choices made
when you were starving...

526
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:37,541
choices made when your...
your gums bleed,

527
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:42,083
and you're sick to your stomach
and you... you shit your pants,

528
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,500
and choices made
when you remember that...

529
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,375
you once had a family.

530
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,416
Choices made.

531
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,291
Take another picture.

532
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,958
I need another bulb.

533
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,666
- Get another bulb.
- All right.

534
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,875
- What is this?
- This is your stage.

535
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:44,833
I don't like that man.

536
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,916
Get in.

537
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,041
- Hands.
- Boxing gloves?

538
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,833
You wanted a real opponent,
you said?

539
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,416
He's a very good fighter.

540
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,250
Before the war,
he could have fought

541
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,083
for the French heavyweight
championships, they say.

542
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,583
- Jewish?
- No.

543
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:06,083
I'm here to see
you fight fairly.

544
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,666
We will use a bell to start
and stop the rounds.

545
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,208
Now go back to your corner,
and wait for the bell.

546
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:18,625
Hertzko, I have a lot of money
bet on you. Hmm?

547
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,333
Enough with the glamour
shots, Rita Hayworth.

548
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:24,375
Come on, get in here.

549
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,625
Move!

550
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,208
Hertzko, Hertzko!

551
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,375
You have to move your hands up.

552
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:05,208
You are fulfilling all of their
expectations.

553
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:14,625
Push him back!

554
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,583
Hertzko!

555
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,166
Yeah!

556
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:46,083
You wanna give up?

557
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,583
Hertzko!

558
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,250
Yes!

559
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,000
<i>They will never
forget what you did today.</i>

560
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,625
<i>None of them.</i>

561
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,583
They may hate you, Hertzko,
but you...

562
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,750
you have their respect.

563
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,000
- I have your respect?
- Of course.

564
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,541
- But you are SS here.
- So?

565
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:01,000
You hate me,
you hate people like us.

566
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,958
You hate...

567
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,541
I don't hate Jews.

568
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,958
That kind of passion
is for simple minds.

569
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,250
All this unpleasantness
in the camps was just...

570
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,375
just a means to an end.

571
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,500
When I was a... a student...

572
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,208
one work spoke to me about war.

573
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,958
"You must either conquer
and rule, or serve and lose.

574
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:31,416
Suffer or triumph.
Be the anvil, or be the hammer."

575
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,250
Choosing to be
the hammer, though...

576
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,541
doesn't mean I enjoy
striking the anvil.

577
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:41,250
- Then why do it?
- Because it's inevitable.

578
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:46,208
All great empires are built
off... off the destruction

579
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,875
of other people.

580
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:51,416
The Romans over the...
the Gauls.

581
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,833
The Normans, the Saxons.
The Mongols, the Chinese.

582
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,791
The Americans and the Indians,
and now...

583
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:00,041
...Germans and Jews.

584
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,958
Hitler was not the first to try.

585
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,208
Your race has been expelled
from every Christian country

586
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:11,750
for the past,
what... thousand years?

587
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:17,666
For... for doing nothing.
For living. For what?

588
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,916
But you didn't fight back,
did you?

589
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,708
- Didn't fight back?
- You didn't.

590
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,833
Any logical person
would see this coming

591
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,750
when Hitler rose to power,

592
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,791
the stripping away
of your rights,

593
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,625
the humiliations.

594
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:38,375
But still your people, they
refuse to save themselves...

595
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,083
- and leave.
- Mm.

596
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,666
I need to piss.

597
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:51,541
My family was from Belchatow,
for 200 years.

598
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:57,208
I'm Polish.
Where were we supposed to go?

599
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,666
I thought Germany could be made
great in a civilized manner.

600
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,541
Brutality followed by peace.

601
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,291
But the monsters of my race
were given free reign.

602
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:14,291
Cruel...

603
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,750
stupid men.

604
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:21,375
Therefore...

605
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,125
the Third Reich will fall.

606
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,250
And I will testify
to every horror.

607
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,500
If you want to shoot me,
you have to take the safety off.

608
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,291
"Didn't fight back"?

609
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,166
But tell me, my friend,
where will you go?

610
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,416
In a stolen SS car?

611
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,291
Ask yourself, is this truly
a survivor's move...

612
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:04,041
to kill the one man standing
between you and the gas?

613
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,958
Do you feel powerful?

614
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,625
I feel nothing.

615
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:36,166
<i>Prost.</i>
In English, it's "cheers."

616
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:39,916
How do your people say?

617
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:53,208
- <i>L'chaim.</i>
- <i>L'chaim.</i>

618
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:57,375
Well... <i>l'chaim.</i>

619
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,291
<i>To life.</i>

620
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,375
Hello?

621
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,333
Mr. Haft?

622
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,666
Coming!

623
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,291
It's Miriam.

624
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:40,250
Oh, uh...
I have news about Leah.

625
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,958
- You found her?
- Well, not exactly.

626
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,375
But a survivors' organization
in Chicago

627
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,541
found a woman
who recognized Leah's name.

628
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,041
She says they made it
through Ravensbrück together.

629
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,125
Leah's alive?

630
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,291
Until May, 1945, at least.

631
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,625
Um...

632
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,791
Mr. Haft, I think
you should sit down.

633
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:37,333
Here. Drink that.

634
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,750
Brooklyn's best.

635
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,375
I looked for her.

636
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,958
In Belchatow. She never...

637
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,958
she never came home.
Where is she?

638
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,250
I don't know yet.

639
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,166
It's like a puzzle, I just have
to find all the pieces.

640
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,625
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

641
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,666
You're welcome.

642
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:16,375
Okay, I'm gonna go
get us registered in.

643
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,875
Keep the hands and feet.
Don't let the elbows flare out.

644
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:01,166
Turn the key. Turn the key.

645
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,083
Charlie.

646
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,750
You lost seven
of your last nine fights.

647
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:11,458
Marciano's bigger,
he hits harder.

648
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:13,416
He's got more experience.

649
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,125
Pugilistically speaking,

650
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,083
you were taught wrong
from the beginning.

651
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,416
What? You think I haven't tried?

652
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,750
I'm not blaming you.
I'm blaming the SS.

653
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,541
Look, here's the big secret.

654
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,166
Rocky's got a slipped disc.
He's hurting.

655
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,333
He wants to end
the fight quickly.

656
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,500
What do you do, Hertzko?

657
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:33,708
- Attack. Make him go backwards.
- First rule, Hertzko.

658
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,833
Never play a man
at his own game.

659
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:39,375
Nobody makes up a game
in order to get beat at it.

660
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,083
Come on, man.
Get to the good part.

661
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,500
I'll give you
two days' training,

662
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,000
but you don't tell nobody
I was here.

663
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,291
You understand? Nobody.

664
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:53,833
Two days?
Why would you help me win?

665
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:57,125
Win? Boychik, I'm just
giving you a chance

666
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:59,416
to lose with a little dignity.

667
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,625
I'm gonna get you bobbing
and weaving if it kills me.

668
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,916
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

669
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Marciano is built
like a tank.

670
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,708
No, he's not.
And he's got those...

671
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,125
those short Tyrannosaurus arms.

672
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:13,208
That's the last time
I use this outhouse.

673
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:16,208
There's stuff down there
from the Revolutionary War.

674
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,625
Aaron Burr probably dropped
a load there.

675
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,666
Joe Lewis
trained up here.

676
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,000
- In this place?
- Man was the greatest.

677
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,625
- Is that coleslaw?
- Yeah, right here.

678
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,750
- Man retires after 12 years...
- Potato salad?

679
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,500
- ...the champion of the world.
- Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,416
Still can't get no respect.

681
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,666
- Why?
- You messing with me, man?

682
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,666
- Is there something wrong?
- Joe Lewis is a Negro.

683
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,625
Best I ever saw.
What's that meat?

684
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,875
You mind
if I ask you something?

685
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,416
One thing I never understood
about the Nazis.

686
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Nazis. What's there
to understand about Nazis?

687
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,791
Whites here
don't like us

688
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:52,416
because of the color
of our skin. But your people,

689
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,375
you look just the same
as the damn Nazis. White!

690
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,916
Nazis don't agree.

691
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,708
No matter how you pray,
it always ends up

692
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,958
in the same place. Yeah?

693
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,750
People will always,
people to hate if they want it.

694
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,583
Hey, Harry, do they even got
spics and, uh, Negroes

695
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,583
- over there in Poland?
- No, none.

696
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,250
- No, really?
- So you know what that means.

697
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:13,791
- No. What?
- No good food, at all.

698
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,875
- You like the ham, Harry?
- Hmm?

699
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,500
The ham. You're eating ham.

700
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:22,708
That's okay.

701
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,583
God doesn't pay that much
attention to me anyway.

702
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,208
And think volume of punches,

703
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,125
because he sure as hell's gonna.

704
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,416
Volume of punches,
volume of punches. Volume.

705
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,125
That's it. That's it.

706
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:35,458
Your feet are either too close
or too far.

707
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,583
They gotta be in the right spot,
so we gotta fix this.

708
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:41,125
Now, look at the loop.
You see it's a U.

709
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,291
We want it straight.
Not too close, not too far.

710
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,083
Now you move. Now you move.

711
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,833
Look, see? Better balance.
Move, move around.

712
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,833
Don't stand in front of him
flat-footed.

713
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:53,250
You know what the last guy
who fought Marciano said?

714
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:56,333
"It was like getting caught
in an airplane propeller."

715
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,083
Keep that balance. Go, go.
Let me see you do it.

716
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:02,666
Go on. That's it.
Pugilistically speaking,

717
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,750
what you gotta do is keep them
on the short breaths.

718
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,041
You move in, you punch him.

719
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,583
You keep him holding that
breath while you punch him.

720
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,416
If you let him
take a deep breath,

721
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,625
you're a dead man.

722
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,500
Volume of punches.
That's what's gonna happen.

723
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:19,083
I'll tell you what he does
before a fight. He sleeps.

724
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,916
- That's it?
- He lays down on a...

725
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,166
on a... on a...
...on the table.

726
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,666
You put a pillow under his head,
he's got the little sweet face.

727
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,041
He sleeps. You wake him up.
He goes out in a ring

728
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:31,000
and beats the shit
out of somebody.

729
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,041
Sure I can't convince you
to switch up teams?

730
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,708
Don't press your luck, Louie.

731
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:41,458
That's it, chin down.
Get in there and look at him.

732
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,833
Defense, defense. Come on.

733
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,833
Now we're talking.
Elbows in, that's it.

734
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,625
I saw the light.

735
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,666
Here. It's to help you sleep.

736
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,625
Ah, no pills.

737
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,208
You know, my big brother,

738
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:41,750
he was a Buffalo Soldier
in the Great War.

739
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:46,291
- Buffalo?
- Uh, colored fighters.

740
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:54,041
In September of 1918, they went
into the Argonne Forest

741
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,666
to push the Germans back.

742
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:58,541
He got pinned down
in a shell hole

743
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,958
for three damn days in the mud,

744
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,208
getting shot at
by the krauts, and...

745
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,583
watching his friends die.

746
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,875
Army sent him home
to my mama, uh...

747
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,833
shaking and screaming.

748
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,208
I know how this shit
stays with you.

749
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,583
With Clyde, it never ended...

750
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,208
not till, uh...

751
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,583
he ended it himself.

752
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,125
There's nothing wrong with me.

753
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,583
You religious,
Hertzko?

754
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:57,666
- After the camps?
- Yeah, me neither.

755
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,666
But life makes you
wonder sometimes.

756
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:06,625
- I got to go back to Marciano.
- I know.

757
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,416
But one last piece
of advice.

758
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,416
Nobody expects you to win.

759
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,375
Nobody even expects you
to put up a fight.

760
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:19,041
And speaking to someone
who's been underestimated

761
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,208
his whole life...

762
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,958
you can use that
to your advantage.

763
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,583
You understand?

764
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:29,083
One other piece of advice.

765
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:31,958
Never buy anything
on the street,

766
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,083
especially diamonds.

767
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:38,583
I wish you blessing
and success, Hertzko.

768
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,291
Pepe said that someone
was waiting for me.

769
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:55,666
Didn't know you liked boxing.

770
01:04:57,166 --> 01:05:00,208
Yes, sure.
Never miss a fight.

771
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:03,291
And Rhode Island in summer
is the best time to visit.

772
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,666
I figured you could use
a friendly face in the crowd.

773
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,875
Maybe we could
get coffee sometime.

774
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:22,291
Yes. Or maybe
we could go dancing.

775
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,750
I have to?

776
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:29,458
- A movie then?
- Yes, a movie.

777
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:34,625
- This it?
- Mm-hmm.

778
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,250
You know what
I would like to see?

779
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,750
<i>On the Town.</i>

780
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,666
- What is this?
- Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra.

781
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,916
I don't know this.

782
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,375
It's a movie, a musical.
It takes place in New York.

783
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,833
Ah, yeah...
...I don't like musicals.

784
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:58,833
It... in real life you don't go
singing to one another.

785
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:03,458
It's a make believe.

786
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:05,625
I haven't had much time
for make believe.

787
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,416
Maybe it's time you start.

788
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,583
I should get going,
get ready.

789
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:28,916
I'll be cheering for you.

790
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,500
Okey-dokey.

791
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,750
Maybe you come
meet me afterwards?

792
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,708
- Maybe, yes.
- Maybe yes?

793
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:47,708
Rocky!

794
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,166
Harry Haft weighs in
at 174 pounds.

795
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,208
This isn't even
gonna be a fight.

796
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:10,250
Rocky Marciano weighs in
at 184-and-a-half pounds.

797
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah, Rocky.

798
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:23,541
<i>♪ Get your kicks on Route 66 ♪</i>

802
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,541
...out of Brighton Beach,
New York.

803
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,708

Harry Haft.

806
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:05,750
And, fighting out
of Brockton, Massachusetts...

807
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:13,416
Rocky Marciano!

808
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,375
Keep poundin' him!

809
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,416
Come on, don't be a target.

810
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,916
Come on,
get off the ropes.

811
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Let's go! Come on.

812
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,916
God damn it!

813
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,500
Okay, guys. Break it up.
Break it up now. Break it up.

814
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,458
Hit him!

815
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,916
- Hit him!
- Beat him senseless.

816
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,958
You looked good
out there, chief.

817
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:58,250
Make him chase you this round.
Open up, open up.

818
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:00,791
Come on, Harry.

819
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,250
Make him chase you.

820
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,000
<i>Hertzko!</i>

821
01:11:58,666 --> 01:11:59,750
Aw, no!

822
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,916
Get him. Get him!

823
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,083
- You all right?
- Good.

824
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,500
- You okay? Look at me.
- I'm hungry.

825
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:13,916
Hungry? I'm hungry too.

826
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,250
Harry, Harry,
are you okay?

827
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,375
That doesn't look good.

828
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,458
You gotta double boil
the anchovies.

829
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:21,666
That's the way to do it.

830
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,375
And I'm gonna toast
the breadcrumbs,

831
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:24,583
the way you like it.

832
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:26,791
Now let's get this
over with, all right?

833
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,666
What's goin' on?

834
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,166
Keep your hands up,
keep your hands up.

835
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,541
Don't let him crowd you, okay?
Don't let him outthink you.

836
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,875
<i>Hertzko, help!</i>

837
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,958
Go on! Double him, double him!

838
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,416
One, two, three...

839
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:37,750
four, five, six.

840
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,291
Let's box!

841
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:04,666
Ref, what are you doing?

842
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,291
Hertzko!

843
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,916
It was tough loss.

844
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:03,875
I'm done.

845
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,333
You had him going
in the first round.

846
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,541
You stepped inside, left, right!

847
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,208
That's it with fighting.

848
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:23,041
Not that I like this
boxing business for you,

849
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:26,125
but maybe you should
think this over.

850
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:29,291
She... she's dead.

851
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,958
- Who?
- Leah.

852
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,083
How did you find out?
What happened?

853
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,125
I feel this, uh...

854
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:42,916
emptiness.

855
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,625
It came over me.

856
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:50,666
- An emptiness?
- Suddenly, in the ring. And...

857
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,000
I feel she's gone.

858
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,500
This is the way you know?

859
01:15:56,583 --> 01:16:00,291
The same way I feel when
what happened to our family...

860
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,125
happened.

861
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,458
I always thought that she died
with the family.

862
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:11,125
When I heard her father
was killed, I thought,

863
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,291
you know, all of them.

864
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:17,541
But you believed.

865
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,583
I fought for her, for Leah.

866
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:35,916
And that was
the only reason for...

867
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,791
for fighting, to be...
Was to be there for her. To...

868
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:53,583
I don't... The words,
I can't, uh...

869
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,833
The words
don't mean anything.

870
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:07,791
What's here is not... here.

871
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,625
Then it's a good time
to end all this.

872
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah, it's a good time.

873
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,708
I just can't think about

874
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:26,458
what the good part
of the good time is.

875
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:30,125
- What?
- I don't know.

876
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:31,583
I don't know what I say.

877
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,125
You want a ride back
to New York?

878
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:39,166
I'm taking Miriam back
with the machine.

879
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,583
I'll see her later.
Tell Miriam, I'll...

880
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:45,041
- I'll talk to her later.
- You sure? It's a free ride.

881
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,666
- I'm not charging.
- You're not charging?

882
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,416
You're a good friend.

883
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,875
- I'm your brother.
- I know that.

884
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:06,000
You're my best friend.

885
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,458
That, you didn't know.

886
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:47,833
<i>Hertzko?</i>

887
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,000
<i>Hertzko!</i>

888
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,458
Come here, Hertzko.

889
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:55,833
Where will you go?

890
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:58,833
<i>The war is almost over.</i>

891
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,083
- Let me go.
- Go?

892
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,250
Go where?

893
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,666
You murdered your own people.

894
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,875
Why like this?

895
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,375
Because it's my duty.

896
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,625
I saved your life.
I made you the hammer.

897
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:37,375
Brother,
I like her for you.

898
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,083
She deserves better.

899
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:46,625
No man should be alone, Hertzko.
They're not built for it.

900
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,333
Now you sound like our mother.

901
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:51,375
Because she's not here
to tell you this herself.

902
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,791
Six million of our people
are dead, Hertzko.

903
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,083
Why did you survive...

904
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,041
if not to live...

905
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:04,916
if not to have children?

906
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,291
Why don't we dance?

907
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:35,208
The band's resting.

908
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:39,041
That's okay. Think of them
playing a slow song.

909
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,250
You always get what you want?

910
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,958
No. But I'm not shy
about asking.

911
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,458
How's my dancing?

912
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,333
Pretty good.

913
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:10,750
Sometime, I might try
dancing with music.

914
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,250
I like this music.

915
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:32,625
I think I forgot
my scarf. Will you come?

916
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:46,583
When I was a little girl, I...

917
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:48,458
before I had to sit
with the women,

918
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:51,375
I would come in here
with my father,

919
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,666
and fall asleep on his lap.

920
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,875
Listening to the songs
and the prayers.

921
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:01,708
It made me feel so safe.

922
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:05,291
Get your scarf, let's go.

923
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,250
You know you can come in.

924
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,708
It was cold.

925
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:25,500
My sister, she had...
she had just given birth...

926
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:32,291
only two hours.
A German soldier walked in...

927
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,708
grabbed the child
from her arms, took him.

928
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:39,125
Threw him into the back
of a truck.

929
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:48,375
Child of only two hours of air.

930
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:59,541
I come from a very...
religious people.

931
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:04,250
No one can tell me that a child
of only two hours of air

932
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,583
has the sins to be destroyed,

933
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,541
to be thrown
in the back of a truck.

934
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:10,875
No.

935
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:19,583
But after all you've seen,
all you've lost,

936
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,791
all our people have lost,

937
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,250
isn't this place
more important than ever?

938
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,875
It's easy to find God
in a synagogue.

939
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:35,250
But where was God
when they threw that baby

940
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:38,125
- in the back of a truck?
- I don't know.

941
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:43,250
Why does this God
ask so much of us?

942
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,625
I don't know.

943
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,583
Sometimes,
I come here to ask questions.

944
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:55,708
- Do you get answers?
- Maybe sometimes.

945
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,916
Well, this God
doesn't answer me.

946
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,500
Keep asking.

947
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:06,875
And in the meantime,
you can talk to me.

948
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:44,416
Maybe you should stop
looking for Leah.

949
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,166
I will share you with Steve...

950
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,708
if you can share me with her.

951
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,375
I can do that.

952
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,041
It's stuck.

953
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,958
Get under the light,
so I can see it.

954
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,416
- Harry.
- I almost have it.

955
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,250
Okay.

956
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:47,625
Harry?

957
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:55,625
I'll be right back.

958
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,958
Harry, it's all right.

959
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,958
To the victor goes the spoils.

960
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Harry?

961
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:31,541
Leah Koscinski from Belchatow.

962
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:37,291
I'm not allowed to mix
with the women's camp.

963
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,708
But I can get a message out.

964
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:46,375
Tell... tell her to survive.

965
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:54,250
Tell her, Hertzko will find her.

966
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:03,750
He's watching.
Wants us on the bed.

967
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:23,708
Harry.

968
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,000
I can't.

969
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:32,916
It's okay.

970
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:41,500
We can just lie down.

971
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:52,666
I'm sorry.

972
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,000
<i>It's okay.</i>

973
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,958
We're closed.

974
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:28,625
Not even
for an old friend?

975
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:37,708
We were never friends.

976
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,541
Eh, maybe so.

977
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,708
Well, it looks like you've made
a nice life for yourself...

978
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,166
so what you do with this
is up to you.

979
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,916
What is this?

980
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,708
It says Tybee Island,
Georgia. But I'd call first.

981
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:06,958
I told you, Harry.
I keep my promises.

982
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,375
You be well.

983
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:55,083
So, that's two dollars
and 50 cents.

984
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,375
Will we see you
at Alan's bar mitzvah, Ronit?

985
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:01,166
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of missing it.

986
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:03,250
You wanna take my place?

987
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:06,041
He thinks he's funny.

988
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:13,583
Will you give me some grapes?

989
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:15,333
- Red?
- Red.

990
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:24,416
- Alan! Get down here!
- You're yelling at him again.

991
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,750
- He's lazy.
- Alan!

992
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,750
Alan, Dad wants you.

993
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:34,458
Get your gloves.

994
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:37,625
I'm doing my Hebrew study.

995
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,458
I said get your gloves.
Button that shirt.

996
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,666
Let's go.

997
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,791
Snap it! Snap it.

998
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:19,916
Fifteen rounds,
don't move from this bag

999
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,291
until you're finished.

1000
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:22,875
Don't come home
until you're done.

1001
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:26,875
Protect! Body, body, body!

1002
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:41,000
- Where's Alan?
- Boxing.

1003
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:44,000
- You just left him there?
- He has to learn.

1004
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:48,375
- You're making him soft.
- You are terrorizing him.

1005
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,000
If he doesn't know
how to throw a punch,

1006
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,375
how can he protect himself?

1007
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:53,083
From what, Harry?

1008
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,250
He would have never
survived the camps.

1009
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,958
And nor would your wife.

1010
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:00,708
Do you need to teach me
a lesson too, huh?

1011
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:02,250
Okay. That's enough.

1012
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,791
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

1013
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,375
<i>Kill me!</i>

1014
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:57,250
Did I hurt you?

1015
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:03,000
- What were you dreaming about?
- Go to bed.

1016
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:07,666
Go to bed.

1017
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:19,875
You know, you'll have
to speak louder

1018
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,250
when you stand on the bimah.

1019
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,833
Dad told me
it doesn't matter, any of it.

1020
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:29,500
Well, he's wrong.
It always matters.

1021
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,583
Now get dressed for school.

1022
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:37,458
He had a bad dream last night.
Why is he like this, Mom?

1023
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:44,291
Alan... your father
will tell you when he's ready.

1024
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,958
When's that supposed to be?
When I'm like 40 or something?

1025
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:50,791
Alan, your father
loves you very much.

1026
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,458
But he doesn't like me,
does he?

1027
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:59,208
I gotta go change.
I'm gonna be late for school.

1028
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:07,000
- Helene, time for school.
- I'm already ready!

1029
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:10,625
Another nightmare?
Third one this week.

1030
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:13,500
You're counting? I'm fine.

1031
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:15,333
No, you're not fine.

1032
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:18,166
Leave me alone, Miriam.

1033
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:29,000
Why? I'm on your side.
I know everything already.

1034
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:37,291
What?

1035
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,666
What haven't you told me?

1036
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,083
I guess you could say
I had a friend, once.

1037
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:58,375
In the camps,
we would look after each other.

1038
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,791
His name was Jean.

1039
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:05,333
If I had a piece of bread,
I would share it with him.

1040
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:07,791
He would do the same with me.

1041
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:11,041
Jean.

1042
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:15,083
I... I know him. He's my friend.

1043
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:17,458
I know that.

1044
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:20,375
But here, I'm your only friend.

1045
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:25,458
I won't. Jean! I won't do it.

1046
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:31,166
I was always impressed with him.

1047
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:34,083
His life or yours?

1048
01:38:35,666 --> 01:38:37,625
Hmm.

1049
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:44,125
Hammer or anvil? Your choice.

1050
01:38:57,666 --> 01:39:00,166
Fight!

1051
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:27,791
He kept saying,
"Hit me, hit me, hit me."

1052
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:27,916
And when they dragged his body
out of that ring...

1053
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:32,250
I fought again.

1054
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:38,583
It keeps going on in my head.

1055
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:45,833
And I can't stop it.

1056
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,750
Harry, you gave
your friend a gift.

1057
01:42:54,250 --> 01:43:00,125
I'm here. He's not.
Tell me how that's a friend.

1058
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:03,000
- You did everything you could.
- No, I didn't.

1059
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:05,708
- I could have said no.
- No, you couldn't.

1060
01:43:05,791 --> 01:43:06,791
I could have stopped.

1061
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,000
- I could have...
- No, you couldn't.

1062
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:09,583
- I could have. I had...
- You didn't have a choice.

1063
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:12,333
- I had every choice.
- That's not a choice.

1064
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:15,875
- And I hit him.
- That's not a choice. No.

1065
01:43:24,958 --> 01:43:27,958
- You have to tell him.
- Tell who?

1066
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:30,583
Your son.

1067
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:33,541
- Tell Alan?
- Yes, tell him.

1068
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:34,625
Tell him what?

1069
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:35,916
He deserves to know who you are.

1070
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,041
Who deserves
to have that kind of darkness

1071
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:41,875
pushed inside of them,
inside of their children?

1072
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:43,708
What sick, cruel person
will do that?

1073
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:47,458
You already are!

1074
01:43:54,416 --> 01:43:55,500
I'm sorry.

1075
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,500
I'll clean it up,
and I'll fix it.

1076
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:03,208
What?

1077
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,291
Fix your family?

1078
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,291
All right.

You bring the bags?

1091
01:46:24,875 --> 01:46:25,958
I think it's raining.

1092
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:29,333
Only a drizzle. It'll pass.

1093
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:36,208
Pops, are you gonna swim
in your pants?

1094
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:38,208
Let's go for a drive.

1095
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:40,875
Alan, change
into your regular clothes.

1096
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:43,541
- We just got here...
- Yeah don't... don't talk back.

1097
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:47,708
You'll swim later.

1098
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:53,750
Harry.

1099
01:46:55,083 --> 01:46:56,083
Why are we here?

1100
01:46:57,083 --> 01:46:59,041
We're on vacation.

1101
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:02,291
Stop lying to me.

1102
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,708
You organized this vacation
out of nowhere.

1103
01:47:06,791 --> 01:47:09,333
You don't look me
in the eyes in days.

1104
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:11,125
I'm... I'm going for a drive.

1105
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,541
She's here.

1106
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:21,083
We'll be at the beach.

1107
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:23,416
If you want to come back to us,
you know where we are.

1108
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:26,416
...a sandcastle
that's 50 feet high!

1109
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:29,416
Same! It's gonna be
so hard to make, though.

1110
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,916
Where's Dad going?

1111
01:48:23,875 --> 01:48:26,916
I'm sorry the weather
has been so unpredictable.

1112
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,041
I, uh, bet the little guy
would like to swim.

1113
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:34,958
- How is she?
- Well, as I said on the phone,

1114
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:37,250
you know, she's grateful
for the good days.

1115
01:48:37,333 --> 01:48:39,875
Sarah, come say hi.
This is our daughter.

1116
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:42,458
Our son, David, is, uh,
playing at a friend's house.

1117
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:45,250
- Uh, this is Alan.
- She's been waiting for you.

1118
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:47,541
She's, uh,
she's out in the dock house.

1119
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:51,958
Uh, Alan, talk to Sarah.
Stay here.

1120
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:54,625
Would you like
some lemonade?

1121
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:56,583
I just made it with real lemons.

1122
01:48:56,666 --> 01:48:58,916
That would be great.
Thanks.

1123
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:04,708
Miriam.

1124
01:50:23,166 --> 01:50:24,166
Michael?

1125
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:30,750
Every day
I'm thankful for him,

1126
01:50:32,166 --> 01:50:33,375
for our children.

1127
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,375
And now he has to put up
with all this,

1128
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:40,625
the doctors, the hospitals.

1129
01:50:43,458 --> 01:50:44,541
But he's good.

1130
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:48,333
He's a good-looking boy.

1131
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:53,333
Must take after his mother.

1132
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,375
Still have your sense of humor,

1133
01:50:56,458 --> 01:50:58,291
even when
you're not speaking Yiddish.

1134
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:03,125
Ah, some words in Yiddish
can never be translated.

1135
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,916
Going to be all right?

1136
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:11,291
There's nothing
the doctors can do.

1137
01:51:34,583 --> 01:51:35,625
You know...

1138
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:38,958
in the camps...

1139
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:43,916
when I wanted to give up...

1140
01:51:50,916 --> 01:51:53,333
I thought about the time
we spent together.

1141
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,791
A few months. Can you believe
that's all the time we had?

1142
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,958
Just a few months.

1143
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:13,833
It kept me alive.

1144
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:17,166
I believe that, Hertzko.

1145
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:19,250
I believe that.

1146
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:24,208
Because two young people

1147
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:26,541
loved each other.

1148
01:52:28,916 --> 01:52:30,750
And we made it to this country.

1149
01:52:32,125 --> 01:52:35,750
We found a different kind
of happiness...

1150
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:40,458
our children. Of our own.

1151
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:43,250
So...

1152
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:47,208
thank you for loving me.

1153
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:59,791
I saw this article...

1154
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:06,958
the day before you fought
with Marciano.

1155
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,833
- You saw that?
- I saw that.

1156
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:21,041
It was the morning
after I married Michael.

1157
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:30,875
I was so happy you'd survived.

1158
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:11,375
Who is she?

1159
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,250
She saved my life.

1160
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:25,083
Alan, when you were born,
all I wanted was for you

1161
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:27,625
not to have to make
the choices I had to make.

1162
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:36,333
And for you...
not to grow up fearful that

1163
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:39,166
someone or some people
would come after you

1164
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,416
because of your faith.

1165
01:54:43,541 --> 01:54:46,958
I didn't want that fear
in your heart.

1166
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:52,291
I'll tell you everything.

1167
01:54:56,291 --> 01:54:57,291
But just once.

1168
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:08,125
I was in a concentration camp.

1169
01:55:14,416 --> 01:55:17,750
Alan. Go, uh, go put
on your swimming shorts.

1170
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:19,541
- Have some fun.
- Great.

1171
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:04,625
I never finished
telling you that joke.

1172
01:56:05,916 --> 01:56:08,000
- What joke?
- The joke

1173
01:56:08,083 --> 01:56:10,500
on the...
on the boardwalk, years ago.

1174
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:14,541
- On the boardwalk?
- About... about the young mother,

1175
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:16,375
the young Jewish mother
and her son...

1176
01:56:16,458 --> 01:56:17,833
- Ah, yes.
- ...walking on the beach.

1177
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:20,125
They're walking on the beach.

1178
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:25,291
All of a sudden, a wave
comes out of the blue,

1179
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:27,625
takes the boy
out into the ocean.

1180
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:30,125
The young mother, she screams.

1181
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:34,083
"God, what have you done?

1182
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:37,083
What have you done
with my only son?"

1183
01:56:37,166 --> 01:56:38,833
Out of nowhere, another wave

1184
01:56:38,916 --> 01:56:41,750
throws the child back
onto the beach.

1185
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:45,208
She holds him, she squeezes him,
she kisses his head.

1186
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:47,500
She looks up to the sky
and she says,

1187
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:49,708
"He had a hat!"

1188
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,291
<i>We're a long way from our homes,</i>

1189
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:25,458
<i>and away from much
that has happened to us, and...</i>

1190
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:27,708
<i>to so many of us.</i>

1191
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,625
Now we're here
in this new country,

1192
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:32,458
where we have been accepted,

1193
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:35,625
and where we live without fear.

1194
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:38,208
I would like to sing a song.

1195
01:58:53,291 --> 01:59:00,375
<i>♪ My home sweet home ♪</i>

1196
