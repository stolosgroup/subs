3
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:39,683
How long is this gonna take?

4
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:42,254
That's really up to you.

5
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,988
Right, then.

6
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,925
I know how this bit goes.

7
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:56,567
My name is
Elton Hercules John...

8
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,442
and I'm an alcoholic.

9
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,814
And a cocaine addict.

10
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,586
And a sex addict.

11
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,125
And a bulimic.

12
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,595
I'm also a shopaholic,
who has problems with weed...

13
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,098
prescription drugs...

14
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,070
and anger management.

15
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:35,437
Why are you here now?

16
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,005
Well, my dealer was out of town.

17
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,043
I thought this seemed like
a good alternative.

18
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:49,186
I'm here because
I want to get better.

19
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:52,054
What were you like
as a child, Elton?

20
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,489

44
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:42,297
Reggie! You're late!

45
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:45,235
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.

46
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,046
Is he back?

47
00:05:58,381 --> 00:05:59,615
What am I? Thin air?

48
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,682
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

49
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,118
He's very unreliable
and very selfish.

50
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,388
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?

51
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,690
Reggie! Move!

52
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,093
Got to get this done
before I go out.

53
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,961
All right, all done.

54
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:16,763
Put it away before you go out.

55
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:18,667
Mum, I've got to go.

56
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:20,769
Where's my cardigan?

57
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,494
What?
Did I do something wrong?

58
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:47,928
Bloody hell, Sheila.

59
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,832
Maybe we should
get him some lessons.

60
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,668
Love to. Get him out
from under my feet.

61
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,774
Go on, play it again.

62
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,843
I want to play it for Dad.

63
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,783
Managed to drag yourself
home then.

64
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,154
- Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?

65
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,721
Like you care.

66
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,392
Come on.
You're letting in a draft.

67
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,296
How long you back?

68
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,832
I've got
a couple of weeks' leave.

69
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,466
Reggie's not long gone to bed.

70
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,970
Go on. Pop up, say hello.

71
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:30,972
I'll see him tomorrow.

72
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,441
Any dinner left?

73
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:36,878
Or have you fed it all
to that boy?

74
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,849
My dad was passionate about...

75
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,919
family and music.

76
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:47,089
He'd talk for hours about jazz.

77
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,322
He was always hugging me.

78
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,358
I was very lucky.

79
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,799
I was actually
a very happy child.

80
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,741
Dad, is it true
you play piano?

81
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,377
I'm saving to get lessons.

82
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,612
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.

83
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:15,816
I'm listening to my music.

84
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,795
I like this one, Dad.

85
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:35,437
Never, ever touch
my collection without asking.

86
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,083
When are you going to hug me?

87
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,185
Don't be soft.

88
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,160
What are you still doing up?

89
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:01,463
Learning.

90
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,332
Turn off the light.
Go to sleep.

91
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,660
Crumbs! That was energetic!

92
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,230
Play another one.

93
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:12,032
The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

94
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:17,102
Mum? My piano teacher
thinks I'm good enough

95
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,473
for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.

96
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,243
The Royal Academy of Music?

97
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:26,180
It has a nice ring to it.

98
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:27,549
"Royal."

99
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:29,283
Scissors.

100
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,589
- What do you think?
- The red one's good.

101
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:39,324
- It's only on Saturdays.
- I've things to do on weekends.

102
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:41,562
- Can't just drop everything.
- I'll take you.

103
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:47,232
- Where are you off to?
- Don't know.

104
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,535
Haven't decided yet.

105
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,840
But whatever it is,
you're not invited.

106
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,543
Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's
good enough for a scholarship.

107
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:56,977
Really?

108
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,310
You think he's got
that kind of talent?

109
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,680
Of course, he has.
But you'd know that

110
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:04,651
if you took the slightest bit of
interest in me or this family.

111
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:17,364
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.

112
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,646
- Can we go home?
- Home? No going home.

113
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:35,849
This is your life.

114
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,552
You have to get over
that silly shyness.

115
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,285
But Mum says I'll never...

116
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,220
Everybody's frightened
at the beginning.

117
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,558
You play at being confident.

118
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,726
Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,

119
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,095
and this is one of yours.

120
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,195
You show 'em you can be
as good as they are.

121
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,634
Better. Number one.
You can do that, can't you?

122
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,369
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Good. Go on then. Here.

123
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,374
Here's for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.

124
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:18,859
Reginald Dwight?

125
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,527
- Yes.
- Hi. How do you do?

126
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,499
Good, thank you.

127
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,534
Take your coat off.

128
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,473
Did you not bring
something to play?

129
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,374
Didn't know I had to.

130
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,144
I see. Well...

131
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,779
So, can you show me anything

132
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:45,051
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?

133
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:07,507
Why have you stopped?

134
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,277
That's as far as you got.

135
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,547
You might have a good memory,
and a good ear,

136
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,785
but you've an awful lot
of work to do.

137
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,421
So, wrists and back straight.

138
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,188
Let's start
with the C-major scale,

139
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,360
both hands, two octaves.

140
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,070
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise.

141
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,742
What you looking at me for?

172
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,629
Reggie. What you doing?

173
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,734
Hello, son. I'm Fred.
I'm a friend of your mum's.

174
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:34,111
You tied me down
with that kid years ago,

175
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,812
and now I've finally
got a reason to leave

176
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:40,051
and be rid of you
and this bloody house!

177
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:05,542
He didn't even give me
a hug goodbye.

178
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,446
He's no good
at showing affection.

179
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,482
Never has been.

180
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:17,387
- I wish I was someone else.
- Oh, don't be silly.

181
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,561
Well, how do you think I felt?

182
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,799
I was a kid.

183
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:35,539
Heartbroken.

184
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,544
People don't care though,
do they?

185
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,717
Anyway...

186
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,454
I'd discovered records.

187
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,857
And rock 'n' roll.

188
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:03,498
I know you like him.
He's quite a dish.

189
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,104
- I would.
- Oh, Mum!

190
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,873
Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

191
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:12,040
You serious about wanting
to be a rock 'n' roller?

192
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,842
Yeah. Of course.

193
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,913
Better get you
the proper haircut, eh?

194
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,750
- Can I get it cut like Elvis?
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

195
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,783
He's like my side
of the family.

196
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,454
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.

197
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:46,274
Congratulations to Dave.
He's won four pork chops,

198
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:49,010
half a pound of prime mince
and a string of sausages.

199
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:51,715
Thank you all! Thank you!

200
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,015
Now, Sheila and Fred's boy

201
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,319
is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.

203
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,655

204
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:01,357
Go on, boy.

205
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,558
Hello.

206
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,797
Bloody hell.
Have you got a fag?

207
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,603
Rubbish!

208
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,639
Reg, Reg,
play the one I like.

209
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:18,208
Excuse me.

210
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,542
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?

211
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:22,145
It'll get knocked off.

It's on me hands.

317
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,362
Watch that, mate.

318
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:18,233
- Elton?
- Yeah?

319
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:20,899
I'm thinking
of changing my name.

320
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,902
Yeah, great.

321
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,804
I'm thinking of changing it
to Elton Dean.

322
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,737
But that's my name.

323
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:29,309
Yeah, I know.
What do you think?

324
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,511
I think, fuck off!

325
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:33,681
Right.

Ten a penny, mate.

330
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,133
I sing, too.

331
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,900
What sort of stuff?

332
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:56,737
Well, anything.

333
00:25:57,137 --> 00:26:00,038
Rock, soul,
country and western.

334
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,007
Bloody hell, I'm gonna shoot
the next piano player

335
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,777
who sings "Streets of Laredo."

336
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:09,082
Uh, well,
I write stuff, too.

337
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,436
That was good.
I mean, it could do with some words.

338
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,006
Yeah. That's the part
I struggle with.

339
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:35,207
What's it called?

340
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:37,176
Oh, no,
I just made that up.

341
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:39,979
Just now?

342
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,117
What did you say
your name was again?

343
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:47,920
Elton.

344
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,291
- Elton?
- Mmm.

345
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:53,960
Elton what?

346
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:04,136
John.

347
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:06,172
Elton John.

348
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:10,510
What are you doing
in my office?

349
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,379
Just taking a meeting.

350
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:18,118
I'll make you a cup of tea then,
shall I...

351
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,087
boss?

352
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:29,493
All right,
Elton John the piano player.

353
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:31,395
Thank you so much
for coming in.

354
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:33,717
- Leave your details on your way...
- Please, Mr. Williams.

355
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,998
Give me a chance.

356
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,471
Um... all right.

357
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:41,040
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

358
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,648
Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

359
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,450
Thank you for coming in.
Will I hear from you, or...

360
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,332
We'll be in touch.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

361
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:58,290
Okay. Thanks so much
for your time.

362
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,660
No worries. Come on.

363
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,939
One frothy coffee, no froth.

364
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:19,245
- Thanks.
- We close in an hour.

365
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:24,681
- Bernie Taupin?
- Yeah. You must be Elton?

366
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,749
- Yeah.
- Hi.

367
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,319
Well, that's my stage name.

368
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:31,157
You can tell me your real name when
we get to know each other better.

369
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:32,559
Right.

370
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,327
- Uh...
- Um...

371
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,262
- I was thinking... Sorry.
- Have you ever... Sorry.

372
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,232
No, no, please.
After you.

373
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,003
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

374
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,340
Yeah, I got the tape
you sent. It's great.

375
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,310
- Really good.
- Thanks.

376
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:55,712
Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

377
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:58,316
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

378
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,285
I wrote a tune to it.

379
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,952
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

380
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:06,623
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

381
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,860
It was all there, I could see all the
notes, and I just had to get it out.

382
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:13,265
It was like my fingers couldn't work
fast enough to keep up with my brain.

383
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you ever get anything
like that?

384
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:19,205
Uh... not really, no.

385
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,106
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

386
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:26,010
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

387
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,146
Great.

388
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,418
My real name's Reg Dwight.

389
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,755
Cool. Yeah, that sounds
like a cowboy name.

390
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:39,358
Yeah, all I ever...

391
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,725
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

392
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,629
Do you like
country and western music?

393
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:46,027
- Yeah.
- It's good, isn't it?

394
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,399
Have you heard "Streets of
Laredo" by Marty Robbins?

395
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,435
Mmm.

396
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:51,769

- Am I supposed to be impressed?
- It's catchy, Dick.

430
00:31:58,596 --> 00:32:00,696
These guys are special.
I've got an instinct for these things.

431
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:03,133
All right, don't break your
neck sucking your own cock.

432
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:06,738
Maybe we could put these two
into a little beat combo.

433
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:10,005
He's the good-looking one.
We'll make him the singer.

434
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:13,642
Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.
Elton is... He sings the songs.

435
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,012
Yeah, I could just take those
songs and leave, if you like.

436
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,447
Whoa, all right, no offense.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

437
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,716
They are writing
a lot of great tunes, Dick.

438
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,685
There is one
that's perfect for Lulu.

439
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,155
Easy, tiger.

440
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,892
You... You flatmates?

441
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:30,526
No, we live with our mums.

442
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,461
So I do the writing,

443
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,423
I send it down to him,
and then he adds the music.

444
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,798
Who ever heard of songwriters
not living together?

445
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,336
Yes, Lennon and McCartney
are inseparable.

446
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:42,037
- How many songs you got?
- Um, hundreds.

447
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,340
Play another one.

448
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:46,543

It's the one percent
I'm interested in.

find a place to work together,

that gray-haired old tramps'll

You never know.

466
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,603
One day, you might have
enough for an album.

00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:12,495
My wonderful new lodgers!

472
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,463
- They're struggling rock stars.
- Hello. I'm Bernie.

473
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:20,569
Who ever heard of a rock star
with the name Bernie?

474
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:25,541
Lovely.

475
00:34:29,513 --> 00:34:32,149
So what are your plans
now... Elton?

476
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:34,248
Not too sure.

477
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,552
Written a lot of songs,
haven't we? Enough for an album.

478
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:39,588
And Elton's got
himself a girlfriend now.

479
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:42,993
Arabella,
our new landlady. Yep.

480
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:46,295
So what about rock 'n' roll?

481
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:50,066
What about hot chicks
and cocaine orgies?

482
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:51,735
What about fame and fortune?

483
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,503
What about the fact
that you're a fag?

484
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,341
A what?

485
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,446
Your little friend
is a homosexual.

486
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:07,714
No, I've got a girlfriend.

487
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:10,653
When's that ever stopped anybody?

488
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,026
Are you?

489
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,064
Don't know.

490
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,936
Would it matter
if I was, Bernie?

491
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:31,674
No, not to me.

492
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,278
Might matter to Arabella,
though.

493
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,548
- Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.
- Have you met her?

494
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,953
Fuck.

What is it now?

What am I gonna do?

504

You're going to tell her.

505
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,822
It'll break her heart.

506
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:22,057
Not sure she has one.

507

- Come on.
- Yeah.

510
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:37,470
There's so much that we gotta do.
There's worlds to conquer.

511
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:41,143
I mean, America.
Wide open spaces.

Tower Records.

513
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:47,850
Listen, the songs are great.

514
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:52,219
And people keep asking. They're, like,
"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

515
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:54,288
You are a shit-hot piano player,

516
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,957
you have an amazing voice,
and I'm telling you,

517
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,160
there is something
special that happens...

518
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:01,729
when you sing our songs.

519
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:05,399
You heard what Dick said.
He said my hands are like midget boxers.

520
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:06,935
Who cares what Dick thinks.

521
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,871
I just don't know if I'm...

522
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,440
what they're looking for.

523
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,882
It's time for you
to be out front.

524
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:28,890
I love you, man.

525
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,460
I do, but...

526
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:34,996
not in that way.

527
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,205
Yeah.

528
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:47,742
Elton, time for bed.

529
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:56,050
We became inseparable
after that.

530
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:58,953
The brother I never had.

531
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,754
Do you know, in 20 years,

532
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:05,624
we have never had
a single argument. Not once.

533
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:08,830
Anyway, I took his advice,
told Arabella.

534
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,033
She took it very well,
actually.

535
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:16,668
You bastard!

536
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,170
She's killed my piano.

537
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,775
You treacherous beast!

538
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:24,645
Your music's as shitty
as you are!

539
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,115
Hi, Mum.

540
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:29,684
I knew you'd be back.

541
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:33,553
You'll have to pay rent.
I'm not made of money.

542
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:43,398
- Morning.
- Good morning.

543
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,067
- Get dressed, Reggie!
- Elton.

544
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:49,037
I'm not having you
moping around here all day.

545
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,571
We're songwriting.

546
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:53,708
Oh, yeah?
Looks like it's going well.

547
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:59,378
Right. I will not
have a mess in this house.

548
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,848
It's nice and tidy,
and that's how I want it to stay.

549
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,417
I'll not have
a doss house around here.

550
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:08,189
I can't do everything.
I can't cook and clean and wash.

551
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,357
Rely upon me to do everything.
It's not fair.

552
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,592
There's egg on this.

553
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,700
I'd better go
take a shave, I think.

554
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:28,942

I love it. Best thing I've
heard since "Let It Be."

594
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:59,081
Trans-fucking-Atlantic!

595
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,885
Always knew
you boys could do it.

596
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,123
First thing I'm gonna do is
put you on a three-album deal.

597
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:06,925
- Three?
- A year.

598
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:09,726
And I got you a couple of
nights at the Troubadour.

599
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:12,931
- Doug Weston's an old friend.
- Hang on. The Troubadour?

600
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:16,500
- It's this really cool folk club in LA.
- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

601
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:18,503
Hang on. Now, let's not be
hasty, because the thing is,

602
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:20,170
I haven't even got
a backing band yet.

603
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:21,973
No, I've sorted the backup
band, don't worry.

604
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:23,973
Dick, I don't wanna
appear ungrateful,

605
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:25,509
but you can't just spring
the Troubadour on me.

606
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,780
Look, it's time to do
something bold, Elton.

607
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,716
Granted, America's
a bit of a gamble,

608
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:33,018
and you fuck up
and I'll kill ya.

609
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:36,255
But Ray'll go, too.
He'll keep an eye on you.

610
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:40,859
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Get something flashy.

611
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:43,262
Let 'em know who you are.

612
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:46,264
Put on a great fucking show,

613
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:49,735
and just don't
kill yourself with drugs.

614
00:43:50,034 --> 00:43:51,903
Yeah?

615
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,505
Yeah, all right.

616
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,140

00:44:51,764 --> 00:44:53,565
Friends of Dick!

629
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:55,565
Good to see you, Doug.

630
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,535
Ray.

631
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:59,835
How are you?
So good to see you, man.

632
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:01,103
What'd you bring me?

633
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:02,972
Hey, Doug. Bernie.
Nice to meet you.

634
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:04,375
- Hi, Bernie.
- Good morning.

635
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,675
- Hi. I'm Elton.
- Oh.

636
00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:08,344
Sweet. How are you?

637
00:45:08,346 --> 00:45:10,913
Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

638
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:12,415
It's gonna blow your mind.

639
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:14,720
Be totally packed.
You're gonna love it.

640
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,052
It's a bit different
from what I expected.

641
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:18,089
Yeah?

642
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,156
Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

643
00:45:20,158 --> 00:45:22,157
Well, size is
everything, my friend.

644
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,793
Neil Young
played here last week

645
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:26,562
and there were people lined
around the block.

646
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:28,766
Man, it was just...
It was the best night ever.

647
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:31,235
- That's a cool hat.
- Yeah?

648
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:33,805
- You like it?
- I do like it, yeah.

649
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:36,572
- I won that hat, in a bet.
- Oh.

650
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:38,174
- With Bob Dylan.
- Really?

651
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:39,375
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

652
00:45:39,377 --> 00:45:41,010
Elton. This is the band.

653
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:43,179
I'm just gonna check
they know what they're doing.

654
00:45:43,181 --> 00:45:45,781
So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

655
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:47,217
They just flew in from England

656
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,454
and, boy, their arms are tired.

657
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,329
Whoa, dude,
what the hell are you wearing?

658
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:02,533
My stage gear.

659
00:46:02,935 --> 00:46:05,367
Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

660
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:08,037
Neil Diamond is at the bar.
He's talking to Leon Russell

661
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,241
and half the fucking
Beach Boys. Huh?

662
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,313
Jesus, shit, Bernie!

663
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:18,449
Reggie?

664
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:21,385
- Elton. I think you're overreacting.
- No.

665
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:24,753
Bernie, you are under-reacting.

666
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:27,323
They are the geniuses
of American music.

667
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,058
I can't go out there
in front of that lot!

668
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,328
Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug
to refund everyone's ticket,

669
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,430
- and we'll send everybody home.
- Where is he?

670
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:38,266
- Hey, Ray.
- You've signed a contract!

671
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:39,802
Dick's paid
your fucking airfare!

672
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:42,439
Now get out there and play,
you little twat.

673
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:51,516
Well, come on then.

674
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,585
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

675
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:57,153
a rising star in rock and roll.

676
00:46:57,487 --> 00:47:00,992
Please welcome, all the way
from London, England,

677
00:47:01,258 --> 00:47:02,824

- It was so good! You were brilliant.
- Thanks.

712
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:26,094
- This is... This is Heather.
- Hi.

713
00:50:26,096 --> 00:50:27,830
- Hello.
- You were amazing!

714
00:50:29,032 --> 00:50:30,232
Thank you.

715
00:50:31,134 --> 00:50:33,834
All right.
Enough of this bullshit.

716
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:36,237
Who wants to go
to a party at Mama Cass's?

717
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:40,542
I'm so drunk, and Doug's
just lent me his car.

718
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:06,434
- How cool is this, man?
- Yeah, great.

719
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:09,337
Apparently Dylan's
here somewhere.

720
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:13,442
Uh...

721
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:16,011
I'm gonna go to the teepee
with Heather.

722
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:18,814
- Really? All right.
- Yeah.

723
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:20,982
Okay.

724
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,250
- You'll be all right, won't you?
- Yeah, of course.

725
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:24,485
Yeah, yeah.

726
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,795
So we still gonna go to
Tower Records tomorrow, then?

727
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:37,599
Uh, well, she's talking about going to
some place called Paradise Cove tomorrow.

728
00:51:39,735 --> 00:51:41,535
But we'll go
another time, though.

729
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:43,372
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:44,705
Come on.

731
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:46,607

Elton.

768
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,978
I know it all seems
a bit overwhelming at first,

769
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,649
but something makes me think
you'll get used to it.

770
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:22,222
In fact, I predict you could be the
best-selling artist in America if you desire.

771
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:24,057
So you like the song then?

772
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:26,558
Not quite as much
as the singer.

773
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:35,035
You don't realize what happened
at the Troubadour tonight, do you?

774
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:38,603
Look, I'm in music management,
and let me tell you,

775
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:42,642
there are moments in a rock
star's life that define who he is

776
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:47,913
and how people perceive him
as he ascends into the heavens.

777
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,252
You lit the blue touch paper.

778
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:57,057
Now we can all see you
shooting light and color and...

779
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:00,627
magic into the night sky.

780
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:06,599
Where there was darkness,
there is now you.

Our review from the <i>LA Times</i>
has been syndicated.

802
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:45,629
- Okay.
- Things are going crazy. I've extended our stay.

803
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,830
We're in San Francisco
tomorrow for three nights.

804
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,499
- Ray, slow down.
- After that we fly to NYC,

805
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:51,769
then we're back here for
two more shows, and then...

806
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:54,439
Dick wants us back in London
to start the new album.

807
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:56,940
- Doug.
- "Rejoice.

808
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:59,242
Rock music has a new star.

809
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:03,013
He's Englishman Elton John,
a 23-year-old,

810
00:58:03,015 --> 00:58:08,786
whose debut at the Troubadour
was, in every way, magnificent."

811
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,786
Whoo!

812
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:11,989
It's happening, guys.

813
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,925
Just remember,
when you get back...

814
00:58:14,393 --> 00:58:15,826
four shows you owe me.

815
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,065
- You said...
- Four.

816
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:21,900
Did... You said four shows?

817
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:24,434
- Yes.
- That's not gonna work!

818
00:58:24,436 --> 00:58:25,470
So...

819
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,207
will I see you
when I get back?

820
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:33,543
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.

821
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:36,080
- That's what's important.
- Come to London with me.

822
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:38,781
I can't, but, uh...

823
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:41,852
But next time I'm there,
I'll look you up. Promise.

824
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:44,588
Hey, I've opened
the fucking house.

825
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,923
Don't be a bummer.

826
00:58:46,491 --> 00:58:47,858
I'm gonna watch out front.

827
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,843
Ah! I love 'em.

828
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:11,847
These are extremely stylish
boots of my own design.

829
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,851
Can you even play
the piano in those?

830
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:27,031
- It's never gonna last.
- Well...

831
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,934
Let's just enjoy it
while we can.

Guys,
we're gonna stop there.

847
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,626
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,496
Kiki, would you mind
giving me five minutes?

849
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:34,365
- I'm gonna go in.
- He's actually quite busy.

850
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,933
Thanks.

851
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,237
- Nice job.
- Nice suit.

852
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,409
Hello.

853
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:49,781
- What are you doing here?
- Business.

854
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,284
And I promised if I was ever in
town, I'd look you up.

855
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,019
How long you staying?

856
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,588
Well, I'm not sure.
That depends.

857
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,924
Don't make me beg.

858
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:03,157
I've been hearing
your songs everywhere.

859
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,463
Makes it very hard
to stop thinking about you.

860
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,333
Really?

861
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:12,735
Elton, what's going on?

862
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:14,538
Are we going again
or shall we go for a pint?

863
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:22,145
Yeah, no, yeah,
you should go for a pint.

864
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,529
What do you want, Elton?

865
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,596
Dinner with you.

866
01:01:40,598 --> 01:01:42,833
You're so humble,
it's embarrassing.

lives at home with his mum.

869

No one's
getting phased out, Dick.

905
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:12,748
Elton feels things will run more
smoothly if he has personal management.

906
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,920
- There's never been a problem before.
- And there isn't one now.

907
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,955
Look, there's loads of work and
commitments, tours, etcetera.

908
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,189
That's what I'll be doing,
personal management.

909
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:25,193
- Taking care of things.
- Is that right?

910
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,528
You realize I've got
a contract with Elton.

911
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,062
I've had that looked into,

912
01:04:29,064 --> 01:04:30,431
and my client
is quite entitled

913
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,932
to take on
outside representation.

914
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,335
That's what you think.

915
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,173
You fucking poofter.

916
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,778
And you. You're happy
with this arrangement, are ya?

917
01:04:43,211 --> 01:04:44,446
Right?

918
01:04:44,746 --> 01:04:45,949
After all these years?

919
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:48,083
It's nothing personal, Dick.

920
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,221
Come on, Ray.

921
01:04:57,859 --> 01:04:59,428
Best of luck to you, Elton.

922
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:07,636
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.

923
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:13,408
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Raymond.

924
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:16,846
Well...

925
01:05:17,312 --> 01:05:19,348
that was absolutely horrible.

926
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:22,749
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

927
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:26,820
Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called
about the Royal Variety Performance.

928
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,022
Apparently,
the Queen Mother is a big fan.

929
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:32,359
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.

930
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,196
"Lovely guy" is not a job.

931
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,432
This is a crucial time,
Elton.

932
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,433
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful,

933
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:42,103
'cause the papers
have been sniffing around.

934
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,572
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.

935
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,174
I'm thinking of getting
someone in as your girlfriend.

936
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:50,378
- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no, no.

937
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,646
This is your career
and our business at stake.

938
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,149
If our sleeping
arrangements get out...

939
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:57,452
- all of this is gone.
- Right.

940
01:05:57,886 --> 01:06:00,055
And you're gonna have
to talk to your parents.

941
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:02,088
Make sure they know
what to say.

942
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,159
Those are the first doors
reporters knock on.

943
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:17,171
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello, Dad.

944
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,714
Well, come on in.

945
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:29,284
Well, those are
very fancy shoes.

946
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,520
Oh. Yeah.

947
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,555
I brought you something.

948
01:06:44,198 --> 01:06:45,433
Why are you here, Reg?

949
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:49,736
The boys.

950
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:55,508
Dad, there's
a Rolls-Royce outside.

951
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,378
Stephen, Geoff...

952
01:06:58,312 --> 01:07:00,648
this is your brother, Reggie.

953
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,016
Half brother.

954
01:07:02,483 --> 01:07:04,452
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.

955
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:06,786
Hmm.

956
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,055
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

957
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:11,026
you and I could
get together, if you like.

958
01:07:11,425 --> 01:07:14,495
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

959
01:07:15,229 --> 01:07:17,431
Not really my thing.

960
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,969
Is it true
you're worth 25 million pound?

961
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:24,536
Do you know,
I don't actually know.

962
01:07:24,538 --> 01:07:27,108
They're really
proud of you. Mmm.

963
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:30,478
Yeah, we've even got
some of your records.

964
01:07:30,978 --> 01:07:34,315
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

965
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,692
You probably get asked this all the
time, but would you...

966
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:46,259
Would you mind signing this?

967
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:51,297
Yeah, of course.

968
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,874
Oh, no. Would you
make it out to Arthur?

969
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,310
He's one of the blokes
from work.

970
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:05,279
Yeah, he's a big fan.

971
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,581
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

972
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:17,858
Perfect.

973
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:21,862
Right.

974
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:26,634
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

975
01:08:27,568 --> 01:08:28,769
- I suppose they have.
- Mmm.

976
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:31,905
'Cause, you know,
not everybody gets a second chance.

977
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,047
The boys loved
meeting a real-life pop star.

978
01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,615
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

979
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:44,051
Bye.

980
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:48,887
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Get inside.

981
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:51,659
What are you doing
without your shoes on?

982
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:54,428
You're gonna be a draftsman.

983
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:57,497
Back inside.

984
01:09:24,891 --> 01:09:27,660
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?

985
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:37,037
Will you stop sulking?

986
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,075
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

987
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:43,810
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

988
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:46,878
Right, stop the car.

989
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,415
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

990
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:56,789
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

991
01:09:57,991 --> 01:10:00,491
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

992
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:04,664
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

993
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:06,865
Elton. Elton!

994
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,533
Drive 'round, Denis.

995
01:10:08,902 --> 01:10:10,400
<i>Liberace!</i>

996
01:10:18,745 --> 01:10:20,978
Pinner nine, seven,
double-five.

997
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,716
- Mum, it's me.
- <i>I know who you are.</i>

998
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:27,152
Well, I've got something
to tell you.

999
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:30,122
Reggie, we're gonna miss
the bit of the show with you on.

1000
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:31,557
Look, shut up, Mum!

1001
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,426
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.

1002
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:37,797
I...

1003
01:10:38,497 --> 01:10:40,033
Me and John, we...

1004
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:43,535
Well, the thing is...

1005
01:10:47,273 --> 01:10:50,109
I'm... a homosexual.

1006
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:55,981
A poofter.

1007
01:10:57,317 --> 01:10:58,717
A fairy.

1008
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:00,686
A queen.

1009
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,592
Well, say something.

1010
01:11:11,064 --> 01:11:13,633
Oh, for God's sake,
I know that.

1011
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:17,170
Known for years.

1012
01:11:19,604 --> 01:11:22,174
- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

1013
01:11:22,941 --> 01:11:26,044
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

1014
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:30,613
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

1015
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:32,251
of being alone forever.

1016
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:35,822
You'll never be loved properly.

1017
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:43,628
<i>Right. Got to go.</i>

1018
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:54,706
She said I'll never be loved.

1019
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:57,907
Don't ever put me
in this position again.

1020
01:11:57,909 --> 01:11:59,176
You're onstage in 10 minutes,

1021
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:00,978
so get over yourself
and do the show.

1022
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,982
We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

1023
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,020
Don't ever put your hands on me.

1024
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:13,792
Real love's hard to come by.

1025
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:22,901
So you find a way
to cope without it.

1026
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:26,597
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1027
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,332
Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

1028
01:13:29,334 --> 01:13:33,735
I'm about to embark on the
highest-grossing tour in rock history.

1029
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:35,671
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

1030
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:38,041
of all record sales
on the entire planet,

1031
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,910
and I have the biggest
headdress known to man.

1032
01:13:40,912 --> 01:13:42,879
So, yeah,
I think I'm okay, Bernie.

1033
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,646
It used to just be
the two of us.

1034
01:13:44,648 --> 01:13:46,782
Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

1035
01:13:46,784 --> 01:13:48,551
Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just

1036
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:51,256
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?

1037
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:55,093
You know,
just be yourself, Reg?

1038
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:58,995
Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?

1039
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:01,998
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

1040
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,666
People don't pay
to see Reginald Dwight.

1041
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:07,170
They pay to see Elton John!

1042
01:14:07,172 --> 01:14:10,341
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!

1043
01:14:17,315 --> 01:14:18,350
Break a leg.

1044
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:22,718
You don't have
to put up with this, Reg.

1045
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,955
Write the fucking lyrics,
Bernie!

1046
01:14:25,656 --> 01:14:27,392
Let me deal with the rest.

1047
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:34,596
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1048
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:37,032
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1049
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:41,303

01:15:58,082 --> 01:16:01,318
- Where am I?
- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

1062
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:04,288
Right.

1063
01:16:05,556 --> 01:16:07,057
I'll put some coffee on.

1064
01:16:15,832 --> 01:16:18,833
Darling, I've been thinking,
maybe we should quit the booze

1065
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:21,372
for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

1066
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:24,308
Afternoon.

1067
01:16:25,775 --> 01:16:27,011
Mr. Reid.

1068
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:34,750
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

1069
01:16:34,752 --> 01:16:37,588
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!

1070
01:16:37,887 --> 01:16:40,457
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

1071
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:43,592
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

1072
01:16:43,594 --> 01:16:46,463
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

1073
01:16:46,697 --> 01:16:48,497
insurance, copyright indemnity,

1074
01:16:48,499 --> 01:16:50,632
renegotiating your
previously insane contracts

1075
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:52,200
and wiping your arse.

1076
01:16:52,202 --> 01:16:54,269
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

1077
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:57,405
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87
million-dollar-a-year industry.

1078
01:16:57,407 --> 01:17:00,109
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

1079
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,845
Hmm? I pay, John.

1080
01:17:03,646 --> 01:17:04,881
For everything.

1081
01:17:05,214 --> 01:17:07,417
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

1082
01:17:07,817 --> 01:17:11,118
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

1083
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

1084
01:17:13,122 --> 01:17:14,690
I want to be by myself,

1085
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:18,193
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

1086
01:17:18,195 --> 01:17:21,164
and takes the piss
day after day!

1087
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:23,930
- Get out!
- Yoo-hoo!

1088
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:25,501
Elton.

1089
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:28,102
What are they doing here?

1090
01:17:28,104 --> 01:17:29,403
You told me to hire a jet

1091
01:17:29,405 --> 01:17:30,741
and fly them over
for the gig.

1092
01:17:31,407 --> 01:17:34,542
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

1093
01:17:34,544 --> 01:17:36,277
I'm gonna go
and fetch them a drink.

1094
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:37,978
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up,

1095
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,347
because you fucking stink.

1096
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,919
Sheila! It's been too long.

1097
01:17:43,386 --> 01:17:45,985
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

1098
01:17:45,987 --> 01:17:47,323
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

1099
01:17:48,056 --> 01:17:51,192
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

1100
01:17:51,194 --> 01:17:52,914
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

1101
01:17:53,129 --> 01:17:54,695
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

1102
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:57,298
Elton, darling,
you remember the Andersons

1103
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,533
- from next door, don't you?
- Yes, the Andersons.

1104
01:17:59,535 --> 01:18:01,337
How could we forget
the Andersons?

1105
01:18:01,637 --> 01:18:02,872
- Hello.
- Hello.

1106
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:07,810
And what a shy little boy
you were.

1107
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:09,610
Look at you now.

1108
01:18:09,612 --> 01:18:11,978
Elton, you must
give them a tour.

1109
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,381
- Yes, right now, go on.
- Yeah, okay.

1110
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:15,115
Everyone,
Elton is giving a tour.

1111
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:17,884
- Mum, you're on my gown.
- Don't be rude.

1112
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,397
Here we go.
Come here, come here. Excited?

1113
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:29,432
- Car.
- Yeah.

1114
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:35,870
- Bernie, how's it going, man?
- Hey, man. How's it going?

1115
01:18:35,872 --> 01:18:37,640
No idea who he is.
Of course.

1116
01:18:53,489 --> 01:18:54,624
Here he is!

1117
01:18:55,057 --> 01:18:56,956
Ladies, Elton.

1118
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,026
- Hey.
- Hey.

1119
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,027
What are you
doing on your own up here?

1120
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,462
Miserable bastard.

1121
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:04,164
You're missing
all the fun downstairs.

1122
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:06,065
Well, as long as all the fun
isn't missing me,

1123
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:07,936
then who gives a shit, Bernie?

1124
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:12,675
We should get a drink.

1125
01:19:13,543 --> 01:19:16,410
- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.
- Come on, it's fine.

1126
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:19,012
No, we absolutely should.
No, I'm telling you...

1127
01:19:19,014 --> 01:19:21,550
Yeah, go and get
a little drink.

1128
01:19:54,316 --> 01:19:56,249
You look amazing.

1129
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:58,819
Fucking prick.

1130
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:13,133
For my next trick,

1131
01:20:15,303 --> 01:20:17,272
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself.

Elton.

1164
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:53,044
- Elton.
- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

1165
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,715
I was saying
that I think I need a break.

1166
01:24:56,048 --> 01:24:58,249
You need to take a break?

1167
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:01,788
I think that I just need
to go and sort myself out a bit.

1168
01:25:04,257 --> 01:25:05,456
What?

1169
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:09,028
I'm going home... for a while.

1170
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,063
Well, that's nice for you.

1171
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:15,668
Why can't we just, you know,
both of us just disappear together?

1172
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:19,939
My ranch.

1173
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:22,208
We'll go to my ranch,
we'll hide away.

1174
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,543
We can write like we did.

1175
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:27,747
Like we used to.

1176
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:31,083
We should go home, Elton.

1177
01:25:32,218 --> 01:25:33,553
Reconnect.

1178
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:39,692
No, you should go.

1179
01:25:41,128 --> 01:25:43,762
There are other writers
I'd like to work with anyway.

1180
01:25:44,663 --> 01:25:48,067
Do me good.
Collaborate with other people.

1181
01:25:49,601 --> 01:25:51,103
I think
it's a really good idea.

1182
01:26:15,027 --> 01:26:17,596
My loyal subjects.

1183
01:26:20,632 --> 01:26:24,136
Hello, hello, Australia. G'day.

1184
01:26:25,304 --> 01:26:27,671
Shit, or New York?

1185
01:26:27,673 --> 01:26:30,042
Swindon.
Or wherever the hell we are.

1186
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:35,346
Well, if you don't like it, go home.

1187
01:26:35,348 --> 01:26:37,847
It's what everyone else
seems to be doing at the moment.

1188
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:44,422

1211
01:28:37,968 --> 01:28:40,336
You'll never be loved properly.

1212
01:28:40,338 --> 01:28:41,973
When are you going to hug me?

1213
01:28:42,873 --> 01:28:44,109
<i>Don't be soft.</i>

1214

<i>Life gives you

1215

<i>- and this is one of yours
- Who are you?</i>

1216
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,579
<i>You can do
anything you want.</i>

1217
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:53,316
<i>You can be anyone you want.
What do you really want?</i>

1218
01:28:53,318 --> 01:28:55,751
<i>And what
a shy little boy you were.</i>

1219
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:57,388
<i>Look at you now.</i>

1220
01:28:57,821 --> 01:28:59,788
<i>What do you really want?</i>

1221
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:02,659
<i>I'm going home... for a while.</i>

1222
01:29:33,757 --> 01:29:35,724
What do you want? I'm busy.

1223
01:29:35,726 --> 01:29:37,961
Why don't you get back in
the studio you're paying for?

1224
01:29:39,364 --> 01:29:43,033
Why don't you sell my fucking records?
What's this? Hmm?

1225
01:29:43,566 --> 01:29:45,267
Number 11 in Italy.

1226
01:29:45,269 --> 01:29:47,568
The song doesn't work,
that's the problem.

1227
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,371
The record's
coked-out MOR shit.

1228
01:29:49,373 --> 01:29:50,374
No, the problem...

1229
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:55,012
is you have
never understood me...

1230
01:29:55,579 --> 01:29:57,281
and what I have to go through.

1231
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:59,781
And you know what?
I should've sacked you when you left me.

1232
01:29:59,783 --> 01:30:02,918
I am glad I left you.
It means I can maintain some objectivity

1233
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,587
in your self-indulgent,
myopic little world.

1234
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:08,092
Get in the studio
and make some music or don't.

1235
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:09,625
I don't care.

1236
01:30:14,597 --> 01:30:16,632
Well, you will
when your money runs out.

1237
01:30:19,903 --> 01:30:23,071
Do your worst.
In fact, take me to court.

1238
01:30:23,073 --> 01:30:25,275
You signed contracts

1240
01:30:30,613 --> 01:30:32,516

01:30:34,251 --> 01:30:35,450

1279
01:34:49,337 --> 01:34:50,372
I'm sorry.

1280
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:56,544
I know.

1281
01:35:02,883 --> 01:35:04,652
Renate didn't deserve that.

1282
01:35:07,756 --> 01:35:09,124
She's a good person.

1283
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,395
I dragged her
into all my madness.

1284
01:35:15,263 --> 01:35:17,399
Did being married
make you happy?

1285
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,699
Not really. I'm gay.

1286
01:35:25,172 --> 01:35:27,340
- I think...
- Hello, Mum.

1287
01:35:27,342 --> 01:35:29,908
- Sir, would you like me to...
- Maybe a bit later, thank you.

1288
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:31,379
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1289
01:35:31,912 --> 01:35:33,146
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

1290
01:35:33,148 --> 01:35:35,950
Just talking about poor Renate.

1291
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:38,153
Such a lovely woman.

1292
01:35:38,453 --> 01:35:40,655
Divorce can be so painful.

1293
01:35:41,489 --> 01:35:44,089
- Yeah.
- Anyway, celebration is in order.

1294
01:35:46,026 --> 01:35:50,061
We found a lovely villa
by the sea.

1295
01:35:50,063 --> 01:35:51,731
It'd be good if you would
talk to John today,

1296
01:35:51,733 --> 01:35:54,634
get the money arranged.
Can't risk losing this one.

1297
01:35:54,636 --> 01:35:56,202
Yeah, in Minorca.

1298
01:35:56,204 --> 01:35:57,503
It is a lovely place.
You should see it.

1299
01:35:57,505 --> 01:35:59,707
- Minorca, eh?
- Mmm.

1300
01:36:01,876 --> 01:36:03,545
What do you want
to go there for?

1301
01:36:04,045 --> 01:36:06,077
- Because you're driving me away.
- Mmm.

1302
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:08,046
Every time
we open a paper,

1303
01:36:08,048 --> 01:36:10,984
there's something about you and
the booze or the drugs, and...

1304
01:36:11,753 --> 01:36:13,753
you're breaking
your poor mum's heart.

1305
01:36:13,755 --> 01:36:15,755
Tell you what,
I'll write you a check. Hmm?

1306
01:36:15,757 --> 01:36:17,422
So she can go buy a new one.

1307
01:36:17,424 --> 01:36:19,794
Typical that you'd say
something like that about me,

1308
01:36:20,127 --> 01:36:22,060
when I've given up
so much for you.

1309
01:36:22,062 --> 01:36:23,763
What have you given up for me?

1310
01:36:23,765 --> 01:36:27,235
Your father... for a start.

1311
01:36:32,072 --> 01:36:34,308
You really are
a heartless monster.

1312
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:41,215
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.

1313
01:36:42,884 --> 01:36:46,521
And I do not want your fucked-up,
frigid ideas about anything.

1314
01:36:50,324 --> 01:36:52,792
You know, I am so sick

1315
01:36:52,794 --> 01:36:54,561
of running away from who I am.

1316
01:36:56,763 --> 01:36:59,931
There's nothing wrong
with success. Or pleasure.

1317
01:36:59,933 --> 01:37:01,299
In fact,
why am I apologizing for it?

1318
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:03,770
Mum, I have fucked
everything that moves.

1319
01:37:05,372 --> 01:37:08,173
And I've taken
every drug known to man.

1320
01:37:08,175 --> 01:37:09,409
All of them.

1321
01:37:10,745 --> 01:37:11,779
Do you know what?

1322
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:15,449
I enjoyed
every last minute of it.

1323
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:18,617

your fat little legs

1324
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:20,487
in front of a piano,
you've been lucky.

1325
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:24,422
You've never worked hard
for a bloody thing in your life.

1326
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:26,992
It all just comes to you.
You don't do anything.

1327
01:37:26,994 --> 01:37:29,027
And I'm the one who suffers.

1328
01:37:29,029 --> 01:37:31,263
I should never
have had children.

1329
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:35,669

it is to be your mother?

Hmm?

1351
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:28,982
You left when it suited you.

1352
01:39:29,415 --> 01:39:31,417
Now you come back
to lecture me?

1353
01:39:32,886 --> 01:39:35,787
'Cause the thing is,
the first time we actually got anywhere,

1354
01:39:35,789 --> 01:39:36,789
you left, didn't you?

1355
01:39:36,957 --> 01:39:38,890
Some girl was more important
to you than me

and all those legends
who were welcoming us in.

When did you give up?

1359
01:39:50,302 --> 01:39:53,270
If you don't care about yourself,
how do you expect anyone else to?

1360
01:39:53,272 --> 01:39:55,574
Whenever I needed you most...

1361
01:39:56,909 --> 01:40:00,511
- you weren't there.
- It's not weak to ask for help.

1362
01:40:00,513 --> 01:40:03,649
I have worked my balls off
to get us out of the shit.

1363
01:40:04,483 --> 01:40:07,918
Day in, day out, for years.

1364
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,554
And now it's me that can't
walk down the streets.

1365
01:40:10,556 --> 01:40:13,926

Yeah, but I started

1427

I just forgot to stop.

Maybe I should've tried

Hello, Nan.

1432
01:46:43,712 --> 01:46:45,748
You was never ordinary.

1433
01:46:46,749 --> 01:46:47,983
Look at you.

1434
01:46:48,984 --> 01:46:52,255
In here, talking

1435
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,988
What a waste of time.

1436
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,993
Mum, I know it was never easy.

1437
01:46:58,694 --> 01:47:00,329
And I hope you can forgive me.

1438
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:04,733
Because I've realized
that's what we need to do now.

1439
01:47:05,835 --> 01:47:07,603
Forgive each other.

1440
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,974
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.

1441
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:15,345
My problem was I believed
you loved me.

1442
01:47:15,611 --> 01:47:17,245
And you're incapable of it.

1443
01:47:17,247 --> 01:47:18,945
I gave everything
to keep something

1444
01:47:18,947 --> 01:47:20,748
that I never even had
in the first place.

1445
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:24,854
I always thought you was
an introverted extrovert.

1446
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:28,924
- A what?
- He's shy. He's always been shy.

1447
01:47:29,325 --> 01:47:30,993
It's all his father's fault.

1448
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:35,197
Don't blame me.
He'd have been strange, regardless.

1449
01:47:35,798 --> 01:47:38,134
Actually, I think
I'm okay with "strange."

1450
01:47:38,634 --> 01:47:41,238
God. Not him.

1451
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:43,339
Both of you. Stop.

1452
01:47:43,938 --> 01:47:47,276
I'm not going to allow you to
talk to me like this anymore.

1453
01:47:49,111 --> 01:47:50,980
It's about time you said that.

1454
01:47:55,484 --> 01:47:56,719
Bernie.

1455
01:47:59,755 --> 01:48:01,488
I never told you
how much I need you.

1456
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:03,359
No, no, no, I love you, man.

1457
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,429
Always have, always will.

1458
01:48:08,963 --> 01:48:11,766
You write songs
that millions of people love.

1459
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:13,569
And that's what's important.

1460
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:16,305
You just need to remember
who you are...

1461
01:48:17,772 --> 01:48:19,074
and be okay with it.

1462
01:48:19,608 --> 01:48:21,377
He doesn't know who he is.

1463
01:48:28,684 --> 01:48:29,984
Yes, I do.

1464
01:48:32,588 --> 01:48:34,355
I'm Elton Hercules John.

1465
01:48:35,957 --> 01:48:37,992
I thought
you were Reggie Dwight.

1466
01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:50,873
I haven't been
Reggie Dwight for years.

1467
01:49:05,153 --> 01:49:06,955
When are you going
to hug me?

1468
01:49:40,121 --> 01:49:42,290
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.

1469
01:49:46,893 --> 01:49:48,263
How you doing?

1470
01:49:49,964 --> 01:49:51,065
Good to see you.

1471
01:49:51,532 --> 01:49:54,135
Some days are tougher than
others, but I feel good.

1472
01:49:55,803 --> 01:49:57,305
They got a piano here?

1473
01:49:58,106 --> 01:49:59,939
- You been playing?
- Hmm...

1474
01:49:59,941 --> 01:50:01,407
- No.
- No?

1475
01:50:01,409 --> 01:50:03,512
Not in the right place
for that just now.

1476
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,912
I'm scared, Bernie.

1477
01:50:09,883 --> 01:50:11,386
What if I'm not as good...

1478
01:50:13,954 --> 01:50:15,490
without the drink
and the drugs?

1479
01:50:19,227 --> 01:50:20,928
You know that's not true.

1480
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:24,563
You're not scared
you're not good without it,

1481
01:50:24,565 --> 01:50:25,900
you're scared to feel again.

1482
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:29,336
You might be able to lie to
yourself, but you can't lie to me.

1483
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,876
I should be going.

1484
01:50:37,978 --> 01:50:39,213
Don't go.

1485
01:50:41,382 --> 01:50:42,383
Not yet.

1486
01:50:43,084 --> 01:50:44,918
This is the part
you gotta do on your own.

1487
01:50:46,521 --> 01:50:49,057
These... need music.

1488
01:50:59,433 --> 01:51:00,535
Thank you, Bernie.

1489
01:51:04,971 --> 01:51:06,307
