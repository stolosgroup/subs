2
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,616
Are you sure you have the right keys?

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,040
Trust me, it's the right key.

4
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,571
Okay, then, open the door.

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,246
It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

6
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,167
20, 19, 18...

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,084
Rocky, those are very slow seconds.

8
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,136
- Yo, kill that already.
- ...17, 16...

9
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,003
- Dude, come on.
- ...15, 14, 13...

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,483
- This is what I'm talking about.
- ...12, 11, 10, 9...

11
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,763
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

12
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,088
All right, so, just like last time.

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,176
No cash.
The total take has to fall below ten G's.

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,336
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Judge Judy.

15
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,486
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

16
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,651
<i>Okay, let's get out of here.</i>

17
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,564
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

18
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,649
Everybody's leaving.

19
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,922
You know, if we keep hitting
houses like today's...

20
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,127
...Rocky, and...

21
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,930
Bye-bye, Detroit.

22
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,447
And <i>hola,</i> California.

23
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,485
Wait, wait.
You're going away, Rock?

24
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,608
Yeah, as soon as I can.

25
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,882
When are you,
when are you coming back?

26
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,360
Never.

27
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,483
You should come with us.

28
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,210
Uh...

29
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,964
What?

30
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,724
Everyone else is gone.

31
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,002
I got my dad here.

32
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,089
I'll miss you, then.

33
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,962
Dad?

34
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,282
You home?

35
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,731
Yo, this is it, man?

36
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,968
Minus my 40 percent.

37
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,565
Take it or leave it.

38
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,176
There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.

39
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,611
And what do you think...

40
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,451
...I'm going to put it up
for auction at Sotheby's? Heh.

41
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,246
Do you know how much...

42
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,528
...people on the street pay
for a hot Rolex?

43
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,967
Heh. You want money?

44
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,009
Then steal money.

45
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,571
Fucking bullshit, bro.

46
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,804
Do you want this new tip or not?

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,290
All right, let's hear it.

48
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,966
<i>1837 Buena Vista Street.</i>

49
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,800
House is with
your dad's security company.

50
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,285
I already checked.

51
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,284
Guy who owns it
is an Army vet loner.

52
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,805
No family.

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,126
Just him in the house.

54
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,696
That part of the city is a ghost town.

55
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,926
It looks like a dump.

56
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,320
That's actually good news.

57
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,811
How's that good news?

58
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,291
The story goes...

59
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,965
...some preppy girl
a few years ago...

60
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,724
...ran over this guy's daughter.

61
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,769
- Jesus.
- The daughter dies...

62
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,321
...and this preppy,
rich-ass family...

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,204
...pays him off...

64
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,850
...gives him a big-ass sediment.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,729
Settlement.

66
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,370
Blow me, Your Honor.

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,082
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

68
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,442
...300K.

69
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,409
Boom!

70
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,723
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

71
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,405
...he will shit his pants.

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,722
Do you think the money's
in the house?

73
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,002
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

74
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,491
Guys, no. We don't do cash.

75
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,005
Above ten K, it's major larceny.

76
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,640
That means ten years
if we get caught.

77
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,683
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

78
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,480
That amount brings
a serious cop presence.

79
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
They'll do an investigation.

80
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,960
My dad could get in trouble.

81
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,326
I knew you'd bitch out, man.

82
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,403
I just knew it.

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,888
Alex, if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,282
Where are you going?

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,171
We're not doing this one.

86
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,607
Seriously?

87
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,649
Give us the fucking keys, man.

88
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,086
- We'll fucking do it.
- Alex!

89
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,688
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

90
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,361
Six-figure settlement.

91
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,886
All right.

92
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,176
<i>The suspect was leaving...</i>

93
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,416
<i>...the rear entrance of the club.</i>

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,522
Are you done, Diddy?

95
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,204
Be a doll and get your mother...

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,328
...a large four-cheese from Tony's.

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,896
- So Trevor's living here now?
- Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

98
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,816
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

99
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,684
You have no money in here.

100
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,968
You pay for it then.

101
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,009
I know you're making money.

102
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,766
I'm done.

103
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,207
Your lips look sore.

104
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,647
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

105
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,041
Ha, ha. Huh?

106
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,048
Okay, Diddy,
let's go for a walk.

107
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,767
I want to go to the beach.

108
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,129
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

109
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,567
I want to be a surfer.

110
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,530
There's no surf in Michigan.

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,165
- Not fair.
- Yeah, well...

112
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,122
...some things
you can't change, baby.

113
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,284
No matter how unfair they are.

114
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,363
What a bummer.

115
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,008
Hey, you know
where there is surf?

116
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,610
California.

117
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,331
What do you say
you and I move there together?

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,561
Would you like that?

119
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,290
Okay.

120
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,851
I promise then.

121
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,445
Is that a new tattoo?

122
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,681
Yeah.

123
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,041
I got it last night.

124
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,368
- Is it a...?
- Ladybug.

125
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,370
Why a ladybug?

126
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,762
What?

127
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,128
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking...

128
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,607
...and she told me that...

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,525
...my dad's leaving was all my fault.

130
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,289
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

131
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,482
She got so fed up with the crying...

132
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,166
...that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

133
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,721
Sometimes for hours.

134
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,169
But there was this, um...

135
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,282
A little hole in the trunk...

136
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,249
...and one time a ladybug flew in...

137
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,165
...kept me company.

138
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,163
It made me feel safe.

139
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,121
When I reach California,
I'm gonna color this tat...

140
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,726
...and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

141
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,969
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

142
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,487
I know you will.

143
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,129
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

144
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,967
No people means
no Five-0 on patrol.

145
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,531
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

146
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,290
The guy's a shut-in...

147
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,200
...hasn't left his house
in, like, five days.

148
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,725
I say we do it with him
in the house.

149
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,325
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

150
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,961
Oh, shit!

151
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
- Jesus.
- Fucking A.

152
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,840
Get off my fucking car, dog shit!

153
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,004
Shit, that's our guy.

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,970
Wait, is he blind?

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,363
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

156
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,921
That's kind of fucked up
to rob a blind guy, isn't it?

157
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,480
Just because he's blind don't
mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

158
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,041
We do this tonight.

159
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,642
The whole neighborhood
is fucking empty.

160
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,280
This guy's the last man standing.

161
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,081
The lights are out.

162
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,241
He must be asleep.

163
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,209
He's blind.

164
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,771
Lights off doesn't mean anything.

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,967
It's 2 a.m.

166
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,771
He's sleeping.

167
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,763
Let's take care
of that dog first, yeah?

168
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,531
Come on, man.

169
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,561
He's chewing it.

170
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,085
It'll be lights out in a sec.

171
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,401
There's four locks.
You got the other keys?

172
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,528
- I only have the one.
- Ah. Fuck me.

173
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,127
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

174
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,645
Because the money's in there...

175
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,485
...and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

176
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,404
Let's check for a side door.

177
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,450
Sweet dreams, pup.

178
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,521
What's that?

179
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,136
We just have to point this
in the general direction...

180
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,496
...of the master keypad,
and it'll kill the alarm.

181
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,364
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

182
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,402
Yes. Got it.

183
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,641
Shit.

184
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,040
What's wrong?

185
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,446
It won't open.

186
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,125
This guy isn't messing around.

187
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,046
There's a bolt here.

188
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,929
I can feel it.

189
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,605
- Come on.
- That's too loud.

190
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,683
- That's too loud.
- Fucking stop.

191
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,926
What about that window?

192
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,127
There's no bars on it.

193
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,560
- I can fit in there.
- What?

194
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,762
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

195
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,485
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

196
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,642
I'm going myself.

197
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,811
Help me up.

198
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,121
Here, Rocky.

199
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,281
You only got 30 seconds.

200
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,441
Okay.

201
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,329
Here. Come here.

202
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,445
Slow your roll, fool.

203
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,728
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

204
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,051
Yeah, like you really give a fuck.

205
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,850
What'd you say?

206
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,162
That's my bitch in there.

207
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,243
Of course I give a fuck.

208
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,607
Let me give you some advice.

209
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,205
Be a good friend...

210
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,125
...and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right?

211
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,121
Are you okay?

212
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,566
Yes.

213
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,484
Shoes off.

214
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,404
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

215
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,761
Hey. Hey.

216
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,724

What the fuck, dude?

250
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,521
The guy's gassed out.

251
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,846
He's out.

252
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,136
He's in Sleeping Beauty mode.

253
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,924
- It's fine.
- Guys.

254
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,846
That's a big-ass lock.

255
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,002
If the money's in the house...

256
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,970
...probably in there.

257
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,088
You think you can crack it open?

258
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,770
Yeah, I got this.

259
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,965
Fuck.

260
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,490
Jesus.

261
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,881
Do you have anything else?

262
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,405
Yeah.

263
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,766
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,287
I've got a more powerful tool.

265
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,530
What the hell is that?

266
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,205
It's a nine millimeter Beretta.

267
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,442
Gangster-style, bitches.

268
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,965
Why did you bring a gun?

269
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,929
This is a soldier's house, Alex.

270
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,696
Like I'm gonna come in here
without some chrome.

271
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,610
Money, you've never shot a gun before.

272
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,888
Yeah, well, it's time
to pop that cherry, baby.

273
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,936
Because I'm going to pop that
shit like a fucking tuna can.

274
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,536
Do you have any idea
what bringing a gun...

275
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,641
...to a burglary means?

276
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,290
Yeah, it gives me...

277
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,329
...a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

278
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,696
No, it means
you just gave this guy...

279
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,927
...the legal right to shoot us.

280
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,208
Rocky, let's go.

281
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,567
No, no, no, no.
I think we should stay.

282
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,842
We have to leave.
This is not good.

283
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,816
You don't really think just because...

284
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,336
...you jerk off
to her Instagram selfies...

285
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,283
...that makes you a Romeo?

286
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,805
Think again, bitch.

287
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,645
Fuck, I'm so out.

288
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,283
Alex.

289
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,204
Who's there?

290
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,930
Okay, man, just chill, all right?

291
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,560
Look, um...

292
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,563
I was wasted...

293
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,768
...and I wandered in,
so that was my bad, all right?

294
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,251
So, I'm just gonna...

295
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,243
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

296
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,450
Stay right fucking there.

297
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,210
Don't you fucking move.

298
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,524
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,967
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

300
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,565
You got me?

301
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,326
Now, you do as I say, all right?

302
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,484
Don't take one single step,
all right? Huh?

303
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,090
Well, do you hear me or what?

304
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,005
What, are you blind and deaf
all of a sudden?

305
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,241
Huh?

306
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,131
Motherfucker, I said stop.

307
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,487
I think you fucking heard me.

308
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,483
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

309
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,696
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man?

310
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,370
I'll fucking shoot you.

311
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,926
Don't you fucking test me.

312
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,531
You're a fucking pussy.

313
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,761
What are you gonna do now,
huh? Huh?

314
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,843
You better fucking stop. Stop!

315
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,568
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

316
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,724
Please.

317
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,120
Please.

318
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,171
Please, just let me walk.

319
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,891
Let me walk.
Leave me alive.

320
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,286
Please.

321
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,245
How many of you are there?

322
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,851
What?

323
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,650
How many?

324
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,644
It's just me, man...

325
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,804
...all right? It's just fucking me.
Just let me go!

326
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,764
Please let me go.

327
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,009
Please.

328
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,569
Just let me go.

329
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,607
Okay. Okay.

330
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,286
Okay.

331
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,686
Okay, I swear to God...

332
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,602
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

333
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,842
Are you okay?

334
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,809
Maybe... Maybe we should...

335
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,246
...call the cops
before he does.

336
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,169
We'll come clean...

337
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,450
Wait.

338
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,602
What?

339
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,801
Oh, my God.

340
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,126
There's a lot more
than 300 grand in there.

341
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,601
That's got to be
about a million dollars.

342
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,162
Okay, let's get out of here.

343
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,891
The storm cellar door.
The door's bolted from the inside.

344
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,122
That could be our way out.

345
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,203
Let's go.

346
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,009
Let's go.

347
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,129
This way.

348
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,367
What?

349
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,524
Oh, shit.
The phone died.

350
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,523
Oh, fuck.

351
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,761
Hmm.

352
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,086
Hmm.

353
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,164
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

354
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,840
Where is it? Do you see it?

355
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,531
Please help me! Please!

356
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,001
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

357
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,891
Come on. Let's go.

358
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,371
Look, the door's right here.

359
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,410
Look! Look at it!

360
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,801
Please!

361
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,524
What?

362
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,728
Rocky? Rocky.

363
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,207
Rocky, listen, listen.

364
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,407
Hey, that's our exit.

365
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,720
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

366
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,723
No, no, no, no!

367
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,124
She's the one
who killed his daughter.

368
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,526
We have to get her
out of here.

369
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,603
No, no, no.
Rocky, we don't have time.

370
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,936
We'll... We'll get out of here,
and we'll call the cops...

371
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,376
...and then they'll
come find her, all right?

372
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,084
The safe! The safe!

373
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,725
There's the safe!

374
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,520
The code
from the safe upstairs.

375
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,688
- You remember it?
- Um...

376
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,126
2978, 78, 78, 2978.

377
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,931
2-9-7-8.

378
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,326
Oh...

379
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,767
Okay, got them.

380
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,691
He's coming.

381
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,406
- Hurry up.
- Okay, one more, one more.

382
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,562
Fuck, fuck!

383
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,650
I almost have it.
Almost... okay.

384
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,976
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

385
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,241
Go, go, go!

386
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,444
- There's the door.
- There it is.

387
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,481
Are you okay?

388
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,721
Okay.

389
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,525
What's wrong?

390
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,161
What's wrong?

391
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,367
It's locked.

392
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,967
You have the keys.
Don't you have the keys?

393
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,087
Fuck.

394
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,360
One of these should open it.

395
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,646
Come on.

396
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,120
Come on.

397
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,446
- Come on.
- Okay.

398
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,085
Oh, yes.

399
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,811
Come on.

400
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,448
He shot her.

401
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,961
No...

402
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,121
Oh.

403
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,161
No!

404
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,886
No!

405
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,123
Oh! Oh! Oh!

406
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,881
My baby.

407
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,401
No!

408
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,529
No!

409
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,686
No!

410
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,249
We have to go back upstairs.

411
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,925
Yeah, listen.

412
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,525
Listen, okay?

413
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,680
These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

414
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,926
All right?

415
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,162
If we get up there,
we can get out.

416
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,084
Okay?

417
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,846
Let's go now.

418
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,888
Shit.

419
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,921
Alex?

420
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,881
Rocky?

421
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,490
Please don't...

422
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,922
No, please...

423
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,447
Rocky?

424
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,523
Alex! Alex.

425
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,966
Rocky, Rocky.

426
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,121
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

427
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,482
This way. This way, come on.

428
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,896
This way, come on, come on, come on.

429
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,206
Okay.

430
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,840
Oh, come on. Where am I?

431
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,166
Where is it?

432
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,049
Light. I see light!

433
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,043
Come on, come on.

434
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,171
Don't...

435
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,446
...run.

436
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,890
Rocky...

437
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,124
...go to the door.

438
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,845
Try the blue key.

439
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,405
- Do it.
- Okay.

440
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,921
Easy.

441
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,201
Easy, buddy.

442
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,846
Fuck.

443
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,368
- Rocky?
- Yeah.

444
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,207
- Come on.
- Easy, buddy.

445
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,600
Easy...

446
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,161
It's okay.

447
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,362
Okay, that's a good boy.
That's good.

448
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,681
All right.

449
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,606
That's...
That's good. That's good.

450
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,526
Oh. Fuck.

451
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,408
Rocky! Rocky.
Run, now. Go, go, go!

452
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,244
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go!

453
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,040
Go! Hurry, hurry!

454
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,966
Go!

455
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,167
There's a door! Come on!

456
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,561
Let's go.

457
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,160
Hey, move this.

458
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,606
Come on.

459
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,485
Damn.

460
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,682
- Are those blocked up too?
- Yeah.

461
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,569
We're trapped in here.

462
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,128
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you?

463
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,566
Come on. Okay.

464
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,376
- What are you doing?
- I'm pressing the panic button.

465
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,496
If I manage to get in range,
the system will call 911...

466
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,000
- ...and the police will come.
- No. Wait, we can't go to jail.

467
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,491
No. No, we won't. Okay?

468
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,440
This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

469
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,920
The police won't care about us...

470
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,376
...or why we were here
in the first place.

471
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,920
We would have helped them
get this guy.

472
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,440
But then we wouldn't
keep the money.

473
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,408
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

474
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,723
Go!

475
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,650
Alex!

476
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,802
What are you doing? Go!

477
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,650
No! No, no!

478
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,686
Oh!

479
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,562
Hey!

480
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,170
Huh, huh!

481
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,363
Ah...

482
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,886
Ah.

483
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,850
Please, let me go.

484
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,728
Please, let me go!

485
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,206
I...

486
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,089
I understand you.

487
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,730
She killed your daughter.

488
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,370
You wanted her to pay.

489
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,561
I understand that.

490
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,290
I won't tell anyone.

491
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,448
You understand nothing.

492
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,524
Only a parent could know the...

493
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,127
...bond between a father
and his child.

494
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,883
She should have
gone to prison, but...

495
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,242
...rich girls don't go to jail.

496
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,361
None of this is going
to bring your daughter back.

497
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,327
That's not really true.

498
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,884
Cindy took my child
away from me.

499
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,681
I thought...

500
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,241
...it's only fair...

501
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,883
...that she give me a new one.

502
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,487
She was pregnant with my baby.

503
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,764
You killed them both.

504
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,565
- No.
- Well, they would be alive...

505
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,206
...if you hadn't broken
into my home.

506
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,566
No.

507
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,406
You have
to be held accountable.

508
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,206
Please.

509
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,765
Please, God.

510
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,081
God?

511
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,163
There's no God.

512
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,370
It's a joke.

513
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,490
It's a bad joke.

514
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:44,328
You tell me what God
would allow this.

515
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,570
What are you doing?

516
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,846
I'm not a rapist.

517
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,009
I never forced myself on her.

518
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,889
Stop.

519
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,327
I promised I would set her free...

520
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,687
...just as soon
as she gave me a child.

521
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,162
But now she's gone.

522
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,288
But I'm done waiting.

523
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,608
Ah! No. No, no.

524
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,765
You can't do this to me.

525
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,689
There's nothing a man cannot do...

526
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,407
...once he accepts the fact
that there is no God.

527
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,210
No!

528
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,806
No. No, no, no, no!

529
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,041
No!

530
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,807
No!

531
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,086
You're strong.

532
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,766
You're young.

533
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,360
You'll breed well.

534
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,488
No. Get away from me.

535
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,644
No! No!

536
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,044
No!

537
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,411
No...

538
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,404
Stop.

539
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,686
Shh, Shh, shh.

540
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,006
Nine months...

541
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,970
...and I will give you
your life back.

542
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,122
Are you okay?

543
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,566
Rocky. Okay, yeah.

544
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,240
Rocky, did he...?
Did he hurt you?

545
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,606
Rocky?

546
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,688
You fucking bastard.

547
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,127
Fuck you!

548
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Rocky. Rocky.

549
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,046
Rocky. Rocky, it's over.
Come on.

550
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,890
How's that taste?

551
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,165
- Now what?
- Come on.

552
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,484
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

553
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,160
Rocky, we can't
involve the cops now.

554
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,209
If we steal a million in cash...

555
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,136
...and then lead the cops here,
he'll tell them about us.

556
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,924
Our blood is all over.

557
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,286
They'll get to us in a second.

558
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,245
You got what you came for.

559
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,124
Now take it.

560
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,482
Get out of my house!

561
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,210
Look, he's buying our silence.

562
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,930
He needs us to take the money.

563
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,844
It's one or the other.

564
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,727
Whatever you choose,
I'm with you.

565
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,045
- Okay.
- This one.

566
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,929
Let's get out of here.

567
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,366
I need to find the key.

568
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,891
All right.

569
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,529
That key won't...

570
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,047
I got it.

571
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,888
You're worthless out here.

572
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,251
Fuck.

573
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,971
Shit!

574
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,806
Fuck.

575
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,201
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

576
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,691
Ah, fuck!

577
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,967
I'm sorry, Alex.

578
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,201
I'm so sorry.

579
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,841
No!

580
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,203
Don't!

581
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,044
Ah, no...

582
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,649
No. Ah...

583
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,165
Ah! Don't...

584
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,401
No.

585
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,370
What is that?

586
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,609
You and me at the beach.
