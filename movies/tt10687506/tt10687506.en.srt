00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:07,777
THIS IS A TRUE STORY

4
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,904
The artist Louis Wain

5
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,864
made the cat his own.

6
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,825
He invented a cat style,

7
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,661
a cat society,

8
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,790
a whole cat world.

9
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,460
Cats that do not look and live
like Louis Wain cats

10
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,463
are ashamed of themselves.

11
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,841
But that is not
what is important.

12
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,303
What is important is that
Louis Wain devoted his life

13
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,223
to making
all our lives happier,

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,600
and cattier.

15
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:46,774
In doing so, he undoubtedly
raised up the cat in society

16
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,944
and he changed our world
for the better.

17
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,090
Aside from
its bizarre social prejudices

18
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,759
and the fact that everything
stank of shit,

19
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,804
Victorian England was also
a land of innovation

20
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,181
and scientific discovery.

21
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,934
Many of the world’s
finest minds

22
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,437
were digging deep
into the nature of electricity,

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,357
to harness its power
for practical use.

24
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,658
But for the young Louis Wain,
electricity was something else,

25
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,661
something so extraordinary
and strange

26
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,832
that the human mind was barely
able even to comprehend it.

27
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:49,169
A mysterious, elemental force
that on occasion,

28
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,131
he could feel
shimmering in the ether,

29
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,259
and the key to all
of life’s most profound

30
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,219
and alarming secrets.

31

THE ELECTRICAL LIFE
OF LOUIS WAIN

32
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,731

33
32
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,901
ANDOVER
ANNUAL COUNTRY SHOW

34
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,987
Please keep
your animals under control.

35
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,365
Sorry. Uh, thank...
thank you.

36
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,790
Thank you.

37
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,089
Ooh. Are you an illustrator?

38
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,592
Yes, I do illustrations
for money.

39
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,345
I’m also working on several
patents at the moment.

40
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,977
You’ve just come from
the country show, I take it?

41
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,061
Mmm.

42
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,483
You’re very muddy. Did you get
into a fight or something?

43
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,277
Uh, no, I was attacked
by a one-and-a-half-ton bull.

44
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,196
Oh. That was you, was it?

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,323
Yes, I heard about that.

46
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,037
How much would you charge
for a drawing of Cleopatra?

47
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,331
Oh, I... I don’t really
draw people.

48
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,209
Oh, no, sorry. Cleopatra.

49
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,378
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

50
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,716
Ah. Well, that
you can have for free.

51
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,592
That’s awfully kind.

52
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,387
My sister usually takes her,
but she’s unwell,

53
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,389
so it’s up to me today.

54
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,391
Thought it might cheer her up.

55
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,352
Dan Rider, by the way.

56
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,437
Hello.

57
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,900
Yes. Good.

58
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:25,117
Find his weak spot,
but just don’t show him yours.

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,619
Move. Think.

60
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,583
All right, Wain,
that’s enough.

61
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,585
You’ll be late for your
meetings, you daft apeth.

62
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,754
Just allow me to have
one more crack at him, sir.

63
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,175
The Bendigo Shuffle.
Come on. Here we are.

64
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,677
Left to right, or right
to left. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

65
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,806
I’m so sorry. Sorry.

66
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,225
I received word
of your foolish antics

67
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,935
at the country show.

68
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,354
A whole raft of complaints

69
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,482
about an odd fellow
being dangerous,

70
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,027
climbing nonchalantly
into the Longhorn’s pen

71
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,653
and standing not three yards

72
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,572
from the largest
and most ferocious animal

73
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,157
on the entire site.

74
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,326
I wanted to get
a closer look at him,

75
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,620
and, well, he didn’t have
a very good sense of humour,

76
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,413
-put it that way.
-Thank you.

77
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,082
Not renowned for their
sense of humour,

78
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,959
-are they, really, bulls?
-Aren’t they?

79
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,254
Every time I commission you
to illustrate a story for us,

80
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,299
you manage to create
some kind of ridiculous chaos.

81
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,929
Why were you throwing peanuts
at a bull?

82
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,389
I heard they like peanuts
and that it calms them down,

83
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,474
but it didn’t work.

84
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,560
The trouble with these
show cows, huge egos.

85
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,188
It’s a good job you can draw,
Mr Wain,

86
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,774
or we would have parted ways
some time ago.

87
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,317
And don’t think
I haven’t noticed

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,194
the state of your visage.

89
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,363
Oh, this wasn’t from the bull,
Sir William.

90
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,574
I’ve just come from a boxing
class with the great Jem Mace.

91
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,577
-Boxing?
-Mmm.

92
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,872
So when did you draw this?

93
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,999
On the train. From memory.

94
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,335
-All of them?
-Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,671
So, how fast
do you work exactly?

96
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,007
Oh. I’ll just show you...

97
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:05,968
Hmm.

98
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,431
I’ll be frank with you,
Mr Wain.

99
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,227
One of our speediest and most
prolific staff illustrators

100
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,021
has been poached
by a rival publication.

101
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,690
Do you think
you’d be up to it?

102
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,650
Well, yes, obviously.
I mean...

103
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,821
Well, I don’t find this work,
um, very taxing, Sir William.

104
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,322
I do it to pay the bills

105
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,866
and to provide
for the five hungry

106
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,534
and precocious sisters
that I live with.

107
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,952
Until they get married,
of course.

108
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,163
As a matter of fact,

109
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,415
I find the whole thing
rather inconvenient.

110
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,378
I don’t think
you quite understand me.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,840
On the basis of the speed
and quality of your work,

112
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,092
and with the proviso
that you can curb

113
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,094
your more imbecilic
behaviour,

114
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,347
I am offering you
a permanent position

115
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,434
on the staff of the
Illustrated London News.

116
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,186
That’s very kind of you,
but I can’t.

117
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,313
I have several
electric patents to finish

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,273
and, in fact,
I’m rather late

119
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,610
for a meeting with Henry Wood,
the celebrated composer.

120
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,112
-Henry Wood?
-I’ve written an opera.

121
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,199
This is not an opera,
Mr Wain.

122
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,285
By conventional standards,
it barely qualifies as music.

123
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,622
And this is not a plot.

124
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,043
It’s just
some of your thoughts.

125
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,794
I applaud your enthusiasm,

126
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,963
but you have to master
the basics of harmony first.

127
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,132
I-- I’ve invented
my own harmonies.

128
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,802
Yes, and that could be
part of the problem.

129
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,387
If it’s any consolation,

130
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,723
I thought the little drawing
you did on the cover sheet

131
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,433
was rather charming.

132
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,606
In the 18 months
since his father had died,

133
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,817
Louis had nominally become
the head of the household.

134
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,820
He was entirely unfit

135
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,406
to shoulder these new
worldly responsibilities,

136
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,202
but as the oldest and malest
of the six Wain siblings,

137
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,497
it had unfortunately
become his duty.

138
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,332
- Evening, Louis.
- Yes, good evening.

139
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,792
- Evening!
- Louis!

140
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,919
Yes, hello. How are you?

141
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,964
- Ooh, are you back?
- Yes, I’m back, Josephine.

142
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,715
Of course I’m back.
What do you mean?

143
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,550
Louis, did you meet
an eligible

144
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,594
young lady of means
in Hampshire?

145
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,305
No, I did not, but I did meet
some goats, some geese

146
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,765
and a rather
cantankerous bull.

147
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,100
That’s no use.

148
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,685
You can’t marry a goat,
can you?

149
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,436
Far better suited

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,939
would have been his beloved
sister Caroline,

151
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,441
who had become frustrated
by their rather whimsical

152
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,151
and bohemian mother

153
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,320
and stepped up at a young age

154
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,781
to take charge
as the family’s matriarch.

155
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,574
Have you been boxing again?

156
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,618
I told you, Caroline,
he barely charges me

157
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,495
because I gave him
that drawing of Bendigo.

158
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,039
Louis, will you practise
quadrilles with me after supper?

159
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,083
Ah, you’ve come
to murder me at last.

160
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,835
-Felicie, defend me, quick.
-En garde!

161
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,337
Don’t! We have to talk
about finances.

162
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,715
How was your meeting with
Sir William? Is he satisfied?

163
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,591
Sir William is, if anything,
overly satisfied.

164
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,760
He has offered me the position
of staff illustrator.

165
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,721
Now, I really do need
to get to my room.

166
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,224
Oh, my goodness!
Did you say staff illustrator?

167
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,852
Yes, staff illustrator,
but I did not accept it.

168
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,730
I beg your very pardon? Why?

169
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,399
We already have twice as many
outgoings as you have wages

170
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,068
and we’ve just hired
a governess.

171
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,779
I told you to keep that room
for my secondary projects.

172
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,115
Besides, I can teach them.
I’m perfectly qualified

173
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,034
in all the relevant subjects.

174
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,077
No, you can’t! You need
to be out there working!

175
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,039
Quite right. You need to be
out there working, Louis.

176
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,999
Governess!
I’m afraid we do not require

177
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,126
-your services at present.
-Louis!

178
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,420
Sorry for any
inconvenience.

179
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,256
Governess? Governess?

180
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,926
Do not go into
that woman’s room.

181
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,136
Governess?

182
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,557
Where are you?

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,975
Is she not in there?

184
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,435
Where... Where are you?

185
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,145
Shh.

186
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,522
Governess?
Is that you in there?

187
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,441
Miss Richardson,
if you are in the wardrobe,

188
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,859
we shall be most displeased.

189
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,444
There’s no need
to be frightened,

190
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,196
but I am going to
have to open the door.

191
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,489
Oh, for fuck’s sake.

192
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,074
After a count of three.

193
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,700
Three, two, one.

194
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,290
Right, yes.
No, I can see how...

195
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,751
I mean, as
first impressions go...

196
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,169
How do you do, Mr Wain?

197
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,004
Miss Richardson,
get out of the wardrobe.

198
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,799
Yes, of course. Would you like
to know my name, Mr Wain?

199
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,009
So you don’t have
to keep shouting "governess."

200
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,470
I believe your mother’s napping.
Not very thoughtful, is it?

201
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,472
Miss Richardson,
why were you in the wardrobe?

202
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,017
It helps me to concentrate
to be in a confined space.

203
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,913
And with Shakespeare,

204
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:26,875
- SHAKESPEARE - THE TEMPEST
- I know it inside out already,

205
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,814
so I block out the world
and play it through in my head.

206
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,358
That’s all very nice, but the
thing is I was just saying,

207
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,735
I am perfectly well versed
in mathematics and chemistry...

208
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,529
You shan’t be needing
my services, then.

209
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,364
-I’ll be on my way.
-No.

210
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,366
Miss Richardson,
he’s just being an ass.

211
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,284
I’m actually relieved
not to have to get up

212
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,578
at 4:30 every morning
to prepare lessons.

213
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,622
And I was a bit worried
about the ancient Greek.

214
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,082
Homer’s use
of the metrical ictus

215
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,417
does make it rather hard.

216
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,001
All those feminine caesuras.

217
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,795
I have no doubt
they’ll be much better off

218
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,505
in your accomplished hands.

219
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,633
I was just thinking,
I promised myself to submit

220
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,927
my steady cycle patent
before the end of the month,

221
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,971
if I’m teaching my sisters
the feminine senoras...

222
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,472
-Caesuras.
-Exactly that.

223
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,433
I won’t have time.

224
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,018
So you’d like me to stay?

225
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,523
My poor husband William
was thrown out

226
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,567
by his family
in Staffordshire.

227
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,319
-They were all Protestant.
-Leek.

228
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,655
The town’s called Leek,
Miss Richardson.

229
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,323
-Isn’t that funny?
-That’s hilarious.

230
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,159
They talk like this up there.

231
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,994
He wanted
to be a Catholic,

232
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,455
but his father wouldn’t let him,
and so he just ran away.

233
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,707
-He was a Cathoholic.
-Shush, Marie.

234
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,750
-How did you meet him?
-I thought it was funny.

235
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,127
Through the church.

236
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,713
I designed tapestries
for the...

237
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,340
Ooh. You’re getting heavy.
...for the church

238
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,593
and he came from a silk family.

239
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,303
He was a draper.

240
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,805
And my own father...

241
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,308
I’m French, you see.

242
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,018
...smuggled himself to England

243
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,769
by disguising himself
as a woman.

244
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,689
We’re a family
of mischief-makers,

245
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,940
Miss Richardson.

246
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,693
We may as well have been called
the Shenanigans.

247
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,071
You’ll have your hands full
with these three.

248
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,574
And as for you two,
high time you found

249
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,868
some nice husbands
of your own, don’t you think?

250
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,661
We will, Mother,
in time.

251
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,457
Well,
I was given quite the look

252
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,460
from a hatted man
with a moustache on the bus.

253
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,296
Absolutely enormous moustache

254
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,590
and a very prominent brow.

255
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,133
Yes, it was very prominent.

256
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,552
It was like a dome.
But, um, it...

257
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,472
Well, it was
quite the glance.

258
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,015
It was embarrassing.

259
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,393
-Did he seem wealthy, Josephine?
-Mother.

260
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,229
Josephine’s
going to marry a man

261
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,272
with a big moustache.

262
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,483
Caroline,
he might have a brother.

263
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,358
Miss Caroline.

264
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,114
Is everything to your
satisfaction, Miss Richardson?

265
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
Very much so.

266
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,702
Why do you ask?

267
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,620
Oh, no.
Just, I was going to say,

268
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,330
if the room
wasn’t to your liking,

269
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,625
I would be perfectly happy
for you to swap with me.

270
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,712
That won’t be necessary.
I’m very comfortable.

271
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,842
Of course, but I wouldn’t
want you to feel... ill at ease.

272
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,094
Sharing the floor...

273
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,472
with a man.

274
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,311
Why would that make me
feel ill at ease?

275
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,565
Very well.

276
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,026
Please keep
all of your belongings in order.

277
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,069
You are here
as an example to my sisters.

278
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,948
Of course. You’re very good
with them, by the way.

279
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,826
It must be exhausting,
having to be the grown-up.

280
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,579
Well, I am a grown-up,
so it’s not exhausting.

281
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,420
Why are you holding a rock?

282
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,130
I travel a lot,

283
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,549
so I like to bring a few rocks
with me from Shrewsbury,

284
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,968
where I grew up.
Helps me to feel at home.

285
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,678
Why don’t you have this one?

286
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,898
Sleep well...

287
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,817
Miss Richardson.

288
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,081
-Morning.
-Morning.

289
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,463
Louis had learnt
to control the chaos in his mind

290
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,298
by always moving

291
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,759
and for many years
had been quite content

292
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,761
frantically pursuing
his various interests,

293
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:13,098
as failed art teacher,
failed musician,

294
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,601
aspiring inventor,
enthusiastic polyhobbyist,

295
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,645
and, of course,
part-time illustrator.

296
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,649
But the one thing
he had never considered,

297
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,777
in spite of constant pressure to
find an eligible young spouse,

298
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,612
was the possibility

299
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,365
of ever leading
any kind of romantic life.

300
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,995
And so, as a strange, tingly
feeling crackled in his breast

301
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,123
and sparkled
through this loins,

302
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,167
I think it would be fair to say
that the innocent Mr Wain

303
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,837
didn’t really know
what the hell was going on.

304
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,301
He had an inkling, of course.
But how could he be sure

305
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,638
that these feelings
would be reciprocated?

306
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,348
What of the unsightly harelip

307
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:59,018
that he so sproutily disguised
with his careful moustache?

308
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,645
Upon closer scrutiny,

309
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,440
she would surely notice
this unfortunate deformity

310
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,691
and run a mile.

311
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,696
Or perhaps, she would not be
so impressed to discover

312
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,657
that in spite
of the rather playful exterior,

313
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,410
his mind was a dark,
screaming hurricane

314
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,747
of crippling anxieties
and recurring nightmares.

315
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,712
Not to mention, of course,
the gossiping neighbours

316
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,715
who would all consider it
ghastly for a lowly governess

317
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,552
to be engaging in these
bourgeois games of courtship.

318
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,305
Emily Richardson’s slightly
unconventional attitude

319
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,723
to her employer’s privacy

320
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,349
had already caught the eye

321
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,435
of nosy-posy Mrs Du Frayne,

322
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,145
who was, by all accounts,

323
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,398
the blabberiest mouth
this side of the River Thames.

324
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,569
Suffice it to say,

325
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,404
there were a great
many obstacles

326
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,616
that stood in the way
of Louis and Emily.

327
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,368
And in a different world,
he might well have decided

328
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,413
not to disturb Sir William
Ingram’s daily splosh

329
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,540
at the Turkish baths
in Islington.

330
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,834
Ah. Good morning, Mr Wain.

331
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,795
Good morning, Sir William.

332
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,797
Don’t often see you in here.

333
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,759
I’ve come to speak to you.

334
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,305
-Have you got a moment?
-Yes, of course, Louis.

335
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,682
Just let me finish
my morning exercises.

336
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,184
Yes, of course.

337
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,401
Actually, I might do some laps
myself now that I’m here.

338
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,114
Careful! Careful, Louis.

339
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,790
Oh! Louis?

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,336
So you’ve come
to your senses, young man.

341
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,881
Why the sudden
change of heart?

342
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,135
Well, we’ve hired a governess
to teach my younger sisters.

343
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,720
-A governess?
-Mmm.

344
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,015
Ah, and you don’t want her
dashing off to some other family

345
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,600
because you can’t pay her.

346
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,561
Something
like that, yes.

347
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,688
Well, I’ll start you off
on poverty wages,

348
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,483
as is standard,
but they will be regular.

349
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:15,113
And I’m afraid we can’t pay you
for holidays

350
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,031
or expenses at the moment.

351
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:21,286
Will those terms be
to your satisfaction, Mr Wain?

352
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,580
Good.

353
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,874
Tap, tap. Advance.

354
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,375
-Advance.
-Tap, tap.

355
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,168
-Tap, tap. Advance.
-Advance. Okay.

356
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,503
En garde!

357
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,171
-En garde!
-En garde!

358
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,465
Caroline, can I show you
how I do fencing?

359
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,217
Not right now.

360
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,095
-En garde.
-Please be civilised, girls.

361
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,472
Mrs Wain, would you
accompany us on the piano?

362
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,892
I would love to
accompany you on the piano.

363
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,227
Let’s show them
what we’ve been practising.

364
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,688
Every penny-counting rogue
in London knows that trick.

365
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,149
-You’re not supposed to say yes.
-Did you not bargain with him?

366
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,026
-Have I taught you nothing?
-I’m happy with it, Herb.

367
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,819
Actually, I really ought
to be getting back.

368
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,779
I have to start work
on my steady cycle patent.

369
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,781
Forget that.
Nobody understands what it is.

370
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,201
Don’t be such a fucking drip.
If you’re happy, you’re happy.

371
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,246
I mean, you’ve been swindled,
so I don’t understand that.

372
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,832
Let’s have some fun. I haven’t
seen you for three weeks.

373
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,460
You’ve been spending too much
time with your weird sisters.

374
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,129
You are staff illustrator
for the top newspaper in London.

375
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,756
All you need now
is the loving touch

376
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,549
of a well-bosomed
aristocrat.

377
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,885
That’s the thing about
Phil May, the saucy fiend.

378
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,971
Always hosting a skulk
of wealthy young vixens.

379
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,682
We can’t celebrate
your success without you.

380
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,684
There’ll be dancing
later, perhaps?

381
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,103
There will be if you’re here,
I know that much.

382
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,564
-I’m in.
-Come on.

383
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,161
Shh!

384
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,873
Be quiet.

385
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,501
Oh. I was so quiet.

386
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,378
Marie is having a nightmare.

387
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,754
Oh.

388
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,924
You’re drunk.

389
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,178
Perhaps a little.
I’ve been celebrating.

390
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,265
I accepted the job...

391
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,975
with Sir William.

392
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,059
Good.

393
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,353
Now go to bed.

394
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,522
Caroline.
I can feel prickles.

395
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,149
-It’s okay.
-I’m scared.

396
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,277
-I’m here. I’m here.
-I’m scared, Caroline.

397
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,779
It’s all right.
It’s just our silly brother

398
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,990
trampling up the stairs.

399
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,534
Shh.

400
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,496
Try to think of a meadow
or a breeze.

401
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,374
Keep calm, Marie, keep calm.

402
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,959
Breathe.

403
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,922
Uh, good evening.

404
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,133
-No.
-What?

405
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,635
-Go away. Go away.
-Yes. What? Why?

406
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,345
-What do you mean, why?
-I don’t...

407
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,139
Yes, of course. Yes, sorry.

408
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,267
What are you doing, Mr Wain?

409
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,935
-I don’t understand.
-Get out!

410
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,354
Right, yes, of course.
Sorry. I apologise.

411
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,024
I am under your employ, Mr Wain,
but I do not expect

412
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,276
to have to tolerate you
barging in here after hours

413
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,236
while I’m...

414
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,447
Well, it doesn’t matter
what I was doing, does it?

415
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,032
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

416
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,700
It’s just I have
so many sisters

417
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,577
that sometimes I forget
that it’s...

418
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,995
Were you painting something?

419
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,830
That’s none of your business,
Mr Wain.

420
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,292
But, yes, if you must know.

421
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,463
I’ve got a drawing lesson
with the girls tomorrow,

422
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,632
and all you Wains
are such accomplished artists

423
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,259
that I rather thought I could do
with a bit of preparation.

424
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,469
I see.

425
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,139
Well, I was, um...

426
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,517
Well, I just wanted to
invite you to the theatre.

427
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,726
THE TEMPEST

428
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,645
As an educational trip,

429
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,772
with Felicie, Claire and Marie.

430
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,692
I’m so sorry again, Miss
Richardson. I do apologise.

431
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,486
I’m terribly embarrassed.

432
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,114
It’s just I was excited
to share the idea with you

433
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,658
and I just don’t want you to
think you have to be cooped up

434
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,744
in this house all the time,
that’s all.

435
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,464
I think it sounds
like a rather splendid idea.

436
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,970
Please just knock the next time
that you wish to see me.

437
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,179
Of course.

438
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,815
-Is something funny, Mr Wain?
-Not at all.

439
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:02,984
Not at all.

440
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,822
Good night, Emily.

441
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,283
Good night, Mr Wain.

442
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,791
Miss Richardson?

443
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,588
Yes?

444
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,299
When it comes to drawing,

445
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,968
there’s only really one rule
you ever need to teach.

446
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,263
It’s to look.

447
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,438
Mummy! Daddy! Help me!

448
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,899
I’m drowning! I’m drowning!

449
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,882
You’re so ugly! Ugly!

450
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,802
You don’t belong here!
You don’t belong anywhere!

451
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,064
It’s magic.

452
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,441
What a clever bugger
Mr Newton was.

453
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,485
Uh, language,
please, Felicie.

454
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,738
- A clever sausage?
- Sausage I will accept,

455
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,782
although I fear
it rather fails to capture

456
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,492
the spirit of Newton’s genius.

457
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,619
I’m a genius.

458
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,247
If you work hard and continue
with your studies, Marie,

459
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,374
perhaps one day, you will be.

460
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,084
Thank you,
Miss Richardson.

461
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,253
You’re very welcome.
Thank you.

462
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,463
Quiet on the stairs,
please, girls.

463
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,176
Crumpets, biscuits, cake!

464
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,028
Ooh. Come in.

465
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,197
Good morning.

466
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:56,949
Morning.

467
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,202
How was your lesson?

468
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,830
It was very good, thank you.

469
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,374
Turns out that your sisters
don’t need my help with drawing,

470
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,168
so we tried something
else instead.

471
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,586
Good. That’s good.

472
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,883
I hereby atone
for my drunken imposition

473
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,718
by presenting myself
to you naked.

474
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,887
Please don’t present yourself
to me naked, Mr Wain.

475
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,972
I might consider that
to be a secondary imposition,

476
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,474
arguably greater
than the first.

477
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,977
But you cannot have failed
to observe

478
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,563
that I have quite
a profound harelip.

479
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,026
Yes. What of it, Mr Wain?

480
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,697
Sorry. Have I made a mistake?

481
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,450
No, I think you look
very handsome.

482
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,704
So, uh...

483
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,082
Well, am I forgiven?

484
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,335
Why do you need me
to forgive you, Mr Wain?

485
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:01,514
When do you think we might
make our trip to the theatre?

486
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,268
For the, uh, for the education
of the girls, of course.

487
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,395
Of course.

488
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,607
Well, I’ll just consult
my diary.

489
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,734
Excellent. Well, I shall
look forward to it.

490
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,822
Thank you.

491
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,159
I appreciate the gesture.

492
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,001
But, Mother, we have
not yet settled our accounts

493
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,628
with the coal merchant
and the butcher.

494
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,046
He should have
consulted me first.

495
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,673
Boring.

496
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,134
We cannot let him out
looking like this.

497
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,970
Why you’ve committed
this most wanton

498
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,265
and violent act of self-harm,
I do not know.

499
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,392
How will he ever
meet a woman of fortune?

500
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,437
Caroline, he’s had a shave,
that’s all.

501
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,106
Marie, darling,
where have you gone?

502
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,275
Well, I think
we should all go.

503
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,943
Make an evening of it.

504
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,736
Josephine,
we at least must stay.

505
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,947
Marie?

506
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,450
Don’t come in.

507
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,244
Marie, what’s happened?

508
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,377
Oh, it’s all right.

509
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,839
It’s all right.
It’s perfectly natural.

510
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,762
If anything, it’s a good thing.
It means you’re a woman.

511
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,266
Well, I should like to go
not so much for the play

512
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,602
but for the handsome
young bachelors in the crowd.

513
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,145
We can practise
our flirtations.

514
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,355
I should like to go
because I should like to go.

515
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,982
If you change your mind,
Caroline,

516
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,650
you’re more than welcome
to join us.

517
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,527
I think it fair to say
that Miss Richardson

518
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,279
has had a positive effect
on this family

519
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,697
and we should show
our gratitude.

520
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,157
I’m a woman!

521
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,575
Hurray!

522
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,369
Sorry, everyone.
Bit of a situation,

523
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,622
but everything’s under control.

524
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,794
Oh.

525
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,480
That’s the governess
I was telling you about.

526
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,233
-Oh.
-For the Wains.

527
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,653
-Uh, you look very...
-No, thank you. So do you.

528
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,321
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Shall we...

529
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,574
-Yes, let’s...
-Yes, let’s sit down. Good.

530
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,452
Is this...
Is this your first time?

531
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,329
-Yes, it is, it is.
-Okay.

532
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,332
-It’s exciting.
-Good.

533
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:36,669
Ooh.

534
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,797
-Here.
-Thank you.

535
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,350
Boatswain!

536
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,479
Here, master!
What cheer?

537
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,357
Good, speak
to the mariners.

538
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,820
Fall to’t, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground:

539
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,740
bestir, bestir.

540
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,869
Heigh, my hearts!

541
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,456
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!

542
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,166
Yare, yare!

543
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,501
Take in the topsail.

544
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,545
Topsail!

545
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,880
Tend to the master’s whistle.

546
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,342
Mummy! Daddy! Help me!

547
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,721
I’m drowning! I’m drowning!

548
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,766
Help me! I’m drowning!
Please!

549
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,519
Help me! I’m drowning!

550
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,990
Um... this is the
gentlemen’s toilet.

551
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,742
Yes. Sorry.

552
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,244
I...

553
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:58,000
I was worried that you might be
distressed about something.

554
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,878
No, no. Just a funny turn,
that’s all.

555
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,047
Right, yes.

556
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,383
No, I thought
it might have, um,

557
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,469
might have reminded you
of something.

558
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,684
Something you found frightening
as a child, perhaps,

559
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,478
like a recurring nightmare.

560
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,689
Like "The Sea
Full Of Big Ships."

561
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:24,401
I might have accidentally
looked in your journal.

562
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,946
Well, that... that was nosy.

563
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,531
I’m afraid it’s one
of my many flaws.

564
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,784
-Nosiness?
-I’m very nosy, yes.

565
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,370
It’s partly why I chose
to become a governess.

566
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,538
Did you find it horrifying?

567
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:40,125
All those dark
and disturbing visions?

568
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:44,046
No. I found it quite reassuring,
to be honest.

569
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,508
I tend to have nightmares about

570
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,760
not being able
to get out of places.

571
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,428
I once spent an entire dream

572
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,013
stuck in a
very complicated barn.

573
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,850
Well, thank God you didn’t
get stuck in that wardrobe.

574
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,019
Yeah, thank God.

575
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,275
Thank God I had you
to let me out of it.

576
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,289
Good God!

577
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,291
It definitely did happen
in the toilet.

578
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,127
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

579
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,546
Well, if it isn’t
my favourite family,

580
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,716
the Wains. Hello, girls.
How are you, Louis?

581
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,261
Very well, thank you,
Mrs Du Frayne. Um, how are you?

582
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,765
Quite well. Terrific eulogy
at your father’s funeral.

583
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,267
Thank you. You say that
every time I see you.

584
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,312
And you must be
the famous Emily Richardson.

585
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,522
-Nice to meet you.
-We were just remarking

586
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,816
that we don’t often see
governesses at the theatre.

587
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,485
Was it your first time?

588
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,405
I hear you got a little
bit confused...

589
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,575
about the lavatories.

590
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,541
Yes, confused.

591
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,127
Quite charming.

592
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,058
You are clearly
an intelligent woman,

593
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,935
Miss Richardson,

594
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,938
and we’ve been impressed
by your teaching.

595
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,857
But there are certain aspects
of your behaviour,

596
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,110
and certain aspects

597
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,196
of the behaviour
that you encourage

598
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,365
in my ridiculous brother

599
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,870
that we simply cannot tolerate.

600
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,748
This evening was intended
to be an educational event.

601
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,667
Yet now, thanks to you,

602
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,710
this family
is the talk of the town.

603
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,295
And not in a good way.

604
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,968
You have three days
to get your affairs in order.

605
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,197
I just wanted to thank you,
Mr Wain,

606
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,576
for a very pleasant evening.

607
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,160
I had a very nice time.

608
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,624
I’ve taught
of countless adventures

609
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,459
from the safety
of a schoolroom.

610
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,674
But it was exciting
to be taken on one for once.

611
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,231
I... I like your shawl,
by the way.

612
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,861
Thank you. It was my mother’s.

613
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,033
It’s blue.

614
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,162
Yep. It’s blue.

615
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,545
Goodbye, Louis.

616
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,397
I don’t care, I don’t care,
I don’t care what people think.

617
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,156
Nor do I.

618
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,993
-Mmm! Close the door.
-What?

619
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,788
Close the door. Ooh. Ooh.

620
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,500
- What happened?
- I fell over my dress.

621
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,168
- I’m sorry.
- It’s not your fault.

622
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,461
Sit down.

623
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,926
As this peculiar romance

624
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,011
blossomed clumsily into flower,

625
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,055
the discrepancy
in their social standing

626
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,683
became the cause
of great controversy.

627
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,268
One neighbour,
it was widely rumoured,

628
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:54,106
vomited immediately upon
hearing news of their courtship.

629
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,442
For the coupling of a gentleman
with a lady of the servile class

630
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,861
was considered
nothing short of revolting.

631
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,655
Not to mention

632
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,991
that the undeniably
charming Miss Richardson

633
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,618
was, by the standards
of the day,

634
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,745
positively geriatric.

635
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,920
But Louis cared little for
these foolish preconceptions,

636
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,132
and in January
of the year 1884,

637
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,135
he asked Emily
for her hand in marriage.

638
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:30,684

639
638
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,188
Trim the bottom.
Trim the bottom.

640
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,577
- It’s dusty.
- It’s a bit dusty.

641
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,789
MRS W WAIN
ONE POUND, TEN SHILLINGS

642
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,295
The weeks
turned to months,

643
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,505
and in spite of the newly
fractious relationship

644
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,299
with his sisters,

645
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,217
Louis quietly continued
in his endeavours

646
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,927
to support them.

647
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,263
Every week, he would
post a modest cheque

648
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,765
to his dear mother,

649
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,184
and even began to take on
private commissions

650
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,144
as a dog portraitist,

651
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,397
visiting dukes and duchesses,
lords and ladies,

652
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,192
and their pampered
canine friends.

653
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,987
At the same time,
he continued with his work

654
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,032
covering general news
and various agricultural shows

655
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,784
for Sir William.

656
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,162
And thus for six
precious months,

657
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,332
Louis and Emily
lived a perfectly normal,

658
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,044
if societally unconscionable
married life.

659
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,824
I gather you’re an
educated woman, Mrs Wain.

660
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,786
Yes, Doctor.
I was a governess.

661
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,915
I... I see.

662
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,167
Well, in that case,

663
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,253
I trust you will
understand me when I say...

664
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,006
you have terminal
cancer of the breast.

665
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,805
Yes, Doctor.

666
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,991
Just when I was starting
to enjoy it.

667
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,756
What was that?

668
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,675
Strange.

669
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, Louis, look.

670
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,320
Hello there, little thing.

671
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,073
-Hello.
-Hello there, cat.

672
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:37,078
You’re soaking wet.
You poor little thing.

673
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,623
Why don’t you
come in the warm with us?

674
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,042
Yeah? Hello.

675
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,419
We’ll take care of you.
Won’t we, Louis?

676
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,005
Yes, we will.

677
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,050
Hello. Hello.

678
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,093
Ooh.

679
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,058
It’s all right.
It’s all right.

680
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,770
Rain. It’s just raining.

681
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,115
Who’s that?

682
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,367
It’s Louis.

683
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,620
Got another
little towel for you.

684
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,041
-That’s better, isn’t it?
-See?

685
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,334
That’s better.

686
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,171
That’s better.

687
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,465
-Hello.
-Hello.

688
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,175
-Hello.
-Hello.

689
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,513
Hello.

690
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,348
Where do you think
you’re going?

691
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,851
What would you like
to be called?

692
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,520
Percy?

693
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,106
-I quite like Percy.
-Paul?

694
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,482
Not Paul.

695
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,359
Peter?

696
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,944
Peter.

697
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,530
-Peter.
-Peter.

698
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,964
It’s sure to be a quick
kerfuffle when Bendigo’s here

699
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,216
with the Bendigo Shuffle!

700
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,386
Curious little fellow,
isn’t he?

701
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,929
Yes, but he’s electric, Herb.

702
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,265
Look how his fancy
all adore him.

703
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,725
Half his opponent’s size,

704
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:25,103
yet he knows how to harness
the electricity of the crowd.

705
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,022
Are you talking
about the photographers?

706
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,275
Look properly, Herb.
The electricity.

707
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,110
Finally, I’m starting
to understand it.

708
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,821
Is everything
all right at home?

709
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,574
-With Emily, I mean?
-Oh, yes, of course.

710
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,534
We have a new friend.
He’s called Peter.

711
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,078
-Peter?
-He’s a cat. We have a cat now.

712
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,873
-For mousing, you mean?
-No, Herb, as a pet.

713
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,624
Okay, Louis,
I’m worried about you.

714
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,836
-Why?
-You have a cat as a pet.

715
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,922
Do you know the true meaning
of the phrase,

716
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:56,092
"There’s no time
like the present," Herb?

717
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,179
It’s that there isn’t.
It’s too fleeting.

718
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,181
In fact, I have a hypothesis

719
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,308
that electricity is what
pushes us through time.

720
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,352
We turn the past
into the future

721
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,437
with the power
of our electricity.

722
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,856
But that process
is entirely reversible.

723
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,108
Remembering the past
is no different

724
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,693
from imagining the future.

725
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,363
And neither is different
to life itself.

726
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,573
I can remember Emily
in the future

727
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,116
and she will be there.

728
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,036
Do you see
what I’m saying, Herb?

729
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,373
Do you see what I’m saying?

730
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:38,051
Bendigo! Bendigo!
Bendigo! Bendigo!

731
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,347
Bendigo! Bendigo! Bendigo!

732
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,641
But these don’t capture
the spirit of the fight,

733
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,975
Sir William.

734
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,186
Yes, they do.

735
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,688
That’s why they’re in vogue.

736
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:55,318
They’re fast, they’re cheap
and they’re 100% accurate.

737
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,237
But where is the electricity?

738
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,954
Louis, I hear your wife
is very sick.

739
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:11,167
I know that you continue to
support your mother and sisters,

740
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,586
which is admirable, Louis,
so I’m...

741
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,797
I’m sorry
to have to say this.

742
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,799
But it may be
that I cannot use you

743
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,510
quite as much as I would like
for the time being.

744
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,679
I have to get
our finances in order,

745
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:26,474
and that means making
difficult, practical decisions.

746
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:30,562
But my advice to you is this:

747
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,442
Spend the time that you gain
with your wife,

748
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,611
because when she is gone...

749
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,910
it will hurt.

750
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,126
These are precious weeks,
Louis.

751
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,004
Do you understand?

752
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,780
- Come on, Peter.
- Come on, Peter.

753
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,824
Up the stairs.
Come on.

754
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,659
- I think he’s coming.
- Peter.

755
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,453
Peter?

756
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,080
Good boy.

757
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,500
Good boy.

758
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,836
Good boy.

759
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,340
Well done, Peter.

760
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,800
-Well done, Peter.
-Well done.

761
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,164
Let’s go for a walk. Yes.

762
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,552
-After you.
-Thank you.

763
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,645
I think
Peter likes the oak trees.

764
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,438
Mm-hmm.

765
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,900
- They’re amazing, aren’t they?
- Mmm.

766
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,194
They live for a thousand years.

767
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,155
Three hundred years to grow.

768
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,616
Three hundred years to live.

769
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,160
Three hundred years to die.

770
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,248
Oh, that’ll do.

771
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,334
It looks lovely.
Peter likes it now.

772
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,796
Don’t you, Peter?

773
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,279
Electricity.

774
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,658
I feel electricity.

775
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,829
Can you feel it?

776
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,966
This is our place.

777
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,429
This is where I’ll be, Louis.

778
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,265
When you need me.

779
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,953
Stuffed mouse for lunch,

780
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,497
Mrs Wain?

781
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,584
No, thank you, Peter.

782
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:24,420
I’m not partial to mouse,
personally.

783
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,882
Sparrow pie?

784
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,844
I don’t care for sparrow either,
truth be told.

785
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,555
-It’s a bit gristly.
-Oh.

786
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,892
-Perhaps a slice of...
-Oh, could you stop it, please?

787
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,480
I don’t have an appetite today.
I’m a bit tired.

788
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,608
What’s the matter?

789
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,862
I have cancer, Louis.

790
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,074
I’m in quite a lot of pain.

791
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:01,249
Ready?

792
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,584
That depends on what
you’re about to show me.

793
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,002
Ta-da!

794
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,132
Oh, Louis.

795
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,761
When did you do all this?
Has Sir William seen these?

796
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:16,180
Sir William hasn’t seen these.
These are for you, Emily.

797
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,015
-Well, you must show him.
-Why?

798
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,852
Sir William doesn’t care
for Peter, does he, now?

799
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,104
And besides, I shall be...

800
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:29,068
I shall be spending more time
with you while you’re still...

801
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,862
I’m the one who’s ill, Louis.

802
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,906
Don’t you start wallowing
in it too.

803
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,955
Sir William!

804
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,919
Sir William! Whoo-oo!

805
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,383
Sir William!

806
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,181
Whoo-oo! Sir William!

807
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,311
Whoo-oo! Sir William!

808
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,520
Excuse me.

809
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,440
Excuse me, sir.

810
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,775
-Oi!
-Whoo!

811
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,360
Oi! Stop!

812
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,530
Oi!

813
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:17,033
This club’s
for gentlemen only!

814
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,083
I’m sorry she wasn’t allowed in,
old boy. I did try.

815
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,838
It wasn’t a very
convincing disguise, was it?

816
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,177
She should be at home resting.

817
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,391
It was her idea.

818
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,523
CATTY MEWS

819
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,732
Hmm.

820
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:50,817
MILK

821
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,531
Very sorry if we’ve wasted
your time, Sir William.

822
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,787
Yes.

823
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:12,088
I have two pages earmarked
in the Christmas edition.

824
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,799
Reserved for a bit
of festive frivolity.

825
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,301
Something to raise the spirits
of our readers.

826
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,764
I’d like you to fill them
with cats.

827
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,726
With... cats?

828
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:30,398
Yes. With cats.

829
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,443
Don’t you think perhaps
a spread of silly dogs

830
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,279
would be more appealing
for your readership?

831
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,947
I’ve seen dogs before.

832
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:43,160
And you capture
something of the cat, Louis.

833
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:46,372
Perhaps because you yourself
are a bit of a renegade.

834
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,916
An outcast, dare I say.

835
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:57,091
How you’ve managed to conjure
images of such delight

836
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,011
at such a dark time...

837
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,347
I don’t know.

838
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,448
Merry Christmas.

839
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,496
Illustrated London News!

840
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,167
Illustrated London News!

841
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,732
Throughout history,

842
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,944
cats have been worshipped
as mystical gods

843
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,324
and maligned as the evil allies
of witchery and sin.

844
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,871
But I think you’re the
first person ever to see

845
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,624
that they are
in fact ridiculous.

846
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,337
They’re silly and cuddly.

847
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,382
And lonely.

848
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,385
And frightened and brave.

849
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,513
Like us.

850
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,478
One day, I don’t think
it’ll be so peculiar

851
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,772
to have a cat in the house
as a little pet.

852
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,743
What’s going on in that
funny little head of yours?

853
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,507
Sometimes...

854
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,431
I think about the day
you won’t be here...

855
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,685
and...

856
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,065
I have to say, Emily,

857
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,234
I find it intolerably
difficult to imagine.

858
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,992
I will be so very alone.

859
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,830
You’ll be all right, Louis.

860
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,833
You’ll have Peter.

861
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,635
This time with you, Emily...

862
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,643
playing with Peter in the
evening, sitting by the fire...

863
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:01,150
these have been the best days
of my entire life.

864
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:08,157
I don’t know why it is
that I find it so very difficult

865
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,078
just being here
on this earth, but...

866
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,915
I can say with absolute
certainty

867
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:20,169
that you have made it
much, much better.

868
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,051
You make the world beautiful...

869
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,890
and warm and kind.

870
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,440
I just wanted to say thank you
for that before it’s too late.

871
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,532
I don’t make
the world beautiful, Louis.

872
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,161
The world is beautiful.

873
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,958
And you’ve helped me
to see that too.

874
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,089
Just remember...

875
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,511
hmm, however hard
things get...

876
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,599
however much you feel
like you’re struggling...

877
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,021
the world is full of beauty.

878
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,902
And it’s up to you
to capture it, Louis.

879
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,072
To look.

880
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,786
And to share it
with as many people as you can.

881
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,626
You are a prism.

882
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,506
Through which
that beam of life refracts.

883
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,183
Here we are.

884
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:07,646
A special New Year’s breakfast
for you today, Mrs Wain.

885
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,523
Don’t worry, Peter.

886
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,483
Yes, I haven’t forgotten
about your eggs.

887
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,612
Thank you.

888
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,225

889
888
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:12,187
Louis Wain special
in the Illustrated London News!

890
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:15,816
Come and get it!
Illustrated London News!

891
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,776
In the years following,

892
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,070
Louis buried
the pain of his grief

893
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:23,323
under a quite extraordinary
quantity of cat pictures.

894
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,744
Almost without realising,

895
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,247
he had achieved
an alarming degree of success

896
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,624
and completely altered
the public’s attitude

897
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,293
towards the humble cat.

898
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,879
Look! There he is!
Louis Wain!

899
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,929
Your cats have won you
many fans, Wain.

900
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,639
Congratulations.

901
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:50,517
He says thank you,
but go easy on the sherry.

902
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,187
You don’t mind if I work
for other people, do you?

903
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,147
That’s the cheek

904
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,608
that’s catapulted you
to fame, my boy.

905
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,319
Oh, we’ve had a telegram
from Miss Judith Shenton

906
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,070
of the National Cat Club.

907
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:03,906
They’re having
a kind of cat competition

908
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,532
and would like you
to judge it.

909
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,326
It’s so wonderful to meet

910
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,161
a kindred spirit, Mr Wain.

911
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,498
I’ve heard even gentry
are keeping cats as pets now.

912
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,791
-Hmm.
-And so handsome too.

913
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,878
I’m just astonished at your
level of knowledge, I really am.

914
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,215
Although I must admit, I don’t
fully understand your theory

915
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,217
about cats preferring
to face north.

916
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,594
Cats will always prefer
to face and walk north,

917
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,304
especially along a wall,
you will notice.

918
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,014
Their whiskers act
as antennae,

919
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,225
attracted to the positive poles
of the earth.

920
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,809
The tabby’s markings
are defined

921
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,811
by the electricity
of their feline heritage.

922
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:36,522
This particular animal
might have had

923
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,024
a great-grandmother
that was struck by lightning,

924
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,318
so defined are the markings
by the jaggedy lines.

925
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,530
-Fascinating.
-Electricity. From the head.

926
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,115
Right down the body
to the tail.

927
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,159
Cats are excellent
conductors of electricity.

928
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,702
Their features
are already changing

929
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:52,663
as they become more domesticated
and intelligent.

930
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,331
Their eyes will become larger,
their heads bigger

931
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,791
as their brains grow in size.

932
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,209
They will turn blue.

933
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,294
Eventually, they will stand
on their own hind legs

934
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,004
and communicate to us
in our own language.

935
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,840
Gosh. I’d no idea
it was so complicated.

936
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,634
Did you say
that they would turn blue?

937
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,470
-Yes. Of course.
-Wow.

938
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:11,056
Well, Mr Wain, thanks to you,

939
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,267
us cat people
are out of the shadows

940
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,769
and finally able to celebrate
in the open

941
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,604
with our feline children.

942
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,022
I’d like to thank you.

943
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:20,482
Oh, sorry.

944
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,150
Yep. Arm in.

945
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,780
The new president
of the National Cat Club.

946
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,198
Is that what it says?

947
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,995
NATIONAL CAT CLUB
DEPTFORD LONDON

948
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,678
I assumed you’d been spending
it all on frivolous luxuries.

949
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,179
’Cause you’ve forgotten
about your family.

950
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:53,432
Yet here you are
living in squalor and chaos!

951
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:56,101
-Don’t shout, Caroline!
-I am not shouting, Claire!

952
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,894
I’m explaining
to him with force.

953
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,772
There’s a cadaver now.
It’s eating a hawk.

954
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,357
Where has it all gone?

955
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,860
We’re in huge
amounts of debt.

956
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,820
It’s really starting to affect
Mother’s health.

957
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,573
-Where has it all gone?
-I didn’t copyright the images.

958
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:11,992
Oh, my God.

959
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:16,246
-Oh, my God, help us, please.
-What does that mean?

960
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,540
It means people have been
reprinting his pictures

961
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,667
all over the country
and he hasn’t seen a penny.

962
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:23,045
Which explains why he is living
rather like a pig.

963
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,880
The stench
is quite unbearable.

964
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:27,132
Some of the originals I have
exchanged in place of money.

965
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,925
So, in fact, they’ve become

966
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,802
a sort of currency
in themselves.

967
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,680
I gave the barber, well,
a handful of dancing cats,

968
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,932
and now I have free haircuts
for the rest of my life.

969
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,601
You’re not a child, Louis!

970
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,312
You’re the man.

971
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,316
You’re a man.

972
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,487
Our parents worked hard
for our reputation.

973
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,864
They worked hard to build
a fortune for their children,

974
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,452
and you have squandered it
on wretched cats!

975
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,830
And on a wilful, doomed,
tainted romance.

976
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,458
You’ve destroyed our family
with your selfishness

977
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,960
and you continue
with your childish delusions

978
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:05,796
which conspire
to keep us all in penury.

979
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,632
The indignity that we’ve
suffered at your hands, Louis.

980
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,134
-I didn’t do it on purpose.
-You didn’t do what on purpose?

981
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,053
You didn’t get married
on purpose?

982
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,609
No one told me I needed
to copyright the images.

983
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,778
What about Sir William?
He should have advised you.

984
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,822
I haven’t seen Sir William
for some time now.

985
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,533
-I am working for other people.
-We don’t have any money, Louis.

986
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,326
And poor Marie...

987
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:42,749
What?

988
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,085
What?

989
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,170
Just tell him.

990
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,299
What has happened?

991
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,889
They hate me, Louis.

992
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,850
They’re plotting.
They’re going to murder me.

993
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,394
-We’re not going to murder you.
-Liar!

994
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,480
They’re going to throw me out
because I had relations.

995
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,774
I had relations
in the graveyard.

996
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,110
And we laughed.

997
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,031
They’re just jealous
because I saw heaven.

998
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,826
And that’s why I’ve got
the leprosy as punishment.

999
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:20,370
They’re all spinsters.

1000
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:23,957
They say it’s your fault.
Because of Miss Richardson.

1001
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,252
But it’s because they’re ugly

1002
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,671
and they lie
and plot and scheme.

1003
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,674
Marie, why don’t you
come and stay with me?

1004
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:36,136
-And you can play with the cats.
-No, no, no, no, not cats.

1005
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,305
They’re poisonous
and they’ve got diseases.

1006
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,515
And I’ve already got leprosy.

1007
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,185
Get it off me, Louis!
Get it off me!

1008
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:47,147
Get it off me! Get it off me!

1009
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,483
It’s going to be okay.
We’re all here for you.

1010
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,027
After a local
doctor’s tentative diagnosis

1011
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,820
of schizophrenia,

1012
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:56,281
the Wain family had done
everything they could

1013
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:58,074
for poor Marie.

1014
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,410
But Louis was at a loss,

1015
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:03,121
and so he went to an old friend
for advice.

1016
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,665
THE ILLUSTRATED
LONDON NEWS

1017
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,667
I have a series of properties

1018
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,711
in the village
of Westgate-on-Sea.

1019
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:11,379
They’re quite habitable

1020
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,799
and you’re welcome to stay there
for as long as you like,

1021
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:16,301
at a reduced rate,
on one condition.

1022
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:21,681
-You take your family with you.
-I...

1023
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,475
I couldn’t possibly,
Sir William.

1024
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,103
Especially after I’ve been
so callously unloyal.

1025
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:33,151
I have plenty of illustrators
on my books, Mr Wain.

1026
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:36,863
-Don’t flatter yourself.
-Why, then, Sir William?

1027
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:43,995
Because in spite of your
rather irregular temperament

1028
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,666
and nigglingly
peculiar foibles,

1029
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,085
in this occasionally
bleak world,

1030
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,004
you have shown a resilience
that I admire.

1031
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,965
And if you must know,

1032
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,634
you’ve brought me rather a lot
of cheer with your pictures.

1033
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,010
Of cats?

1034
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,304
Mmm.

1035
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,306
But they’re not just cats,
are they?

1036
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,102
You are a brave soul, Louis,

1037
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,062
but you can’t do all this
on your own.

1038
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,774
It sounds to me like Marie
needs a change of scenery.

1039
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:16,236
Fresh clothes,
proper food, brisk walks.

1040
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,744
-Thank you. Just in there.
-Yes, sir.

1041
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,539
- Louis!
- Hello! Hello! Hello!

1042
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:31,084
-It’s wonderful, Louis.
-Welcome to Bendigo Lodge.

1043
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,586
BENDIGO LODGE

1044
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,132
Caroline, welcome.

1045
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,758
Louis, it’s lovely.

1046
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,888
Welcome to Bendigo Lodge,
Mother.

1047
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,639
- Ooh, Bendigo.
- Bendigo.

1048
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:45,974
It’s perfect.

1049
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,786
Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these, thy gifts,

1050
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,831
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty...

1051
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:12,667
Well done, Peter.
You show them how to eat.

1052
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,587
Very good manners. Nina, try
and slow down a little bit.

1053
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,839
You’re terribly tiny to be
eating that much so quickly.

1054
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:19,341
Pass me your plate.

1055
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:23,637
Felicie, plate.

1056
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:27,223
That’s it. Well done.

1057
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,144
We could go
and walk tomorrow,

1058
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,813
wear our nice clothes
and smile at men.

1059
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,941
- They’ll run away.
- Run away?

1060
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,068
I don’t want to run away.
We just got here.

1061
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,403
So what
are we looking for, then?

1062
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,405
- A writer.
- Oh, no.

1063
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,532
Who writes for the newspaper.

1064
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,493
No. A doctor.

1065
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,578
I would like dark hair.

1066
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:50,246
- Dark hair.
- Blond.

1067
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,499
Oh, no. Untrustworthy.

1068
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,757
Give me the pillow,
Josephine!

1069
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:08,181
I think for you still
it’s better beside your legs.

1070
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,516
That was good.

1071
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,643
Triumph.
I get another go.

1072
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,688
Shall we shell?

1073
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,859
-Some plates.
-Bravo.

1074
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,028
-They’re a little fancy.
-Ooh.

1075
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:24,239
Yes, don’t drop them, please.

1076
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,616
Felicie, did you see
a better knife than this?

1077
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,369
- Why?
- ’Cause this one’s dreadful.

1078
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,246
All right.

1079
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,914
Or a sharpener.

1080
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:36,334
I’ll go
and get the pie.

1081
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,207
IN NURSERYLAND
WITH LOUIS WAIN

1082
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,293
THE LOUIS WAIN
NURSERY BOOK

1083
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,921
DADDY CAT
LOUIS WAIN

1084
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,529
Louis?

1085
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,328
It’s all right.
Not long now, Peter.

1086
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,041
Where are we going?

1087
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,801
Where are we going?

1088
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,596
I think
we should stop quite soon.

1089
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,224
- Are you tired?
- I’m quite tired.

1090
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,899
Louis?

1091
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,150
-Lunch.
-Come.

1092
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:25,819
-Come and eat.
-Come.

1093
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:30,824
I think he’s trying
to divert the electricity.

1094
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,118
Oh, that again.

1095
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,676
I’m scared, Louis.

1096
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,515
Me too.

1097
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,774

1098
1097
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:07,819
Get off me! Get off me!

1099
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,737
No, I said, get off!

1100
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,365
Let go of me!

1101
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,534
His sisters
went several years more

1102
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,245
without finding
a single suitor,

1103
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:20,206
and in spite of Sir William’s
cheery prognosis,

1104
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,834
Marie’s condition
did not improve.

1105
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,919
-Dr Elphick.
-Miss Wain.

1106
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:31,509
After the catastrophic marriage
of their only son,

1107
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:33,678
the fact that one
of their number

1108
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,556
was now officially
a raving lunatic

1109
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,018
did nothing to help
the family’s social status.

1110
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,228
-Thank you, Doctor.
-All the best.

1111
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:52,447
And then, his great
teacher and best friend,

1112
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,950
his dear old Peter,
passed away.

1113
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,423
Like a frenzied bat
in a burning oven,

1114
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:14,010
Louis’ heart was a screaming,
flapping mess.

1115
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,930
He wept without ceasing
for several years,

1116
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,932
but at the same time,

1117
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,518
he was overtaken by an
extraordinary new discovery,

1118
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,939
that the more intensely
he suffered,

1119
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,775
the more beautiful
his work became.

1120
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,152
He realised
that the memories he still held

1121
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:34,155
of his dear wife, Emily,
and darling Peter

1122
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,074
had become
powerful conductors

1123
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,661
of that mysterious electricity
in the atmosphere

1124
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,538
that he had so far
been unable to harness.

1125
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,438
- Mr Wain?
- Hmm?

1126
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,606
Are you aware of the reason
I’ve been summoned?

1127
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,150
I assume it’s to inform us

1128
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,068
on how Marie is doing
in the asylum.

1129
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,779
That or to conduct a study on
the neural evolution of my cats.

1130
01:16:56,863 --> 01:16:58,630
Bridget’s already halfway
to talking. Aren’t you, Bridget?

1131
01:16:58,692 --> 01:16:59,907
I do my best

1132
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:01,639
I’m afraid not, Mr Wain.

1133
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:02,562
but I am cat

1134
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:03,465
Although since you ask,

1135
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,219
Marie seems to be

1136
01:17:04,274 --> 01:17:05,580
- coping much better of late.
- jomping!

1137
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,206
I’m very glad
to hear it.

1138
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,042
I have been working
on a psychiatric patent

1139
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,762
- that I meant to show you.
- I like jomping!

1140
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:13,212
-It’s for an electric suit.
-An electric suit?

1141
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,298
Full body suit.
Made of copper and silken steel.

1142
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,300
Attached to a large
mechanical motor

1143
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:18,968
that transmits
a positive current

1144
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:20,970
through the nervous system
and into the brain,

1145
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,680
thus curing the patient
of all harmful thoughts

1146
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,349
and eradicating
their lunacies entirely.

1147
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,100
Would you care
to take a look at it?

1148
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:28,686
-No, thank you, Mr Wain.
-That’s a shame.

1149
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,396
I think there’s
a very high chance

1150
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,690
that it could cure Marie
entirely of her sickness.

1151
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,778
I’ve been called here, Mr Wain,

1152
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,822
because your sister Caroline
is concerned for your health.

1153
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:42,367
My health? Why would she be
concerned about my health?

1154
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,702
It’s not just Caroline
who is concerned, Louis.

1155
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,579
I understand you’re
planning a trip, Mr Wain?

1156
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,331
Indeed. I have sent

1157
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,416
some colourful missives
to several publications,

1158
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,918
including some new examples.

1159
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,128
More electrically
influenced samplings.

1160
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:57,173
I’m happy to say
the great William Hearst

1161
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,884
of the New York American
has offered me a full-time post

1162
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,886
as their cartoonist
at a considerable fee.

1163
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,722
Why do you have to go
to New York? It’s too far.

1164
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:06,349
Over 3,000 miles.

1165
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,351
Because, as you are
all so keen to remind me,

1166
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,977
we are lacking in funds
at the minute.

1167
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:12,438
This is not our house.
We are in debt.

1168
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:14,065
And for a variety of reasons

1169
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,817
that we are very well
acquainted with,

1170
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,320
my work is currently
of little value on these shores.

1171
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:21,364
What’s more,
the people of America

1172
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,825
are light years behind
in their attitude towards cats.

1173
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,535
I assume you’ve been reading
about Roosevelt

1174
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,703
and his Gentlemen’s Agreement
with the people of Japan.

1175
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:29,080
Japanese children
will now be taught

1176
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,040
in the same school
as their American compatriots

1177
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,750
and their immigrant parents
can freely roam

1178
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,877
in the streets of America,
but can their cats?

1179
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,213
I have helped this country
a great deal in this regard.

1180
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,006
Now I must help
the cats of America.

1181
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:41,217
For better or worse,
Dr Elphick, I am a prism

1182
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,386
and a transformative funnel
for negative electricity.

1183
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,720
In these tumultuous times,

1184
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,431
I want to make the people
of America smile.

1185
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,057
I’ve never seen an American
smile in my life.

1186
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:49,475
You have never seen
an American.

1187
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:50,768
It’s time to change that.

1188
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,186
The only reason
that you are here

1189
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,688
is my sister has summoned you

1190
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,189
because she is
extremely jealous

1191
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,941
and has been
since I was 12 years old

1192
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,610
and will do anything to prevent
me reaching my full potential.

1193
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:05,283
Mr Wain, there is no question
that you are delusional.

1194
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,034
But mere delusions
of grandeur

1195
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:09,412
are not sufficient reason
to commit you to hospital.

1196
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:12,957
I would quite strongly advise
against your trip to New York.

1197
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,834
I’d suggest you stay here
to rest,

1198
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,586
gain a little perspective

1199
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,130
before you proceed to the
next chapter of your life.

1200
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,840
But ultimately,
the choice is yours.

1201
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,234
You can run away
from your family, Louis.

1202
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,322
You cannot run away
from your grief.

1203
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,951
It trails you.

1204
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,705
Like a violent shadow.

1205
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:05,843

1206
1205
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,397
You, sir, you seem
like the kind of man

1207
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,107
who wants to keep up
with the times.

1208
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,817
The New York Times.

1209
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,055
Chateau Guiraud.
Hurry up.

1210
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,223
Yes, sir, yes.

1211
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,225
Upon arriving
in New York,

1212
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,894
Louis was immediately struck
by a palpable difference

1213
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:59,647
in the material content
of the atmosphere.

1214
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,233
It was clear
that this was a city

1215
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,860
with an enormous surfeit
of electrical energy.

1216
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,612
Get those drinks
to table nine now.

1217
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:07,697
Yes, sir.

1218
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,450
Every cat fancier knows
puss loves nothing more

1219
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,411
than to sit
on a piece of brown paper.

1220
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:16,497
Cats are aware of the dangers
of electrical rheumatism,

1221
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:18,916
and of course if you ever need
to punish a cat,

1222
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,627
you could just crumple the paper
to make the sound of thunder.

1223
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:24,255
-Do cats get rheumatism?
-Yes, of course, Miss Simmonds.

1224
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:28,759
Mr Wain, we have been showing
your cat pictures to our staff.

1225
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:31,220
They’ve been laughing.
They’ve been smiling.

1226
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,222
Tell him, Alicia.
Tell him I’m not lying.

1227
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:36,225
One of our typists, she took
some your pictures to her kids

1228
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:38,561
and she said that
they were running about

1229
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,188
on their hands and knees,
pretending to be cats.

1230
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:43,941
Pretending to be cats!
How cute!

1231
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:47,028
And asking to have cats
for their birthday.

1232
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:49,488
We’re gonna get you out there.
You’re a personality.

1233
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:53,618
Wouldn’t you say, Alicia, honey?
You’re Mr Cat.

1234
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,411
- You’re Cat Man.
- Cat Man.

1235
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,830
-He’s Cat Man.
-Cat Man.

1236
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,291
I think that has
a certain ring to it.

1237
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,128
But I like Louis Wain.

1238
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,340
I think that has
a certain ring to it too.

1239
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:12,094
Can I ask you a question,
Mr Wain?

1240
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,597
Why cats?

1241
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,533
Just remember,

1242
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,452
however hard things get,

1243
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:39,163
however much you feel
like you’re struggling...

1244
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,625
the world is full of beauty.

1245
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,462
And it’s up to you
to capture it, Louis.

1246
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,632
To look.

1247
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,635
And to share it
with as many people as you can.

1248
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,192
You all right, Mr Wain?

1249
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,196
Her whispers come
in the leafy tickle of the wind,

1250
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:16,409
or the wet crackle
of the electric rain.

1251
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,661
And at night, I turn the dial
of the wireless,

1252
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,330
hoping to catch clues
in the atmospheric electricity

1253
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:23,165
that comes from the afterlife.

1254
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,127
How to continue
with this crusade?

1255
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:29,171
For it was Emily
who first taught me

1256
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:31,048
the true nature of cats.

1257
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,801
The true value of cats.

1258
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,469
It is only
through understanding cats,

1259
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,304
how they are misunderstood
and mistreated,

1260
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,473
for no other reason
than simple blind prejudice,

1261
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:42,309
that I came to understand
human beings.

1262
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,856
How we are all corrupted
by a foul form of electricity.

1263
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,899
And it is only
through the work

1264
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,026
of those who have
the transformative gift

1265
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,654
that we can defeat it.

1266
01:23:53,738 --> 01:23:57,324
Without change, we are
a fallen species with no future,

1267
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,745
an animal whose only instinct
is to destroy!

1268
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:03,622
Dear Louis.

1269
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:07,710
After a long and valiant
struggle with the influenza,

1270
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:11,005
our mother passed away
at 11:36 this morning.

1271
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:17,219
Even in her dying weeks,
she lived at her own rhythm,

1272
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,764
and regaled us
with stories about our father

1273
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:22,308
and their time together
as young lovers in London.

1274
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:27,271
She spoke of how dearly
she had missed you

1275
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,815
but understood
that you had gone on your trip

1276
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,485
for the good of the family.

1277
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,404
I hadn’t shared with her
the truth about our finances.

1278
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,326
But, Louis,
I’m writing to you now

1279
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,703
because I want you
to come home.

1280
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,290
I know we’ve had
our differences,

1281
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,000
but we’re getting old.

1282
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:53,547
And you’ve been too far away
for too long.

1283
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:55,299
Meow. Ha, ha, ha.

1284
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,718
Your sister, Caroline.

1285
01:24:57,802 --> 01:24:59,303
It’s funny. It’s funny.

1286
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:28,082
Hello?

1287
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,626
Let me out!

1288
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,878
It’s not safe!

1289
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:51,939
Help! We’re... We’re sinking!
We’re sinking!

1290
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,149
Help me, please!

1291
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:59,238
Please, help me!
Help me! Help me!

1292
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,448
Please! Please!

1293
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,617
Mummy! Daddy!

1294
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:07,997
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1295
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,082
Help me!

1296
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,596
Just remember...

1297
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,112
Just remember...

1298
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,740
Mummy!

1299
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,659
Daddy!

1300
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:52,499
Help me! Please!

1301
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:57,713
I’m drowning!

1302
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:13,729

1303
1302
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,260
You would be excused for hoping

1304
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:49,223
that this is where Mr Wain’s
fortunes would change.

1305
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:53,268
But, alas, a few years
after the death of his mother,

1306
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:57,189
poor Marie was also taken
by the dreaded influenza.

1307
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,694
While the creaking heart
of his friend and mentor,

1308
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:03,904
the generous
Sir William Ingram,

1309
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:06,448
finally gave in to his gout.

1310
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,535
Louis had continued
to display

1311
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,829
a woeful lack
of financial acumen,

1312
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:13,872
and the family sank
ever deeper

1313
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,916
in the quicksand
of their debts.

1314
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:23,257
And then,
when attempting one day

1315
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,300
to dismount
from a moving omnibus,

1316
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:28,637
he fell head first
into a profound coma

1317
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:32,307
and saw a vision
of the year 1999.

1318
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:50,534
To everyone’s surprise,
his lucky futurist cats

1319
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,369
were a great success

1320
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,581
and orders were made
all across Europe.

1321
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,166
But, at the same time,

1322
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,460
negative electricity
around the globe

1323
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:01,587
had risen to a critical level

1324
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,506
and military tensions
blistered into a state of war.

1325
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,763
He had worked tirelessly
for several months,

1326
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:13,265
but almost all of his cargo
was destroyed

1327
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,143
by a German U-boat
in the North Sea.

1328
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,145
A number
of British cargo ships

1329
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,147
have been sunk
by German submarines,

1330
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,182
leaving thousands of pounds

1331
01:29:21,252 --> 01:29:22,267
- THE DAILY MIRROR
- worth of merchandise

1332
01:29:22,338 --> 01:29:24,818
to rest at the bottom
of the North Sea.

1333
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:26,945
Initial reports imply
that these vessels

1334
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,864
were caught in a crossfire...

1335
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:02,689
Louis?

1336
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,904
Caroline would like to see you.

1337
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:19,373
Louis, sit down.

1338
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:40,811
I want you to know that...

1339
01:30:49,153 --> 01:30:51,738
I want you to know
that I’m very proud of you.

1340
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,968
Shh. Shh.

1341
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:19,349
Enough!
Louis, enough!

1342
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,604
Louis!

1343
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,402
Stop it, Louis, please!
Calm down!

1344
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,614
Louis! Louis!
Louis! Stop it!

1345
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:40,037
Cats have been
worshipped as mystical gods

1346
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,375
and maligned as the evil allies
of witchery and sin.

1347
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:51,048
But I think you’re
the first person ever to see

1348
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,717
that they are
in fact ridiculous.

1349
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:58,722
They’re silly and cuddly.

1350
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,433
And lonely.

1351
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,728
Frightened and brave.

1352
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,731
Like us.

1353
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,200
What’s going on in that
funny little head of yours?

1354
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,355
Much better.

1355
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,984
You make the world beautiful.

1356
01:33:35,569 --> 01:33:38,071
And warm. And kind.

1357
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:42,909
I just wanted to say thank you
for that before it’s too late.

1358
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,415
I don’t make
the world beautiful, Louis.

1359
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,836
The world is beautiful.

1360
01:33:55,589 --> 01:33:57,716
And you’ve helped me
to see that too.

1361
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:09,061
I’ll take you to
what we call the paupers’ ward.

1362
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:13,065
For, um... Well,
for obvious reasons.

1363
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:16,068
I assure you, the patients
are taken care of

1364
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,153
in a perfectly
professional manner.

1365
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:19,738

1366
1365
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:23,033
I hope you will report
favourably

1367
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:25,327
back to the committee
you volunteer for?

1368
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,538
I’m here to assess the welfare
of your patients, Dr Cooke,

1369
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:30,290
and the running
of your hospital.

1370
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:32,834
Not just on behalf
of my fellow committee members

1371
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:34,836
but on behalf
of the government.

1372
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,672
So I shall report back

1373
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:41,009
-according to what I find.
-Indeed.

1374
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:44,054
What is the average length
of stay here at Springfield?

1375
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:48,183
Have you had much success
with turning patients out?

1376
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,310
We have had some successes.

1377
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,687
But it depends partly
on the patient’s willingness

1378
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,398
to cooperate.

1379
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:56,900
And as you can imagine,
Mr Rider,

1380
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,778
that varies widely
from person to person.

1381
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:03,156
Louis Wain.

1382
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,911
Yes. This is Mr Louis Wain.

1383
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:12,582
You might remember his rather
charming cat pictures

1384
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,502
from all those years ago.

1385
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:19,923
How are you, Mr Wain?

1386
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,972
It’s, uh... It’s me.

1387
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:32,602
Dan Rider. We met on the train
back from Andover.

1388
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:36,982
I had my...
my sister’s Pomeranian with me.

1389
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:39,443
Cleopatra.

1390
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,321
Cleopatra?

1391
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:44,489
Yes.

1392
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:55,167
I’d no idea you were
a patient here, Mr Wain.

1393
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,586
He is, I’m afraid,
quite insane.

1394
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,464
Uh, but we do our best
to look after him.

1395
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:05,051
Very sad, isn’t it, Mr Rider?

1396
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:07,137
He seems almost entirely

1397
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,222
to have lost a handle
on his craft.

1398
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,190
Do you like it here, Mr Wain?

1399
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,361
There are no cats.

1400
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,409
I cannot see... outside.

1401
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:35,290
Oh. That must be
rather difficult

1402
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,168
for someone like you,
Mr Wain,

1403
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:41,463
who’s spent his entire life
examining the world,

1404
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:45,300
suddenly not to see it.

1405
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,911
I have failed.

1406
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,499
I’ve...

1407
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:24,589
I have failed her, Mr Rider.

1408
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:28,343
I don’t think you have failed,
Mr Wain...

1409
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,054
from what you have been saying.

1410
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:38,979
Why do you think
Emily wanted you

1411
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,356
to keep painting pictures,
Mr Wain?

1412
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,152
To help people.

1413
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:50,240
To show them.

1414
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:52,993
Perhaps.

1415
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:55,287
And there’s no doubt
that you’ve done that.

1416
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,374
But I have a rather
different theory.

1417
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:08,341
I think she wanted you
to keep painting

1418
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:12,846
so you would not be alone.

1419
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:27,569
When you paint, Mr Wain,
you connect with other people

1420
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:30,322
and you give them
a piece of yourself,

1421
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:35,702
but... they are also
connecting with you.

1422
01:38:38,288 --> 01:38:42,250
And that electricity
that you describe...

1423
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,714
that you felt
in the presence of Emily,

1424
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:51,509
I’d call that love, Mr Wain.

1425
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,850
And that is still here.

1426
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:18,286
With the help
of the Wain sisters,

1427
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:21,081
the plucky Mr Rider
decided to start a fund

1428
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,791
in support of Louis

1429
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,834
and to raise enough money
to move him

1430
01:39:24,918 --> 01:39:27,504
to a much more comfortable
hospital in the countryside,

1431
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:29,339
where they allowed
their patients

1432
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:31,132
to keep cats for comfort.

1433
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,302
They were joined
by Wain enthusiasts

1434
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:35,845
up and down the country

1435
01:39:35,929 --> 01:39:37,639
and even received the help

1436
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,724
of some more influential fans,

1437
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:42,519
like the renowned
author HG Wells,

1438
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,437
who made a national plea

1439
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,856
on behalf
of the Louis Wain fund.

1440
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:51,111
The artist Louis Wain
made the cat his own.

1441
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:54,030
He invented a cat style.

1442
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:56,074
A cat society.

1443
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:59,452
A whole cat world.

1444
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:03,123
Cats that do not look and live
like Louis Wain cats

1445
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:05,542
are ashamed of themselves.

1446
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,168
But now,

1447
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:12,132
as he approaches
the end of his own life,

1448
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:16,052
Mr Wain and his sisters
desperately require

1449
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:18,638
the most generous help
of cat lovers

1450
01:40:18,722 --> 01:40:21,683
and right-thinking
people everywhere.

1451
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,187
CONTRIBUTE TO THE
LOUIS WAIN FUND

1452
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:29,107
For Louis Wain,

1453
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,735
electricity was not just
something that we use

1454
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:35,405
to make toast or to power
a bulb in the bathroom.

1455
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:37,323
It was something bigger,

1456
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,826
something so extraordinary
and strange

1457
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:43,329
that the human mind was barely
able even to comprehend it.

1458
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:48,293
A mysterious elemental force
that on occasion,

1459
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:51,379
he could feel shimmering
in the ether,

1460
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:54,174
and the key to all
of life’s most profound

1461
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:56,259
and alarming secrets.

1462
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:12,372
Look.

1469
01:44:13,305 --> 01:45:13,637
