3
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,097
Gentlemen!
Lock and load!

4
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,842
Connie Kaminski, you're under arrest.
Show me your hands. Show 'em!

5
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:01,110
<i>Yep, that's me.
Connie Kaminski.</i>

6
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,579
<i>And holy shit, that was scary.</i>

7
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,748
<i>I mean, I almost wet the bed.
I don't know why they didn't just knock.</i>

8
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,819
<i>I mean, this is a story about coupons.
Little old coupons. They j...</i>

9
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:13,189
<i>You know what? I should probably
start from the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,559
<i>Hiya. Me again.</i>

11
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,229
<i>Okay, yeah. This is
the perfect place to start.</i>

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,400
<i>Here's a fun fact:</i>

13
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,537
<i>I'm a three-time gold-medal-winning
Olympic racewalker.</i>

14
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:30,406
<i>And you know what that's worth
out in the real world?</i>

15
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,876
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

16
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:35,745
<i>Did you know most Olympic
athletes aren't famous?</i>

17
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,881
<i>And they sure as heck
aren't rich.</i>

18
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>Go ahead, look it up.
I mean, not now, but, you know, later.</i>

19
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:45,555
<i>And, yeah, I may have retired,
but I don't quit.</i>

20
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,825
<i>I figure no matter what you
do, give it all you got.</i>

21
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,095
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola,</i> Mrs. Flores.

22
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,163
Do you have my coupons?

23
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:00,837
Oh. Super-duper.

24
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,942
Hey.

25
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,386
You know what,

26
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:19,289
you can never have
too much toilet paper, right?

27
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,291
Okay, enjoy.

28
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,665
You might wanna pack a jacket.
The weather showed rain in Cleveland.

29
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,436
Oh, um, hey, did I just see you giving
the paper lady a bunch of stuff for free?

30
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,538
Rick, she's barely getting by.

31
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,941
Yeah, but at least
she has a job.

32
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,577
And you are spending money
that we don't have.

33
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,780
I am not spending money.
I am saving us money.

34
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,648
- <i>This is my husband Rick.</i>
- You literally are.

35
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,984
<i>He works for the IRS.</i>

36
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,420
<i>And his job is to look
for people's mistakes.</i>

37
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,588
I'll get it.

38
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,389
What's this? Is this new?

39
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,959
There's, like,
50 jugs of Tide.

40
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,226
It's couponing 101.

41
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:02,231
When Tide hits a six-month stock-up
price, you stock up, okay?

42
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:06,336
That's 400 dollars' worth of
detergent that I got for $57.

43
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,338
My mom used coupons...

44
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,607
<i>We didn't always
argue about money.</i>

45
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,343
<i>It was only after we tried
to start a family.</i>

46
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,679
<i>And we tried.
And we tried.</i>

47
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,615
<i>And we tried.</i>

48
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,818
<i>And then, it finally happened.</i>

49
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,288
<i>We were going to have a girl.</i>

50
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,858
<i>But I just couldn't get
to the finish line.</i>

51
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:35,732
<i>After that, for a while we
didn't argue about anything.</i>

52
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,968
<i>Then Rick discovered
he could travel more for work.</i>

53
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,904
<i>Now he's gone three weeks
out of every month.</i>

54
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,406
<i>But that's okay.</i>

55
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>'Cause if that didn't happen,</i>

56
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,443
<i>I might not have met
my best friend, JoJo.</i>

57
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,381
Yo, yo, yo!
It's time to save with JoJo.

58
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,884
Here is the thing
I love about coupons.

59
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,354
I control my time,
I control my income,

60
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,056
I control my life.

61
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,659
So, JoJo's deal of the week
is right here...

62
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,895
You sure as shit doing a good
job controlling your income.

63
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,731
- Mom.
- 'Cause you ain't got no money.

64
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,900
Stop. Mama, no. Stop it!

65
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,936
You know I'm just... I'm over
here busy trying to build my brand

66
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,972
as a successful entrepreneur.

67
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,474
I'm my own CEO.

68
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,312
CEO! What the F are you talking about?

69
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,547
You nothing but a saleswoman
that don't make no sales.

70
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,483
Yeah, Mama, that's a business.
Sometimes you don't make sale...

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,885
You ever heard of Steve Jobs?

72
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,787
What do you know
about a job?

73
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,489
Okay, Mama. You be like that.
I'm going next door.

74
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,892
Why you gotta spend
so much time with that girl?

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,561
You and her carting around
all them food stamps.

76
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,697
They're not food stamps.
They're coupons.

77
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,598
White people use them.
Why can't we?

78
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, so if white people
were jumping off a bridge...

79
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,502
Oh, my gosh. Again.

80
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,071
No, if white people
were jumping off a bridge,

81
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,506
- I would not jump off a bridge.
- Why you got such a damn attitude?

82
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,076
You're always talking about white people!
Like, no, of course not!

83
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,911
Get on my nerves.

84
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,085
Oh, hallelujah, praise the Lord.
Look who's here.

85
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:04,754
- The savior of savings.
- What up, Rick Dick?

86
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,689
Oh, hey,
I had a question for you.

87
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,358
Um, has anybody
ever been happy to see you?

88
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,128
Like, have you ever walked into
a room and someone's gone like,

89
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,465
"Hey, everybody, look!
My cool IRS auditor just walked in"?

90
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,100
- Yeah, they don't have to be happy.
- Oh, okay.

91
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,068
I'm respected. I'm valued.

92
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,536
Mmm.

93
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,105
- I'm leaving.
- There you go.

94
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,073
Those are the two words
we love to hear you say.

95
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,975
All right, now. Bye, Rick.

96
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,010
- Hey, Rick, I had one more question.
- Don't slam...

97
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,147
- Hey, girl.
- Hiya, JoJo.

98
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:35,418
All right,
I have got some stuff for you.

99
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,886
- Look at all these.
- Oh, my gosh.

100
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,821
- Big day.
- Big day.

101
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,896
- Buy one, get one.
- BOGO!

102
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,998
Rick should be happy
I taught you how to stockpile.

103
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,801
Yeah, he doesn't get any of this.

104
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:55,471
Oh, lookee. I only need
one more Colgate proof of purchase

105
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,740
- to get a free AT&T gift card.
- You see that?

106
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,544
You think Rick knows how to pay
a phone bill with toothpaste? No.

107
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,613
You're winning.

108
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,616
Hey, did you know that winning actually
changes the way your brain works?

109
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,619
Like, every time you win,
you get a teensy bit smarter.

110
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,487
They call it
the winner effect.

111
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:15,124
You know, basically, the more you
win, the more you will win.

112
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,759
Winning becomes habit.

113
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,896
I really need a win.

114
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:32,542
Yes!

115
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,097
You doing okay today, Greg?

116
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,736
You know,
I read that if you're lucky,

117
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,207
you only get about 30,000 days
on planet Earth.

118
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,875
- Right.
- That's not a lot.

119
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,878
Maybe you should try
to make every day count.

120
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,047
Total is $138.55.

121
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:13,983
Is it?

122
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,652
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,690
It's like
a thousand coupons, man.

124
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,916
Well, good for you, lady.
You saved $122.10.

125
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,986
It is good for me, Greg.
It is good for me.

126
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,855
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

127
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:55,258
- All right.
- Sorry about the wait.

128
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,526
Don't be.
That was impressive.

129
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,228
Change.

130
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:02,765
Your trophy.

131
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,830
<i>"Dear General Mills,</i>

132
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,799
<i>I recently purchased
a box of Wheaties cereal</i>

133
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,335
<i>from my local A&G Family Mart
here in Phoenix.</i>

134
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:43,706
<i>When I opened it, I discovered,
to my chagrin, that the cereal was stale.</i>

135
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,143
<i>As a former Olympic athlete,
I was very disappointed.</i>

136
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,578
<i>'Breakfast of champions'?</i>

137
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,949
<i>With cereal this stale,
it's more like 'breakfast of chump-ions.'"</i>

138
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,252
No shade, but, um, we both know
the before we were working with.

139
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,321
But why don't you
take a little look

140
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,924
- at the after!
- Oh, my God!

141
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,627
- Wow.
- Yes, girl! Look at you!

142
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:08,297
Who is that?
Is that Halle Berry from 2002?

143
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,067
So what I've used here

144
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,003
is the Back-2-Black
executive package.

145
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,239
I try to tell people, like, that
white-girl makeup does not work for us.

146
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,374
You know what I mean? Okay.

147
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,176
- Mm-hmm.
- You need your own stuff.

148
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,346
So, do we have a sale?

149
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:24,947
Do you take credit cards?

150
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,116
Unfortunately,
I can only accept cash.

151
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,685
I have a history
with identity theft.

152
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,988
- What?
- No. Girl. No, no, no.

153
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:34,757
No, I did not steal
anybody's identity. No way.

154
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,859
I had my identity stolen.

155
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,894
My credit's trash.
I can't even walk into a bank.

156
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,396
- Mmm.
- It's a whole thing. You don't even need

157
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,398
to worry
about that right now, so...

158
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,034
I need to think about it.

159
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,763
Fun trip?

160
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,165
Fun? What's fun about work?

161
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:20,703
Hey, what do you say we go out for
a nice dinner tonight? Maybe sushi?

162
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,171
Sushi's expensive.

163
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,173
Didn't you say you had
some kinda coupon thing

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,341
from TGI Fridays?

165
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,178
Mm-hmm.

166
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,148

169
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,334
- Earl!
- Hey there, JoJo.

170
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,071
You better not have a bunch
of bills in there for me.

171
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,972
Ugh. Oof.

172
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,075
- You got this?
- Oh.

173
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,778
- I don't know nothing about this.
- Okay. Damn.

174
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,381
- Oh, I loved your new YouTube video, JoJo.
- Oh, yeah?

175
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,451
Yeah. You know, I keep asking
myself, "How does she do it?"

176
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:09,985
It's like
you can read my mind.

177
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,887
That's 'cause I can.
Come here.

178
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,023
I'm gonna tell you what you're thinking.
Look at me.

179
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,432
Oh. Uh...

180
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,501
- Oh, boy.
- I'm just playing with you, Earl.

181
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,770
- I can't tell what you're thinking.
- I should be going.

182
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:28,938
- Okay.
- Yeah.

183
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,309
Bye!

184
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,487
I'm leaving. I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

185
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:45,754
Mm-hmm.

186
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,824
You had a choice.

187
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:53,195
We could've been eating out at
expensive and fancy places all the time.

188
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:58,067
Instead, you chose four
rounds of IVF treatments.

189
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,137
You knew I wanted to quit
after one, but...

190
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,508
You're trying to replace
what you lost with coupons.

191
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:08,878
Are you kidding me right now?
We lost a baby.

192
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,814
Get out of this room.

193
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,182
And get a job.

194
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,126
Mail's here.

195
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,598
<i>Oh, my...</i>

196
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,636
See that, Greg?

197
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,972
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

198
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,907
Why do you always say that?

199
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,376
'Cause it's the little things
that matter.

200
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:16,512
Mmm. Little things.

201
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,381
Like wasting your time writing
a stupid complaint letter?

202
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,251
- How did you know that?
- You're not special.

203
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,988
They always send you coupons for free
shit when you bitch to the manufacturer.

you nailed it."</i>

211
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:34,189
- Okay, don't... don't peek. Okay.
- Okay.

212
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,292
Okay, open.

213
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,696
What? No, Connie!

214
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:41,530
You told me
you wrote that letter

215
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,499
- 'cause your cereal was stale.
- Yeah.

216
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,701
So, what, the whole fucking
house has gone stale?

217
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,370
- Not exactly...
- Oh, shit!

218
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,039
- You got Cottonelle Ultra?
- Yeah.

219
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,408
- You got 36 family rolls for free?
- Yeah.

220
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,476
That coupon's worth,
like, 40 bucks.

221
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:57,012
Well, you can get one too.
Just write a letter to Cottonelle.

222
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,614
And say what?
"Dear Cottonelle,

223
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:01,216
your supersoft toilet paper
scratched up my ass"?

224
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:02,685
Please,
they're not gonna believe me!

225
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,220
Or, better yet,
just pay me for the coupon.

226
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,323
Okay.

227
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,192
Actually, how much would you pay
me for this Cottonelle coupon?

228
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,695
Would you pay maybe half
of what it's worth?

229
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,364
Twenty bucks? Yeah, why not?

230
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,434
So you'd give me 20 bucks for
this coupon that I got for free?

231
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,170
That's quite a profit,
don't you think?

232
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,273
Imagine if we got more of these,
and we sold them to people for half.

233
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,675
That would...
That'd be a real business.

234
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,279
How is that a real business?

235
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,049
Even if you wanted to,
how would you ever get enough to sell?

236
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:37,086
I think I know where
we can get 'em in bulk.

237
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:41,023

00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,741
Okay, Chihuahua.
What's your point?

244
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,542
That's where
all the coupons are.

245
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,144
So what,
you want to rob the place?

246
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,579
- No.
- Oh.

247
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:08,150
No, no. Not rob. Just remove
or just separate some.

248
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,619
No. No. Uh-uh.
Are you crazy?

249
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,755
JoJo, I need you.

250
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,090
There's no one better
at selling people stuff.

251
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:16,358
Then how come I'm so broke?

252
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:19,461
Yeah. Exactly. It's not fair.

253
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,598
Like, all you wanted
was a successful business.

254
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:26,735
But because someone ruined your
credit, you can never fix that?

255
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,537
And all I wanted was a baby,

256
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,540
and I... now I gotta pay
for that the rest of my life?

257
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,809
No one is gonna help us.

258
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,744
You know who gets rewarded?

259
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,514
People who don't follow
the rules.

260
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,716
It's time we start
bending 'em a little.

261
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,688
I want you to know you don't
have to keep selling me on it,

262
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,590
- 'cause I'm in.
- I'm just saying,

263
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,126
you know, you lodge one complaint,
they send you a free coupon.

264
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:53,395
- They're handing them out like hot cakes.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:55,731
And... And we're just
taking a few extra.

266
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,533
Mmm.
Well, we're stealing them.

267
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,168
And all we're doing is
making them more accessible.

268
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,669
- By smuggling them.
- That...

269
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:03,405
Honestly, these companies
make bazillions of dollars,

270
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,542
so it's not like they're gonna
miss a couple of coupons.

271
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:12,281
I'm just telling you that it is stealing,
smuggling and selling illegally.

272
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,550
It sounds bad
when you say it like that.

273
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,085
- It is bad, girl.
- Well, don't say it like that.

274
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,487
It doesn't have to sound bad.

275
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,556
I think it's gonna be good.

276
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,124
No, it's gonna be good.

277
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,093
It's gonna be good.
I can feel it.

278
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,733
Hey, congratulations, Sunil.

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,302
Congrats on being
a grandfather.

280
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,471
- Thank you.

281
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,607
Not everybody's got a family.

Yeah, I see that.

Alice will help you on one.

291
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,202
Yeah. No. This is,
uh, this is not a real coupon.

292
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,837
I-I don't understand.

293
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,305
It's a fake, ma'am.

294
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,608
How is it fake?
Look, uh, who are you?

295
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,910
I am, uh, Ken Miller.

296
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,645
I'm the loss prevention
officer

297

for all the A&G Family Marts
across the Southwest.

298
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,217
You're lucky I was here today
to spot this little guy.

299
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,354
Take a look here.
See that expiration date?

300
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,890
Does that look familiar
to you? November 31st?

301
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:31,426
It shouldn't. There's only 30
days in the month of November.

302
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,629
So whoever tried to replicate
this little guy,

303
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,497
clearly, they didn't look
at a calendar.

304
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,932
Probably out of China.

305
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,501
You know, they screw up the dates
all the time. There's always a flaw.

306
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,937
You know, if you know what to look
for, it's easy to spot.

307
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,373
Well, can you just make
an exception?

308
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,842
I mean, we could just honor
it, Ken, this one time.

309
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,711
She's been coming here
for, like, 150 years.

310
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,748
Yeah, I don't care if she's
Dame Judi Dench, Dave.

311
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,883
You leave the food out,
the critters will get it.

312
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,885
This is how this starts.
I'm just saying.

313
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,288
Sorry to compare you to rodents, ma'am.
I didn't mean that.

314
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:02,524
I just mean to say that rules are rules.
But if it helps, I...

315
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,427
If it helps?
I have hemorrhoids.

316
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,430
You know what helps, honey?
Preparation H.

317
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,666
Well, we're happy to sell
it to ya at full price.

318
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,401
Well,
then why don't you buy it?

319
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,369
Because you're
a giant asshole!

320
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,408
That's a good one, ma'am.

321
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:22,578
But as Dave will attest,
I've been told that before.

322
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,915
You should put that in the burn pile.
See you, Dave. I'll be back next month.

323
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:34,256
Hey, sorry. Um, would you mind if we
switched seats, just for this last part?

324
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,925
She really likes to watch
out the window as we land.

325
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,628
- And it helps calm her down.
- Mmm. Yeah.

326
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,930
No, even if
I wanted to switch,

327
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:46,768
I think it's more important that your
daughter learn a valuable lesson.

328
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:50,906
That's not how the world works, you know.
You don't always get your way.

329
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,910
- Are you for real, dude?
- Okay.

330
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:37,052
Fuck!

331
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,455
Fuck.

332
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,502
So, what, we're just gonna
eeny, meeny, miny, mo,

333
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:57,406
pick some random dude and be
like, "Could you steal for us?"

334
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,942
Yeah.
We need someone on the inside.

335
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,045
We need an inside man.

336
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:06,415
Ooh, what about that guy? He
looks like that badass dude from <i>Machete.</i>

337
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,917
- Too sketchy.
- We want sketchy.

338
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,920
We want him to help us,
not chop us up into tiny pieces.

339
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:14,790
What about this Cesar
Millan-looking motherfucker?

340
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:16,525
Too square.

341
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,863
We need that guy.

342
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,332
That guy?
Why that guy?

343
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,601
'Cause he's already
bending the rules.

344
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,641
Look at that. We got two
for the price of one.

345
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,343
- BOGO.
- BOGO.

346
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,879
Are you interested in a way
to make some more money?

347
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:40,415
No, that sounds creepy.
Just be like, "Oh, hey, we have a"...

348
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,983
- We have a business opportunity for you.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
- Okay. That's better.
- That's it, that's it.

350
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,759
- Okay. Here goes nothing.
- All right.

351
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,399
Why is she running?

352
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,134
- Shit! Shit, shit.
- Oh, my God. Wait!

353
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,371
We have money. Money.
Dinero. Dinero. We have it!

354
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,043
No! Dinero. We have dinero for you.
We have it.

355
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,911
For you, yeah.

356
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:11,880
- For me? Oh.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

357
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,389
What is she doing?

358
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,391
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- Oh, no, no, no!

359
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,927
Stop! What...

360
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,429
Alejandro!

361
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,397
These women
are trying to help us.

362
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,668
- Uh.
- It's okay. It's okay.

363
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,403
Oh!

364
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,542
Okay, here we go.

365
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,478
- Hi.
- Mmm.

366
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:47,816
Okay, here we go.
You good? Okay, here we go.

367
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:54,890
You never trail someone
in Mexico. Ever.

368
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,158
You <i>estúpida.</i>

369
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,832
My... My wife is angry.
But she's right.

370
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:05,700
She is angry.

371
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,436
And also... pregnant?

372
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:11,873
- It is very early. But yes.
- Oh, wow.

373
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,942
Minimum wage
is only two dollars an hour.

374
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,077
Do you really have a way
for us to make some money?

375
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,915
Wait, your wage is two dollars an hour?

376
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,150
That's a crime.
You gotta talk to somebody about that.

377
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,052
I should talk to my boss
and ask for a raise?

378
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,587
- Yes.
- Yes.

379
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,889
Yes, you should definitely
talk to your boss.

380
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,659
Are you crazy?
This company's American.

381
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,728
They only moved here so they
could take advantage of us.

382
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,164
That's all the more reason
you should hear us out.

383
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,504
These coupons. They all come
from your factory, yes?

384
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,806
<i>Sí, sí,</i>
we make all kinds of coupons.

385
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,476
We don't need all kinds.
Just the ones for free stuff.

386
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:49,778
Can you get more of these?

387
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,814
Are you asking me to steal?

388
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:59,688
Again, everyone is making it sound so
bad, but it's...

389
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:01,223
- Technically, yes.
- Yeah.

390
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:03,258
- Uh.
- Okay, okay.

391
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,126
It's like Robin Hood, okay?

392
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,996
You are gonna take these
coupons from this company

393
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,998
that pays you chump change,

394
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,601
and then we're gonna get them to
families who really need them.

395
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,670
She's right. Do you have any idea
how expensive diapers are?

396
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,240
And, obviously,
you would be sharing in the profits.

397
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:20,609
- Yeah.
- <i>La puta's</i> right.

398
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:25,013
But we don't need your Robin Hood.
We have Jesús Malverde.

399
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,816
He took from the rich
and gave to the poor families.

400
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,151
We will follow
in his footsteps.

401
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,722
Okay, yeah. Go with him. I mean,
this dude is dope as hell. I love it.

402
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:34,990
Rosa, no.

403
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,039
A wise man once said,

404
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:55,777
"Family is not an important thing.
It is everything."

405
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,013
Was that Jesús Malverde
as well?

406
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,683
It is the words
of Michael J. Fox.

407
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,084
Michael J. Fox?

408
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,054
The damn actor?

409
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,790
- Like, Marty McFly?
- Doesn't matter who said it, JoJo.

410
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:09,858
He's right.

411
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,294
Michael J. Fox is right.

412
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:22,837
Okay.

413
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,339
- Yes.
- Yes?

414
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,974
- I will do it.
- You will?

415
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,077
For real?
Like for... Oh. Oh, wow.

416
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:31,947
I mean, 'cause it took me a while
to get on board, and I know her.

417
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,082
You are ready, huh?

418
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,017
And here is how we will do it.

419
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,721
<i>The factory is split in two.
Printing and redemption.</i>

420
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,792
<i>And the right hand does not
know what the left hand does.</i>

421
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,728
<i>Rosa works on
the coupon redemption side.</i>

422
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,999
<i>All day counting used coupons,
very tedious.</i>

423
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,268
<i>And I work on the print side.</i>

424
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:57,005
<i>It is man's work.
Heavy lifting, dangerous.</i>

425
00:25:57,072 --> 00:26:00,675
- Just get to the point.
- Don't boss me.

426
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,244
Anyway.

427
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,015
<i>With each coupon we print,
there is always extra.</i>

428
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:10,018
<i>Even with the free coupons.</i>

429
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:14,055
<i>It is normal for us to destroy
these extra coupons.</i>

430
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,058
But no more.

431
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,728
Oh, Alejandro,
you very sexy right now.

432
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:23,398
Instead,
I will send them to you.

433
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,368
<i>Our trucks ship coupons
all across the US.</i>

434
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,270
<i>And as for the border,
this is no problem.</i>

435
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,774
<i>They stop drugs because
there is a war on drugs.</i>

436
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,343
<i>But who cares about coupons?</i>

437
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,017
<i>Gracias.</i>

438
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,425
Okay, Mama,
just please be quiet, okay?

439
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:53,294
I ain't saying a word.

440
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,931
Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.

441
00:26:56,998 --> 00:27:00,068
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

442
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,770
It's you.

443
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,005
I have to start again now!

444
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,741
<i>I'm getting my Cheetos fix</i>

445
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:10,879
thanks to my flamin' hot site
for coupons,

446
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:13,281
savvysupersaver.com.

447
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,951
<i>You get a bunch of coupons.
All of them are gonna be half off, okay?</i>

448
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:20,955
So, go there, get your coupons,
make your savings, okay?

449
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,866
$47.99.

450
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,135
Whoa, look at that. Free!

451
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:42,143
Okay.

452
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:51,019
- Hey, I got it.
- Thank you, Earl.

453
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,388
Savvy Super Saver, huh?

454
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:57,792
<i>Now, did I say save,
or did I say save?</i>

455
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:00,161
<i>You get a free coupon!
You get a free coupon!</i>

456
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,463
<i>You get a free coupon!</i>

457
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,979
Keep an eye on that for me,
okay?

458
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:37,031
Okay.

459
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:41,002
<i>You have 74 new
voice messages. First voice message.</i>

460
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,837
<i>I'm calling from General Mills</i>

461
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:46,107
<i>about a fraudulent, um, uh,
coupon for Cocoa Puffs.</i>

462
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,442
<i>Coupon for Cocoa Puffs.</i>

463
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,511
<i>That sounds funny, I guess.
Anyway...</i>

464
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,212
<i>There's
been a run on Schick razors.</i>

465
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,781
<i>In the past month,
this one counterfeit coupon</i>

466
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,217
<i>has cost us hundreds of
thousands of dollars.</i>

467
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,521
<i>Uh, we've
had, uh, several of your A&G stores</i>

468
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,423
<i>attempting to redeem this counterfeit
coupon for Huggies diapers.</i>

469
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,125
- There's no flaw.
- <i>If you're looking at</i>

470
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,860
<i>these redemption numbers,</i>

471
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,896
<i>this is quickly becoming
a serious issue.</i>

472
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:10,064
<i>Which is why we're
calling on all LPOs</i>

473
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,867
<i>to look into
these fraudulent Tide coupons.</i>

474
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,335
<i>This is code red.</i>

475
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,004
- <i>I've mailed you...</i>
- There's no flaw.

476
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,839
<i>...of the fraudulent coupon.
If Gerber didn't...</i>

477
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:21,843
<i>Eleven days. No sleep.
Just me and the receipts.</i>

478
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,413
<i>On a diet of coffee
and heartburn.</i>

479
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,517
<i>The key was finding discounts that
matched the coupons in question.</i>

480
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,053
<i>It was no small task.</i>

481
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,356
Aha! Yes!

482
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:37,559
<i>Then, accessing
our financial database,</i>

483
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:41,362
I was able to trace the credit
card number back to you, back here.

484
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:42,830
And here we are today.

485
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,599
But you're not a detective.

486
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,368
'Cause you sort of look
like a detective.

487
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:50,104
Detective...
Do I look like a detective?

488
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,341
Huh. I'll pocket that
compliment for a rainy day.

489
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:57,111
I, uh, no,
I work for A&G Family Mart.

490
00:29:57,178 --> 00:30:00,048
Anyways, let's cut to
the Chevy Chase here.

491
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,584
If I ask a question,
just assume I know the answer.

492
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,953
So, stick to the facts,
would you, ma'am?

493
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,121
Spill it.
Where'd you get the coupons?

494
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,123
Uh, okay.

495
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,127
Well, a friend sent me this video
of this Black woman going on and on

496
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:15,129
about all this stuff
she got for half off

497
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:18,533
with these coupons
from some website.

498
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,101
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna stop you there.

499
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:23,037
You purchased these coupons
off a website?

500
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:26,241
Do you have any idea how many
Cheerios a one-year-old goes through?

501
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,976
Well, what's the name
of this website?

502
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:32,280
Uh, Super Snappy Saver?

503
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:35,149
Super Snazzy something.

504
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:37,418
- Snazzy Super Saver.
- Uh...

505
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,921
I remember thinking,
"What a dumb name."

506
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,457
Yeah. Sp-Speedy Shopper?
Could that be it?

507
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:44,225
Speedy Shopper?
No. That's not even close.

508
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,027
Well, I'm trying
to be helpful.

509
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,595
You said you already knew the answers.

510
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,964
- I-I know a lot of 'em, but the point...
- One minute.

511
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,541
Savvy!

512
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,244
S... Are you talking to me,
ma'am?

513
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,612
Savvy Super Saver.

514
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,914
Savvy, is that one V or two?

515
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:10,018
Oh, no, I guess one would be
"savy." So it's two. Two V's.

516
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:17,058
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

517
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,662
Savvy Super Saver.

518
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,067
My hands hurt.

519
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,236
We're filling
hundreds of orders a day.

520
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,705
Don't you feel like this is
all happening way too fast?

521
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:33,374
No, fast is good. Fast is...

522
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,177
- Oh, crap.
- What?

523
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,347
Frozen? No. No.

524
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,583
Connie, I told you this
is all happening too fast!

525
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,552
I'm like,
"Whoop, whoop, whoop!"

526
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,521
Alarm bells
are just going off in my mind.

527
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:47,955
- Let me refresh it.
- So just...

528
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:49,390
Okay, close the page.
Start again.

529
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:50,658
Did we lose all that money?

530
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,660
- I don't know.
- Fuck!

531
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,962
Uh-huh.

532
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,632
Uh-huh, yep. So...

533
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:02,403
Abnormally large amounts of money
in the account. Right.

534
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,640
Okay, and... and how do we unfreeze it?

535
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,577
Uh-huh.

536
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:12,747
Oh, so we just have to prove
that it's a legitimate business.

537
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:15,983
Okay. Got it.

538
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,752
Yes.

539
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,022
All good. Okay. Okey dokey.
Thanks so much. Bye.

540
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,991
I knew this was
too good to be true.

541
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,526
Is it though?

542
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:28,496
The PayPal rep
made it seem simple enough.

543
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,199
We just need someone who's had
experience with this sort of thing.

544
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,635
Like selling stolen shit for
abnormally large amounts of money.

545
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,337
- Like that sort of thing?
- Exactly.

546
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh, okay.

547
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,776
What about that girl
who stole your identity?

548
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,345
Tempe Tina? Really?

549
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:48,182
You wanna go to the little
brat who ruined my entire life?

550
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,319
JoJo...

551
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,554
- Girl, this is unnecessary.
- I know, but we need her.

552
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:54,455
What the fuck
is this about?

553
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,290
Just to clear the air,

554
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,026
the shit I did to you as a
kid, that was a side gig, okay.

555
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,795
I dabble in the dark web.

556
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:04,565
Okay, well, just to clear the
air on my side, just so you know,

557
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:07,668
after that little stunt you
pulled, I went to the police.

558
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,470
- They didn't help me.
- That's true.

559
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:11,606
I went to social security.
They didn't believe me.

560
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,608
And I went to my bank.
And guess what?

561
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,610
Those motherfuckers
didn't trust me.

562
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:18,579
Girl, you know,
I had so much debt because of you.

563
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,481
I had to move back home
with my mama.

564
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:24,085
You know how embarrassing that shit is?
I'm a grown-ass woman.

565
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,653
I'm really sorry about that.

566
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,655
I-I really... I had no idea.

567
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,157
Yeah, well, okay.

568
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,059
- Electric car?
- What?

569
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,329
Is this an electric car?
It's just so quiet, isn't it?

570
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,198
I mean, I've never been
blindfolded before,

571
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,066
and it's true what they say.

572
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,436
All your other senses
are so heightened.

573
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:44,338
Ooh...

574
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,207
- Did we just go over train tracks?
- I felt that.

575
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,742
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

576
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,111
- They are heightened, I...
- That's so weird.

577
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,647
Are you eating Juicy Fruit?
The gum. Is that what you eatin'?

578
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,615
You smell that?
Oh, I love Juicy Fruit.

579
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:57,318
- Oh, I haven't had it in forever.
- Me either. Me either.

580
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,786
Can you guys
just shut the fuck up?

581
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,154
Okay, rude.

582
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,123
My specialty
is cybersecurity.

583
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,559
You guys have any idea
what that means?

584
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,860
- No. Not a clue.
- No.

585
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,463
Okay. Governments
and global corporations

586
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,332
deal with security attacks
every single day.

587
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,302
My job is to identify 'em,
prevent 'em,

588
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:18,139
or, if they pay me enough,
to create 'em.

589
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,342
Humblebrag.

590
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,649
How the fuck did you
make this kind of coin from coupons?

591
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:29,750
Take 'em off.

592
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,320
Whew.

593
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,222
You can't have this much money
flowing in a single account.

594
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,657
I can unfreeze this for you,
but we gotta spread this shit out.

595
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:39,694
I'm talking MoneyPak, PayPal,
Venmo, Google Pay.

596
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,432
Okay, wow.

597
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,567
You're cashing in
with this craptacular site,

598
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:48,169
Savvy Super Saver?

599
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,471
- It was a template.
- Right.

600
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,241
And the site isn't savvy,
the shoppers are.

601
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,408
There we go. That part.

602
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,610
The site is registered

603
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,712
to a Charles Barkin
from Hackensack.

604
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:01,148
Charlie Barkin. It's from
<i>All Dogs Go to Heaven.</i>

605
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,485
- And the address is a Petco in New Jersey.
- Boom.

606
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:08,556
Well, look at you. We got ourselves
a couple of queenpins in the making.

607
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:11,425
- Damn, you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,661
We queenpins, bitch.

609
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,397
Relax, 'cause it's still
way too easy to trace back to you.

610
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,667
Is there anything else
I should know about?

611
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:22,436
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.</i>

612
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:24,839
<i>You know what makes your booty
so fine?</i>

613
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:28,910
<i>Half-off booty
from savvysupersaver.com.</i>

614
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,580
Seriously?

615
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,415
You see, my YouTube's
a part of my brand, so...

616
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,684
<i>That's 48 real rolls,
okay, y'all?</i>

617
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,953
<i>Head over to Savvy Super Sa...</i>

618
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Where you go, girl?

619
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,295
Trust me, nobody gives a bag
of dicks about your brand.

620
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:49,764
What you guys need
is a front for your business.

621
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,965
All of this money is dirty,

622
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,467
so don't go spending dough
on shit you can't write off.

623
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:54,902
Give it six months,

624
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,538
and make sure it ain't
Alarm-ageddon out there.

625
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,309
You got that? And to start,
we need aliases, and lots of 'em.

626
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,412
From there, we open up bank
accounts, apply for credit cards,

627
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:07,381
and don't be doing this shit
at home.

628
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,383
Rent a stash house, okay?

629
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,253
And from now on, use this.
It's an IronKey.

630
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,655
It's military-grade encryption.
Just stick it in your USB.

631
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:18,326
Uh, for my help, I take 10%
of everything you make.

632
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:19,827
Girl, what?

633
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:21,262
Well, I'm worth it.

634
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,297
The good news is, ladies,

635
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,399
is you are entering
a real growth industry, okay.

636
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:28,402
Pink-collar crime,
it's fly as fuck right now.

637
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,405
We get you square,
and this coupon hustle,

638
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,674
it's gonna pay off
in a big, big way.

639
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,678
Could you say it all again
and, like, much slower?

640
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,847
I don't know what half
those things you said were.

641
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:42,316
- And do you have a pad and pen maybe?
- Pen and paper, yeah.

642
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,418
Or give me my phone back.
I'll take notes.

643
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,887
- Just to write it down.
- No. No.

644
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,956
- We don't got it, but we got it.
- We will wing it.

645
00:36:58,032 --> 00:36:59,734
<i>Yeah, I mean,
you and me are...</i>

646
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,969
We're standing on the tip
of the iceberg here.

647
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,772
Ah, it's probably just...
...China.

648
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,808
Oh. Can't be China.

649
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,610
Why not China?

650
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:12,380
Ah, no, China's just...
You gotta trust me on this one.

651
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,682
I mean these...
these are gall-damn perfect.

652
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,718
You know this...
China couldn't pull this one off. No.

653
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,687
These... It's all
in the file folder.

654
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:21,589
- I mean, the, uh, coupon warning sheets...
- Yeah. Okay.

655
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,557
...the website,
the interview with the mother.

656
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,793
- It's... It's... It's a real bombshell.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,597
Don't say bombshell
in an FBI building.

658
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,933
- I thought maybe don't say bomb.
- Don't say bomb anything.

659
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,835
- Sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

660
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:38,606
No, I just... I'm trying to
relay the severity of the case.

661
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,807
I just, uh...

662
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,709
This is a crisis
at a national level.

663
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,311
- This is my Pelican Brief.
- Okay. Okay.

664
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,380
- Okay. Ken? Ken, okay.
- Yes, sir.

665
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,850
Ken, you have my attention.
You have her attention.

666
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,452
Oh. Hey.

667
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,056
I think we should run this
up the chain to HQ.

668
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,427
- That's, uh, it's good to hear that.
- Yeah.

669
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,362
'Cause, I mean,
that's great.

670
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,963
Uh, we're gonna need a whole
team working on this thing.

671
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,498
Yep, yep. Mm-hmm.

672
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,635
- Is... Do you do tours?
- Uh, we d... We don't.

673
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,603
Well, you got my card.
I gave you my card and that.

674
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,638
Yeah, we got your card.

675
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,039
- We got your email.
- Email.

676
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,375
We got your... your snail mail.
We got everything.

677
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,876
- Trust me, trust me.
- That's good.

678
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,878
You're going to be hearing
from DC real soon. Yeah.

679
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,514
- Okay. Thanks so much, guys. This is fun.
- Thank you.

680
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,450
- Appreciate it, uh...
- We'll do it again.

681
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:24,118
Ken. See you, Ken.

682
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,692
Who the fuck let that kook in here?
I mean, come on. Coupons? Coupons?

683
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,928
Dealing with
national security, terrorism,

684
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:36,363
and this nutbag
is babbling on about coupons.

685
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,698
I can't... Just... Here.

686
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,602
Why don't we let that shit
get lost in DC?

687
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,072
<i>This is Ken Miller.</i>

688
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:48,442
<i>Salt Lake City referred
my coupon case to HQ.</i>

689
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:52,680
<i>Uh, whether I gotta fax or email or
what have you, uh, you let me know,</i>

690
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,050
<i>'cause I would love to get in touch

<i>All right. Ken Miller.</i>

693
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,595
- Looking for someone?
- I was told to find

694
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,064
the lowest rung on the ladder.
Is that you?

695
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:17,705
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

696
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,773
Mm-hmm.

697
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,834
- Nice truck!
- Nice new house!

698
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:49,937
- So big!
- Thank you.

699
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,806
Had to rent it
for the business.

700
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:55,442
<i>Uh, just leaving
message number umpteenth.</i>

701
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:57,745
<i>Uh, hoping y'all are gonna
give me a call back.</i>

702
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,748
<i>I am sitting here waiting.
I think you know my number by now.</i>

703
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,917
Okay, what's with all
the free fucking coupons?

704
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:12,660
<i>Hey, this is Ken Miller.</i>

705
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:14,562

706
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,498
<i>I just spilled some coffee.

707
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:24,205
<i>This is Ken.
Just checking in again.</i>

708
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:26,740
<i>Um, Miller, it's Ken Miller.</i>

709
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,777
<i>The "I" still stands for
investigation, right?</i>

710
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,656
- It's been six months!
- I know.

711
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:47,761
Today's the day we finally
get to spend our money!

712
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,831
I know. Hey, I added up
everything in all of our accounts.

713
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,666
- Mm-hmm.
- You wanna know what we've got?

714
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,104
- 5,230,000...
- What?

715
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,772
...and 55 cents.

716
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,241
- We're millionaires!
- I know!

717
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,077
We're filthy fucking rich!

718

724
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,162
Didn't Tempe Tina say
that all the money is dirty?

725
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,099
- What?
- We still have to clean it.

726
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,735
Fuck!

727
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,938

Call her ass up.

728
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,744
<i>We're sorry.

731
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,983
Think she's using
a burner phone?

732
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,319
What do we do now?
I'm a multimillionaire

733
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,987
and I can't spend
any of my money?

734
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:48,255
That's fucking bullshit.

735
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,257
Wait a minute.

736
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,326
- Rick.
- What about him?

737
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:55,296
Rick is always griping to me

738
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,765
about how these different
companies hide their money.

739
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:00,868
They funnel money through, like,
offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands.

740
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,304
Honestly, I try to tune out
all of the audit talk,

741
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:08,142
but there was this one story about this
comptroller guy in Tacoma, Washington,

742
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,077
who embezzled $25 million.

743
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:14,281
And the only reason I remember
is because his name was Guy Rich.

744
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:16,150
- Guy Rich?
- That's what I said.

745
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:18,052
Rick was like, "Yeah."

746
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:22,356
Anyway, he said that Guy's
stupidity actually helped him.

747
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:24,792
'Cause he didn't know anything
about the Cayman Islands account.

748
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:27,895
So what he did instead
was bought a bunch of stuff.

749
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,863
And then he went out
and sold it,

750
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,600
and whatever he made
from selling it was clean.

751
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,870
JoJo, we need to get all of our money
out of these different bank accounts,

752
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:40,607
buy a bunch of expensive stuff
and then sell it.

753
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,743
And all the money
we make from selling it

754
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,244
- will be clean.
- Will be clean.

755
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,348
Okay. All right.

756
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:50,851
But you can't just walk into a bank
and take out a shitload of money.

757
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,020
Can you?

758
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,856
Ooh. Girl,
we are gonna get you together.

759
00:42:55,923 --> 00:42:57,324
Really?
This dress with that blazer?

760
00:42:57,391 --> 00:43:00,661
Yes! A hundred percent!
Just trust me, okay?

761
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,363
<i>Just let JoJo work her magic.</i>

762
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:03,897
Yes!

763
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:27,354
Hi. Joseph Johnson, please.

764
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,356
Straight ahead
through that door.

765
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:37,431
And you must be Melissa.

766
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,666
- Very nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

767
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:40,834
I'll be honest with you,
Melissa.

768
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:42,336
I was pretty suspicious
at first.

769
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:44,438
You moving around
this kind of money.

770
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:47,207
With this being a border state,
we're extra vigilant, Nancy,

771
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,943
because we're dealing with
some pretty dangerous people.

772
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,311
Lucky for us, Stephanie,

773
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,380
the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network

774
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:55,382
has established
dollar amount thresholds

775
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:56,984
to guard against
money laundering.

776
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,386
But obviously
you're not the cartel.

777
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:03,991
You're not hiring mules,
smuggling what have you across the border.

778
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:08,729
No, no. You're just a hardworking,
successful, female entrepreneur.

779
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:13,267
Now, your business.
What is Back-2-Black exactly?

780
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,403
It's a cosmetics line

781
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,972
for...
...people of color.

782
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:22,042
People of color?

783
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,477
Huh.

784
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,751
Well, if there's a demand,
why not you?

785
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:33,954
Hey, Barbara, we're gonna need some help
carrying Ms. Russell's money over here.

786
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:38,158
Let's go get you your money.

787
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:40,127
Will hundreds be a problem?

788
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:43,230
Super-duper.

789
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:49,436
Oh, my God.

790
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:51,371
- Look at all this money.
- I know.

791
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,440
How are we
gonna clean it all?

792
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:57,311
You know we gotta go shopping.
What would a guy buy with all this cash?

793
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:59,813
Yeah.
Like, what would Rick buy?

794
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,321
What's up? I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

795
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,256
Hey, quick question.

796
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,361
What would I buy
if money was no object?

797
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:17,030
Why are you asking me?
You know what, doesn't matter.

798
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,767
I guess I would buy
a Lamborghini.

799
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,562
And finally,
the Lamborghini Urus

800
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:51,165
merges the soul
of a sports car

801
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,433
with the functionality
of an SUV.

802
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,270
You truly can't call yourself
a real American

803
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,139
till you've been behind the
wheel of a Marathon Coach

804
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,942
- built on a Prevost chassis.
- How much for this one?

805
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,846
This beauty
is priced at $265,000.

806
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:07,581
Oh, uh,
don't forget the boat.

807
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:09,283
Oh, yeah.
How much for the boat?

808
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,451
What do you say, ladies?
Which one do you want?

809
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:13,921
We'll take them all.

810
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:28,135
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

811
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:40,280
You know, every A&G store in America
is affected as well, so I hear ya.

812
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:41,982
- I hear ya.
- <i>Do you, Ken?</i>

813
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,483
<i>Do you understand
the trickle-down</i>

814
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,019
<i>if corporations like us
don't make money?</i>

815
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:49,289
<i>We can't pay taxes. Then suddenly
the roads aren't getting fixed.</i>

816
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,425
<i>Teachers are losing
their jobs.</i>

817
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:54,261
<i>Before you know it, John Q.
Public is getting mugged at gunpoint,</i>

818
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:55,996
- <i>maybe gang-raped.</i>
- Uh...

819
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,165
<i>And where are the cops?
There are no more cops.</i>

820
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,499
Okay, Craig, I...

821
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,568
Oh, 7:00 a.m.

822
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:03,937
Yeah, one sec, Craig.
I gotta call you back.

823
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:05,606
<i>We're
supposed to be the good guys here,</i>

824
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:07,608
<i>giving everybody
a great deal. Shit...</i>

825
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:11,411
Yeah. Hey, you know, Bill, I...
I actually got another call coming in.

826
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:13,080
I'm going to switch over,
okay?

827
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:15,115
<i>It's a goddamn priority
we find out who...</i>

828
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,951
Hello?

829
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:19,620
<i>Oh, hi. Yes,
I'm calling for Ken Miller.</i>

830
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:21,154
<i>Speaking.</i>

831
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,390
Ken, hi.
My name is Albert Anderson.

832
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:25,525
I'm calling from the Federal
Bureau of Investigations

833
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,894
about your counterfeit
coupon case.

834
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,330
<i>Thank God you're calling me.
Hey, wait a sec.</i>

835
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:34,935
I have been calling you guys,
leaving messages ad nauseam,

836
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:36,670
and here you are,
finally getting back to me.

837
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:38,572
This is "real soon"?
Let me tell you what.

838
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,341
We need boots on the ground
ASAP right now. Okay, bud?

839
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:42,943
Uh,

840
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,212
I'm an intelligence analyst

841
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,049
working out of
a sub-subbasement.

842
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,252
My field experience
is literally zero.

843
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,322
Yeah, that sounds about right.
You got to be fucking kidding me.

844
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:59,226
Unfortunately, no. But I am calling
you because I think I can help.

845
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,029
Yeah, don't...
don't let me stop ya.

846
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:03,964
Give me
the master plan here, bub.

847
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,401
Okay, uh, well, this Savvy
Super Saver website.

848
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,337
Now, the interface
is complete amateur hour,

849
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:13,073
<i>but the problem
is with the site's back end.</i>

850
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,575
<i>I've used every possible tool
at my disposal</i>

851
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,644
<i>and I am meeting
nothing but dead ends.</i>

852
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,579
<i>The IP address is untraceable,</i>

853
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,349
there's no analytics,
no cookie trails.

854
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,218
Guess what I'm trying
to say is...

855
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:29,156
none of it really adds up.

856
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:32,359
Okay, so how's that
supposed to help me, Albert?

857
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:36,163
Oh, well, I guess it doesn't.
But, um...

858
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:39,199
The fuck, Albert?
Talking about cookie trails.

859
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,701
<i>I don't know this shit.</i>

860
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,170
Do you realize that
these counterfeit coupons,

861
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:45,305
tens of thousands of 'em,
have been mailed out all over the country?

862
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:47,674
- <i>And I'm the one who's supposed to...</i>
- Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

863
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,276
Did you say mail?

864
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:53,413
Like, postal, snail mail,
not by email?

865
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,617
Mail. Like...
Like through the post office.

866
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,754
Okay. Help is on the way.

867
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:03,490
Yeah, you're gonna have those boots
on the ground within 48 hours.

868
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:07,627
Okay, so now we're talking.
Now what are we...

869
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,429
And he hung up. Goddamn.

870
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:26,513
Ken Miller?

871
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,715
Oh, yeah. And you are?

872
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:31,752
- Simon Kilmurry, US postal inspector.
- Oh, with the Federal Bureau...

873
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,720
US... Sorry, say that again?

874
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:36,590
I'm with the US Postal Service.

875
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:40,460
The Postal Service? No. No, no.
They said that they were sending the FBI.

876
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:44,064
This is unacceptable.
They... I...

877
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:47,067
So what do you do?
You, like, carry mail around or something?

878
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:51,071
That would be a mailman.
They carry the mail. I carry a gun.

879
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:54,040
This company, Kimberly-Clark,

880
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:56,510
issues just under
a thousand of these coupons.

881
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:01,314
As of this week,
over 15,000 of them have been redeemed.

882
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:04,117
As if that wasn't bad enough,
we can't tell the difference

883
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,753
between the real,
legitimate coupons and the counterfeits.

884
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,357
Well, I do appreciate you
contacting the FBI,

885
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,427
but the postal inspectors
will take it from here.

886
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:16,129
I appreciate your initiative,

887
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:18,298
but this is my case.
All right?

888
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:20,233
You're gonna need me
on this one.

889
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,769
You can't just waltz in here
and take the food off my plate.

890
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:26,406
This is my thing. This is my deal.
Unless you wanna be partners.

891
00:50:26,473 --> 00:50:28,642
- We could be partners on this.
- No. No, we can't be partners.

892
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,710
And you wanna know why
we can't be partners?

893
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,779
'Cause I'm a federal
law enforcement officer.

894
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:36,383
I carry a firearm, I solve
crimes, and I arrest people.

895
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,619
You're a private citizen who
chases around 15-year-old girls

896
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:42,656
for lifting packs
of Juicy Fruit.

897
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:45,492
That's one thing I do
of many.

898
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,463
I-I know coupons.
I live coupons.

899
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:52,532
So what happened when you tried
to order some off the website?

900
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,835
What are you... I didn't.

901
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,203
So you've done nothing?

902
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,471
I did someth...

903
00:50:57,537 --> 00:50:59,673
- I did a lot of things.
- I did...

904
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:02,209
You know what I did?
Here's what the fuck I did.

905
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:04,611
I called the FBI, and I said,
"Can you help me out?"

906
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,814
They said, "Sure, boots on the ground."
And then they brought me a postman.

907
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:12,319
All right, Ken, I tell you what.
You seem to know a lot about coupons.

908
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:17,190
So, why don't you order some off the
website, and they'll come in the mail.

909
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:19,226
And then we can all see
where they're from.

910
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:23,296
But, uh, just to be clear so
there's good boundaries in place,

911
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:24,798
we're not partners.

912
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:28,802
But what
about you making me, uh,

913
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:31,671
some sort of a deputized
citizen or something?

914
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,573
Just from
a placard standpoint.

915
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:37,577
- A deputized citizen?
- Yeah.

916
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,880
So what am I doing?
Am I forming a posse here?

917
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:41,915
No, I'm sorry. It's...

918
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:44,784
What's your action item?

919
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:48,255
- My... My actionable item?
- What is your action item?

920
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:51,258
Action item is to order
the coupons off the website.

921
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,929
That's a good i...
That was a good idea too.

922
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,635
Oh, yes.

923
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,373
Guns? No. No way.

924
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,875
Not happening. Never.

925
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:11,478
We can go to Shake Baby after
and get a milkshake.

926
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,283
What has
the best resale value?

927
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:18,818
We're looking for
a good investment.

928
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,555
All right, well,
that'd probably be this here.

929
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:24,858
This is a KelTec
KSG tactical shotgun.

930
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:27,460
It's pump-action. Right?

931
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:29,829
Now y'all seen <i>John Wick,</i> right?
John Wick movies?

932
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,765
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah.

933
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:33,333
There ain't
no better commercial for a gun

934
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,834
than a John Wick movie.

935
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,838
The moment Keanu
used this sexy bad boy,

936
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,874
the price just went
straight through the roof.

937
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,343
Is it cheaper
if we buy them in bulk?

938
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,583
- Ah.
- Mmm.

939
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:51,718
Mmm.

940
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,520
That probably shouldn't
have been that easy.

941
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:04,531
Champagne?

942
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,545
Oh. Ah!

943
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:20,347
Oh, yeah!

944
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:22,682
- Coupons! Coupons!
- Coupons! Coupons!

945
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:31,491
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

946
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:33,627
What are you going to do
with your half of the money?

947
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,362
Oh, okay.

948
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:37,430
Um, I'm gonna pay off
Mama Josie's mortgage...

949
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,666
- Mmm, mm-hmm.
- ...hire her a live-in housekeeper,

950
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,935
and then, I don't know.

951
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,271
I wanna go somewhere exotic.
Like somewhere with a beach.

952
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:46,840
- You know?
- Mmm.

953
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:48,675
What about you?
What are you gonna do with your share?

954
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:50,777
Well...

955
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,814
- Okay. You want to hear something crazy?
- Always.

956
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:58,952
I made an appointment
at the fertility clinic.

957
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:02,288
And I know it's a long shot,

958
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:04,691
but I just figured, why not?
You know?

959
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:07,994
Yeah, okay.
Uh... What did Rick say?

960
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,330
I didn't tell Rick.

961
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:12,932
I was kinda hoping
you'd go with me.

962
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,671
Connie. Of course!
You know I gotta go.

963
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,806
- You will?
- Yes!

964
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:22,475
'Cause when this little girl asks her
auntie JoJo the story of her life,

965
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:25,845
I'm gonna say, "Girl,
this all started with a coupon."

966
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:32,752
Okay, so what we got here
is a address for a pet store,

967
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,054
a Petco in Kansas.

968
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,622
I Google Mapped it.

969
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,091
The nearest airport
is Kansas City, Missouri.

970
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:41,695
So I took the liberty of booking us
a little red-eye flight over there.

971
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,663
Booked us? Okay.

972
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,633
Ken, we are not doing this.
We are not...

973
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,669
Kansas, huh?
Did you check the postage?

974
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:52,839
- What, like the stamp?
- Well, there is no stamp.

975
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:55,108
They're using
an online postage service,

976
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:57,444
which also means
there's no postmark.

977
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,613
- Okay, so...
- Okay, so the zip code on the postmark

978
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,349
and the zip code on the return
address, well, they don't match.

979
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,720
So, the return address, well,
that's Kansas, anything starting with 6-6.

980
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:09,456
And the postage, 8-5-0-1-3,

981
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:11,691
anything starting with 8-5,
that's Arizona.

982
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:15,028
And the last three digits,
0-1-3, that's Phoenix.

983
00:55:15,095 --> 00:55:17,097
So screw
what the return address says.

984
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:18,765
These things were mailed...

985
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,134
Mailed from Phoenix.
That's impressive. Holy shit.

986
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:22,569
I'm sorry.

987
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:24,704
Did you actually memorize
the zip code

988
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:25,872
for every city in the country?

989
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:28,007
I'm a postal inspector, Ken.

990
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,477
And all things being equal,

991
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,746
the simplest explanation
tends to be the right one.

992
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,447
Oh, my God.

993
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:35,749
So if those things
were mailed out of Phoenix,

994
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:37,484
then the criminal outfit
behind these are...

995
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,952
- From Phoenix.
- ...also in Phoenix.

996
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:40,954
Yeah, that's... You gotta
let me in on this thing.

997
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,490
I'm Mr. Phoenix.
I'm there every month.

998
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:45,925
There's nine A&G stores
in the area. I can help.

999
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:48,461
- Ken, we've been through it.
- Please, come on.

1000
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:55,168
All right.
I shouldn't be doing this.

1001
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,637
- What are you...
- Okay.

1002
00:55:57,704 --> 00:55:59,639
Put your left hand on my badge
and raise your right hand.

1003
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:02,575
- Oh, holy shit. Yes, yes, yes. Okay.
- Repeat after me.

1004
00:56:02,642 --> 00:56:04,644
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

1005
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,713
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

1006
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,181
That I'm being fucked with.

1007
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:10,917
That I'm being...
Oh, fuck you, man. Come on!

1008
00:56:10,984 --> 00:56:12,552
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

1009
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,054
I don't have the power to make you a
deputy on anything. We've talked about it.

1010
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,957
Thought you might give me a chance.
I thought maybe you would...

1011
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:20,460
Okay, listen. Y-You're right.

1012
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:24,831
Fifteen years I've spent tracking lowlifes
shoving shit in their pockets. I get it.

1013
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:28,468
But it's a real case.
I... I...

1014
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:31,604
I thought you'd give me a chance at
doing something that actually mattered.

1015
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:36,676
I... Oh, shit.

1016
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,912
Maybe you can help.

1017
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,513
You do know Phoenix,
and you already gave me

1018
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,015
a really good lead
with those coupons.

1019
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:43,983
And I don't want you
to feel bad.

1020
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,186
ATF, DEA, FBI,

1021
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:48,955
most of those assholes would already
be on a plane to Kansas by now.

1022
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,858
But you can't cheat the mail.

1023
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:53,760
<i>And you
can't cheat Father Time.</i>

1024
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,130
There is a price to pay for all
your training over the years.

1025
00:56:57,197 --> 00:57:01,801
- I hate to say it.
- This is... your last shot.

1026
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,171
Well...

1027
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:07,640
I'm egg-cited to give it a go.

1028
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:11,044
Egg humor.
Well, here's one for you.

1029
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,612
Uh, last time we tried this,

1030
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,082
your average yield
was only four or five eggs.

1031
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:18,251
Whew.
Damn, girl.

1032
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:20,620
But the good news
is that we still have

1033
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,755
some of Rick's sperm
from last time. So...

1034
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:26,092
Uh, do we have to use
his sperm?

1035
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,263
Well, no, but...

1036
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,166
I mean, he is your husband.

1037
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:36,903
Yeah, I think
we'd like to shop around.

1038
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,973
- Okay, so there's no photos?
- No photos.

1039
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,908
- It feels like a huge flaw in the system.
- Aw.

1040
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:45,178
- What about that one?
- Oh. Well, let's take a closer look.

1041
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:51,651
Geez.

1042
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,888
This donor was very active.
We have over 400 vials.

1043
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:57,523
- 400?
- Yeah.

1044
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,225
6'2", high IQ,

1045
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,561
- extremely high motility levels.
- Ooh.

1046
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,630
His little guys
are like Olympic swimmers.

1047
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:05,832
- Olympic?
- Uh-huh.

1048
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,967
Hello, Mr. Baby Batter.

1049
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:10,837
You know what?

1050
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,640
I bet a lot of women can't
afford high-quality sperm.

1051
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,075
We could get it to
them at a discount price.

1052
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:17,977
Do you take cash?

1053
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:27,887
Did we just spend $330,000
on one man's sperm?

1054
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:33,026
You know, I bet we'll be the first
people to launder money selling semen.

1055
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,594
Right?

1056
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,562
I don't know.

1057
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,731
Getting a call
from Switzerland.

1058
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:39,832
Weird.

1059
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:41,834
Hello?

1060
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:44,837
Oh, hey, Tina.

1061
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:46,306
Are... Are you in Switzerland?

1062
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,776
Oh, no, right. You're here.

1063
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:51,277
Oh, you're here, here.

1064
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,080
Yeah, okay.
Uh, we'll be out in a jiff.

1065
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:57,050
- She's here.
- Oh.

1066
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:07,860
Tempe, Juicy Fruit?

1067
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:20,807
Any idea
why I brought you guys here?

1068
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:21,941
- No.
- No.

1069
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:23,910
Where the fuck
is all your money?

1070
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,879
- Oh, that. We...
- Oh.

1071
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:29,649
- Um, relax.
- Girl, we got it.

1072
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:31,918
We took care of everything.
I mean, we're self-starters.

1073
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,721
- We're queenpins. Remember you said?
- That's who you're looking at.

1074
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:36,222
- You said it.
- "Queenpins."

1075
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:37,657
We're cleaning it!

1076
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:41,060
Okay. And, uh,
why are you cleaning it?

1077
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:45,198
- Because it's... dirty.
- It's dirty, Tina.

1078
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:48,768
You don't have any dirty money.
Do you know why?

1079
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,705
'Cause your front company
Back-2-Black's sole purpose

1080
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:54,240
is to clean your money.

1081
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:57,210
So, you're...
you're telling us that w...

1082
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,512
- Wait.
- That we don't...

1083
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,914
- All the fucking money is already clean?
- Oh, my God.

1084
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,783
I'm just, like, over you guys.

1085
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,852
- Can I be honest?
- Yeah.

1086
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,754
- I wish you would've let me write...
- That's what I'm saying.

1087
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,789
You didn't let her write it
down, so we didn't know.

1088
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,325
I asked for a pad. You said it was dirty.
I got home. I...

1089
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:14,927
All right. You're gonna go to
the bank every couple of days.

1090
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:17,063
Just take the money
in small increments. Okay?

1091
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,731
And put it in the bank
in small increments.

1092
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:20,666
Can you do that?
And not fuck that up?

1093
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:23,036
We can...
That's something we can totally do.

1094
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:25,171
- We st...
- We, um...

1095
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:28,141
We still have
some of it left, but...

1096
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:30,877
We bought a few things.

1097
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,413
A few things?

1098
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:37,683
You guys said a few things.
This is not a few things.

1099
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,220
This is a big red flag.
You need to sell this shit now.

1100
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:42,922
Okay. Yeah.

1101
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:44,457
We also bought
a bunch of guns.

1102
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:47,393
Guns?
Where are you gonna sell guns?

1103
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,029
We're gonna
figure that out.

1104
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,165
Or eBay.

1105
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,134
- Or eBay.
- Was my first thought.

1106
01:00:56,436 --> 01:00:58,805
There's nothing more
important than the mail, Ken.

1107
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:02,175
People put pen to paper
with their innermost thoughts.

1108
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,111
And then they seal it in an
envelope, and they put a stamp on it.

1109
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:07,413
They trust us with their
secrets, and we deliver.

1110
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,015
Yeah, no, I guess...

1111
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,417
I have a hard time
believing anybody gives a hoot

1112
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,719
when they get a letter
in the mail.

1113
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:16,089
Yeah.

1114
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:26,299
I have a feeling
that Leo F. Sullivan

1115
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:28,734
gave a hoot about getting
a letter in the mail.

1116
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:35,942
Marked October 16th, 1918.

1117
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:41,280
"Dear Mary,

1118
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:44,217
I received two of your
letters a couple weeks ago,

1119
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,019
and they brought the usual
amount of good cheer.

1120
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:50,223
Those letters made the trip
with me to the front,

1121
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,127
and now all I have to do
is put my hand in my pocket,

1122
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:55,761
and there you are.

1123
01:01:55,828 --> 01:01:57,830
I spoke to
Father Tom Holbrook

1124
01:01:57,897 --> 01:02:00,766
about my big desire within
to return to you

1125
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:05,338
and the ache in my heart to meet our
little Irene and hold her in my arms.

1126
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:07,874
I took my last confession

1127
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,977
and now head out to battle
with a clear conscience

1128
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:15,448
and a heart full of thoughts
of you, my dear, sweet Mary.

1129
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:19,485
As ever I remain,
Leo F. Sullivan."

1130
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:29,262
I think some people do care
about getting a letter, Ken.

1131
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,134
- Wait, wha... what happened?
- What do you mean what happened?

1132
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,536
Did he make it?

1133
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:39,805
You know, did he, um...
did he survive the battle?

1134
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:42,108
Doesn't matter if Leo made
it or Leo didn't make it.

1135
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,878
What matters is that the letter survived.
The letter made it.

1136
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:47,980
And it's something
that we take very seriously.

1137
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,950
Yeah, I get that. I just...

1138
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,819
It's hard not to think
about the Sullivan family.

1139
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:56,956
What... Whatever happened to Mary?
Did she become a widow?

1140
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,058
Ken. Ken, it was
a hundred years ago.

1141
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,960
All the Sullivans
are probably dead.

1142
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,063
I wonder.
Did he ever get to hold Irene?

1143
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,299
Are these relatives
of yours? Are they...

1144
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,968
I think we're all related
in some ways. Don't you, Ken?

1145
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:10,970
Hmm?

1146
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:13,839
Welcome to Phoenix.

1147
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:17,610
5,000 square miles of hot-as-shit
desert, suburban sprawl.

1148
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,613
Yeah, well, some haystacks
are bigger than others,

1149
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,982
but the bad guys
are out there.

1150
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,383
Trouble for them,

1151
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,286
they decided to do bad things
through the mail.

1152
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:29,855
Now we're gonna handle this
the post office way.

1153
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:32,124
Yeah, I kinda wish you
hadn't read me that letter.

1154
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:34,994
I can't stop thinking
if that guy survived or not.

1155
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,230
Oh, Ken, you're missing
the point of it.

1156
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:41,167
<i>...where the temperature is
currently 89 degrees, southwest winds...</i>

1157
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,399
Hey. What's going on
around here?

1158
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:18,037
Did we get a new TV?

1159
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,374
I can't get anything past you.

1160
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,175
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

1161
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:26,312
You know,
you telling me to get a job

1162
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:29,115
was exactly the push I needed
to realize I could do better.

1163
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,584
So I marched out there,
and I got a job.

1164
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:33,586
A job doing what?

1165
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:36,555
Sales.
Just a boring old sales job.

1166
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,425
You know, filling orders
and stuffing envelopes mostly.

1167
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:42,261
And the couponing?
What's going on with that?

1168
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:44,463
Oh, I don't use coupons
anymore.

1169
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,464
You're shitting me.

1170
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:47,166
I hope you don't mind.

1171
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:49,969
I used my first paycheck
to buy you your 4K TV.

1172
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:52,371
Why would I mind?
I mean...

1173
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:56,175
...got a brand-new TV
and a brand-new wife.

1174
01:04:58,377 --> 01:05:01,047
Yep. Connie 2.0.

1175
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:02,281
Enjoy.

1176
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,320
Are you sure you don't wanna
discuss this with your husband

1177
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:09,322
before I implant the embryos?

1178
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:11,557
Remember,
I can't un-bake the cake.

1179
01:05:11,624 --> 01:05:14,193
Dude. It's her body.
It's her choice.

1180
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:17,163
No.

1181
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:19,365
We didn't use
any of his ingredients.

1182
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:21,701
He doesn't deserve
a piece of my cake.

1183
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:25,304
You all know Ken
Miller, the store's LPO.

1184
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:28,507
And with him
is Simon Kilmurry.

1185
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:30,743
He's an FBI agent
who wants to ask you...

1186
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,179
- A postal inspector.
- What's that?

1187
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:35,348
I'm a US postal inspector.

1188
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:39,251
Oh. He's a postal inspector,
whatever that means.

1189
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:42,388
We're just looking for any customers
with strange coupon habits,

1190
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:46,992
any irregular coupon activity,
uh, frequency of use,

1191
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:50,363
any customers who have
unusually high savings.

1192
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:53,999
First of all, people literally
forget you're even a human being.

1193
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:57,136
Then she's gonna lecture me on how
plastic bags are killing our planet

1194
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,238
like I'm the asshole
who invented plastic.

1195
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:02,174
We call her the "Oh, wait.
I have a coupon" lady

1196
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:06,145
'cause she only remembers she has a
coupon in her hand after she's paid.

1197
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,215
We call him "Mr. Bullshit" 'cause he
makes you check in the back for stuff.

1198
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:14,153
And every time we tell him we're out,
he always screams out, "Bullshit!" Yeah.

1199
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,123
Well, I guess that's it.
Hope it helps.

1200
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:19,692
Oh, wait.
We do have one other cashier.

1201
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:22,695
I call her
the "Crazy Coupon Lady."

1202
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:25,197
Got this smile
plastered across her face,

1203
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,300
ridiculous amount of coupons
in her hand every time.

1204
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:32,405
And, of course, everybody's backed
up, waiting, waiting, waiting.

1205
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:36,575
And they're getting pissed
at me. At me!

1206
01:06:36,642 --> 01:06:38,210
- And the worst part...
- Okay.

1207
01:06:38,277 --> 01:06:40,713
...she had this fucking
catchphrase, okay,

1208
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,750
this little saying she would spew
at me every time before she left.

1209
01:06:44,817 --> 01:06:46,519
"Watch the pennies,

1210
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,354
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah." And I'm like...

1211
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,456
I'm sorry, I gotta
back you up there.

1212
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:52,458
Did you say...
Was the phrase,

1213
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:56,162
"Watch the pennies, and then the
dollars will take care of themselves"?

1214
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:59,098
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it.

1215
01:06:59,165 --> 01:07:01,467
Okay, we're connecting then now.
We're connecting here.

1216
01:07:01,534 --> 01:07:04,203
So let me ask you this. What is her name?
What is this woman's name?

1217
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,805
I don't know her name, man.
I fucking hate her.

1218
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:08,207
But you've done the transactions.
You see the card.

1219
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,743
- I'm sure you got her name, right?
- Crazy Coupon Lady.

1220
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,646
- Description. What does she look like?
- She's, like, three feet tall.

1221
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:15,281
- Call a sketch artist!
- Okay.

1222
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:17,216
We gotta have somebody
down here.

1223
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,185
Can you stay there
for a second?

1224
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:21,554
Ken, Ken. I'd like to talk
to you for just a minute.

1225
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,656
This is good.
Don't forget the...

1226
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:25,424
- Remember where we were at.
- Come on. Let's go.

1227
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:27,226
You can't be
screaming at him.

1228
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,495
What did you scream at the
guy, "Call a sketch artist"?

1229
01:07:29,562 --> 01:07:32,465
- Yeah, I...
- Who do you think she is, Keyser Söze?

1230
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:34,467
Ken, just take it
down a notch.

1231
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:38,571
- Slow it all down. Okay?
- I'm slowing it down,

1232
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:42,475
and I'm going to slowly tell
you exactly what happened there.

1233
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:46,712
He gave us the seed that's gonna
become the fucking branches, okay?

1234
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:48,481
- That lady, that's the gal.
- What does it...

1235
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:50,749
That's the gal! That phrase.
Did you not hear it?

1236
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,853
"Watch the pennies. Dollars take
care of themselves." That's...

1237
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:58,624
I mean, that is literally plastered
on the Savvy Super Saver website.

1238
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,496
Okay. Well, that is interesting.
That's helpful.

1239
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,767
And did you know that
your average shopper

1240
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:13,506
travels 2.27 miles to their
nearest local grocery store?

1241
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:16,609
- Is that true? Are you right about that?
- Yeah. That's a fact.

1242
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,612
If you are, that means our haystack
just went from 5,000 square miles

1243
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,814
- down to a two-mile radius...
- We're shrinking it.

1244
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:24,283
...and we should get boots
on the ground. Look at me.

1245
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:28,587
- That's good, Ken. That's great.
- Thanks.

1246
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:30,556
Now do it without
the screaming, okay?

1247
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,825
It's just passion.
I'm a passionate man.

1248
01:08:32,892 --> 01:08:34,793
You can be passionate
without being an idiot.

1249
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,200
Whew.

1250
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:43,536
- Hey.
- Hi.

1251
01:08:43,602 --> 01:08:45,271
Ugh, girl, eBay is a bust.

1252
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:47,540
It's just too much.
I can't sell it fast enough.

1253
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:51,277
What are we gonna do? It's not like we
can have a yard sale for all this shit.

1254
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,585
We are investigating
a counterfeit coupon ring

1255
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:03,222
that we believe is operating
somewhere within your postal routes.

1256
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,758
Now, the mail that's being
picked up is primarily envelopes

1257
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:09,628
with a Kansas return address
and marked "Savvy Super Saver."

1258
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:14,266
Suspect is a Caucasian female,
late 30s, approximately 5'1".

1259
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:18,637
One witness described her as overly
cheerful with a superiority complex.

1260
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:21,907
She may or may not
have accomplices.

1261
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:25,878
Hey, Earl, what about that gal
you won't stop blabbing about?

1262
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:28,781
Um, not sure I know
what he's talking about.

1263
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:31,584
You know, the girl.
She makes all these coupon videos.

1264
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,419
I'm sorry.
Did you say "coupon videos"?

1265
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,822
I don't know
nothing about nobody, uh...

1266
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:39,592
The girl. Yeah, she lives over
on, uh, Clayton Avenue.

1267
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:43,395
What's her name? Uh, Coco? JoJo?
It's JoJo, right? Or is it Coco?

1268
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:46,665
Hold on. You said she's Caucasian?
Whoopsie-daisy. Never mind.

1269
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:50,269
She's a Black gal.
A Black woman. Lady. So...

1270
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,539
Oh, shit. Look.
These open carry dudes.

1271
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,807
Hi. Do you have oat milk?

1272
01:09:54,873 --> 01:09:56,442
Oat milk is over there.

1273
01:09:56,508 --> 01:09:58,711
Oh. Maybe they want to buy our guns?

1274
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,847
- Morning. What can I get for you two?
- Hey, what's up, baby?

1275
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:05,651
- Let me grab a skinny caramel macchiato.
- Connie.

1276
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:08,954
- Large coffee. Black.
- What are you doing?

1277
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:10,789
Mmm.

1278
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:12,324
Nice.

1279
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:16,996
Couldn't help but notice. Are you
fellas part of some sort of gun club?

1280
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:19,498
Just practicing
our right to bear arms...

1281
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:21,500
- Oh, okay.
- ...while we pick up coffee.

1282
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:25,738
- I got two macchiatos for Stephanie.
- Oh, that's me.

1283
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,940
- Stephanie. Hiya. And you are?
- Hey.

1284
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:29,408
I'm Rattlesnake.

1285
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:31,677
That's catchy.
Rattlesnake.

1286
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:33,712
- Sandman.
- That's a good one too.

1287
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,750
Hey, I was wondering...

1288
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,051
We don't know where we're going.
We don't know who these people are.

1289
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:41,654
Yes, we do.
He dropped me a pin.

1290
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,555
- Oh, he dropped you a pin.
- Yeah.

1291
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:46,058
- So we know... We're good now. That's it.
- JoJo.

1292
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:49,028
What do you want me to say? It's not
like we can have a yard sale, okay?

1293
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:52,031
And you just do what you do on your
sales calls, like you taught me.

1294
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:53,732
You make the customer
the hero.

1295
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:55,401
- The hero?
- Yeah.

1296
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:57,936
These guys could be KKK,
Aryan Brotherhood, anything.

1297
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,039
And you want me
to make them the heroes?

1298
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:04,076
I highly doubt that, okay?
Did you see what Rattlesnake ordered?

1299
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:06,779
A caramel macchiato
doesn't sound very KKK to me.

1300
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:10,315
Am I in any kind
of trouble here, or...

1301
01:11:11,116 --> 01:11:14,053
Well, it's kind of
up to you, Earl.

1302
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,088
You gonna dance
with the tiger?

1303
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,525
- You gonna play some ball?
- I'm sorry...

1304
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,661
I'm not quite sure who the tiger is that
someone would be dancing with, Earl.

1305
01:11:22,728 --> 01:11:24,530
- Are you?
- No, sir.

1306
01:11:24,596 --> 01:11:26,398
- It's about cooperation.
- Do you mind if I call you Earl?

1307
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:27,866
Oh, no. No problem.

1308
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:30,402
Earl, how long have you been
with the post office?

1309
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:33,539
- Oh, well, it's going on eleven years now.
- Eleven years.

1310
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:35,074
And have you had
the same route for most of it?

1311
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,942
Oh, yes, sir.
That's how I like it.

1312
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:40,045
Okay. And probably getting pretty
close to your pension here?

1313
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:41,680
Oh, you bet. Yes.

1314
01:11:41,747 --> 01:11:43,849
Who's the Earl, girl?

1315
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,655
- Who's the girl, Earl?
- Whoa, am I under arrest here?

1316
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,825
No, you're not under arrest.
God, that was loud. It scared me too.

1317
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,426
But we need some answers.

1318
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:57,396
The guy out there is
talking about coupon videos.

1319
01:11:57,463 --> 01:11:59,665
You seem to not know
a darn thing about it.

1320
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,468
That had nothing to...
I don't know what he was talking about.

1321
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:05,704
You might want to talk to Adam,
'cause I have no idea about any girl...

1322
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:07,840
- Adam. What's his last name?
- Phillips.

1323
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,842
Adam Phil... Two L's?

1324
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,744
You're not giving me
enough here!

1325
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,879
I think it's pretty clear that
Earl doesn't know anything.

1326
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:16,582
I think your coworker must have
got his signals crossed somehow.

1327
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:19,985
- Yes, sir.
- Unfortunately, there is one kind

1328
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:22,154
of uncomfortable question
pertaining to this.

1329
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:23,522
Yes, sir.

1330
01:12:25,057 --> 01:12:26,725
Have you ever danced
with a tiger?

1331
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:30,162
It was his joke.
It wasn't...

1332
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:32,898
- Tiger dance.
- What are you... Don't dance.

1333
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:34,933
Anyway, thank you so much.
I appreciate you.

1334
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,002
- Sure thing. No problem.
- Sorry about the confusion.

1335
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:39,338
- Oh, no. It's cool.
- Have a good time out there.

1336
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:46,879
The hell was that?
I had him on the ropes.

1337
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:48,947
Screaming at somebody doesn't
make 'em tell you the truth.

1338
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,450
He could've been sweating bullets.
I had him bent, man.

1339
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:53,786
Let's agree to disagree.
We're gonna go for a ride.

1340
01:13:04,496 --> 01:13:05,664
Hey, Earl!

1341
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,634
Oh, hey!

1342
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,736
There you go. Yeah.

1343
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,472
Uh, that top one right there for JoJo
is real, real important, Ms. Johnson.

1344
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,108
Oh, that girl
been up to something.

1345
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:18,777
You just gotta promise that she
get that letter, Ms. Johnson.

1346
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:21,847
Oh, yeah, yeah, you the mailman.
Now, I get how this shit works.

1347
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:28,887
Yeah,
I don't know about that interaction.

1348
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:31,156
And now
he's just standing there.

1349
01:13:31,223 --> 01:13:35,127
The DMV database lists
two names at 1579 Clayton.

1350
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:37,830
Josephine Johnson,
60 years of age,

1351
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:40,566
and Joanna Johnson,
33 years of age.

1352
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:42,134
Joanna Johnson.

1353
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:44,970
The fuck's that sound?

1354
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,241
It's 120 degrees.
Car's overheating, and the fan's dying.

1355
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:53,679
Go ahead. Roll down your windows,
and, uh, I gotta kill the engine here.

1356
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:56,081
That's no good.

1357
01:13:57,616 --> 01:13:59,751
Ooh. Okay.

1358
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:06,191
Joanna Johnson.
Joanna John... JJ. Jo...

1359
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:08,894
Oh! JoJo?

1360
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:12,664
We must be crazy. Oh, my God.
I don't have any cell service. Do you?

1361
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:16,902
Will you relax? I promise I will
not let anything happen to you.

1362
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:19,104
You can't promise that.

1363
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:21,573
You have no idea what
you're asking me to do here.

1364
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,841
I understand.

1365
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:24,877
No, you do not understand.

1366
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:30,115
- All right.
- What the fuck is this?

1367
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:32,117
Okay.

1368
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:34,720
Wait.
Is that a helicopter? What?

1369
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:36,755
Talk about a stockpile. Yikes.

1370
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,523
Oh, my God.
Is that a missile?

1371
01:14:39,157 --> 01:14:41,560
Okay.

1372
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:43,228
- We got it.
- All right. Oh, you're gonna get...

1373
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:45,097
Gentlemen.
Thank you. Whoop.

1374
01:14:45,764 --> 01:14:46,932
Oh, sure.

1375
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:51,236
This is Captain Pain.

1376
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:53,739
These are the guns
I was telling you about.

1377
01:14:53,805 --> 01:14:56,174
Captain Pain. Connie.

1378
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:59,144
Stephanie Kaminski.
Nice to m... meet you.

1379
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:01,546
This is a cool place
you guys have.

1380
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:08,020
- What the fuck is this?
- All right, boys.

1381
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,689
I think you guys love guns as
much as I love guns, right?

1382
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,293
So, uh, like we told
your friend Rattlesnake,

1383
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:16,762
we just happen to have
a surplus in our stockpile.

1384
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,330
- One too many.
- Personal favorite.

1385
01:15:18,397 --> 01:15:20,632
This here is the KelTec
pump-action shotgun.

1386
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:22,334
- Easy, easy.
- It's cool.

1387
01:15:22,401 --> 01:15:24,903
It's not loaded. You can ch...
Connie, just show 'em.

1388
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:27,906
Easy to handle, quickest reload
on the market. You know, even...

1389
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:30,309
Do you wanna take
a look at that, Sandman?

1390
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:35,047
- So hot. I'm gonna faint.
- I just found it. It's, uh...

1391
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:37,082
She says, and I quote,

1392
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:42,187
"A friend sent a video of an
African-American woman going on and on."

1393
01:15:42,254 --> 01:15:46,258
That woman
was in a coupon video.

1394
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:49,695
- And all things being equal...
- Uh, the... Don't say it.

1395
01:15:49,761 --> 01:15:53,065
"The simplest explanation tends
to be the right one." Yeah.

1396
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,734
- So, where are you, JoJo?
- Where are you, JoJo?

1397
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:08,113
No deal.

1398
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,349
- All right. Let's wrap it up. Let's go.
- Wait, wait.

1399
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:13,018
No. It's just... We thought
the money was dirty, so w...

1400
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:14,753
What did you say?

1401
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,288
- Whose money's dirty? Our money's dirty?
- Wait!

1402
01:16:16,355 --> 01:16:18,790
- We thought our money...
- What did you just say?

1403
01:16:18,857 --> 01:16:21,893
Don't even... What she meant was,
we came into a bunch of fucking money.

1404
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,096
It doesn't matter how.

1405
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,131
We thought it was dirty.
It was not.

1406
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:28,333
We bought all these guns,
and now we have to off-load them.

1407
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,068
That's it.

1408
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,006
And we'll give you
a really good discount.

1409
01:16:34,072 --> 01:16:35,707
What kind of discount?

1410
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,879
- Eleven hundred each? Seventy thousand?
- That's retail.

1411
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:42,381
- That is not retail!
- Get outta here, dude.

1412
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:43,782
Fifty.

1413
01:16:44,316 --> 01:16:46,818
- Sixty-five.
- Sixty.

1414
01:16:46,885 --> 01:16:49,321
Sixty-five.
It's a good deal.

1415
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,796
Okay. You got a deal.

1416
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:00,198
We'll take 'em all.

1417
01:17:11,777 --> 01:17:13,278
Don't do that. Ken.

1418
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:14,980
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do that.

1419
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:17,115
Don't do that.

1420
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:22,921
Yo, heads up. Heads up.

1421
01:17:23,455 --> 01:17:25,057
Okay.

1422
01:17:25,123 --> 01:17:27,325
Is that her? Is that J...
That's JoJo?

1423
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,428
Yeah. Well,
she pulled in the right driveway.

1424
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:31,963
Well, we'll see
in a minute here.

1425
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:38,170
<i>JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

1426
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:42,207
<i>JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

1427
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:44,042
<i>JoJo! Jo...</i>

1428
01:17:44,109 --> 01:17:46,912
<i>Okay. You got a deal.</i>

1429
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:03,762
What the hell is she doing?

1430
01:18:15,006 --> 01:18:18,143
<i>Happiness is
when what you think, say and do...</i>

1431
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:21,213
Think that's Joanna Johnson?

1432
01:18:25,183 --> 01:18:27,018
That's JoJo.

1433
01:18:27,085 --> 01:18:28,987
Now we just gotta see
who she's working with.

1434
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:39,865
Wow.
That was quite a show.

1435
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:45,871
Yeah. The hell?
So, okay, now what?

1436
01:18:45,937 --> 01:18:49,274
Now. Now we wait.

1437
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:50,742
Wait?

1438
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,210
Isn't that what we been doing
all damn day?

1439
01:18:52,277 --> 01:18:56,314
Why don't we just go on her front
lawn, knock on the door and arrest her?

1440
01:18:56,381 --> 01:18:59,251
Arrest her?
Arrest her for what?

1441
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:02,787
For putting on a damn show
in her driveway?

1442
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:05,257
You know, Ken, you actually
do have to collect evidence.

1443
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,926
Okay, well, if we're gonna
be here all dang night,

1444
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,163
then I'm just gonna pull
my trousers up.

1445
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:17,869
What's that noise?

1446
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,404
That noise.

1447
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:22,841
That's the...
Oh, God.

1448
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:24,943
Geez. Are you regular?

1449
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,411
Huh?

1450
01:19:26,478 --> 01:19:29,581
Every morning, I shit like clockwork.

1451
01:19:29,648 --> 01:19:32,150
So what is that,
some kind of a shit alarm?

1452
01:19:32,217 --> 01:19:34,052
- No...
- What's with the chimes?

1453
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:37,088
Yeah, well, the chimes are soothing.
They set things in motion.

1454
01:19:37,155 --> 01:19:39,157
I'm just trying to find
out what's going on.

1455
01:19:39,224 --> 01:19:41,459
- Ma, it's none of your business.
- No, hey, hey!

1456
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,829
I'm not one of
your little friends... Ow.

1457
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:48,099
Oh. Every time
I yell at you, it hurts.

1458
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:51,836
I call it my JoJo pain.

1459
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:53,171
Ma.

1460
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:54,606
I'm sorry. Okay, Mama?
Come here.

1461
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:57,108
- Oh!
- My mama.

1462
01:19:57,175 --> 01:19:59,244
- I'm sorry. I'm just working hard, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1463
01:19:59,311 --> 01:20:02,847
How you think I'm able to buy all this
new stuff and pay all these bills?

1464
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:04,950
Another stack of them bills
shown up here yesterday.

1465
01:20:05,016 --> 01:20:06,618
Okay. I'm gonna
take care of it later.

1466
01:20:06,685 --> 01:20:08,520
- Love you, Ma. See you later, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1467
01:20:09,588 --> 01:20:11,590
Don't come in here late!

1468
01:20:14,593 --> 01:20:16,561
Hold up.
Target's on the move.

1469
01:20:16,628 --> 01:20:20,165
- Eyes open. Just stay alert here.
- All right.

1470
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,033
Okay.

1471
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,570
Hold it together, Ken.
This is your white whale.

1472
01:20:43,521 --> 01:20:45,023
You ever hear of Mr. Zip?

1473
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,424
No, I haven't
heard of that guy.

1474
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:47,926
- Robert A. Moon.
- Mmm.

1475
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:53,231
<i>You don't get to the
top of Mount Everest by following...</i>

1476
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,402
He's the genius
behind the zip code.

1477
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:00,305
<i>The journey is the destina...</i>

1478
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:10,248
We'll turn around
up here and circle back.

1479
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:12,617
Yeah, I'm just saying
it's not good to hold it in.

1480
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,002
- Oh, God.
- Hang on.

1481
01:21:31,069 --> 01:21:33,104
Where'd the minivan come from?

1482
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:36,941
I don't wanna
startle you, Simon,

1483
01:21:37,008 --> 01:21:38,677
but, uh, you should know

1484
01:21:38,743 --> 01:21:43,248
that I'm prepared to take
this thing the whole way.

1485
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,117
What?

1486
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:49,254
What are you saying?

1487
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,490
I'm gonna shit my pants,
but that's okay.

1488
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:55,493
No. Actually, Ken,
that's not okay.

1489
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,097
Okay? There's not a world that
exists where that would be okay.

1490
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,734
Well, in this world
it does exist. This is real.

1491
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,270
You gotta embrace it 'cause I'm
not getting out of this vehicle.

1492
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,571
Ken.

1493
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:08,273
Ken.

1494
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,076
You don't shit...
You don't shit in the car.

1495
01:22:11,142 --> 01:22:14,346
Okay, I'm gonna do a bank run.
I'll be back in a jiff.

1496
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:16,247
Perfect.

1497
01:22:16,314 --> 01:22:19,718
All men are forced to make
difficult decisions. This is mine.

1498
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:22,454
We're too close,
and I have come too far.

1499
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,189
I hear everything
you're saying.

1500
01:22:25,056 --> 01:22:26,658
You don't shit
in the car, Ken.

1501
01:22:26,725 --> 01:22:28,593
You don't shit
in the car.

1502
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:31,262
It's a rental. You pay a cleaning fee.
Everybody moves on.

1503
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:33,131
Yeah, it's a rental
that I rented.

1504
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,467
Most people wouldn't even
tell me that they had to shit.

1505
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:38,002
They just would make up an excuse
and they'd get out of the car, okay?

1506
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:39,204
You're a grown man, Ken.

1507
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,005
Go walk to the restroom.

1508
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:42,774
Go shit
in the fucking brush.

1509
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:45,310
I really don't care.
Just figure it out and go and take a...

1510
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,445
Holy shit.

1511
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:49,447
Late 30s.

1512
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:54,085
Slim build, 5'1".
Seems cheerful enough.

1513
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:56,588
My white whale.

1514
01:22:57,789 --> 01:22:59,257
Ah. There she blows.

1515
01:22:59,324 --> 01:23:03,328
Jesus Christ!

1516
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,463
Fucking animal.

1517
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:07,465
Are you serious?

1518
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:10,268
Are you fucking crazy?

1519
01:23:10,335 --> 01:23:14,038
Jesus Christ! You can't
just take a shit in a car.

1520
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:16,541
I know. I'm sorry.

1521
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,043
To be fair, this is like
my beach in Normandy...

1522
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:21,713
No, it's not. This isn't heroic.
This is bad stomach management.

1523
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,315
Your ass smells like a fucking
outhouse at a carnival.

1524
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,084
Go wipe your ass
like a puppy on the grass.

1525
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:27,519
Get that fucking ass
out of here.

1526
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,054
I don't wanna get it
on the seat,

1527
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:32,690
so I'm gonna sit up like this,
or something.

1528
01:23:34,726 --> 01:23:36,261
Well, we got her.

1529
01:23:39,697 --> 01:23:42,200
A silver 2010 Dodge Caravan.

1530
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:46,404
Now, that is registered
to Connie Kaminski,

1531
01:23:46,471 --> 01:23:48,640
born Connie Stevens
of Olathe, Kansas,

1532
01:23:48,706 --> 01:23:53,344
uh, both parents deceased,
and get this, former Olympian.

1533
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:56,247
- Olympian? What event?
- Racewalking.

1534
01:23:56,314 --> 01:24:00,151
That's not real. Did you
say racewalking? That's a real thing?

1535
01:24:00,218 --> 01:24:03,755
It's a largely ignored
but often ridiculed event,

1536
01:24:03,822 --> 01:24:05,557
kinda like couponing.

1537
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,593
Why are you wearing
pajama pants?

1538
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:12,730
- I took one for the team. Yeah.
- He had an accident.

1539
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,467
Nothing wrong
with a little elasticity.

1540
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:17,735
Except in
a professional environment.

1541
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,405
- I wish I was dressed different.
- Moving on.

1542
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,541
Now, cashier Greg Garcia
corroborated.

1543
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:28,313
Ooh! That's her.
That giant fucking smile.

1544
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,150
I think
I got something here.

1545
01:24:32,217 --> 01:24:36,354
It's an invoice.
A lease on an airplane hangar.

1546
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:38,556
An airplane hangar?

1547
01:24:38,623 --> 01:24:41,259
What the hell are they doing
with an airplane hangar?

1548
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:44,629
Let's go, boys! Gear up.

1549
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:46,831
I think
I owe you an apology.

1550
01:24:46,898 --> 01:24:49,701
You guys are like the FBI.

1551
01:24:49,767 --> 01:24:52,837
Negative.
FBI's like us.

1552
01:24:52,904 --> 01:24:55,707
Don't fuck with the post office.

1553
01:24:55,773 --> 01:24:58,476
Uh, you know,
careful out there.

1554
01:24:58,543 --> 01:25:00,879
Good luck, you know.
Do your thing.

1555
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,817
Wanna do a ride-along?

1556
01:25:08,486 --> 01:25:10,355
You messing with me?

1557
01:25:10,822 --> 01:25:12,490
That's a 10-4.

1558
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:17,228
Just stay out of the way
and listen.

1559
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,622
So what are we dealing with?

1560
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:47,659
Drug runners?
Arms dealers?

1561
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,928
It's coupons.

1562
01:25:52,297 --> 01:25:54,299
Come again?

1563
01:25:54,365 --> 01:25:59,270
It's coupons.
It's two women counterfeiting coupons.

1564
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:04,842
I mean,
this feels like a lot.

1565
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,879
You don't think we're coming
in a little hot here, boss?

1566
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:10,615
- Boss.
- All right, gentlemen. Lock and load!

1567
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:20,792
Good Lord have mercy, Jesus.

1568
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:23,394
My own child
fixing to suffocate me.

1569
01:26:23,461 --> 01:26:25,430
Ma. Oh, my gosh.

1570
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:27,932
- Help me with this thing.
- Okay, okay.

1571
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:30,668
Ma, I'm not trying to suffocate you.

1572
01:26:30,735 --> 01:26:32,637
I thought you stopped
breathing or something.

1573
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,906
- I was trying to save your ass.
- Mm-hmm.

1574
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:39,377
Ma, I can't sleep. I don't know.
I'm just anxious. I...

1575
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,279
I fear something bad
must have happened.

1576
01:26:41,346 --> 01:26:42,880
- Ken.
- Yes, sir.

1577
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,983
- Do not go near that house.
- No, sir.

1578
01:26:45,049 --> 01:26:46,718
I want you
staying by the vehicles.

1579
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,319
I will fall back, sir.

1580
01:26:48,386 --> 01:26:50,555
- You are not in the military, Ken.
- Yes, sir.

1581
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,957
Do not get
caught up in this moment.

1582
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,601
Mmm.

1583
01:27:04,936 --> 01:27:06,871
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

1584
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:12,877
Hmm.

01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:33,831
Connie Kaminski. You're under arrest.

1591

Show me your hands! Show 'em!

1592
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:39,437
Keep 'em up. Don't move.

1593
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:43,408
Freeze! Freeze!

1594
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:44,842
What the hell
is going on here?

1595
01:27:44,909 --> 01:27:46,611
Okay. Oh, my God. Okay.

1596
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,380
Okay. This is Joanna Johnson.
The po-po got in my house...

1597
01:27:49,447 --> 01:27:51,449
- Stop!
- Joanna Johnson! We have a warrant!

1598
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:55,086
- Girl, I knew you was up to something.
- Ma, don't say anything. Ma!

1599
01:27:55,153 --> 01:27:58,856
In all my life I never had no
police up in my house like this.

1600
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:49,040
Move! Go, go, go!

1601
01:28:49,107 --> 01:28:51,609
- With me! Move, move, move!
- Stairs clear!

1602
01:28:57,715 --> 01:29:00,151
This is a fuck ton
of coupons, sir.

1603
01:29:00,218 --> 01:29:02,987
Look, baby diapers.

1604
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:04,856
Could use these. Just had one.

1605
01:29:14,165 --> 01:29:16,868
- I got the computer.
- Sir, what about this room full of food?

1606
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,170
What about it?
It's food. Leave it.

01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,433
Look, let's get down
to brass tacks.

1615
01:29:50,268 --> 01:29:53,871
What do I get
if I turn state's evidence?

1616
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:56,841
You really want me to believe you
don't have anything to do with this?

1617
01:29:56,908 --> 01:30:01,112
All you've told me is my wife's been
arrested for something involving coupons.

1618
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,014
What, she used
an expired coupon?

1619
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,751
Well, your wife ran
an intricate financial scam

1620
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,453
involving
over 240 companies,

1621
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,089
costing them tens of millions of
dollars, right under your nose.

1622
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:15,726
And you're an auditor for
the Internal Revenue Service.

1623
01:30:17,862 --> 01:30:19,664
We have

I'm sorry,
what did you say the site was?

1625
01:30:21,599 --> 01:30:25,102
It's Savvy Shopper
or some...

1626
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:28,739
No, it doesn't...
It does not ring a bell. I'm sorry.

1627
01:30:28,806 --> 01:30:31,576

Have you ever heard the term,
"Savvy Super Saver"?

1634
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:55,066
- Well, quite obviously, yes.
- Okay.

1635

What? Really?

1637
01:31:01,973 --> 01:31:05,276

woman more than I do, so yeah.

1638

Okay.

1639
01:31:25,329 --> 01:31:26,864
Connie, this is Ken Miller.

1640
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:28,866
This is the, uh,
loss prevention officer

1641
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:32,003
that was pivotal
in tracking you down.

1642
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:35,873
- For starters, let's talk coupons.
- Okay.

1643
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,277
What do you wanna know?

1644
01:31:39,343 --> 01:31:42,280
I mean, most people
undervalue coupons.

1645
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:45,082
I don't undervalue coupons.

1646
01:31:45,816 --> 01:31:48,886
No. I guess you don't.

1647
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:51,155
I suppose that's why I'm here.

1648
01:31:51,222 --> 01:31:53,024
But, you know, most people do.

1649
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:57,295
Well, here's what I think.
I think you preyed on people.

1650
01:31:57,361 --> 01:32:02,667
I think nobody understands better than
you that people use coupons to save money

1651
01:32:02,733 --> 01:32:05,803
or to buy things that they need,
and I think you took advantage of that.

1652
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:08,039
No. No, you're wrong.

1653
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:09,774
Tell me how I'm wrong.

1654
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,642
- That's not really why...
- That's not what...

1655
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:14,211
That's not really why people
use coupons.

1656
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:18,916
It's not about what you buy.
It's about the, uh... the feeling you get.

1657
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:20,952
They've done studies.

1658
01:32:21,018 --> 01:32:23,788
When folks use coupons,
their oxytocin levels,

1659
01:32:23,854 --> 01:32:27,325
they kinda spike and they get
that little tingly sensation.

1660
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:29,894
They call it
the "coupon high."

1661
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,832
Supposedly, it's better than intimacy
with another person, or so I've been told.

1662
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:39,370
Sorry, I... I'm unclear.
Did you...

1663
01:32:39,437 --> 01:32:42,139
Have you not used a coupon
or have you not had sex?

1664
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,109
T... What happened?

1665
01:32:45,176 --> 01:32:49,613
No, that's... Oh, no.
This is not about me. This is about you.

1666
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:53,050
You... you had...
You had a good life, Connie.

1667
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:56,087
You had the nice house
and loving husband.

1668
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,389
Wha... Why... Why would you risk
losing all of that?

1669
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,396
I knew I was worth more.

1670
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:07,131
And what do you know
about my life?

1671
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:09,400
Just 'cause you've watched me
from a distance

1672
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:11,702
does not mean
you really know me.

1673
01:33:12,737 --> 01:33:15,706
You happy with the life
that you're living?

1674
01:33:15,773 --> 01:33:18,809
Haven't you ever wanted just
a little bit more out of life?

1675
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:23,848
Maybe we just value
different things.

1676
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:28,052
Well, I'll tell you what I value, Connie.
I value the law.

1677
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:30,654
Just because you want
a little more out of life

1678
01:33:30,721 --> 01:33:33,124
does not give you an excuse
to break those laws.

1679
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,960
Now, it is not my job
to judge you.

1680
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,062
And you seem
like a nice enough lady.

1681
01:33:38,129 --> 01:33:40,231
But I want to make sure
that you are grasping

1682
01:33:40,297 --> 01:33:43,000
the gravity of the situation
that you're in.

1683
01:33:43,067 --> 01:33:47,104
It is one year
for every $100,000 of fraud.

1684
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:50,674
So, with what you've stolen,
your sentencing is off the charts.

1685
01:33:50,741 --> 01:33:53,811
You are facing
40 years to life.

1686
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:55,813
What?

1687
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,217
- Uh...
- Thank you.

1688
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:09,460
You should, uh, probably get
yourself a really good lawyer.

1689
01:34:09,527 --> 01:34:13,230
And if I were you, I would
pay full price for this one.

1690
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:25,709
<i>They said 40 years to life.</i>

1691
01:34:26,844 --> 01:34:28,813
Forty years to life?

1692
01:34:28,879 --> 01:34:32,917
But they said that if I took full
responsibility for starting all of it,

1693
01:34:32,983 --> 01:34:34,218
they would go easy on you.

1694
01:34:34,285 --> 01:34:36,120
No, Connie.
What about you?

1695
01:34:36,187 --> 01:34:38,856
I'm up a creek either way.
It doesn't...

1696
01:34:40,124 --> 01:34:41,926
I did rope you into it,

1697
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:45,262
and if I can make it easier
on you, then...

1698
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:47,798
Can you believe they are
calling what we did fraud?

1699
01:34:47,865 --> 01:34:49,500
I know, that's so stup...

1700
01:34:49,567 --> 01:34:51,735
- It's like, we didn't defraud anybody.
- No.

1701
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:55,473
- Now, theft... Maybe. A little.
- Maybe theft. Maybe.

1702
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:57,141
Joanna Johnson?

1703
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,476
That's me. Hi.

1704
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:00,277
You made bail.
Let's go.

1705
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,348
Mama Josie.

1706
01:35:09,587 --> 01:35:11,722
- Connie Kaminski?
- Ooh! That's me!

1707
01:35:13,891 --> 01:35:16,160
- I made bail too?
- No. You got a visitor.

1708
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:21,832
What the fuck, Connie?

1709
01:35:23,434 --> 01:35:25,503
I told you
that I stopped using coupons.

1710
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:28,539
I just didn't tell you
that I started selling them.

1711
01:35:28,606 --> 01:35:30,274
Look, it's a good job.

1712
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:31,976
It's not a job!

1713
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,411
Would you...
Would you just bail me out?

1714
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:36,514
Oh, you don't have
a coupon for that?

1715
01:35:40,017 --> 01:35:42,086
Rick, next time
you walk into a room

1716
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,321
and you think everyone there
is sorry to see you,

1717
01:35:44,388 --> 01:35:46,257
just know it's not 'cause
you're an auditor.

1718
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:48,392
It's 'cause you're an asshole.

1719
01:35:49,426 --> 01:35:51,328
I'd like a divorce.

1720
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:13,517
Earl?

1721
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:16,187
- Hey!
- Hey.

1722
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:18,455
- These are for you.
- I... Oh, thank you.

1723
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,524
I thought you
were my mama, so...

1724
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:23,928
Yeah, well, I think your mama's
cooperating with the authorities.

1725
01:36:24,595 --> 01:36:26,997
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

1726
01:36:27,064 --> 01:36:30,067
- Well, thank you. This is nice.
- You're welcome.

1727
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:32,536
How you doing?

1728
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:36,407
- Um... I'm doing. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1729
01:36:36,473 --> 01:36:38,042
Better days.

1730
01:36:38,108 --> 01:36:39,610
Just got the official tally.

1731
01:36:39,677 --> 01:36:43,180
Over 40 million dollars' worth
of counterfeit coupons.

1732
01:36:43,247 --> 01:36:45,216
We traced it back
to a facility in Mexico,

1733
01:36:45,282 --> 01:36:47,618
a US company
called Advanced Solutions.

1734
01:36:47,685 --> 01:36:50,087
It's the same place that makes
the real coupons, yeah.

1735
01:36:50,154 --> 01:36:52,189
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Used to be up in Michigan.

1736
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:55,960
Moved down to Mexico to save some money.
They got a factory overseas too.

1737
01:36:56,026 --> 01:36:57,628
We know who their
Mexican counterparts were?

1738
01:36:57,695 --> 01:37:00,431
Uh, yeah.
Advanced Solutions employees

1739
01:37:00,497 --> 01:37:03,200
Alejandro and Rosa Diaz,
husband and wife.

1740
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:06,637
<i>One of Kaminski's
aliases would wire money orders</i>

1741
01:37:06,704 --> 01:37:10,541
<i>totaling well over a million
dollars, and that's a lot of pesos.</i>

1742
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:12,376
Mexican government
gonna pursue 'em?

1743
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:14,245
Nope.
Trail's gone cold.

1744
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:16,981
Uh, when news of the arrests
broke, these two disappeared.

1745
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:19,883
They're probably sitting on a
beach somewhere drinking mai tais.

1746
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:22,987
<i>My lawyer,
this super expensive fella,</i>

1747
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:25,155
<i>sure had an interesting way
of looking at things.</i>

1748
01:37:25,222 --> 01:37:27,992
All you did was take
advantage of a loophole.

1749
01:37:28,058 --> 01:37:31,428
These corporations you're accused of
exploiting use loopholes all the time

1750
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:33,197
and take advantage
of a broken system.

1751
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,132
<i>He always liked to say...</i>

1752
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,002
Just because someone says
something, doesn't make it true.

1753
01:37:38,068 --> 01:37:40,170
<i>The funny thing is,
whenever he said it,</i>

1754
01:37:40,237 --> 01:37:42,406
<i>most everyone
took it to be fact.</i>

1755
01:37:42,473 --> 01:37:47,911
My client is just following the
lead of a successful corporation.

1756
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:50,247
Will the defendants
please rise?

1757
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:56,053
Through all this,
I've learned more about coupons

1758
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,256
and America's shopping habits
than I ever cared to know.

1759
01:37:59,323 --> 01:38:04,628
The court has considered the nature
and circumstances of the offense

1760
01:38:04,695 --> 01:38:09,500
in arriving at a sentence for Ms.
Johnson and Mrs. Kaminski.

1761
01:38:11,235 --> 01:38:14,071
The court sentences
the defendant Joanna Johnson

1762
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:19,043
to ten days in jail suspended
and one-year probation.

1763
01:38:20,444 --> 01:38:23,347
As for the defendant,
Connie Kaminski,

1764
01:38:23,414 --> 01:38:27,418
she will be incarcerated in the
Arizona Department of Corrections

1765
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:32,690
for a term of 11 months,
with the possibility of parole.

1766
01:38:32,756 --> 01:38:34,725
That's all.

1767
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:36,026
Oh, my G...

1768
01:38:36,627 --> 01:38:38,128
Well, lookee there.

1769
01:38:38,195 --> 01:38:40,964
First time in history
a Black woman gets off

1770
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:43,734
and a white woman gets to do
some time.

1771
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:46,036
<i>That loss
prevention guy was right.</i>

1772
01:38:46,103 --> 01:38:47,738
<i>You get what you pay for.</i>

1773
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:49,573
<i>Not 40 years to life. Just...</i>

1774
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,142
Eleven fucking months!

1775
01:38:52,209 --> 01:38:55,245
All right. Look,
you didn't hear this from me,

1776
01:38:55,312 --> 01:38:59,416
but we may have received multiple
phone calls from numerous corporations,

1777
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:02,086
saying, you know, uh,
"We don't want our logo on the news.

1778
01:39:02,152 --> 01:39:04,021
- Our shareholders... Keep it quiet."
- Oh, God.

1779
01:39:04,088 --> 01:39:06,323
Bottom line, they just
want this to go away.

1780
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,559
The damage she's done, we're gonna
throw the rules out the window?

1781
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:12,329
They don't matter?
She cost P&G alone $80 million.

1782
01:39:12,396 --> 01:39:15,466
For P&G and for every other
company, this was just a write-off.

1783
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:18,068
And, uh, it'll probably be
eight with good behavior.

1784
01:39:18,135 --> 01:39:19,770
Oh, God.

1785
01:39:19,837 --> 01:39:22,740
Oh, my God.
I-I just... I don't get it.

1786
01:39:22,806 --> 01:39:26,310
So, uh, you're telling me that's it?
Move on, it's over?

1787
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:28,379
Well, that's all there is.
That's law enforcement.

1788
01:39:28,445 --> 01:39:31,782
You just do the best that you can, Ken.
You try to be fair.

1789
01:39:31,849 --> 01:39:35,652
You follow the law and if everything
goes well, you get to go home safe,

1790
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:39,256
and hopefully to someone
that you love.

1791
01:39:39,323 --> 01:39:41,358
Which reminds me,
I need to call my wife.

1792
01:39:42,192 --> 01:39:43,594
See you later.

1793
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:50,634
- Oh, one more thing.
- Wow.

1794
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:53,704
I almost forgot.

1795
01:39:59,643 --> 01:40:04,615
Dated December 3rd, 1918.

1796
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:09,453
"My dearest Leo,
when word arrived from Pastor Holbrook

1797
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,588
that your injuries
were not life-threatening,

1798
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:14,491
and that you were on your way
back home to us,

1799
01:40:14,558 --> 01:40:16,693
my heart leapt from my chest.

1800
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:22,433
Our little Irene could not decipher
my tears as those of pure joy.

1801
01:40:22,499 --> 01:40:26,603
My only hope now is that you receive
this letter before you depart,

1802
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:29,840
and that my words
will accompany you

1803
01:40:29,907 --> 01:40:31,809
on your arduous journey
back home.

1804
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:35,479
With grace,
faith and love. Mary."

1805
01:40:37,748 --> 01:40:39,082
This one's for you.

1806
01:40:39,516 --> 01:40:43,086
What? Really?

1807
01:40:43,153 --> 01:40:47,391
- Oh... Not the letter.
- You can't separate the letters.

1808
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,827
What good would the letters be
if they weren't together?

1809
01:40:49,893 --> 01:40:51,728
- Right.
- The letters are kind of archival.

1810
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:54,198
What I mean is that
this lesson is for you.

1811
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:57,301
The lesson's for you, Ken.

1812
01:40:57,935 --> 01:40:59,636
You're a good man.

1813
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:01,538
I enjoyed working
alongside you.

1814
01:41:03,707 --> 01:41:06,643
Don't go searching for too much.
You're pretty great the way you are.

1815
01:41:28,699 --> 01:41:31,335
Could you just make
an exception?

1816
01:41:34,304 --> 01:41:37,374
Uh, honor it.
Yeah. Give her a discount.

1817
01:41:38,442 --> 01:41:40,177
<i>You may be asking yourself,</i>

1818
01:41:40,244 --> 01:41:42,779
<i>"Who won and who lost
through all of this?"</i>

1819
01:41:44,448 --> 01:41:47,718
<i>And I guess that's
really for you to decide.</i>

1820
01:41:48,752 --> 01:41:50,420
Yes!

1821
01:41:52,222 --> 01:41:53,690
<i>Rick and I got a divorce.</i>

1822
01:41:53,757 --> 01:41:56,860
<i>So, yeah.
I guess I lost my husband.</i>

1823
01:41:56,927 --> 01:41:59,663
<i>But not in the way
you lose something important,</i>

1824
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:02,399
<i>like your car keys or your cell
phone or something like that.</i>

1825
01:42:03,734 --> 01:42:06,436
- Please, take it all.
- I just wanna get rid of it.

1826
01:42:06,503 --> 01:42:08,438
Definitely don't need those.

1827
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:10,874
Ah, careful now. You don't know
what you need till it's gone.

1828
01:42:10,941 --> 01:42:13,410
Sage advice. You get that
from your parole officer?

1829
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:17,447
<i>And after paying
the fancy lawyer,</i>

1830
01:42:17,514 --> 01:42:21,385
<i>we still have
a little money left over.</i>

1831
01:42:21,451 --> 01:42:25,722
<i>As for JoJo, she finally figured
out exactly what Earl was thinking.</i>

1832
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:31,662
<i>Have you ever been
to Montenegro?</i>

1833
01:42:32,462 --> 01:42:33,497
We need that guy.

1834
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,265
Why that guy?

1835
01:42:35,332 --> 01:42:37,200
'Cause he's
already bending the rules.

1836
01:42:37,267 --> 01:42:40,671
<i>JoJo says I'm gonna love it
when I get there.</i>

1837
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:43,640
<i>In fact, she's already found
the perfect spot</i>

1838
01:42:43,707 --> 01:42:46,710
<i>for our new
and improved business.</i>

1839
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:55,485
<i>Oh, and did you know Montenegro
has no extradition to the US?</i>

1840
01:42:58,922 --> 01:43:02,292
<i>If you ever find yourself
doing a stretch in the slammer,</i>

1841
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:04,728
<i>you should still try to make
every day count.</i>

1842
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,935
<i>Especially your last day.</i>

1843
01:43:20,344 --> 01:43:22,613
<i>Sometimes you look back
and you think,</i>

1844
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:26,683
<i>"Well, if that didn't happen and that
didn't happen and that didn't happen,</i>

1845
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,885
<i>I wouldn't be who I am today."</i>

1846
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,926
Betcha I can walk a mile
faster than you can run one.

1847
01:43:44,568 --> 01:43:46,770
<i>And it turns out,</i>

1848
01:43:46,837 --> 01:43:48,872
<i>it really doesn't matter how
you get to the finish line.</i>

1849
01:43:48,939 --> 01:43:51,508
<i>Just as long as you get there.</i>

1850
01:44:22,487 --> 01:44:27,487
