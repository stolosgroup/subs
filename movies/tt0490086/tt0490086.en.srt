00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,725
[man] Think about it.
Right on the beach,

3
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,393
ocean breezes, blue skies, seagulls.

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:26,063
- All yours for the taking.
- [woman] It's a timeshare.

5
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,354
[man] Well, it's called a timeshare,

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,613
but the truth is,
for the two weeks you're at the condo,

7
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,442
you're not sharing anything.

8
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,236
You're not sharing the bathroom,
not sharing the toaster, nothing.

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,655
<i>Nada.</i> Zip.

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,079
You are the mistress of all you survey.
[chuckles]

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,123
My nephew looked up the neighbourhood
on the computer.

12
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,419
Your nephew?

13
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,293
Mrs. Darby.

14
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,089
He said the condo was
in a bad neighbourhood.

15
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,512
[whispers] Blacks.

16
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,643
You're right. You're right.

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,234
The condo is in a rather
poor majority black neighbourhood.

18
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,691
And you know what?
I'm glad you brought it up.

19
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,741
Seriously.

20
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:23,739
Otherwise, I might have done something
that I'd be ashamed of later.

21
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:28,542
And that would be
to sell you that timeshare.

22
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:31,962
- You would not feel safe there.
- No, I wouldn't.

23
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:36,794
Of course you wouldn't.
How could you?

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,630
We all know,

25
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:43,266
and I say this at the risk
of sounding a little racist,

26
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:47,682
black dudes love white women.

27
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,806
Love 'em. I don't know
if it's genetic or if it's society.

28
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:55,817
We can argue nature versus nurture
all day, but it's a scientific fact

29
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:59,689
that black men can't get enough
of white women.

30
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:03,201
Don't think a woman of your age
would be safe from their advances.

31
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:04,913
No, ma'am.

32
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,497
These big black bucks
don't care whether you're young or old,

33
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:09,996
skinny or fat,

34
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,630
walking or with two wrinkled stumps
right below the knees.

35
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,666
They want your white flesh.
They want it bad.

36
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:22,925
Truth be told, I'm part black myself.

37
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,384
And if it wasn't for my wife,
I'd be bending you over the desk

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,304
doing you doggy-style right now.

39
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:34,517
I can just imagine you there,
all alone in that big condo,

40
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:38,228
awash in a sea of Negro cock.

41
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:40,314
I'll... I'll take it.

42
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:43,492
Smart move. Sign your Jane Hancock
on the dotted line.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,578
- You can't go in there.
- Here you go.

44
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:49,072
- Stan Minton.
- I'll be with you in a second.

45
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,280
Go on. Sign it.

46
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,831
Stan Minton,
you're under arrest for fraud.

47
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,624
Anything you say will be
used against you in a court.

48
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:58,371
It's just a little mix-up.
Go on, sign it.

49
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,756
- You white Jezebel!
- [woman] I'll call Mal!

50
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,545
[Stan] You're gonna regret this!
Call my attorney!

51
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,645
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

52
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:13,848
- We have, Your Honour.
- Please hand it to the bailiff.

53
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:19,729
[judge] Will the defendant please rise?

54
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:22,193
Madam Foreman,
how do you find the defendant?

55
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:26,315
[woman] We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty.

56
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,991
- What?
- [judge] Thank you, Madam Foreman.

57
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,738
- That bitch!
- Stanley, please, quiet.

58
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,918
Sentencing will be tomorrow at 10am.

59
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:41,547
- What the fuck just happened in there?
- You lost, Stanley.

60
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:44,208
I didn't lose.
You're the lawyer, you lost.

61
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,047
I'm truly sorry.

62
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:48,677
Damn it, man! I'm rich!

63
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,806
I wanted some of that O.J. justice.

64
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,933
Maybe the judge will give probation.

65
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:56,638
No. In this state, first-degree fraud

66
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,389
carries a minimum
of three to five years.

67
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,395
I got it!

68
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,322
- We bribe the judge.
- I'm not gonna bribe the judge.

69
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,566
- Bribe him.
- I'm not gonna bribe him.

70
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,236
- Bribe him!
- Oh, please.

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,070
- Bribe him!
- No!

72
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,914
I don't practise that kind of law,
and I never will.

73
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,370
You wanna bribe the judge?
Be my guest.

74
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:19,955
I'm sure any shyster on the street
will be happy to do it for you.

75
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:33,048
[Stan] Mal? You're fired.

76
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:37,722
[judge] Mr. Popper,
is your client ready for sentencing?

77
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:40,056
He is, Your Honour.

78
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,851
[judge] Anything you'd like to say
before the court passes sentence?

79
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:47,860
Your Honour, my client
has been convicted

80
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,321
of fraud in the first degree.

81
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:53,909
A crime of which he is innocent.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,496
But even if he were guilty

83
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,418
and his customers were defrauded,

84
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:04,963
isn't it better that Mr. Minton,
as a resident of Los Angeles,

85
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,667
receive the money,
thereby keeping it in the community,

86
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:12,545
as opposed to some gypsies
or travelling Mexicans,

87
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:16,851
who would have taken the money
out of the community?

88
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,564
Please take that into consideration.

89
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,439
Mr. Minton, you are hereby sentenced to
serve a term of no less than three years

90
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:31,365
at the Verlaine State
Correctional Facility.

91
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,653
Normally, your sentence
would begin immediately.

92
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:39,656
However, I'm going to delay
your incarceration for six months

93
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,162
so that you may...
reorganise the charity

94
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:48,549
that you've established
to teach music to retarded children.

95
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,467
Thank you, judge.

96
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:55,878
Court is adjourned.

97
00:05:57,016 --> 00:06:01,061
- Teach music to retarded children?
- It sounded good at the time.

98
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,435
- I thought you were gonna bribe him.
- I did.

99
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:06,311
Hundred grand in Krugerrand
doesn't go too far now.

100
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,227
- Did we win?
- No. I don't get it.

101
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:10,525
You bribe the judge
and I get three years?

102
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,736
Mandatory.
The judge couldn't fix that.

103
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,480
Now you got six months
to set your affairs in order.

104
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,320
My affairs are already in order.

105
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:23,953
My legal opinion is that you take
a Brazilian vacation. Permanently.

106
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,415
Sounds like fun. [laughs]

107
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,165
I can't do that.

108
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,912
Those Krugerrands were the last
liquid asset I had.

109
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,214
The rest of my money
is frozen in the bank.

110
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:35,959
I'm not gonna run
and leave seven million behind.

111
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:39,174
Well, Stan,
my old man had a saying:

112
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,050
"You walk through a locker room,
you're gonna see some dick."

113
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:48,600
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you rip off enough people,

114
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,768
eventually you're gonna go to jail.

115
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,735
Thanks, that's really comforting.

116
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:57,365
Hey, I'm a crooked lawyer.
I know I'm going to jail someday.

117
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:00,903
You don't see me crying about it.
[laughs]

118
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:14,585
Stan, slow down. You're gonna choke.

119
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,128
I gotta eat now.
I hear that prison food is real crap.

120
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,423
I'm real glad we have six months
together before you have to go to...

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,474
- You know.
- Tell me about it.

122
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,977
I could be in jail right now.
Popper's one hell of a lawyer.

123
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,312
I'm gonna be awfully lonely
while you're gone.

124
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,613
I know, sweetheart.
But I think I get conjugal visits.

125
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:39,782
I can probably stick it to you
once a month or so. Pretty good.

126
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,990
Oh, sure, that's great.

127
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,869
- But I was thinking...
- Mm-hm.

128
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,280
...maybe we could do something now
so I wouldn't be so lonely later.

129
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,251
Like what?

130
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,998
Like maybe we could make a baby.

131
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,678
Mindy, are you crazy?

132
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,004
- I just...
- I'm gonna be gone three years.

133
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:06,432
Five at the max. What are we gonna do
with the kid when I get out?

134
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,594
Give it up for adoption?
That's cruel.

135
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,807
I thought maybe we could keep it.

136
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:14,105
Mindy, how many times
have we gone over this?

137
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,648
It's selfish to bring
a child into this world.

138
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,655
A world full of suffering
and hunger and war.

139
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:22,574
- It's just... selfish!
- I know.

140
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:25,529
Plus, a kid would totally
cramp our lifestyle.

141
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,748
We couldn't go on vacation when we
wanted, they break stuff, they cry.

142
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,454
You'd get stretch marks.

143
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:35,296
That's right. Stretch marks.

144
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:36,578
Scary stuff, huh?

145
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:39,959
[sobbing] I just let you
walk all over me.

146
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,420
- Oh, Mindy, come on.
- [sobbing]

147
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,885
OK, Mindy, you can get a dog.

148
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,974
After I leave!

149
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:51,052
Your other steak, sir.

150
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,067
[thunder rumbles]

151
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:17,619
[rock music playing]

152
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:25,337
- What do you want, doll?
- Put some Scotch in this.

153
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:31,015
- We got whiskey.
- Not as good, but it'll have to do.

154
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,052
All right. That'll be 75 cents.

155
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:37,811
Good deal.

156

Ah! Give me another one, honey.

No. No, I...

160

I was just wondering...
you've been to prison, right?

161
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,473
You do have a problem.

162

No, I... I'm going to prison.

163
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,140
But I've never been there before
and I was just thinking maybe

164
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,975
you could give me some pointers.

165
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:26,274
- I'll pay you 100 bucks.
- Just for talking?

166
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,610
- How much time did you get?
- Three to five.

167
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:34,157
- Where at?
- Verlaine.

168
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,371
Verlaine? That's fucked, Stan.
Guards just don't give a damn.

169
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:43,161
They let the cons beat the shit
out of one another all day.

170
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:44,880
How am I gonna do in there?

171
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:48,500
I mean, if you saw me,
would you beat the shit out of me?

172
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,470
I'd probably rape ya.

173
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:55,589
- You'd rape me?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,808
So it's true, huh?
A lot of guys turn gay in prison?

175
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,681
I'm always gay.
I only rape people in prison.

176
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:08,394
- You're gay?
- Yeah. This is a gay bar.

Whoo!

180
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:21,831
Look, rape isn't an act of sex.
Rape is an act of violence.

181
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,168
And in prison society,
it's all about violence.

182
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:27,663
You're judged by how bad
other cons fear you.

183
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,924
Raping a dude is the ultimate way
of beating him down.

184
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:33,169
It means you're one bad motherfucker.

185
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,465
So you rape people?

186
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,677
Well, now that's something
I'm not real proud of.

187
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:43,684
I don't condone the practise,
to be honest. But I do it some.

188
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:47,106
Just to keep up with the Joneses.
You know what I mean.

189
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:51,108
Little dude like you,
be an easy mark.

190
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,443
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't there anything I could do?

191
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:57,526
You could join a gang.

192
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,241
- Are you a racist?
- Not really.

193
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:02,655
That leaves out the Nazis.

194

- Got any Mob connections?
- No.

195

- Wouldn't happen to be Latino?
- Uh-uh.

196
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,049
Looks like everybody's gonna rape you.

197
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:16,256
OK. OK, I... I bet I can be a racist
for three to five years.

198
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:19,216
- A real racist. Hardcore.
- Well, good.

199
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,716
- Then you can join the Nazis.
- Excellent.

200
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:23,850
You'll only be raped by other Nazis.

201
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,685
Raped by Nazis? No way!

202

Anything else I can do?

203

Isn't there some way I can
cultivate some outlaw image?

- You have to kill a dude.
- Without killing a dude?

it'd be a real long shot, Stan.

Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
I didn't grow up with my mom. So I...

209
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:51,670
When I was 18, I got a tattoo.

No, I did not.
I had nothing growing up.

I had a drunk father
who was emotionally unavailable to me.

00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,068
You'll fight Seymour
for honour of green belt.

312
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,114
- Want me to fight this little guy?
- [growling]

313
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,744
- All right.
- Fighting stance!

314
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,242
All right, Seymour.
See what you got.

315
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,996
- [grunts]
- [grunts]

316
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,005
Ah! Ah!

317
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:16,667
Oof!

318
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:22,376
- [chuckling]
- [grunting]

319
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,760
- How do you like that, huh, Seymour?
- Stanley!

320
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,017
[grunts]

321
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:37,772
- Uh!
- You can forget about your refund!

322
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,653
[both grunt]

323
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:43,943
Is that all you got?

324
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,114
Ah!

325
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:56,122
Pussy.

326
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,385
[groaning]

327
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,767
That's some technique you got.

328
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:29,702
[cat yowls]

329
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:35,078
You couldn't knock a shit
out of a paper bag full of shit.

330
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,910
Oh, and you could do better?

331
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:56,185
Any questions?

332
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,774
- [Stan] Mindy!
- Dinner's almost ready!

333
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:05,021
- I got great news!
- What happened to you?

334
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,818
Never mind that.
I just met the best guy. Guess what?

335
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,277
- He's agreed to be my trainer.
- Really? What's his name?

336
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,443
The Master.

337
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,662
- How do you do...
- The Master.

338
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:22,378
He's gonna live with us and train me.

339
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,003
I have to pay him
when my accounts get unfrozen.

340
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:26,835
- Oh.
- [The Master] Ahem.

341
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,670
And the contract.

342
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,170
Yeah, I'll write it up right now.

343
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:41,063
I'm so sorry, The Master,
but there's no smoking in the house.

344
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:45,694
Yes, there is.

345
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:51,688
I better heat up another Lean Cuisine.

346
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:55,735
Honey, you've done it again.
You heated it just perfect.

347
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,912
[Mindy] So...

348
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,167
...The Master, where are you from?

349
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,163
Hell.

350
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:10,044
Oh! What brought you to LA? A job?

351
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:15,424
I travel where the wind takes me.

352
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,721
- Isn't he great?
- [laughs]

353
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:23,062
Well, how long have you been
teaching the art of self-defence?

354
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:29,773
Young lady,
what I teach is not art.

355
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,904
It is science.

356
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:37,115
A careful amalgam of the most
deadly parts of karate, kung fu,

357
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:41,783
Wing Chun, Krav Maga, Muay Thai,

358
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,908
savate and Filipino Kali.

359
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:47,332
My favourite.

360
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:50,079
Ooh! [laughs] Wow!

361
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,594
I find weakness

362
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,431
and turn it into strength.

363
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:59,598
I find fat and turn it into muscle.

364
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:04,476
I find blisters
and turn them into canker sores.

365
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:09,225
I find doubt
and I turn it into will.

366
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,643
You can stop doing that now.

367
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,193
- Doing what?
- Your hand.

368
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:19,698
Oh. I forgot it was there.

369
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,199
I'm gonna take a shit.

370
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:30,577
- Enjoy yourself.
- Mm.

371
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:36,172
Stan, honey,
does he really have to live here?

372
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:38,633
- The Master?
- He scares me.

373
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:42,673
I know. He scares me too. That's exactly
why he's the perfect guy to teach me.

374
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:45,556
- But, Stan...
- Look, want me to survive in prison?

375
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:48,896
- Of course I do.
- Then don't argue with me about this.

376
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:50,608
You'll see, he'll grow on you.

377
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,818
Wake up, weakling.

378
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:07,330
- [both scream]
- What the hell you doing in here?

379
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,834
It's time to begin your training.

380
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,292
- But it's five in the morning.
- [The Master growls]

381
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:16,382
- Is that liver?
- It's your breakfast.

382
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:21,793
And every moment you delay,
I squeeze out more of its vital juices.

383
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:24,298
Trust me, you'll need them later.

384
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:27,844
- OK, I'm up.
- [The Master] But are you ready?

385
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,690
Look what I found beside your bed.

386
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:34,106
This is weakness.

387
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:37,645
This is defeatism.

388
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:40,443
Actually, we were kind of enjoying that.

389
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:42,609
Eat this.

390
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:45,902
And follow me.

391
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:53,796
[The Master] Punch!
All right, now kick.

392
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:56,037
[The Master] Punch!
All right, now kick.

393
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:58,503
- Kick!
- [blender whirring]

394
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:00,926
Kick like you mean it!

395
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,047
[glass shatters]

396
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:06,756
- Oh!
- I blended that gross stuff you wanted.

397
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:10,598
I got it all in Koreatown. I didn't
even know there was a Koreatown.

398
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,597
[sniffing]

399
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:16,231
Too many eggs.

400
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,852
The fish oil is nice.
Ox pancreas is good.

401
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:24,074
- Next time, use more tongue.
- That's what she said.

402
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:25,985
- Ooh!
- Oh, Stan!

403
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,034
- I'm all right.
- Get away from him!

404
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:32,581
- I'm OK.
- Rise and drink your lunch.

405
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:38,915
[slurping]

406
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,380
Don't I get to eat anything
that tastes good?

407
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:50,630
- You like hot dogs?
- Yeah, sure.

408
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,135
If you don't drink that,

409
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,684
the boys in prison will feed you...

410
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,313
...many hot dogs.

411
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:11,952
I can kick your ass so fast
you wouldn't even feel it.

412
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:15,621
- I'd like to see that.
- [whooshing]

413
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,996
You didn't kick me in the ass.
I didn't feel anything.

414
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,962
[sighs]

415
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,001
[sniffs]

416
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,677
[Stan] Ow! Ow!

417
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,303
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

418
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:34,349
Ow! Ow! Ow!

419
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,978
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

420
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:38,637
- [The Master] Pain is interpretation.
- OK.

421
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:43,393
I'm gonna call a time-out here. You're
beating my husband with a flaming stick.

422
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,654
Isn't there some kind
of role-playing exercise you can do?

423
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:49,314
Run along, honey.
This is man stuff here.

424
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:51,235
Go ahead, Master.

425
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,652
Ow! Ow! Ow!

426
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,364
Ow! Ah! Oh!

427
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,665
Ow! Ah!

428
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,505
[grunting]

429
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:08,464
No disrespect, I realise this
is strengthening my nipples.

430
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:11,471
And believe me, I can feel the burn.

431
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:15,683
I was wondering,
just how important are strong nipples?

432
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,473
- Someday these nipples...
- Ah!

433
00:27:18,646 --> 00:27:21,516
...may save your life.
- Ah!

434
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:26,357
You are what you eat.

435
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:29,814
[Mindy] Um, are you sure
that's Eastern mysticism?

436
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,991
Because I learned that
in health class in third grade.

437
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,784
Silence, woman.

438
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,903
I mean, all that stuff about pain
and illusion sounds totally mystical.

439
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:42,368
But "you are what you eat"?
Even I know that. And I am from Omaha.

440
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,413
What part of Omaha?

441
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:50,212
- Oh!
- Dundee.

442
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,880
Happy Hollow.

443
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,383
You're Oscar?

444
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:58,130
I should have known.

445
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,141
Those womanly, childbearing hips

446
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:07,355
could not be a product
of this perfidious coast.

447
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,812
Uh, do you mind?
I'm trying to eat scorpion here.

448
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,111
Insolent fool!

449
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:16,487
- [Mindy screams]
- You have lost the right

450
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,199
to eat scorpion.

451
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,284
- [sighs]
- Great. There goes my lunch.

452
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:28,086
- Thanks.
- This is not working.

453
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:29,999
- Master says...
- Master's a jerk.

454
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:31,668
- Shh!
- He is!

455
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:36,421
And he is a creep. The house smells.
Does he have to smoke in every room?

456
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:40,429
The only time I see you alone is in bed
and you're too tired to...

457
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,970
Hey! I got five months, and then
it's prison. I gotta stay focused.

458
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:48,607
I gotta think, eat, breathe prison.
I don't have time for anything else.

459
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:51,776
Not even time for me?

460
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:54,152
[sighs]

461
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:55,651
Tell you what.

462
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:59,193
After I'm done working out
with The Master, I'll rent some movies,

463
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,738
and we'll cuddle around the TV
like old times, OK?

464
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,706
Really?

465
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,039
- Mindy!
- [gasps]

466
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:17,052
Some men broke into the house!
They wanna rape you!

467
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,426
- What?
- Big men!

468
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:22,717
- They wanna rape you! Repeatedly!

00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:51,363
Anybody caught pissing on that
will have his penis removed.

628
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,702
Sergeant Bullard will lead you
to the medical office where you'll strip

629
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,960
and have your cavities searched.
You're gonna enjoy that.

630
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:05,428
Now, gentlemen! Single file.
Come on! Get up there.

631
00:42:05,597 --> 00:42:06,628
Pecker to butt hole.

632
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:14,430
All right, assume the position.

633
00:42:20,153 --> 00:42:23,901
- [screams]
- Why you screaming like a little girl?!

634
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:27,110
Sarge, look.

635
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,076
Sweet Jesus!

636
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:36,041
It's like an alien
staring into my soul.

637
00:42:36,294 --> 00:42:37,954
[door buzzes]

638
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:42,541
Welcome home. New luxury condos,
compliments of the state.

639
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:44,425
Step it up, boys.

640
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:50,257
- [blues plays]
- [men shouting]

641
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:53,433
- Come on, sweet meat!
- [yelling]

642
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:06,320
Hello there, young fella.
I guess we're cellmates.

643
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:11,827
My name's Larry.
But you can call me Shorts.

644
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:14,533
Shorts, you're in my bunk.

645
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:18,620
- What?
- That's my bunk. Get out.

646
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:22,127
[laughing] You hold on there
just a second.

647
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:25,666
This is my bunk.
What gives you the right to...

648
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:27,420
Ow!

649
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:34,392
- I said that's my bunk.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

650
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,757
Whoo!

651
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,519
Uh, you might wanna change the sheets.

652
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:50,364
I'm kind of a compulsive masturbator.

653
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:56,871
Shorts, that's your bunk.

654
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,242
- Really?
- Absolutely.

655
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:04,332
Thanks, buddy.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

656
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:05,785
Hey, put her here.

657
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:11,716
- I don't shake hands.
- Well, whatever.

658
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:15,636
[grunts, sighs]

659
00:44:15,808 --> 00:44:18,215
Ah, good to be back.

660
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:23,105
Tell me, Shorts,
who's the toughest guy here?

661
00:44:23,273 --> 00:44:25,515
Who's the biggest bad-ass
in the cell block?

662
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:28,942
Biggest bad-ass...
There's a lot of contenders.

663
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:33,062
There's Cleon. He's leader
of the Diamond Kings, the black gang.

664
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:38,034
- I seen him kill a man with his fist.
- That's right! Yeah!

665
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:42,582
Then there's Juanito.
He's head of the Mexican gang.

666
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,743
Hey, get back. Hey!

667
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,585
And whatever you do,
don't go near those guys.

668
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:53,917
- The goal is to express ourselves...
- They're Scientologists.

669
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:57,630
- They don't look so tough.
- Yeah. They'll talk your ear off

670
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:00,298
- and then sue your ass.
...distinguish fear.

671
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:04,426
Then there's the Nazis.
None of them are too tough.

672
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:08,685
They don't fight fair and don't fight
alone. They always gang up on you.

673
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,777
Their leader, Patterson,
he's a real bastard.

674
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:15,397
His uncle's the head
of the Aryan Nation.

675
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,401
Let me clarify my question, Shorts.

676
00:45:17,576 --> 00:45:20,246
Who's the most
dangerous sexual predator?

677
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,370
Oh, that's easy.

678
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,706
It's Big Raymond.
Absolutely insatiable.

679
00:45:25,876 --> 00:45:28,877
Crazy. The other black guys
don't go near him.

680
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:32,711
But they'd back him up
if it came to a fight.

681
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:35,125
Big Raymond it is.

682
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:37,176
- Can I borrow that?
- Yeah.

683
00:45:37,346 --> 00:45:38,840
Thanks.

684
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:43,262
Hey, Stan. Stan, where you going?

685
00:45:43,435 --> 00:45:46,306
You think that cigarette was free?
Is that what you think?

686
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,149
I'll pay you back, man.
I don't have any money.

687
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,771
You think I want money?

688
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:54,149
Mmm...

689
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:57,903
- Excuse me.
- Bug off, bitch!

690
00:45:58,074 --> 00:46:00,482
I'll get to you later.

691
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,534
Did you just call me bitch?

692
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:05,954
Yeah, I said it.

693
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:11,917
Hey, everybody! Did you hear that?

694
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:15,291
Big Raymond, for no reason,
just called me bitch!

695
00:46:15,466 --> 00:46:17,174
Now, was that nice?

696
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,095
- [muttering]
- It's not like I called him fat.

697
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:24,509
It's not like I said I seen pig shit
prettier than he is.

698
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:30,803
It's not like I said his mother's pussy
smells like egg salad.

699
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:33,524
Which it does.

700
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,777
[men shouting]

701
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:45,070
[man] Oh, hell nah! Ohhh, hell nah!

702
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:48,449
Hell nah! Oh, hell nah!

703
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:50,498
Ho-ho! Yeah!

704
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:53,075
[shouting]

705
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:01,791
[cracking]

706
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:04,220
[screaming]

707
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:07,805
- [snapping]
- Ah! Ah!

708
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:10,597
Ahhh!

709
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:12,644
[screaming]

710
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:14,439
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

711
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:16,150
[continues screaming]

712
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:17,646
[all] Ooh!

713
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,737
I told you Raymond was gonna get
his ass beat. I told you!

714
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:24,156
[cheering]

715
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:27,113
[laughing] My cracker!

716
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:29,742
Laying the boot to the big nigga.
Give it up!

717
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:32,785
Don't use that word around me.
It's ugly and racist.

718
00:47:34,294 --> 00:47:38,042
- [all laugh]
- [man] Yeah, dawg!

719
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,339
He's funny too, man.

720
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:44,344
All right, listen here, player.
All right?

721
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:48,130
We want you to join up with us,
nah mean? Them niggas is gonna tear...

722
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:50,430
[man] Ooh!

723
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,475
I said don't talk that way around me.

724
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:54,020
Let me get some of that!

725
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:57,272
- [man] Let's kill him.
- No, I got it, I got it. I got it!

726
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,982
Handle your business, Cleon.

727
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:07,273
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're gonna
stick up for that fat son of a bitch.

728
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,785
You happen to see the colour
of that fat son of a bitch's skin?

729
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,161
Hey, aren't we over that?

730
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:16,119
Didn't you see that <i>Nova</i> episode?
Huh, you guys?

731
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,333
They did that DNA test.

732
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:20,959
- We all come from Africa.
- [man] Kick his ass.

733
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:25,378
It's a proven fact. Under the skin,
I'm just as black as you are.

734
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:27,011
- [man] Fuck that.
- Get him!

735
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,879
- [man] Get him, man! Get him! Get him!
- Motherfucker!

736
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:33,928
[grunting]

737
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,271
- Get him!
- Ah!

738
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,693
[shouting]

739
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,201
Man, get that fool!

740
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:06,294
Dumb bitch!

741
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:12,388
Hold on. See what happens.

742
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:15,760
- [shouting]
- [grunts]

743
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,353
- Oh!
- Ah!

744
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:40,663
[all] Oh!

745
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,128
- [man] Take the stick!
- [man 2] No, don't take it!

746
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:59,851
- [man 3] Take the stick!
- [man 2] No, don't take it!

747
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,478
Oh, he did it again.

748
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:11,235
- [man] Take the stick! Take it!
- Mm-hm?

749
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:14,075
- [all shouting]
- [man 2] No, no, don't take it!

750
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:20,364
Whoo!

751
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:25,081
[man 2] I told him
not to take that stick.

752
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,009
[man] Even the Asian!

753
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,589
Where the hell did that guy come from?

754
00:50:37,765 --> 00:50:39,639
- Whoo!
- [man] Damn!

755
00:50:39,808 --> 00:50:42,015
- [man 2] That guy's good.
- [man 3] All right.

756
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:44,060
[man 4] Come on, Cleon.

757
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:46,899
[man 5] It's your time, baby.
Don't be scared.

758
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:49,272
[man 6] It's your time to shine, Cleon.

759
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:51,516
[all] Ooh!

760
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,529
[Stan] Cleon.

761
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,828
If you wanna fight me,
you're gonna have to fight me.

762
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:04,116
- I understand.
- Pick up your gold teeth.

763
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:07,790
I'm gonna let you keep them this time.

764
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:10,001
But if you come at me again...

765
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,038
...I'm gonna hang onto them
like a Swiss banker.

766
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:30,937
[Cleon] Ya'll ain't gonna help me?

767
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:33,778
I'm missing a bicuspid.

768
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:37,645
We should have killed him.

769
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:41,773
[sobbing] Somebody,
call an orthodontist.

770
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:49,950
Hm. I see Mr. Minton
has acquainted himself

771
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:52,334
with his new surroundings.

772
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,334
I believe it's time I had
my little chat with him.

773
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,889
Ow!

774
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:08,635
- [indistinct chatter]
- Whoa, whoa, look out.

775
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,852
Beat it. All of you.

776
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:25,451
Oh, man, this stuff's good. I don't know
what everybody's complaining about.

777
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,412
You're kidding me.

778
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:30,665
Hey, man.
I just wanna say thanks.

779
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,991
For what?

780
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:37,673
You know, for helping me before.

781
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:39,039
With Big Raymond.

782
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:42,088
I wasn't helping you.
I was helping me.

783
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:46,968
I had to beat up the biggest shithead.
He happened to be talking to you.

784
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:49,434
OK.

785
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:53,728
But, you know, I... I mean, I...

786
00:52:53,898 --> 00:52:55,891
I think that guy wanted to fuck me.

787
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:03,735
Trust me, in your case,
I was just putting off the inevitable.

788
00:53:05,201 --> 00:53:09,495
[speaking Spanish]

789
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:12,949
- [man makes kissing sound]
- Yeah.

790
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,536
Well, thanks anyway.

791
00:53:16,378 --> 00:53:19,830
[man] What's your name, girl?
Don't be shy, just say hi.

792
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:23,124
Come here. Kick back, baby girl!

793
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:26,303
Little hard on the kid, weren't you?

794
00:53:26,472 --> 00:53:29,757
That's got nothing to do with me.
And I'm gonna keep it that way.

795
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:32,175
- You got that?
- Mm-hm.

796
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,408
[Bullard] One-one-five!

797
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:56,664
Minton, warden wants to see you.
Get up.

798
00:53:56,835 --> 00:53:59,207
- Me?
- Now! Walk!

799
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,129
Put your hands behind your back.

800
00:54:05,635 --> 00:54:08,802
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

801
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,723
Minton, I'm glad you could make it.

802
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:19,264
- You can take the cuffs off him.
- Sure you wanna do that, Boss?

803
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,516
I said take 'em off.

804
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,266
It's all right.

805
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:25,725
I already got 'em.

806
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:29,821
It's a matter of dislocating the wrists.

807
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:31,652
[snaps]

808
00:54:32,745 --> 00:54:34,572
[cracks]

809
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:38,614
Ew! Ew, that is creepy!

810
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:42,042
- You can wait outside.
- [shudders]

811
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:44,203
Have a seat.

812
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:52,847
Warden, if this is about me
fighting in the yard, it...

813
00:54:53,015 --> 00:54:54,509
Cigar?

814
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:57,768
Thank you.

815
00:55:01,523 --> 00:55:02,721
Brandy?

816
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:06,649
Sure.

817
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:18,577
You know, you wardens should complain.

818
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,960
'Cause in the movies,
they always make you look like assholes.

819
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:28,204
[laughs] Well,
I don't plan on being a warden forever.

820
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:31,004
- Is that right?
- Tell me, Minton.

821
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:33,549
What do you think of this place?

822
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:37,422
It's OK, for a prison.

823
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,811
Not the prison. The land.

824
00:55:45,316 --> 00:55:50,191
It's a nice sized property. Great views
of the foothills and city. Level grade.

825
00:55:50,362 --> 00:55:53,696
I'm assuming there's
bedrock beneath us.

826
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:58,611
Easy access to downtown.
I see some nice development potential.

827
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:01,954
- Too bad you got a prison on it.
- Exactly.

828
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:06,453
You know, it's no accident
you came to Oaksburg.

829
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:09,499
I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

830
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,252
What made you wanna do that?

831
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:18,097
Come here.

832
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:25,096
Oaksburg Estates.

833
00:56:25,272 --> 00:56:29,684
I'm a silent partner, so to speak,
with some private investors

834
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:35,150
who would like to develop this land
into timeshare condominiums.

835
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:39,190
I believe that's
your field of expertise.

836
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:42,785
- True.
- 'Course, all this is only possible

837
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:45,743
in the event the prison
ever closes down.

838
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:49,582
- Makes sense.
- You know, I'm in the prison business.

839
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:52,423
I know how to break a man's will,
crush his spirit.

840
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,801
But them real estate contracts,
those things put a real hurt on you.

841
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:58,511
That's where you come in.

842
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:06,221
- What's in it for me?
- How would you like to be out of here

843
00:57:06,395 --> 00:57:07,426
in a year?

844
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:13,978
- But I've got a mandatory minimum.
- Wardens have great discretion

845
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:18,980
getting early parole, especially
to non-violent, first-time offenders.

846
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:23,819
- Prisons are crowded, you know.
- The system is corrupt.

847
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:25,241
Me likey.

848
00:57:25,414 --> 00:57:28,996
But you gotta move the luxury units
closer to the lagoon.

849
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:31,837
That'll double rents.
Parking goes underground.

850
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:35,419
Wasting space. Eight extra units.
Whoever designed this is a moron.

851
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,591
- How will you get rid of the prison?
- Let me worry about that.

852
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,085
Tell me more about them parking spaces.

853
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:50,728
[Stan singing in Spanish]

854
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:09,035
You strapped?

855
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:11,579
He ain't gonna know what hit him,
nah mean?

856
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:25,044
Ah!

857
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,258
That's gonna scar, you psycho.

858
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:37,397
- Whoo!
- [grunts]

859
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:50,119
You want that shiv, don't you?

860
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,660
You made that with a melted toothbrush
and a razorblade?

861
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,578
- That's very creative.
- Ah!

862
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:06,009
Look what I made
with three bars of soap and a shoelace.

863
00:59:07,263 --> 00:59:09,173
[chuckles] Cracker, please.

864
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,800
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

[high-pitched warbling]

867
00:59:26,908 --> 00:59:28,900
Come on, race traitor.

868
00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:33,737
- Ah!
- Ooh!

869
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:38,330
[high-pitched warbling]

870
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:41,962
Oh!

871
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:45,378
- [neck cracks]
- Ha!

872
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,709
Hee-yah!

873
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,304
He's all yours.

874
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,891
This gonna be fun.

875
00:59:55,144 --> 00:59:57,432
[all shouting]

876
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:08,562
Hey, Stan. What'd you do to Patterson?

877
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,112
I just roughed him up a little bit.

878
01:00:11,284 --> 01:00:15,033
- Why?
- Somebody took a shiv to his ass.

879
01:00:15,205 --> 01:00:19,914
They say he'll be shitting sideways
for a month. [laughs]

880
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:22,920
Now I know
what schadenfreude feels like.

881
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:24,961
- What?
- Schadenfreude.

882
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:28,880
It's German for when you feel good
because your enemy's anus is violated.

883
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:31,009
Oh.

884
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,891
You know you're getting that on me.

885
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:43,814
<i>[Stan on phone] I'm doing great.</i>
<i>You guys are pussies.</i>

886
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:48,444
That's terrific. Hey, listen, pal.
I need your help.

887
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,863
I can't get Mindy's lawyer
to return my call.

888
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:54,440
If we wanna go through
with this divorce,

889
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:57,987
you're going to have
to contact her personally.

890
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:00,195
<i>Stan.</i>

891
01:01:00,374 --> 01:01:02,034
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

892
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:05,625
<i>- How's the appeal coming?</i>
- [laughs]

893
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:10,754
Believe it or not, I'm looking
at the Madam Foreman right now.

894
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:12,717
- [laughs]
- <i>That's great.</i>

895
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:18,307
[stammering] I gotta go now.
You know, duty calls.

896
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,764
All right. Thanks, Lew.
I'll talk to you soon.

897
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:25,809
[grunting, farting]

898
01:01:29,611 --> 01:01:32,980
Ain't you Charlize Theron?

899
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,575
Oh, look what fell out there.

900
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:47,368
[laughing] So I had them
exchange the beef for horse meat.

901
01:01:47,545 --> 01:01:50,582
- Clever.
- That's Stan.

902
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:53,164
Minton, I'd like for you
to meet Mr. Dang.

903
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:55,382
He's on the prison's board of governors.

904
01:01:55,553 --> 01:01:59,598
They let Vietnamese mafia on
the prison board of governors?

905
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:02,555
Your finger tats.

906
01:02:03,936 --> 01:02:09,560
[laughs] Like you say, Stan,
the system is corrupt.

907
01:02:09,734 --> 01:02:13,897
Mr. Dang's family happens to be
my partners in Oaksburg Estates.

908
01:02:14,071 --> 01:02:16,823
Oh, good, 'cause I was just
going over the contracts.

909
01:02:16,991 --> 01:02:20,110
The language gets rather vague
on gross versus net liability.

910
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:23,785
I'm sure it's unintentional, but that
could screw you in the long run.

911
01:02:23,956 --> 01:02:28,950
Could it? I'll have my lawyers
correct that immediately.

912
01:02:29,128 --> 01:02:32,579
I got an excellent lawyer for that.
He specialises in it. Lew Popper.

913
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:36,207
Popper? I'll be sure to contact him.

914
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:40,252
[laughs] Come on, Dang,
let's check out the floor show.

915
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:45,850
[shouting]

916
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:49,554
It looks like the savages
are ready for the inspection.

917
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:54,440
[Gasque] Well, give me a few more weeks.
I'll even have 'em readier.

918
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:56,568
[Dang] I'm counting on that.

919
01:02:58,031 --> 01:03:00,237
Would you like a strawberry?

920
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:04,779
- I grew them in my own garden.
- Thank you.

921
01:03:04,954 --> 01:03:07,445
Minton? Strawberry?

922
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:09,656
No, I'm good.

923
01:03:15,548 --> 01:03:18,668
[Gasque] Maybe I picked 'em
a little too soon.

924
01:03:20,636 --> 01:03:22,593
I don't think that's it.

925
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:26,588
<i>[Stan on phone] People</i>
<i>are scared shitless of me.</i>

926
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:28,096

<i>Is there anyone there</i>

Nah. I got it all under control.

What's the matter, Stan?

930

You sound... distant.

<i>I don't know. It's just...</i>

932

Don't you ever find yourself
feeling sorry for anybody?

933
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:48,742
You might as well ask me
if I feel sorry for the maggots

01:03:48,914 --> 01:03:50,788
I grind into my morning coffee.

935
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:54,492
[laughs] That's how I feel too.
Listen, I gotta go.

936
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,540
Make me proud, Stan.

01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:00,384
[woman] Come on, baby!
Do it to me!

938
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,876
- [Popper] Oh, yeah!
- [woman] Are you using me?

939
01:04:03,053 --> 01:04:05,259
- [Popper] No!
- [woman] Don't you love me?

940
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,506
- [Popper] Yeah!
- [woman] Show me!

941
01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:11,051
- [phone rings]
- [shouting]

942
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:17,767
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. Hello. Hey!

943
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:20,860
Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah.

944
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:23,864
Hi, Stan. Yeah.
I think I have good news.

945
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:27,981
- [woman] Do you love me?
- Yeah. I think the... I think the...

946
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:33,582
The Madam Foreman is just one orgasm
away from giving you your appeal.

947
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,537
<i>[Stan] That's great, Lew.</i>
<i>And gross.</i>

948
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:38,750
Heard from Mindy or her attorney?

949
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:40,997
Uh, no.

950
01:04:41,174 --> 01:04:45,005
But don't say I don't earn my money.
[laughs]

951
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:54,390
Hi, fellas.
I don't believe I ordered Chinese.

952
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,558
I guess I could go
for a little pot-sticker.

953
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,240
[Shorts] Who are you writing to?

954
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,734
No one special.

955
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:15,371
You've been sitting there for a while
writing to no one special.

956
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:22,626
You know, Stan, I've been here for a
long time. I can handle a lot of things.

957
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:26,498
Like having to spend the rest
of my life in this shithole.

958
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:29,926
But there's one thing I do regret.

959
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:33,596
I could never make it work
with Miyoshi.

960
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:39,769
Oh, she was the only person
who ever loved me for me.

961
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:44,817
I was too pigheaded to realise it.

962
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:50,325
[sighs] I'd give anything
to change the way I behaved.

963
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,950
How did you behave?

964
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:55,241
I killed her.

965
01:05:56,914 --> 01:05:58,243
Oh.

966
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:03,243
Alcohol wasn't something that always
brought out the best in me, Stan.

967
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:27,479
<i>[Stan] Dear Mindy, I've been</i>
<i>thinking a lot about you lately.</i>

968
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:29,444
<i>About us.</i>

969
01:06:29,613 --> 01:06:31,771
<i>I realise now that you were right.</i>

970
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:35,318
<i>I was pigheaded and selfish.</i>

971
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:39,076
<i>Leaving me was probably</i>
<i>the best thing for you.</i>

972
01:06:39,247 --> 01:06:41,240
<i>And I'm truly sorry.</i>

973
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:44,121
<i>I never should have hurt you.</i>

974
01:06:44,294 --> 01:06:47,330
<i>I know now why you wanted</i>
<i>to have a baby with me.</i>

975
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:49,794
<i>It's just another way</i>
<i>for us to love each other</i>

976
01:06:49,966 --> 01:06:52,718
<i>even more deeply.</i>

977
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:56,420
<i>I hope, someday,</i>
<i>you'll be able to forgive me.</i>

978
01:06:56,598 --> 01:06:59,515
<i>Love always, Stan.</i>

979
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,647
[The Master] Hey, baby.

980
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:19,364
Now, I know all of you want to get back
to your weightlifting and basketball

981
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:22,988
and masturbating, so I'm gonna
try to keep this short. All right?

982
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:28,670
I am throwing away all of these
violent video games and movies.

983
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:30,462
[all groaning]

984
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:33,087
Don't do that! No! Come on, man!

985
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:36,793
From now on, I want you guys
watching more wholesome entertainment.

986
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:40,470
And frankly, a lot of the rap music
you brothers listen to

987
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:43,096
- was too hateful towards women.
- [all laughing]

988
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,353
What is up with that?
You like women, right?

989
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:47,720
[all] Yeah!

990
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,641
Now, on the other hand,

991
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,020
the Mexicans are onto something
with mariachi and salsa music.

992
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,401
[cheering]

993
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:00,282
It's positive, easy to dance to
and you never get tired of it.

994
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,322
- Shorts, give us a taste.
- Here we go.

995
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:08,289
<i>[salsa music plays]</i>

996
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,536
<i>[man singing in Spanish]</i>

997
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,630
[cheering, whistling]

998
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,964
[cheering]

999
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,572
Holy shit.

1000
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,744
- All right. All right, all right.
- [music stops]

1001
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:49,448
That's Afro-Cuban. I asked
for mariachi. But you get the point.

1002
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,828
All right? Now, lastly,
and most importantly,

1003
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:55,921
from now on, there will
be no more rape at this prison.

1004
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,628
- [all shouting]
- No, no!

1005
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,170
That's right.
Anyone who rapes another inmate

1006
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:05,216
- will have to answer to me.
- [man] Boo!

1007
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,098
[Stan] I will not be kind.

1008
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:10,138
- Excuse me, Big Stan.
- Yes, Juanito.

1009
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,767
Why you putting your nose
where it don't belong?

1010
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:15,181
My men are aggressive and hard.

1011
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,226
Sometimes they need a way to work off
that excess energy. What's it to you?

1012
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:22,405
- OK. Well, first off, good question.
- Thank you.

1013
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:26,785
What is it to me?
Well, frankly, I just don't like it.

1014
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:30,821
And let me show you why.
Robbie, come up here.

1015
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:32,873
You, Robbie the hippie.
Come up here.

1016
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:35,368
[all whistling]

1017
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:41,670
All right, all right. Robbie, how long
is your sentence here at Oaksburg?

1018
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:45,757
- Five to ten.
- Five to ten years.

1019
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,801
What exactly did you do
to earn that sentence?

1020
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:52,474
- I sold marijuana.
- [laughter]

1021
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:56,310
- A shitload of marijuana.
- [cheering]

1022
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:00,684
Thanks, Robbie. Go sit down.

1023
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:04,396
He sold marijuana.
He was a marijuana dealer.

1024
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:08,488
I'm not here to argue about drug policy.
I don't think they're tough enough.

1025
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:12,361
- [protesting]
- Whatever.

1026
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:15,908
But just because Robbie was guilty
of selling dope

1027
01:10:16,085 --> 01:10:21,079
doesn't mean he deserves to get raped
up the ass every day for ten years.

1028
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:23,498
I just don't think that's fair.

1029
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:26,712
- [murmuring]
- Some of you are here

1030
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:32,842
because you're habitual drunk drivers.
Some of you have a fondness for crack.

1031
01:10:33,018 --> 01:10:36,184
- [laughing, murmuring]
- Some of you robbed a bank.

1032
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:40,019
- I'm talking to you, Lee Otis.
- [laughing]

1033
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,192
But that doesn't mean you should
get raped. It's just not fair.

1034
01:10:47,866 --> 01:10:51,365
- Yes, Carnahan.
- What about guys convicted of rape?

1035
01:10:51,536 --> 01:10:54,869
- Can we rape them?
- [all] Yeah!

1036
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:57,115
Rape the rapists.
Seems appropriate.

1037
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:59,830
Punishment fitting the crime and all.
Go ahead.

1038
01:11:00,003 --> 01:11:02,873
- [cheering]
- [man] That's what I'm talkin' about.

1039
01:11:03,047 --> 01:11:07,626
- How about them child molesters?
- [all] Yeah!

1040
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:10,174
Yeah, them too. Good point.
Anyone else?

1041
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:12,837
[cheering]

1042
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:16,716
[Big Raymond] Big Stan!

1043
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:21,223
- What about the counterfeiters?
- [all] What?

1044
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,728
Counterfeiters? Big Raymond,
you're the only counterfeiter here.

1045
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:28,738
[man] Yeah!

1046
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:32,073
Wait a minute.
Do you just want somebody to...

1047
01:11:32,242 --> 01:11:34,615
[all] Aw!

1048
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:36,945
OK, here's another thing
we gotta clear up.

1049
01:11:37,122 --> 01:11:40,242
There's a difference
between homosexual sex and rape.

1050
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:44,000
- Now, Big Raymond.
- Hm?

1051
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:47,006
There's someone here
who wants to have sex with you.

1052
01:11:47,174 --> 01:11:49,665
- [man] Not me!
- OK? How about it, anyone?

1053
01:11:51,678 --> 01:11:54,762
Yeah. Yeah.

1054
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:57,339
[laughter]

1055
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:01,095
Tyler!

1056
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:05,814
- Great!
- Man! [giggles]

1057
01:12:15,326 --> 01:12:18,446
You two have fun.
But wear protection.

1058
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:20,614
- [cheering]
- [Big Raymond] OK.

1059
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:25,499
All right, grow up. Look, if you've got
a problem with that, then that's...

1060
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,995
[farting, groaning]

1061
01:12:29,423 --> 01:12:30,882
Nurse!

1062
01:12:32,301 --> 01:12:33,961
[farts]

1063
01:12:35,972 --> 01:12:37,003
[farts]

1064
01:12:37,181 --> 01:12:41,048
Now, those two are about to have
consensual homosexual sex.

1065
01:12:41,227 --> 01:12:44,228
A beautiful, beautiful thing.
The total opposite of rape,

1066
01:12:44,396 --> 01:12:47,600
- which is not allowed.
- Except for rapists and molesters?

1067
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:49,981
- We can still rape them.
- No, you can't.

1068
01:12:50,152 --> 01:12:53,568
- [all] What?
- I changed my mind.

1069
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:55,316
Bad habit. Quit cold turkey.

1070
01:12:55,491 --> 01:12:58,906
- [all yelling]
- If you're not happy with it,

1071
01:12:59,077 --> 01:13:02,826
- you're welcome to fight me.
- [groaning]

1072
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:06,322
I didn't think so.
All right, you're dismissed.

1073
01:13:06,501 --> 01:13:08,708
Beat it.

1074
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,621
- Good speech.
- You think?

1075
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:15,717
- I should have opened with a joke.
- No, it was good.

1076
01:13:15,886 --> 01:13:19,171
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sorry about the mariachi.

1077
01:13:19,347 --> 01:13:20,545
Let it go.

1078
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:26,971
Hey, Big Stan.
Check out the lovebirds.

1079
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:32,483
- One for you!
- [giggles]

1080
01:13:32,652 --> 01:13:35,569
Mm! One for you.

1081
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:37,937
Good for them.

1082
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:41,817
I have something important to show you.

1083
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:43,157
Let me eat, will you?

1084
01:13:43,329 --> 01:13:44,574
Hey, Big Stan.

1085
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:50,040
- Can we talk?
- Make it quick.

1086
01:13:50,211 --> 01:13:52,417
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

1087
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:55,957
- I didn't do anything...
- Don't say you didn't do it for me.

1088
01:13:56,133 --> 01:13:59,300
Because you did, didn't you?

1089
01:14:00,638 --> 01:14:03,841
- A little.
- Well, thanks.

1090
01:14:04,016 --> 01:14:07,432
- Yeah. Thanks, man.

Hey, Big Stan.
I like what you said.

1095
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,440
I wanna join your gang.

1096
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:25,150
- I don't have a gang.
- Yes, you do.

1097
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:30,781
OK, you're in.

1098
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:36,829
[man clears throat] Me too?

1099
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:46,341
- Yeah, you too.

- Yeah! Ow!

1102
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:59,100
All right, can I eat now?

1103
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:04,901
- [Big Raymond] Yes, you did!
- He's gotta eat.

1104
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,374
I told you I had something important
to show you.

1105
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:18,828
From Mindy.

1106
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,467
She wants to see me.

01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:09,972
Thanks.

1115
01:16:22,318 --> 01:16:25,438
- Excuse me, man.
- No, that was my bad.

1116
01:16:25,613 --> 01:16:28,234
No, really. It was my fault.

1117
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:31,574
There's a pickup game of hoops later,
if you wanna play.

1118
01:16:31,744 --> 01:16:32,823
I'd like that.

I loved your letter!

- I missed you so much.

Before we go any further, there's
three little words I need to hear.

1129
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,834
- I was wrong?
- Good boy!

1130
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,761
It looks like
a nursery school picnic out there.

1131
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,472
It's Minton.

1132
01:18:19,683 --> 01:18:23,894
- What do you mean, it's Minton?
- Well, first he banned rape.

1133
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:26,351
It's to the point
that anybody gets beat up,

1134
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:29,773
they run and join Minton's gang
and Minton beats up the bad guy.

1135
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:33,146
The truth, he's got them too scared
to look at each other funny.

1136
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:37,070
- We ain't had a fight in three days.
- I thought I saw Ingleberg fight

1137
01:18:37,242 --> 01:18:40,361
that big Mexican yesterday, Jesus.

1138
01:18:40,537 --> 01:18:44,321
Oh, no, that was more in the nature
of a lovers' quarrel.

1139
01:18:44,499 --> 01:18:46,906
Ingleberg forgot their
two-week anniversary.

1140
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:49,789
That wasn't very nice of him, was it?

1141
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:54,043
Well, they made up. You should
have seen the cake Ingleberg made.

1142
01:18:54,217 --> 01:18:56,708
- It was special...
- You get out of here right now

1143
01:18:56,886 --> 01:19:00,504
and get Minton up here!
You understand me? I mean right now!

- Now hurry!
- [door closes]

1145

I'm not just saying this, but I think
that was the most amazing sex

- we've ever had.
- [giggles]

1147

I guess being away from me
this long made you crazy.

1148
01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:19,490
Well, yes, I guess.
The Master's opened my eyes, sexually.

1149
01:19:19,658 --> 01:19:23,027
He showed me all these different
positions in the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

1150

- The Master? You been seeing him?
- Yeah, he's staying at the house.

1151

- But Stan, I...

1154
01:19:35,966 --> 01:19:39,833
- Warden wants to see you now!
- Wait. I don't want you to see him.

1155
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:44,424
You tell Master Dickface I'm gonna get
out of here soon and kick his ass!

1156
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:46,971
Don't tell him.
You're not allowed to see him.

1157
01:19:47,143 --> 01:19:49,266
I said now, convict!

1158
01:19:49,437 --> 01:19:51,145
- Minton!
- Not allowed to see him!

1159

- Let's go.

I was part psychic.

1162
01:20:09,582 --> 01:20:14,043
That's right.
I'm able to see into the future.

1163
01:20:15,671 --> 01:20:18,756
- I didn't realise.
- Let me tell you what's going to happen

1164
01:20:18,925 --> 01:20:21,166
one week from today.

1165
01:20:24,096 --> 01:20:27,430
The board of governors
is gonna come to inspect the prison.

1166
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,728
And something awful happens.

1167
01:20:31,896 --> 01:20:36,308
Some prisoners find a way
to smuggle weapons into the yard.

1168
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:39,105
And a full-scale riot breaks out.

1169
01:20:39,278 --> 01:20:43,441
And as the prison board watches
in absolute horror,

1170
01:20:43,615 --> 01:20:47,743
my men are forced to shoot
into the yard in order

1171
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:50,912
to end the melee.

1172
01:20:51,081 --> 01:20:56,158
In the ensuing scandal,
the Board chooses to sell the property

1173
01:20:56,336 --> 01:20:59,752
to a Vietnamese family

1174
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:02,675
based in San Pedro.

1175
01:21:02,843 --> 01:21:06,128
And everybody lives happily ever after.

1176
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:08,882
Especially me.

1177
01:21:09,057 --> 01:21:13,351
Now, if the events that I foretold

1178
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,975
do not come to fruition...

1179
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:21,018
...I will be very disappointed.

1180
01:21:28,493 --> 01:21:30,569
And when I get disappointed,

1181
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:32,951
Mr. Deng over there

1182
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:37,867
likes to stomp on men's spines
like they was bubble wrap.

1183
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:56,386
I spent 35 years of my life

1184
01:21:56,562 --> 01:22:00,096
in this stinking cesspool.

1185
01:22:00,274 --> 01:22:04,852
And I will not walk away
without something to show for it.

1186
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:09,191
Your little prison reform
ends right now.

1187
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,452
You play ball,
you might get yourself a parole hearing.

1188
01:22:14,621 --> 01:22:17,326
How many will get killed?

1189
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:22,493
Who cares? They're all animals.

1190
01:22:24,631 --> 01:22:26,042
Bullard!

1191
01:22:28,385 --> 01:22:32,881
- Escort Mr. Minton back to his cell.
- Yes, sir. Come on, Minton.

1192
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,770
Stan, you ever have two Asian men
pounding your balls

1193
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,810
after sex with a questionably
attractive older woman?

1194
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:47,309
No, I can't say I have, Lew.

1195
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:51,354
Madam Foreman won't return
any of my calls.

1196
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:54,652
You better go for that deal
the warden offered you.

1197
01:22:54,827 --> 01:22:59,619
- So there's nothing else I can do?
- I'm sorry, pal. It's over.

<i>You're in real danger.</i>

The Brazilians won't
stop calling Farib an Arab.

I'm not an Arab! I'm Persian.

You look like an Arab.

01:26:56,647 --> 01:27:00,063
Stay out of the yard tomorrow.
You hear me?

1240
01:27:06,782 --> 01:27:10,614
D-block houses some
of our most hardened offenders.

1241
01:27:10,786 --> 01:27:15,412
But here, we have Oaksburg's
greatest rehabilitation story.

1242
01:27:15,582 --> 01:27:20,244
Stan Minton. Stan, I'd like for you
to meet the board of governors.

1243
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:24,251
Not going in the yard today, Stan?

1244
01:27:24,424 --> 01:27:27,710
- I don't feel well, warden.
- Maybe this will make you feel better.

1245
01:27:27,886 --> 01:27:31,800
Due to Stan's exemplary behaviour,
the parole board has agreed

1246
01:27:31,973 --> 01:27:34,381
to meet with him today.

1247
01:27:35,143 --> 01:27:37,716
Well, we better be moving along.

1248
01:27:43,193 --> 01:27:46,277
The shit goes down at 12.30.

1249
01:27:46,446 --> 01:27:50,823
At 12.35,
I'm in the real estate business.

1250
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,125

Stan! Honey!

1253
01:28:29,446 --> 01:28:31,403
- I'll deal with you in a minute.
- Everything OK?

1254
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,068
Both of you.

1255
01:28:37,454 --> 01:28:40,408
[woman] Next up is prisoner 5824.

1256
01:28:41,124 --> 01:28:43,876
In the matter of Stanley Minton.
You have your files.

1257
01:28:47,547 --> 01:28:51,497
[woman] In his time here, Minton
has accrued an exemplary record.

1258
01:28:51,676 --> 01:28:55,176
And let it be noted,
he's a first-time non-violent offender.

1259
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,009
[ticking]

1260
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:03,593
Hold up!

1261
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:07,022
Before we vote, Mr. Minton, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1262
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:10,442
I'd just like to say, um...
[clears throat]

1263
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:12,734
...I've really learned a lot.

1264
01:29:12,905 --> 01:29:15,361
And I'm ready to get back to work.

1265
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:19,193
[woman] Good, we like to hear that.

1266
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:23,788
Here's the yard where the prisoners
come to exercise.

1267
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:27,541
That's where Charlie the Fly
tried to fly over the wall. [laughs]

1268
01:29:27,712 --> 01:29:30,997
Well, in light of Warden Gasque's
recommendation,

1269
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:34,673
I think we have a pretty
clear-cut case for parole.

1270
01:29:37,263 --> 01:29:39,551
Mr. Minton?

1271
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:45,309
How would you feel
about getting out of here today?

1272
01:29:49,608 --> 01:29:51,268
Mr. Minton?

1273
01:29:55,447 --> 01:29:57,190
Did I mention I'm in real estate?

1274
01:29:58,408 --> 01:30:01,991
[laughs] I got my eye on some property
real close by here

1275
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:06,373
- I can't wait to develop.
- Hm. That's commendable.

1276
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,159
You know, while I was in here,
also, I joined a biker gang.

1277
01:30:10,337 --> 01:30:13,172
Satan's Paedophiles.

1278
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,416
Anyway, they said when I get out,

1279
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:18,546
they'd love to camp next
to the grammar school near here.

1280
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,131
I hope that's not a problem.

1281
01:30:20,305 --> 01:30:24,801
They're pretty cool guys, except
when they drink and do crystal meth.

1282
01:30:24,976 --> 01:30:26,554
Which is almost every weekend.

1283
01:30:26,728 --> 01:30:31,520
But most of the people I sell to,
they don't need to know about that.

1284
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:35,819
'Cause, uh, they're old ladies, mostly.
Not too good with fine print,

1285
01:30:35,987 --> 01:30:37,101
if you get my drift.

1286
01:30:38,781 --> 01:30:42,530
Tell me, is your grandma still alive?
I bet I could make her a sweet deal.

1287
01:30:42,702 --> 01:30:44,778
By the time I'm through with her,

1288
01:30:44,954 --> 01:30:49,746
she'll give hand jobs behind the pharmacy
to pay for arthritis medication.

1289
01:30:51,544 --> 01:30:54,580
Two at a time, you know?
Stuff you see in pornos.

1290
01:30:56,715 --> 01:31:00,760
Anyway, that's a nice top you have on.
Seriously.

1291
01:31:00,928 --> 01:31:03,633
Mind lowering it?
I'd love to see some boobage.

1292
01:31:04,848 --> 01:31:07,849
Let me see that, woman. That's sexy.
Let me see that.

1293
01:31:08,018 --> 01:31:11,304
Let me touch one of them.
Let me touch one of them. Can I? Please?

1294
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,101
Parole denied!
Take him back to his cell!

1295
01:31:14,274 --> 01:31:18,106
What colour are your nipples?
I bet they're pink! Light brown?

1296
01:31:18,278 --> 01:31:19,772
Dollar size or quarter?

1297
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,821
Stan, did we win?

1298
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:26,820
Let go of me. I'm in a hurry.

1299
01:31:26,995 --> 01:31:28,370
Have no fear, Stanley.

1300
01:31:28,538 --> 01:31:32,239
I will continue to take care
of your wife while you're gone.

1301
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:35,038
- Thanks a lot, pal.
- No thanks needed.

1302
01:31:35,211 --> 01:31:37,998
I cherish Mindy's company.

1303
01:31:38,173 --> 01:31:42,087
Since my addiction to cigarettes
made me impotent,

1304
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,296
I've had very little contact
with the fair sex.

1305
01:31:46,264 --> 01:31:47,675
Impotent?

1306
01:31:47,849 --> 01:31:50,091
I used to think smoking was cool,

1307
01:31:50,268 --> 01:31:56,021
but a limp dick spells nerd
in any language.

1308
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:59,227
- You're impotent. That's great!
- Not really.

1309
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:02,684
Baby, I love you.
I'll write to you as soon as I can.

1310
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:04,655
OK.

1311

- Code red!

Don't tell me.
You studied with The Master too?

1319
01:32:59,669 --> 01:33:04,378
- I am his number one.
- [scoffs] I didn't see that coming.

1320
01:33:04,549 --> 01:33:07,503
There are many things
you will not see coming.
