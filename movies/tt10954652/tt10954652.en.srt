Sing it, girl.

11
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,636
Mom, now I can't.

12
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,372
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.

13
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,806
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,642
You have such a beautiful voice.

15
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,978
I can't wait to hear it
when you're older.

16
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,314
Will this place
have scuba diving?

17
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,883
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?

18
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,752
I don't know, Trent.

19
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,220
I think you're a bit too young.

20
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:45,421
You're a baby.

21
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:47,223
You said five minutes.

22
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,224
Technically, it's been way,
way more than five minutes.

23
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:50,660
Are we close?

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,396
Stop wishing away this moment.

25
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,165
Look out the window.
Look how pretty it is.

26
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,101
Prisca.

27
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:01,836
Work stuff?

28
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,773
Yeah.

29
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,142
Lead by actions, Mom.

30
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,987
Wow.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,657
This is
much better than Cancún.

32
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:30,598
Mr. and Mrs. Capa,

33
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,867
welcome to our version
of paradise.

34
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,369
Wow.

35
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,937
Hello.

36
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,478
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,213
From your food and beverage
preferences you selected,

38
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,650
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.

39
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,284
Wow.

40
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:50,853
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,823
Look how big you guys are.

42
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:56,157
We have a drink fountain
for you two.

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,492
Can we go?

44
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,728
- Mm.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,362
Let's go. Let's go.

46
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:05,034
Can you believe
I found this online?

47
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,881
My favorite thing:

48
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:21,984
open 24 hours,
the candy station.

49
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,287
Oh, my God. Come on, Trent.

50
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,127
Mix the vanilla
and strawberry in it.

51
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,698
Say hi, Trent.

52
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,098
Hi.

53
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,767
I'm Idlib.

54
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,836
My uncle's
the resort manager here.

55
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:43,171
He's Trent. I'm Maddox.

56
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,040
I can do a 1,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle,

57
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,708
which is a considerable
thing to do.

58
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,544
My dad and I put
clear glue on them

59
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,178
and hang them on my wall.

60
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:52,748
I collect conch shells.

61
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,817
I have 42 conch shells.

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,754
Amazing.

63
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,089
- Okay.
- I might need a little help with this.

64
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,892
Right, so you do
strawberry and vanilla?

65
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:15,938
Hi.

66
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,205
Thank you.

67
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,741
Yes. Ah, okay.

68
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,142
Okay, I got it.

69
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:21,443
Okay. Come on.

70
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:22,811
Thank you.

71
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,979
Great job helping.

72
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,616
Yes.

73
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,455
You!

74
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,157
I touched your jacket.
That counts.

75
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,659
Hey.

76
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,993
There's 250,000
furniture-related injuries

77
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,996
in the United States per year.

78
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,834
25% of those...
coffee table injuries.

79
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,068
Hey. Hey!

80
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:49,003
- Fine.
- Okay.

81
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:01,950
Warren and Warren must be
affiliated with this resort.

82
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,053
They must have conventions here.

83
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:09,257
We love this
pharmaceutical company at work.

84
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,826
We're considering
asking our clients

85
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,294
to use Warren and Warren drugs

86
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,029
as a way to lower
their insurance rates.

87
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,367
Ah, hmm. Yeah.

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,936
"No kids allowed on the beach"?

89
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:23,938
What? Hold on.

90
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,940
"No Kids Week"?

91
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,610
- That's not true!
- It says no ki...

92
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,111
- Let me see that!
- Prisca, you should've checked.

93
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:30,446
- Let me see that!
- It's your mom's fault.

94
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,947
- Let me see!
- No, no, no, really.

95
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,616
- No, it says this. No.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

96
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,850
- She should've checked. It says this.
- Let me see!

97
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,318
- Yes, of course.
- Let me see!

98
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,887
I know this is
very painful news

99
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,888
- for you all to bear, but now...
- Let me see!

100
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,890
- ...now I've gotten power.
- No!

101
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,625
Yes. And you have to do it.

102
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,127
Yes, you have to understand.

103
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,029
It's like this.
Life is like this.

104
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:50,164
It's tough, and sometimes things
don't go the way you want.

105
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:56,071
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:06,381
Come on. Blue team's winning.

107
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:08,183
Ah, good hit.

108
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,253
What's your name, and what
do you do for a living?

109
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,488
Hey, guys. I'm Annette.

110
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,088
And what's your name?

111
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,356
I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

112
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,325
Hey, nice to meet you.

113
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,693
- Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,296
Bye.

115
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,200
Hi. I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

116
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,603
What are your names, and what
do you do for a living?

117
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,505
Oh, well, I'm Sophia Watson.

118
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,738
I'm a chef.

119
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,408
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.

120
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,676
Cool.

121
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,944
And I'm Malin Mitchell.

122
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,412
I'm a dancer.

123
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:37,746
Wow. That's cool.

124
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,615
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

125
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:41,116
- Bye.
- Bye.

126
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,585
Hey, let's go over there.

127
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,467
Truth-telling game. Go.

128
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,303
I can't do a push-up. Go.

129
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,775
I don't have friends.

130
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,243
I'm your friend.

131
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,711
You'll leave.

132
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,547
My mom might let me
FaceTime you.

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,382
Then we can be friends.

134
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:16,284
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.

135
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:18,988
Then we can go
to the same college together

136
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,456
and become neighbors
with mortgages.

137
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,825
Cool.

138
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,532
It's weird.

139
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,800
I know.

140
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,771
It's hanging over me.
I can barely eat.

141
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,006
And I don't feel anything?

142
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,243
We agreed... we'd give them

143
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,647
one last vacation
before telling them.

144
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,114
I can't understand why

145
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,849
we don't take
into consideration...

146
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,952
That shouldn't affect anything.

147
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,989
The doctor said
it's a nonfactor.

148
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:56,392
It's probably been there
for years, he said.

149
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:02,330
We were on a course to separate.

150
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,967
That's confusing enough for us.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,571
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.

152
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,708
Let's get through this, Guy.

153
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,842
Compartmentalize.

154
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,678
It's only for three days.

155
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,012
You found a place?

156
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,647
Yes.

157
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,817
Oh, Prisca, come on.

158
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,123
You're always thinking
about the future!

159
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,894
It makes me feel not seen!

160
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,029
You're always thinking
about the past.

161
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,399
You work in a goddamn museum!

162
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:43,172
I think they stopped.

163
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,708
Why don't you play?

164
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,923
Good morning.

165
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,825
What would you like
for breakfast?

166
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,827
I'll have
the Calcium Bomb juice drink.

167
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,229
I have a calcium deficiency.

168
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,731
So, is it really calcium-rich
or just a catchy name?

169
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,669
It has all
calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

170
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,070
Sit up, Kara, honey.

171
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,771
- Okay.
- All right?

172
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,606
You don't want to be hunched
when you grow up, baby.

173
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,509
It's very unattractive.

174
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,112
Boys will get turned off.

175
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,380
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

176
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:37,486
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

177
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,123
This one.

178
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,726
I recommend
the granola parfait.

179
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,263
Um, it's a good choice.

180
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,463
Okay.

181
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,466
So, how is the Capa family?

182
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,534
Any plans today?

183
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:56,438
Well, one of our kids
wants to do Jet Ski,

184
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:58,774
- and the other one...
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,342
...wants to do
anything but that.

186
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,479
Well, there's, um...
there's a private beach

187
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:07,716
on the nature preserve side
of the island.

188
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,151
It's impossible to find.

189
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,952
It's surrounded
by stunning rocks,

190
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,855
- very unusual minerals.
- Oh.

191
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:15,557
Oh, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, so...

192
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,560
A natural anomaly.

193
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,396
I only recommend it
to certain guests.

194
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,497
But I liked you guys
immediately.

195
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,066
All right? You're a nice family.

196
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,303
So I-I could arrange
a van to take you, if...

197
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,505
Hmm. Yeah.

198
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,808
Sounds like
a great memory for us.

199
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,209
It's our little secret.

200
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:36,077
I'll make all the arrangements.

201
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,549
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

202
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,885
Okay, so I think we should get

203
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,687
the Calloway Kale-away
for Trent.

204
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,222
Idlib, what did I tell you

205
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:49,258
about being in here
when you shouldn't?

206
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,861
You can't... You know,
I told you so many times.

207
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,496
You know, we have certain...

208
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,241
I'm a doctor.

209
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:07,775
My wife has epilepsy.

210
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:08,876
I'm a nurse.

211
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:09,978
My name is Jarin.

212
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,680
Right, she's having
a grand mal seizure.

213
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:14,916
Keep things away
from her, please.

214
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,921
Patricia?

215
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:21,522
Doll?

216
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,257
All right, Jack,
I think if you just leave her

217
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,525
lying here for a while,
put something under her head,

218
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:25,593
I think she'll be fine.

219
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,895
Thank you, Doctor.

220
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,230
It's Jarin, by the way.

221
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,702
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

222
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,573
I'm sorry I ruined
everyone's breakfast.

223
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,543
You always want to be
the center of attention.

224
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,980
My goodness.

225
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,648
Let's get you
something to drink?

226
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,382
Yeah.

227
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,827
Idlib?

228
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:13,275
Oh, can't be
that secret of a beach.

229
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,809
We were told to keep it quiet.

230
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:16,510
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav.

231
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:19,347
Good boy.

232
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,850
Come. Stay.

233
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:26,188
Okay, guest checklist.

234
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,123
Books, sunscreen.

235
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,825
Did everybody leave
their passports in their safes?

236
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,526
I don't want anybody
to lose anything.

237
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,828
Yeah.

238
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,497
What are your names
and occupations?

239
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,665
Okay, my friends.

240
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,734
You can just call us,
and we'll pick you up

241
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,637
whenever you're ready
to come back.

242
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,572
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.

243
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:19,975
Just follow the path
down to the beach.

244
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,543
- Is that also food?
- Yeah.

245
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:25,547
Wow. That's a lot of food.

246
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,515
Well, kids eat a lot of food.

247
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,217
And you got
three of them with you.

248
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,086
Okay.

249
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,789
Seems like a waste,
but thank you.

250
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,394
Could you help us carry
some of these bags, please?

251
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:41,663
We've got an elderly person
here and a child.

252
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,565
I'm sorry. I got to get back.

253
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,400
But it's not far.
Just walk down.

254
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,169
You'll see a beautiful
slot canyon.

255
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,004
Walk through that, and in
a few minutes, you'll be there.

256
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,404
Enjoy, everybody.

257
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,274
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.

258
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,443
Do you think there's snakes?

259
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,610
Of course.

260
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:56,778
Cool. I want to see one.

261
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:02,484
- Gorgeous.
- Wow.

262
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,421
Okay.

263
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:10,424
You okay?

264
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,493
Yeah?

265
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,948
Could, uh,
someone please tell me

266
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,316
what just happened?

267
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:35,583
Look out.

268
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:36,985
Oh, this is so exciting.

269
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,386
Careful, Maddox.

270
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,799
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win.

271
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:19,827
Wow.

272
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,462
I just got chills.

273
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,933
Come on, darling.

274
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:27,302
Let's show Gustav the sea.

275
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,106
Hey. Maddox, Maddox, look.

276
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,941
Listen, I...
Let's move somewhere else.

277
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,975
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

278
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,611
- No, but I...
- No, it's...

279
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,413
Look, it's beautiful.

280
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,195
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

281
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,303
They were right to send us.

282
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,505
Lie down.

283
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,242
Good boy.

284
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,178
Kids, look at
the beautiful coral.

285
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,414
I'm gonna get... Aah! Stop!

286
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:14,916
What are you going to do?

287
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:16,517
Now I'm gonna splash you.

288
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,419
Just keep on reading, I guess.

289
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,355
You just splashed me.

290
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,856
Stop!

291
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,992
I didn't mean to splash you.

292
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,294
- Guy?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,264
What book am I reading?

294
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,970
I don't know.

295
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,739
Why?

296
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,409
No reason.

297
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,284
Prisca, I wanted
to tell you something.

298
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,590
No, never mind.

299
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,391
I'll tell you later.

300
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,698
Oh, my God.

301
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,935
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.

302
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,637
What? Mid what?

303
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,138
He's a rapper.

304
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,806
"More Dough for the Cookin'"?

305
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,442
- Mid-Sized Sedan?
- Begin an activity.

306
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,877
- Dad, I have to. I have to!
- Yes. Okay.

307
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,211
You and Mom on one side.

308
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:18,446
No, no, no, no, no. Leave him.

309
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,047
Sounds like fun. Come on.

310
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,082
No, because it's, like,
a private, you know...

311
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,284
No, Dad, stop! I need to say hi.

312
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:23,418
He's on vacation.
He's on vacation.

313
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,486
What's his surname? Sedan?

314
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,624
Oh! Oh.

315
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,394
Whoa.

316
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,461
Whoa. All right.

317
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,496
Here's a big one. Aah!

318
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,432
Help me with this.

319
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,536
We should have
a housewarming party.

320
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,374
Isn't our house so beautiful?

321
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:00,188
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

322
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,089
- Come. Come back here!
- No!

323
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,293
Not gonna get me!

324
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,328
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.

325
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,929
Come on.

326
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:11,766
- Not gonna get me!
- No, I am.

327
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,567
Come on, Kara.

328
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,638
Whoa! Oh, my God.

329
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,506
Caught you.

330
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,278
Ha. Never gonna catch me.

331
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,614
Honey, I'm home.

332
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:30,217
I told you,
I don't want to live like this.

333
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

334
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,689
I'm going for a drive
to calm down.

335
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,192
I'm really, really hungry.

336
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,895
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

337
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,597
Me, too.

338
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,813
Wow.

339
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:01,882
Who would leave this?

340
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,919
Hey, Mom!

341
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,854
From the hotel!

342
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:08,523
They're so rusted.

343
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,158
Put that down!

344
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,594
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself.

345
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,362
Come away.

346
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,098
- Next activity.
- What's happening?

347
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,666
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
- I don't know.

348
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:20,869
They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.

349
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,006
18, 19, 20.

350
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,510
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

351
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:46,727
Mom!

352
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,963
Mom! Mom!

353
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:53,634
Mom! Mom! Mom!

354
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,238
What is it? What is it?

355
00:20:58,272 --> 00:20:59,908
- Trent?
- Someone over there.

356
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,275
Over where?

357
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:14,422
Come on,
give me a hand. Get the legs.

358
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,233
Make your list.

359
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,734
- Make your list.
- Okay.

360
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,268
- Red and orange.
- Red, orange.

361
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,103
Come away from here, babies.

362
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:32,841
Let the doctor try
and help this lady, yeah?

363
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,708
- Green.
- Green.

364
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,079
- Tan.
- Tan.

365
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,313
- Purple.
- Purple.

366
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:40,814
- What happened?
- It's okay.

367
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,650
- Blue.
- Blue. Blue is good.

368
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:44,151
- In there.
- Green.

369
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:45,419
- Green, yes.
- Yellow.

370
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:46,754
Yellow. I love yellow.

371
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,689
Call the police, right?

372
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:51,192
I'll get my mobile.

373
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,194
Oh, damn.

374
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,849
What happened to her, Mom?

375
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,551
I don't know.

376
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,920
- I'm still hungry.
- Me, too.

377
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:23,357
Was she with you?

378
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,325
I was waiting for her.

379
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,328
She swam out by herself.

380
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:30,899
Yo, I don't know
what the hell happened.

381
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,400
I ain't saying nothing else.

382
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:34,836
Did you strike him?

383
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,471
I don't need to know
the context of...

384
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,305
What? No. Of course not.

385
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:40,909
So why's your nose bleeding?

386
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,844
I told y'all, I ain't got
nothing to say to you.

387
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,284
My chest feels funny.

388
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:52,687
Well, you know,

389
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:55,422
we should've gotten a yacht,
like I suggested, Agnes.

390
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,426
You shouldn't have
fought me on that.

391
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,328
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

392
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,398
I mean, I...

393
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:11,039
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.

394
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:12,607
I have to take it off.

395
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,809
Well, just loosen your...

396
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,949
We're from Philadelphia.

397
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,284
I'm on a break here with
my wife and kids. That's them.

398
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:26,987
That... Well, yeah, over there.

399
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:32,226
And for the record, I know
most people who die on vacation

400
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:35,896
die from sun exposure,
overexertion,

401
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,565
overindulgence
of food or alcohol

402
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,769
or-or a mixture of all
of the above 99.4% of the time.

403
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,771
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

404
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:45,773
I calculate people's
insurance rates

405
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,842
based on their risk profile.

406
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,580
I ain't do nothing, man.

407
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:56,016
She was into me.

408
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:01,422
Somebody will figure this out.

409
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:03,890
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

410
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,960
No reception at all.

411
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:09,496
I guess our beach day's over.

412
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,833
You got to keep an eye
on him and the body.

413
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,406
Oh, my goodness.

414
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:20,207
Wow.

415
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,812
Did you just get
dropped off by the resort?

416
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:26,346
Yeah. We were supposed
to come earlier,

417
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,282
but we rested in the room first.

418
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:29,917
Great. We have to get
the resort people

419
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:31,419
before they leave.

420
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:33,121
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

421
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:34,354
Wait. Why?

422
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:35,657
They left already.

423
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,057
What happened?

424
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:50,971
We really don't know
what happened.

425
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,107
Well, I think this man had
something to do with it.

426
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,475
Man, if I was involved,

427
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:55,876
why would I be
standing around, bro?

428
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,711
- Damn.
- His nose is bleeding.

429
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,280
I think he got that when she
was trying to defend herself.

430
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:01,049
I don't like
this dynamic at all.

431
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,051
Yo, my nose has been bleeding
for hours, man.

432
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,053
I don't know why
it's doing that.

433
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,688
Charles, something's wrong
with your mother.

434
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,756
She's asking for you, honey.

435
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:12,560
Well, we're all in this now.

436
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:14,728
We are responsible
for that woman.

437
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:16,397
And I've got nothing
against this man.

438
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:19,366
I'm just doing
what needs to be done.

439
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,703
No cell phone reception
on this beach.

440
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,137
You stay here.

441
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:24,471
I'll go to the clearing
in the jungle

442
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:25,907
where they dropped us
and try to call.

443
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,808
They obviously have
a signal out here.

444
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,344
- How else do people call to go back?
- Right.

445
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:50,164
Oh, my God.

446
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,366
You stumbled back out.
You were holding your head.

447
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,268
You looked like
you were in pain, babe.

448
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:57,938
You blacked out.

449
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:00,040
I felt this pressure in my head.

450
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,311
Are you okay?

451
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:06,279
I'm fine, Charles.

452
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:08,448
I-I think it's the shock.

453
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,886
Try to help Gustav,
or he'll be sick.

454
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,720
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

455
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,723
Listen, I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

456
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,092
but first, I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

457
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,726
Are you okay?

458
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,361
Yeah.

459
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:23,630
I know you've been stressed.

460
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:26,233
Don't let this upset you.

461
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:28,702
Help these people
through this, Charles.

462
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,073
So, what did you hear?

463
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,942
Help these people through
this, Charles.

464
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:37,845
Excuse me.

465
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:42,717
Excuse me. I saw you were
talking to my husband.

466
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:45,419
I know you're dealing with a
lot with that woman right now,

467
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,420
but something is wrong
with my son.

468
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:49,323
- Some kind of reaction.
- Is... is it severe?

469
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:51,057
I don't have time for this.

470
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,894
What kind of doctor are you?

471
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:55,329
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

472
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,631
You don't know me.

473
00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:00,635
I curate exhibits for museums.

474
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,837
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

475
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,839
and not think I'm being
hysterical when I say

476
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,475
there's something very wrong
with my child.

477
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,777
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

478
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,947
You look different, too.

479
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,681
How?

480
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:16,516
Uh, I don't know.

481
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,453
You just look different.

482
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,354
Hold my hand.

483
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,323
Okay.

484
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,094
Willow.

485
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:30,031
Japanese maple. Evergreen.

486
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,300
If you get scared,
just tell me, okay?

487
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,703
What do you keep looking at?

488
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,805
- There.
- Where?

489
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,108
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

490
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:43,710
What do you see?

491
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,280
I thought I saw
something shiny.

492
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,748
Here comes Mom.

493
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:54,722
Charles, she stopped breathing!

494
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,824
She stopped breathing!

495
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:00,894
I didn't do anything, Charles.

496
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,030
You guys just...
you just walked away,

497
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:05,399
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

498
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,067
She... I mean, she was peaceful.

499
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:09,337
Can you step back, please?

500
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,539
We'll take the kids
away from here.

501
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:13,541
Is this happening?

502
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,589
She couldn't take the shock.

503
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:32,060
She-she saw a murdered woman,
and her heart couldn't take it.

504
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:35,563
What are your names
and occupations?

505
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,931
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

506
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,501
I'm Patricia.
I'm a psychologist.

507
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,402
He remembers everyone's names

508
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:44,772
and things about them.

509
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:46,908
Everything's gonna be okay.

510
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,575
What's your name?

511
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:50,177
I'm Trent.

512
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,845
This is my sister Maddox.

513
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,514
How old are you guys?

514
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:56,516
I'll guess. I'm good at this.

515
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,719
You're 11, right, Trent?

516
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,922
I'm six.

517
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:02,456
No.

518
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:04,525
Really, are you ten, 11?

519
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:07,260
He's not lying. He's six.

520
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:10,531
I'm specifically
six and a quarter.

521
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,800
She's 11.

522
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,137
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

523
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,971
They're playing with us.

524
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:19,607
Let's leave it.

525
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,610
Okay, what's
your best friend's name?

526
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,444
Maddox.

527
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,313
How sweet.

528
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,415
Have you seen my children?

529
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,320
Is-is everyone trying
to play a joke on us?

530
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:34,921
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

531
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:36,991
I'm right here, Mom.

532
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,261
Mom?

533
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:43,831
Mom.

534
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:54,042
Why are you looking
at me like that?

535
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,586
Prisca.

536
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,755
I think we should leave.

537
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,757
Get the kids back to the resort.

538
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,493
Guy.

539
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:32,179
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

540
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:37,584
What's going on?

541
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:51,098
You see? You see?

542
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,351
Damn.

543
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,588
- How'd we get here?
- Take it easy.

544
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:50,423
Intense cranial pressure.

545
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:52,493
It's like being deep underwater.

546
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:57,398
Hey, can you get up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy.

547
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:01,134
Charles?

548
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:02,703
- Yeah, no, I'm-I'm all right.
- You okay?

549
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,271
I'm fine. I'm all good.

550
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,073
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

551
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:08,942
For some reason, people are
blacking out going this way.

552
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,777
Three people
have blacked out now.

553
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:12,246
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, no, no.

554
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,114
I saw it, Prisca.
I saw Jarin black out.

555
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:17,751
What I know is that we have to
get these kids to a hospital.

556
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,620
Now.

557
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:21,755
Look, let's stop
talking about it.

558
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,591
The kids are scared.

559
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:27,093
I can stay here with them,
but everyone else should try

560
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:30,563
and find a different pathway
off this beach.

561
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:32,565
Break off into groups of two

562
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,601
in case people black out.

563
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:38,005
Chrystal, go with me.

564
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:56,423
Whoa.

565
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:58,125
Whatever you do,
just stay close.

566
00:32:58,158 --> 00:33:00,494
- I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
- Just... Hmm?

567
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,028
Don't get up too quickly.

568
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:04,497
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk
for a second.

569
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:07,334
No. Mom, we're scared.

570
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,271
Please, stay right here.

571
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:11,805
Okay?

572
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:14,542
If I cry,
please don't let them see.

573
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:15,842
I won't.

574
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,011
Your hands are shaking.

575
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:18,344
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

576
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,414
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah. You okay?

577
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:24,217
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

578
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,353
That is just
statistically impossible.

579
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:28,289
All three kids are reacting
to something.

580
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:29,857
Only the kids.

581
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,059
I mean, look at
the doctor's daughter.

582
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:36,330
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

583
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,698
Or they caught something.

584
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:41,368
We're on a remote,
undeveloped island,

585
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,404
but we have a doctor here, so...

586
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:46,707
let's get the doc
to look at the kids.

587
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,050
I still can't get any reception.

588
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,719
Doctor, before we do
anything else,

589
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:01,856
can you take a look
at our children, please?

590
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,360
He's got a knife!

591
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,829
There's a damn hole in my cheek.

592
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:11,432
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

593
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:13,499
Put that down right now, Doctor.

594
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:15,569
Watch out, Jarin.

595
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,272
Listen, I don't know
why I did that.

596
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:21,342
I thought he was
gonna hurt me. Sorry.

597
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:22,775
Sorry.

598
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,544
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?
- Okay.

599
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:26,780
- Let me see that laceration.
- Man, that's assault, man!

600
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,249
- Just-just...
- Calm down.

601
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:31,851
What's your name?

602
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,754
Mid-Sized Sedan.

603
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,424
I must be in shock. I'm numb.

604
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,225
I'm not feeling
the pain no more.

605
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,561
Please, let me see.

606
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:51,372
No, this is not making
any sense, Prisca.

607
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:53,573
I need to get
my ass to a hospital now.

608
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:57,178
What's with all y'all faces?

609
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:01,082
It's hard to explain.

610
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:05,985
This is messed-up, man.

611
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:07,553
Where'd it go?

612
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:09,555
This is some kind
of parlor trick.

613
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:11,824
Yo, I know I tried to dip,

614
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:14,262
but I am freaked, man.

615
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:17,430
I just want to go back
to my hotel room.

616
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:20,566
This was supposed to be
a zen trip, man.

617
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,302
She and I only started talking

618
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,104
because she was sick
and so am I.

619
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,972
She had just been
diagnosed with MS,

620
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,675
so we started rapping
about that.

621
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,910
I didn't do nothing
to that girl, man.

622
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,346
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

623
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,814
backstroking and whatnot.

624
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,449
She swam way the hell out.

625
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,251
What did you say?

626
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:40,020
No, I-I-I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

627
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,587
I don't watch
the Summer Olympics like that.

628
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:42,990
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

629
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,425
- and so did she?
- Yes.

630
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:45,959
I thought that was
a cool coincidence.

631
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:48,195
Maybe this is some kind
of group psychosis.

632
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:49,829
I've studied this.

633
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:52,599
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

634
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:56,003
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.

635
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,442
Mom, is there any more food?

636
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:03,811
I'm still hungry.

637
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:05,678
Well, she's definitely aged.

638
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:07,680
Honey, how can you
still be hungry? We just...

639
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,048
I'd put her biological age

640
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,616
somewhere between 12 and 13,

641
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,354
and she turned six
two weeks ago Tuesday.

642
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,655
What?

643
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,358
We're older?

644
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,526
Am I okay?

645
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,161
I don't know what's happening

646
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,030
to the three of you, sweetheart.

647
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:26,233
For now, I have
another swimsuit in my bag,

648
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:29,635
and maybe you should
change into that.

649
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,504
Uh, it might be a virus, maybe.

650
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,240
Could be mosquitoes where...

651
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,309
the way they behave
on this part of the island.

652
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:38,044
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

653
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:40,046
- The dog has died!
- Oh, my God.

654
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,215
Oh, my God.

655
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:43,717
He was only just alive.

656
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:45,151
Kara, hold on to me, baby.

657
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,753
What's happening?

658
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,857
Who thinks they can swim

659
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:53,359
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents

660
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:56,329
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount

661
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:58,599
along the coast
till we find another shore?

662
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:01,034
That's what I'm guessing
the distance is

663
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:04,104
to swim out
and get around this cove.

664
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,718
It looks too far, babe.

665
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,019
It's not safe.

666
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,021
My name is Brendon.

667
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,525
I went to private school,
my mom is an attorney,

668
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:27,059
and my dad is a dentist.

669
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,797
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

670
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:31,798
I have a problem with my blood.

671
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:33,733
A rare issue with its clotting.

672
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,136
I came to this island
to see the ocean

673
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:40,239
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

674
00:37:40,273 --> 00:37:43,376
That's beautiful, Brendon.

675
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,978
I don't feel the same way

676
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,713
I felt yesterday
or this morning,

677
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:49,182
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

678
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,485
My thoughts have
more colors in them now.

679
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,890
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

680
00:37:56,923 --> 00:38:00,327
and now I have more
and they're quieter.

681
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,729
Okay!

682
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,765
Everyone, gather!

683
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,834
Come on, come on, come on.

684
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,602
Everyone needs to have
a voice here.

685
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,737
Are you sure
we have time for this?

686
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,273
We will make
destructive decisions

687
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,907
if we don't feel safe
with each other.

688
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:16,743
I know we don't have time,
but...

689
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:18,946
why don't we start with you two?

690
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:20,948
Why are you here?

691
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:25,252
We've been having
a tough time...

692
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:26,820
Chrystal.

693
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:28,454
W-We've been going
through something.

694
00:38:28,488 --> 00:38:30,290
He's under a lot of stress
as a doctor.

695
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:32,091
- He needed some time away.
- Everyone does.

696
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,093
- I'm not unusual in that.
- Charles, it's okay.

697
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,862
I'm not gonna say anything else.

698
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,331
Good!

699
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:39,332
It's nice to hear from you both.

700
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:41,367
How about you guys?

701
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:46,506
Prisca?

702
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:48,374
It's nothing.

703
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,843
We just have to make a decision.

704
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,979
The kids are reacting
to something.

705
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:55,882
It's a virus.
It's-it's probably a virus.

706
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:59,052
I just need to catch my breath.

707
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,121
I just started feeling weird
a minute ago.

708
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:02,523
Are you okay, Mom?

709
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:04,124
- Mom?
- What's wrong?

710
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:05,825
- Um...
- Are you okay, Mom?

711
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:07,393
I don't think it's the...

712
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,329
- She has a tumor.
- What?

713
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:11,331
But it's benign. It...
They said it's benign.

714
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,434
- Oh, my God.
- Mom...

715
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:17,337
- Wow. Um...
- Is it... Where?

716
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:18,505
Mom?

717
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:19,706
It's okay.

718
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:21,240
Can I...

719
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:23,409
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.

720
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,812
No, it's supposed
to be three centimeters.

721
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:27,680
All right. Let-let me see.

722
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,215
- Whoa, whoa.
- Mom!

723
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:30,817
- Prisca.
- She's gonna faint.

724
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,184
- She's gonna faint.
- Wait. - Prisca. - Mom. Mom!

725
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:34,955
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

726
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:39,559
It's there.

727
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:42,195
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

728
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:44,097
Jesus.

729
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,532
- It's grown.
- What?

730
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,400
- What's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.

731
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:49,202
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.
- Dad.

732
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:51,204
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys

733
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:52,905
go play somewhere else
on the beach, okay?

734
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,575
Okay?
Mom's just a little bit tired.

735
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,209
Would you do that for me, tiger?

736
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:57,611
The first adult's
being affected.

737
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,246
Okay, what if we cut it out?

738
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:00,746
- Dad!
- Not possible.

739
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,182
Actually, it is.

740
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:03,684
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!

741
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:05,084
No, no, no. No.

742
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:06,786
I don't want to make
this decision. No.

743
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,022
No, I...

744
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:11,125
I don't know what to do.

745
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,965
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.

746
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:19,967
Some bottles from the minibar.

747
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,534
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?

748
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,537
Yes.

749
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,872
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

750
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,474
We're gonna have to sew this up.

751
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:29,108
Um, yeah, yeah. Uh...

752
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,877
Here. Here.
Is this the right decision?

753
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,279
Maybe we should all
talk about this.

754
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:33,313
I can't think.

755
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,081
This tumor is going to kill her.

756
00:40:40,086 --> 00:40:44,457
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

757
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,693
Oh, no.

758
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:47,995
What is he saying?

759
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,463
Wh-What was the name
of that film?

760
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:51,064
- Charles, breathe.
- Are you okay?

761
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,466
Yes.

762
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,067
Will you just let me
do my job, please?

763
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,468
Is he okay?

764
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:18,958
Cut her again.

765
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:21,028
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

766
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,130
Guy, I can help, brother.

767
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:24,865
No. No, I'll take care of her.

768
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,499
Does anyone know
the name of that film?

769
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:28,934
It was with Jack Nicholson...

770
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,138
and Marlon Brando.

771
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,539
Both!

772
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:34,106
Try again, Doctor.

773
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,308
Oblique incision
on the side of the belly.

774
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:38,177
Four to six inches.
You can do this.

775
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,050
Put your fingers
inside the incision.

776
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:44,684
Okay.

777
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,654
Can you open it
a little wider, please?

778
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:49,488
It's closing around my fingers.

779
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,190
Keep pulling it apart.

780
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:52,793
That's it.

781
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,361
I'm lifting the tumor out.

782
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:57,030
Wow!

783
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:58,664
It's the size of a cantaloupe.

784
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,466
W-Wait.

785
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:02,802
It's attached to something.

786
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,004
Muscle tissue.

787
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:05,706
Okay. You, um,

788
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:08,541
hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would.

789
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:11,343
I'm so sorry, Pris.

790
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:13,846
Just cutting
underneath the tumor.

791
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:17,284
Okay. Got it.

792
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:31,964
Mom.

793
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,767
Prisca?

794
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:37,504
Mom?

795
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:55,554
It's okay.

796
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:57,457
I just fainted.

797
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:01,227
We took the tumor out.

798
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,262
It was going to kill you.

799
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:07,900
Your husband made
a fast decision.

800
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:21,347
Guy, I feel better.

801
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,636
Damn.

802
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:47,039
Come on, y'all, look at this!

803
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,643
Hurry!

804
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,582
Damn.

805
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:57,651
Come on, y'all.

806
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:08,428
Can we all agree
I didn't do that?

807
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:10,030
What happened to her?

808
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:12,365
The body has decomposed.

809
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:14,700
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.

810
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:16,335
Mom knows this stuff.

811
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:18,671
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

812
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:21,207
but from excavations
for the museum,

813
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,476
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

814
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,479
My best guess... an exposed body,

815
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:31,684
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

816
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,687
And this happened in what,
three hours?

817
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,121
I know.

818
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:37,056
And bones, we found,
will disintegrate

819
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,025
in 30 years more.

820
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:40,793
The hell, man?

821
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:42,829
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,

822
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:44,497
you just return to dust.

823
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,066
What exactly are we saying?

824
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,201
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

825
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,838
Time?

826
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:58,611
You have wrinkles.

827
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:13,861
I'm scared.

828
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:21,501
It's best to focus
on specifics in the present

829
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:23,336
in unsettling situations.

830
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:24,571
Mm-hmm.

831
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:25,839
Like breathing.

832
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,843
What's happening to us?

833
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:31,410
Are we sick, too?

834
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:32,912
No, I don't think so.

835
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:35,381
I think we're just growing.

836
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:37,851
Going by
Trent and Maddox's ages

837
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:39,852
and the time we spent
on this beach,

838
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:42,354
half an hour is equivalent

839
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:45,090
to something like one year
of our lives.

840
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:46,760
This must be true for all of us.

841
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:48,695
We just don't see it
on everyone.

842
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:50,296
You know, it's the first time

843
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,131
- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:54,534
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

845
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:58,537
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.

846
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,706
We're staying roughly
the same mass.

847
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,742
Our cells are just aging.

848
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:05,144
I don't feel the same.

849
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:08,113
It's like my mind
is changing, too.

850
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:11,250
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

851
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:13,954
It's weird.

852
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,459
I'm not as scared about
what's happening to us.

853
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:23,496
What about our hair and nails?

854
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:26,265
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

855
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:28,668
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells

856
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,637
in hair and nails are dead

857
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,106
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

858
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:36,476
On this beach,
60 minutes is two years.

859
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:40,780
We'll age almost 50 years
in one day here.

860
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:43,450
Almost a lifetime.

861
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:48,956
I think it could be the
rock that surrounds this beach.

862
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,959
If our cells are being affected,

863
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:56,528
speeding up in their processes,

864
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:59,365
then us trying to leave is like

865
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:03,168
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.

866
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:06,039
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

867
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:08,976
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

868
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,678
Maybe...

869
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,315
we could slowly walk
through the canyon.

870
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:19,452
Take a step, stand still.

871
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:23,456
Do it over eight to ten hours.

872
00:47:23,488 --> 00:47:25,525
Let our bodies acclimate.

873
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,695
But according to
Prisca's timeline,

874
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:32,499
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

875
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:34,467
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

876
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:36,736
Let's not shut down
everyone's experience.

877
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:39,238
Wait. Where are the kids?

878
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:44,410
Trent!

879
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:45,744
Kara!

880
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:48,048
Answer us now!

881
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,381
We need you here!

882
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:50,750
There they are.

883
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:07,868
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

884
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:26,419
Hey.

885
00:48:26,452 --> 00:48:28,388
Mom! Dad!

886
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,273
Kara?

887
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:49,208
What did you do?

888
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,044
We were just playing. It's okay.

889
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:52,412
I just got a little fat.

890
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:53,847
Mom, you're better.

891
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,617
Maddox?

892
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,052
Maddox.

893
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:00,352
It's okay, Trent.

894
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:04,291
Just let Mom and Dad
figure this out.

895
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,496
My God, Guy.

896
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:11,264
It's okay, right, Mom?

897
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:15,267
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando

898
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,903
were in a movie together.

899
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:20,339
If she walked into
the emergency room,

900
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:23,142
I'd say she's about
five months pregnant.

901
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:24,744
- What?
- What?

902
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,479
Just stay calm, Trent.

903
00:49:26,512 --> 00:49:29,015
She'll only be pregnant
for about 20 minutes

904
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:30,683
from the time of conception.

905
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:32,084
Why do you keep looking at me

906
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:33,452
like you want
to steal my wallet?

907
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:35,121
Do you want me
to punch you in the face?

908
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:36,588
Calm down.

909
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:38,091
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

910
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:40,959
All right.
Let's just concentrate

911
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:42,928
on the issue at hand.

912
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:44,664
Do you know about movies?

913
00:49:44,697 --> 00:49:46,666
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

914
00:49:46,698 --> 00:49:48,767
Okay, we need to get her help.

915
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,702
Okay? This cannot happen here.

916
00:49:50,735 --> 00:49:52,271
- It's gotten bigger.
- Kara.

917
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:54,307
- It's Kara, right?
- Yeah.

918
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,543
- Lay down on a blanket.
- It's gonna be okay.

919
00:49:56,575 --> 00:49:58,544
There's a lot of people here
that can help you.

920
00:49:58,577 --> 00:50:00,112
We're all like your family now.

921
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:02,715
Oh, God.

922
00:50:02,747 --> 00:50:04,784
Our cells are aging
very fast here.

923
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:07,019
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

924
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,654
Just lay down
on the sand. Okay.

925
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:10,122
Whatever would have
happened to us

926
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:11,724
is happening to us really fast.

927
00:50:11,756 --> 00:50:13,226
Okay.

928
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:14,827
What you did is
how babies are made.

929
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,628
I know, but I thought
you had to do that

930
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,497
ten times or something.

931
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,233
Did I get that wrong?

932
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:22,534
Look, it can happen
after only once.

933
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:26,171
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

934
00:50:26,204 --> 00:50:28,207
Are Trent and I having a baby?

935
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,909
Did I get it wrong?

936
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:32,177
Only a couple
of minutes left if we're right.

937
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,180
- Is that the baby?
- You got it. Okay.

938
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:35,715
- Mom.
- Charles!

939
00:50:35,747 --> 00:50:37,182
- Kara?
- I...

940
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:38,650
I need to think about
what to do.

941
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:40,753
- Mom, I think I...
- No. I need to help her.

942
00:50:40,785 --> 00:50:41,988
Mom!

943
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:43,323
- I'm scared!
- It's okay.

944
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:44,991
- Kara. - Wait.
- Mom, it's coming.

945
00:50:45,023 --> 00:50:46,391
Stay with me. Stay with me.

946
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:48,160
Come on, baby.

947
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:50,095
- Can you hold her hand? Kara?
- I've decided...

948
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:52,431
I'm gonna marry her, and we are
never gonna yell at each other,

949
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:54,200
and we are never
getting divorced!

950
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:56,401
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain.

951
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:58,403
Intense pain. Okay?

952
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:00,105
Like she never felt before.

953
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:02,008
But then it's going to pass.

954
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,443
Okay? It's going to pass.

955
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:09,115
Chrystal.

956
00:51:09,148 --> 00:51:11,718
Chrystal!

957
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:13,919
Hey, you blacked out.

958
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:16,456
You can't go that way.

959
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,291
Come on. You're okay now.

960
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:20,026
Come on.

961
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:21,427
Get up.

962
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,095
Come here.

963
00:51:23,128 --> 00:51:25,197
Look.

964
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:32,405
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

965
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,439
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.

966
00:51:34,472 --> 00:51:36,375
We looked that up,
remember, Mom?

967
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:50,389
We put him
on the towel to clean him up.

968
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:53,959
He looked around
and closed his eyes.

969
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:56,996
We had him on the towel
for one minute.

970
00:51:57,028 --> 00:51:58,997
He died from lack of attention.

971
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,999
Things are moving too fast here

972
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:03,168
for a baby to survive.

973
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:05,305
No. No, you're lying.

974
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,006
You're lying! You're all lying!

975
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,841
- Trent. Shut up, Trent!
- You're lying! You're lying!

976
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:11,511
- You're lying!
- Hey, hey, hey.

977
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:16,716
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

978
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:21,153
Charles.

979
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:22,988
- Get us out of here!
- It's my baby.

980
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:24,756
Get us out of here now!

981
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:26,793
You were supposed to protect us!

982
00:52:26,825 --> 00:52:28,994
You didn't protect us!

983
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:31,631
Kara's hurt!

984
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:33,932
I will make these decisions.

985
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:35,868
Just give me a second.

986
00:52:40,572 --> 00:52:42,275
I used to see you
in our neighborhood.

987
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:44,010
Who... who are you?

988
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,380
I'm Jarin!

989
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:51,217
I-I don't know where you live.

990
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,022
Don't condescend to me.

991
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,327
Put some makeup on your face.

992
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:22,615
I'm sorry about the baby.

993
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:27,619
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

994
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:31,557
His name was Giuseppe.

995
00:53:32,858 --> 00:53:35,762
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.

996
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:40,366
We looked silly together,
he and I.

997
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:51,544
He had nothing to offer.

998
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,282
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

999
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,729
Leave me alone.

1000
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:23,943
Charles, stop!

1001
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:26,746
Stop! Stop!

1002
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:39,157
He's gone.

1003
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:40,959
Oh, God.

1004
00:54:51,637 --> 00:54:54,240
Bring your bag.
Okay, come here.

1005
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:07,519
I'm just going to take it...

1006
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,494
- ...now.
- It's okay.

1007
00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:17,030
Everything will be okay.

1008
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,284
I'll find another beach,
and I'll try to find help.

1009
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:41,621
She needs her medicine.

1010
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,456
We're lucky she hasn't
had a seizure yet.

1011
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:46,325
It must be the beach,
whatever it's doing to my body.

1012
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:50,063
Guy, I was on the swim team.
I'll make it.

1013
00:55:52,064 --> 00:55:53,600
I'll make it.

1014
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,608
Watch him.

1015
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,026
Maybe I could climb that rock.

1016
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:24,229
Maybe the effect,
the blacking out,

1017
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:26,531
doesn't happen if you go up.

1018
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,601
You can't do it.

1019
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,535
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong.

1020
00:56:30,568 --> 00:56:32,371
- He can do it. He can do it.
- Yeah.

1021
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:34,840
No. I won't allow
my son to do that.

1022
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:36,508
Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.

1023
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:38,209
It's a last resort.

1024
00:56:38,242 --> 00:56:41,012
Mom...

1025
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:45,384
I do feel overwhelmed.

1026
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:49,354
I'm managing,
but no one must know.

1027
00:56:52,256 --> 00:56:55,293
They'll try to stop me
from working.

1028
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:58,030
What should I do?

1029
00:56:58,063 --> 00:57:00,666
Mom, tell me what to do.

1030
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:05,705
Prisca,
something's bothering me.

1031
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:09,275
Charles' family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

1032
00:57:09,307 --> 00:57:12,210
Someone in each group was sick.

1033
00:57:12,244 --> 00:57:14,213
How did you first hear
about this place?

1034
00:57:14,246 --> 00:57:16,715
I don't know. I-I fell upon it.

1035
00:57:16,749 --> 00:57:18,317
A random sweepstakes.

1036
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:20,652
It came with a receipt
at the pharmacy.

1037
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:23,488
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

1038
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,323
They know
our medical condition.

1039
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:27,293
They chose us.

1040
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:28,961
They have our passports.

1041
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:30,762
We could just disappear.

1042
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:33,232
They sent us a special car
to the airport.

1043
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:35,000
- A plane.
- They can...

1044
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,303
They can make it look like
we never left our house.

1045
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,588
You were thinking
about leaving Dad,

1046
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:59,058
weren't you?

1047
00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:07,066
Yes.

1048
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,869
I didn't want you two to suffer.

1049
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:16,675
Was there someone else?

1050
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,722
Did Dad know?

1051
00:58:40,932 --> 00:58:43,235
Maddox.

1052
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,470
Please.

1053
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:48,239
I found out about this tumor,

1054
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,575
and I got scared.

1055
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:54,345
I stare at the remains of
nameless people in glass cases,

1056
00:58:54,378 --> 00:58:57,482
and I kept thinking I'm going
to be one of those people.

1057
00:58:57,515 --> 00:58:59,218
Does that make any sense?

1058
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,724
I feel different
than I felt yesterday.

1059
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:09,028
What I did feels like
an illusion.

1060
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:10,530
I swear.

1061
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:14,867
Do you hate me now?

1062
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:19,639
I just need some time, Mom.

1063
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:27,447
We don't have that, baby.

1064
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:31,784
Look at you.

1065
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:36,455
You're an adult.

1066
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:41,626
Be strong for everyone.

1067
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:48,433
Connect to something bigger.

1068
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:49,360
Here, here. Dad.

1069
01:00:49,394 --> 01:00:51,330
Lay him down. Lay him down.

1070
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:16,988
He must have gone
unconscious swimming.

1071
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:21,861
Brendon didn't do anything
to that woman.

1072
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,597
We can't swim out, Prisca.

1073
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:37,008
We're not getting
off this beach.

1074
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,847
We never had a prom.

1075
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,414
Or a graduation.

1076
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:46,251
There are so many memories
we didn't have.

1077
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,021
It's not fair.

1078
01:01:54,226 --> 01:01:56,262
He needs to rest now.

1079
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,398
Kara.

1080
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,436
Kara.

1081
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:40,438
Wait. What if you get
dizzy up there?

1082
01:02:40,472 --> 01:02:42,608
- You might black out.
- Trent, we are in charge now.

1083
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,443
My dad could hurt more people.

1084
01:02:44,476 --> 01:02:46,378
I have to get him
off this beach.

1085
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,380
Kara! Don't climb that.

1086
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:49,981
Come down!

1087
01:02:50,014 --> 01:02:52,083
We'll find another way.

1088
01:02:52,117 --> 01:02:54,285
- No, don't! Trent.
- Listen to Mom.

1089
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:55,820
I have to go with her!

1090
01:02:55,854 --> 01:02:57,656
Kara, wait! Don't climb!

1091
01:02:57,689 --> 01:02:59,124
Let me get your mother!

1092
01:02:59,157 --> 01:03:00,559
- Kara!
- It's not the way.

1093
01:03:00,592 --> 01:03:02,294
She's panicked and desperate.

1094
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:03,996
Talk to each other.

1095
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:07,565
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

1096
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,133
What if we spend
this whole time trying

1097
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,735
to get out of here
and we still don't make it?

1098
01:03:12,671 --> 01:03:14,740
It'll be too short
if we don't try.

1099
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,307
No, Kara, please!

1100
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,376
Please just stay with me,
please.

1101
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:36,294
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

1102
01:03:37,863 --> 01:03:39,832
Go to the ledge and rest!

1103
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:47,205
There has to be a way out.

1104
01:03:47,238 --> 01:03:50,543
It's a mathematical certainty
there must be a way out.

1105
01:04:01,385 --> 01:04:02,653
No. Why is she stopping?

1106
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:03,722
No.

1107
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:08,293
No. Kara! Kara, wake up!

1108
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:09,827
Kara, wake up!

1109
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,429
Wake up!

1110
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:57,075
Kara.

1111
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:04,617
Daddy.

1112
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:25,604
Let's all stay together.

1113
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:28,640
Nobody in this family
goes alone anywhere.

1114
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:31,944
I think I figured it out.

1115
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:35,014
I'm using these to swim out.

1116
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:40,952
I have a sister.

1117
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:42,420
She's a therapist, too.

1118
01:05:42,454 --> 01:05:44,555
I need to get to my sister.

1119
01:05:44,588 --> 01:05:46,924
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

1120
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:50,262
She's older, but now I am.

1121
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:54,200
The fighting seems
ridiculous now.

1122
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:00,839
Patricia.

1123
01:06:00,872 --> 01:06:02,441
Patricia.

1124
01:06:03,874 --> 01:06:05,244
No.

1125
01:06:05,276 --> 01:06:06,845
Wh-What's happening to her?

1126
01:06:06,878 --> 01:06:08,247
What's going on?

1127
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,082
She was fine.
What-what's happening?

1128
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:12,485
She keeps
stopping and starting.

1129
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:18,657
No. Dad, do something.

1130
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:09,941
Oh, no.

1131
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:13,044
Kara?

1132
01:07:14,912 --> 01:07:17,582
Kara, where are you?

1133
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:24,423
Somebody's done this
to us, Kara.

1134
01:07:27,025 --> 01:07:30,329
I can't protect you anymore.

1135
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:32,363
Kara!

1136
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:43,941
No, you don't know.

1137
01:07:43,974 --> 01:07:45,743
Jarin went in a different way.

1138
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,612
He went on, and I... and I'm
a better swimmer than he is.

1139
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,948
He's older than me.
I-I can probably swim...

1140
01:07:49,981 --> 01:07:52,517
Trent, stop it. No. No.

1141
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,785
No, you're not
a better swimmer than him.

1142
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:56,220
Yeah, but let me try.

1143
01:07:56,253 --> 01:07:58,089
Listen. Listen.

1144
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:14,773
We're not gonna let you.

1145
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:16,974
Stop. It won't work.

1146
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:18,744
Well, I don't want to give up.

1147
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:20,212
- I really don't want to give up.
- We're not giving up.

1148
01:08:20,245 --> 01:08:21,747
And I think,
if you let me try...

1149
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:41,065
My back.

1150
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:42,933
I need my calcium.

1151
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:44,769
Chrystal?

1152
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:47,171
Chrystal, stay with us.

1153
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,207
Don't look at me.

1154
01:09:06,825 --> 01:09:10,028
Prisca, I have to
tell you something.

1155
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,170
I saw your text messages
one day.

1156
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:25,177
He says romantic things.

1157
01:09:31,383 --> 01:09:33,218
I'm sorry.

1158
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:40,157
I don't know who I would have
been okay with, but...

1159
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:42,061
with that guy?

1160
01:09:44,696 --> 01:09:46,465
He's-he's a joke.

1161
01:09:46,497 --> 01:09:49,067
He's a pretend person.

1162
01:09:49,099 --> 01:09:51,769
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1163
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:56,475
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1164
01:09:56,508 --> 01:09:59,211
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1165
01:09:59,244 --> 01:10:03,014
This was no one's
responsibility but me.

1166
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:06,451
Your anger should be aimed
at me, just me.

1167
01:10:13,724 --> 01:10:18,062
There's no place
I want to be but with you.

1168
01:10:19,863 --> 01:10:22,300
Do you believe me?

1169
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:26,237
I want to be here...

1170
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,909
...right now.

1171
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,299
It's notebooks.

1172
01:10:58,135 --> 01:11:01,106
Well, maybe we can use
some of the empty pages

1173
01:11:01,138 --> 01:11:03,775
for the fire,
keep Mom and Dad warm.

1174
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:10,781
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science fiction writer.

1175
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:13,585
It's full of story ideas.

1176
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:16,921
"Birds that can make you
black out when they scream

1177
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:20,959
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1178
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,596
He realized he was never
getting off this beach.

1179
01:11:26,697 --> 01:11:29,334
He's trying to figure out
what's going on.

1180
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,007
"Magnetism of this exact spot
on the Earth

1181
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,811
"with the rocks on this beach
submerged beneath the ocean

1182
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:43,248
"for millions of years
deposited with special minerals

1183
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:47,185
"are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1184
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:50,287
"Are there other places
like this?

1185
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:52,224
Who found this place?"

1186
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:57,161
Well, maybe we can make
a metal tube that we can get in

1187
01:11:57,195 --> 01:11:59,531
that stops the effects
on our cells.

1188
01:11:59,563 --> 01:12:01,265
Like at a dentist's office,
you know,

1189
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:03,835
when they put a metal vest
on us before an X-ray.

1190
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:06,537
I mean, then we could just
walk out with it on us and...

1191
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:08,173
I mean,
we'll get dizzy at first,

1192
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:09,807
but then, slowly,
we'll get used to it

1193
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,742
and we can leave, right?

1194
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:15,380
Where are we gonna make
a metal tube?

1195
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,483
He wrote down a list of all
the names and the addresses

1196
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:21,519
of the people with him
on the beach.

1197
01:12:30,894 --> 01:12:32,930
Maddox, that's a camera.

1198
01:12:34,732 --> 01:12:36,735
They're recording us.

1199
01:12:39,336 --> 01:12:41,372
Why would they do this?

1200
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:21,446
Who is that?

1201
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:23,648
Prisca, who is that?

1202
01:13:31,421 --> 01:13:33,659
You're gonna tell them
what I did.

1203
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:37,963
The man with the tattoos,

1204
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:42,133
he was gonna steal things
from my home.

1205
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,872
Guy!

1206
01:13:48,906 --> 01:13:50,108
No!

1207
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,611
I can't let you tell them.

1208
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:54,144
I'm a good doctor.

1209
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:55,546
He was gonna follow us.

1210
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,048
He was gonna steal things
from our home.

1211
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,449
Why don't you believe me?

1212
01:13:59,683 --> 01:14:00,785
I stopped him.

1213
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:05,423
Tell me where
the knife is, Prisca!

1214
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,262
I keep having these thoughts.

1215
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:14,432
Listen, they keep coming to me.

1216
01:14:14,464 --> 01:14:16,300
Don't tell anyone.

1217
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,438
Prisca!

1218
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:24,075
Hide the kids! I'll protect you!

1219
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:29,981
Yes.

1220
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:32,282
Maddox! Trent!

1221
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:36,021
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!

1222
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,956
Somewhere where
someone can't find you.

1223
01:14:37,988 --> 01:14:39,790
- I need you to go right now.
- Mom, what...

1224
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:41,358
And don't ask any questions.

1225
01:14:41,392 --> 01:14:43,495
Now, go! Hide!

1226
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:46,197
Go!

1227
01:14:57,375 --> 01:15:00,278
Shh.

1228
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:02,648
There's someone
in here with us.

1229
01:15:08,486 --> 01:15:11,222
My body hurts to move.

1230
01:15:11,254 --> 01:15:12,723
I miss Giuseppe.

1231
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:16,027
Don't look at me!

1232
01:15:16,059 --> 01:15:18,397
Turn off the light!

1233
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:24,369
I don't want to be seen!

1234
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:29,973
Kara's dead, isn't she?

1235
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:34,012
Whoever did this killed her,
didn't they?

1236
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:37,049
Kara died.

1237
01:15:38,683 --> 01:15:40,452
It was an accident.

1238
01:16:07,778 --> 01:16:09,747
Don't look.

1239
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:11,716
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.

1240
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:13,684
Turn off the light!

1241
01:16:13,718 --> 01:16:15,385
Go.

1242
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,356
Turn the light off.

1243
01:16:18,388 --> 01:16:20,791
I'm chief medical officer

1244
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:22,594
of my hospital!

1245
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:25,062
I am not gonna let...

1246
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,865
...take it away from me!

1247
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:27,659
It's rust.

1248
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:31,997
It acts like poison when it
gets into your bloodstream.

1249
01:17:55,652 --> 01:17:58,088
I'm sorry you were
on this beach.

1250
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:02,125
But this is my family.

1251
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:13,098
Dad, Mom, you guys
got to stay hydrated.

1252
01:19:14,732 --> 01:19:16,267
Mom.

1253
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:17,968
Mom.

1254
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:21,005

1266
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:30,874
We were.

1267
01:20:33,244 --> 01:20:37,482
Well, whatever it was, uh,
I'm not mad anymore.

1268
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:47,224
I can't remember.

1269
01:20:51,862 --> 01:20:54,566
Why did we want
to leave this beach?

1270
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:02,540
So beautiful.

1271
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:08,513
It doesn't matter.

1272
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:17,222
It's funny.

1273
01:21:19,022 --> 01:21:20,757
I...

1274
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,660
forget...

1275
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:25,397
the word.

1276
01:21:28,131 --> 01:21:30,602
It's about my feelings for you.

1277
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,906
I know.

1278
01:21:57,594 --> 01:21:59,329
- Dad.
- Dad?

1279
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:55,320
Mom?

1280
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:00,992
Oh, Mom.

1281
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,419
We have about...

1282
01:24:35,451 --> 01:24:38,088
13 hours left, do you think?

1283
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,237
We just got three days older
while you held my face.

1284
01:24:59,009 --> 01:25:01,579
Should we keep trying
to get out?

1285
01:25:04,915 --> 01:25:06,651
I guess so.

1286
01:25:11,287 --> 01:25:13,924
Want to make a sandcastle first?

1287
01:25:38,948 --> 01:25:41,285
I wonder if everybody

1288
01:25:41,317 --> 01:25:45,655
continues to feel like a kid
when they're our age, or...

1289
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,492
is it because
we were kids yesterday?

1290
01:25:50,794 --> 01:25:52,963
Idlib sent me
a message I never decoded.

1291
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:56,633
Yeah, we thought
we were so smart.

1292
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,571
Decode it.

1293
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:24,062
Each symbol means a letter.

1294
01:26:25,696 --> 01:26:27,732
We thought we were like spies.

1295
01:26:36,874 --> 01:26:38,943
What was the big message?

1296
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:52,023
What's it say?

1297
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,342
The coral might protect us

1298
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,577
from the effects of the rocks.

1299
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:16,679
Maybe that's like
our metal tube.

1300
01:27:16,713 --> 01:27:19,082
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.

1301
01:27:19,116 --> 01:27:21,919
Well, maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.

1302
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:23,920
Idlib heard something
he shouldn't have.

1303
01:27:23,954 --> 01:27:27,625
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.

1304
01:27:30,594 --> 01:27:33,063
He's trying to help us.

1305
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:34,732
Wait.

1306
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:36,901
I need to get something.

1307
01:29:54,304 --> 01:29:55,973
Both of them drowned.

1308
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,742
For a second,
I thought they were

1309
01:29:58,775 --> 01:30:00,744
gonna get through the coral.

1310
01:30:00,777 --> 01:30:02,713
I don't know how they suddenly
thought about going there.

1311
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:04,781
Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?

1312
01:30:04,814 --> 01:30:06,383
We can't have another incident.

1313
01:30:06,415 --> 01:30:09,018
Sidney, relax. I watched
for a minute and a half.

1314
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:10,955
And the one person
who got through last year

1315
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:12,689
ended up drowning anyway.

1316
01:30:12,723 --> 01:30:14,592
We're fine.

1317
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:17,361
Final members of trial 73
are deceased.

1318
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:19,796
Observation's complete.

1319
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,466
Bringing drives back,
returning to base.

1320
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:43,680
All rooms for
this trial have been cleared.

1321
01:31:43,714 --> 01:31:46,316
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.

1322
01:31:46,348 --> 01:31:48,885
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1323
01:31:56,526 --> 01:31:58,295
Hello.

1324
01:31:58,327 --> 01:32:03,366
Uh, a moment of silence
for the members of trial 73.

1325
01:32:11,607 --> 01:32:12,976
Thank you.

1326
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:16,412
Mm.

1327
01:32:16,446 --> 01:32:19,082
I'll try not
to be dramatic. Uh...

1328
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,088
Because of this beach,

1329
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,323
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1330
01:32:27,357 --> 01:32:29,660
with new medicines.

1331
01:32:29,692 --> 01:32:32,762
Before we're done,
it will be millions.

1332
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:36,566
As you know,

1333
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:39,736
we do trials
and fail constantly.

1334
01:32:41,972 --> 01:32:44,575
But not today.

1335
01:32:44,607 --> 01:32:46,476
Tell them, Sidney.

1336
01:32:49,579 --> 01:32:51,849
One of this cohort, uh,

1337
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:55,384
was a woman with
the epileptic seizures.

1338
01:32:55,418 --> 01:32:57,387
Her name was
Patricia Carmichael.

1339
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,090
She suffered debilitating
seizures her whole life.

1340
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:02,125
Nothing could help her.

1341
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,361
The medicine we gave her
when she arrived

1342
01:33:04,393 --> 01:33:07,097
turned out to be
the exact mixture.

1343
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,700
She didn't have a seizure
for eight hours and 17 minutes.

1344
01:33:12,302 --> 01:33:14,338
16 and a half years.

1345
01:33:15,472 --> 01:33:17,907
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1346
01:33:17,941 --> 01:33:21,945
We'll now fast-track trials,
make that medicine

1347
01:33:21,978 --> 01:33:24,548
and share it
with the whole world.

1348
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,583
Every single person
that needs it.

1349
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:34,390
Nature made that beach exist
for a reason.

1350
01:33:34,424 --> 01:33:36,260
Warren and Warren was
meant to find it

1351
01:33:36,293 --> 01:33:37,827
on their research expedition.

1352
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:40,464
We were meant to test
medicines in one day

1353
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:43,232
instead of a lifetime.

1354
01:33:43,265 --> 01:33:46,637
Lots more work to be done,
everyone.

1355
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:50,507
Let's do what nature
wanted us to do.

1356
01:33:58,048 --> 01:34:00,017
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive

1357
01:34:00,049 --> 01:34:02,852
at 11:00 a.m.
with six nontargeted guests.

1358
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:05,688
Joseph Brody has
early-onset Parkinson's.

1359
01:34:06,689 --> 01:34:08,826
Florence Brody will be
accompanying him.

1360
01:34:08,858 --> 01:34:11,093
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nills.

1361
01:34:11,126 --> 01:34:13,095
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1362
01:34:13,129 --> 01:34:14,997
from the mental illness
subjects.

1363
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:16,500
Our violent
schizophrenic patient

1364
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:18,334
cost us the data
on our blood clot patient.

1365
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:21,170
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter
protocol at this point,

1366
01:34:21,204 --> 01:34:23,473
but, uh, put it in a form

1367
01:34:23,505 --> 01:34:25,742
and submit it
to Warren and Warren again.

1368
01:34:49,566 --> 01:34:51,035
How are you?

1369
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:54,972
Those kids went home.

1370
01:34:55,004 --> 01:34:56,405
They don't matter.

1371
01:34:56,438 --> 01:34:58,674
I tell you which kids
you can play with.

1372
01:34:58,707 --> 01:35:00,376
You have to trust me.

1373
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:01,912
And don't ask question.

1374
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:03,447
Okay?

1375
01:35:04,446 --> 01:35:06,549
- Okay.
- Good.

1376
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:08,719
Now, those kids are fine.

1377
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,888
See, you can play with them.

1378
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,688
Okay.

1379
01:35:12,722 --> 01:35:14,523
Good.

1380
01:35:30,807 --> 01:35:32,876
You're a police officer.

1381
01:35:35,111 --> 01:35:36,881
Yeah.

1382
01:35:55,497 --> 01:35:57,733
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1383
01:35:57,767 --> 01:36:01,905
Welcome to our version
of paradise.

1384
01:36:01,937 --> 01:36:04,240
Thank you.

1385
01:36:04,273 --> 01:36:06,776
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Thank you.

1386
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:08,978
This is Madrid.

1387
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:11,747
From your food and beverage
preferences that you selected,

1388
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,985
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.

1389
01:36:16,452 --> 01:36:17,955
Sorry.

1390
01:36:17,987 --> 01:36:19,289
Oh, no worries,
Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1391
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:20,957
We'll just make a new set.

1392
01:36:20,991 --> 01:36:22,626
It'll only take a few moments.

1393
01:36:22,659 --> 01:36:24,428
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1394
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,597
They left us all to die.

1395
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:31,668
My name is Trent Capa.

1396
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:34,071
I'm Maddox Capa.

1397
01:36:39,142 --> 01:36:41,812
All three are missing persons?

1398
01:36:42,812 --> 01:36:45,115
Sending you the rest
of the names now.

1399
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,590
Our parents are
Guy and Prisca Capa.

1400
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:58,161
We live at 707 Pine Street,
Philadelphia, USA.

1401
01:36:58,193 --> 01:36:59,996
Also with us was

1402
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:02,631
Jarin Carmichael,
who was a nurse;

1403
01:37:02,665 --> 01:37:05,435
Patricia Carmichael,
who was a psychologist...

1404
01:37:12,808 --> 01:37:14,610
Listen, we have to get security.

1405
01:37:14,643 --> 01:37:16,813
What's happening?
Are you listening to me?

1406
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,021
May I help you?

1407
01:37:58,021 --> 01:38:00,189
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1408
01:38:00,223 --> 01:38:01,525
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

1409
01:38:01,558 --> 01:38:03,026
I need your assistance
immediately.

1410
01:38:03,058 --> 01:38:05,327
Two of our guests need
your attention.

1411
01:38:05,361 --> 01:38:07,930
Solve this problem. Now.

1412
01:40:18,695 --> 01:40:20,729
We've arrested everybody here.

1413
01:40:20,763 --> 01:40:22,399
Subpoenas are being served

1414
01:40:22,432 --> 01:40:25,001
at Warren and Warren's
headquarters this week.

1415
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:32,241
Let's get them to the airport.

1416
01:40:32,275 --> 01:40:35,312
Your aunt will be waiting
for you when you land.

1417
01:40:35,344 --> 01:40:37,046
How's she handling things?

1418
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,217
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called

1419
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,786
and told you he was
your six-year-old nephew?

1420
01:40:47,723 --> 01:40:49,592
We'll be okay.

1421
01:44:18,233 --> 01:44:22,439
