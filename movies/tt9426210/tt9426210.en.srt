This is a story
only she and I know about.

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,051
The story of a secret
about this world.

4
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,678
It was like a pool of light.

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,141
Then, she ran out of the hospital.

6
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,314
Praying with all her heart,

7
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,407
she crossed the shrine gate.

00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:23,234

was really just a dream.

But it wasn't.

17

We ran into a typhoon
on the island too.

00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,438
It's raining so much this year.

163
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,236
- He ignored me?
- So there's a demand for that.

164
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,365
Right.

165
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,073
Come on, kid.
You've got zero initiative.

166
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,444
We've got an interview appointment.
Go along and listen.

167
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,120
Me? Now?!

168
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,618
- You're on probation!
- "Probatory period.”

169
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,910
No, really. I can't.

170
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,625
Of course,
Sunshine Girls do exist.

171
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,758
I knew it!

172
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,087
And also Rain Girls.

173
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,050
{\an8}Fortune Teller

174
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:35,632
The first are possessed by a fox god.
The latter by a dragon god.
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:35,632
{\an8}Fortune Teller

175
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,970
What was that?

176
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,646
Dragon individuals drink a lot.
They yearn for water.

177
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,392
They're strong-willed and competitive,
but a bit careless and unreliable.

178
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,401
Maybe that's me.

179
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,281
Fox individuals are hardworking,
but too weak-hearted to be leaders.

180
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,410
Many are beautiful.

181
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,494
Definitely me.

182
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,739
The weather's off-balance right now,
so probably one of them is needed.

183
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,415
Homeostasis of Gaia Theory.

184
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,544
I see.

185
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,914
But, those are dangerous jobs.

186
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,131
Messing with nature
always has a cost.

187
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,135
Whoever uses too much weather power to bring
back a balance will get spirited away.

188
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,264
Don't tell me...

189
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,344
I'll be careful.

190
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,184
So, how was it?

191
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:27,020
A so-called psychic talked at length
about hocus-pocus magical stuff.

192
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,913
"If you use too much power
you'll disappear.”

193
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,402
I see. So it was like that.

194
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:35,317
Weather isn't some kind of “power.”
It's a natural phenomenon.

195
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:40,537
Look, we're aware of that.
But, we're providing entertainment.

196
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,249
Is that all you've written so far?
You're slow.

197
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,082
Sorry.

198
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,211
But it's not bad.

199
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,714
All right, you're hired.

200
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,716
Wait a minute!
I didn't say I was...

201
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,213
It's a live-in job.

202
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,178
- Meals included.
- Really?

203
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,721
I'll do it! Please hire me.

204
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,887
Good. What's your name again?

205
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,226
- Huh?
- Funny.

206
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,220
- It's Hodaka, right?
- Right.

207
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,524
It's ready.

208
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,067
Here.

209
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,687
I'm underage, remember?

210
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,732
Let's celebrate Hodaka's hiring.

211
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,774
Cheers!

212
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,243
That was the first meal I shared
with someone since I came to Tokyo.

213
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,247
And also when my new life started.

214
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,305

215
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,059

216
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,275

217
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,693

218
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,190

219
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,615

220
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,735

221
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,243
It was a small editing company,
run by Mr. Suga and Natsumi.

222
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,870
I did all the office chores.

223
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,582
Starting from Mr. Suga's
personal care...

224
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,130
Answering the phone, filing receipts,
transcribing interviews...

225
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,877
Is that all you've written so far?

226
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,803
This isn't mine.

227
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,639
Mr. Suga's out of the office...

228
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,771
Sometimes I rode around town
with Natsumi doing some interviews.

229
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,566

230
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,196

231
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,235

232
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,448

233
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,471

234
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:45,245

235
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,582
- They're really looking for a Sunshine Girl.
- No, Really?

236
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,712
My sis' friend's a real sunshine girl.
You have no idea what she can do.

237
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,748
{\an8}Weather Research Lab
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,748
We're not interested.

238
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,964
Then, the weather balloon
picked up something really strange.

239
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,006
A swarm of moving objects
among the clouds.

240
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,009
Is that all you've written?

241
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,867
You have to buy these
when they're on sale.

242
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,265
He's out of the office again...

243
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,230
This paragraph's crap.
But this ain't bad.

244
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,025
{\an8}Pachinko

245
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,854
Mr. Suga, wake up. Come on.

246
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,524
Mr. Suga, wake up. Come on.

247
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,694

248
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,443

249
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,390
But, for the first time
someone was relying on me.

250
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:25,869
But, for the first time
someone was relying on me.

251
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,206
But, for the first time
someone was relying on me.

252
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,744

253
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,334
Those rainy days in Tokyo passed in a flash.

254
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:33,543
Those rainy days in Tokyo passed in a flash.

255
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,081
Those rainy days in Tokyo passed in a flash.

256
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,966

257
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,856
Rain.

258
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,566
Rain. Rain. Rain.

259
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,814
There you are.

260
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,356
How's it going, Rain?

261
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,067
Yeah? Good boy.

262
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,951
It's an easy job. You'll see.

263
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,084
But...

264
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,586
Just give it a try.
You'll get paid right away.

265
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,922
Our club is right there.

266
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,259
That girl...

267
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,180
Give it a go
and earn yourself some bucks.

268
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,190
It's right in here. Let's go!

269
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,981
But...

270
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,743
Let's go!

271
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,335
Hey! Wait a minute.

272
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:02,958
Wait!

273
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,004
- Just keep running!
- Listen to me.

274
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,551
You brat!

275
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,055
Hey, man.

276
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,857
What do you think you're doing?

277
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,776
You were forcing her.

278
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:26,072
Are you dumb or what?
We made a deal.

279
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,820
Oh, wait...

280
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,331
Aren't you the brat who was
sleeping in front of the club?

281
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,331
What's this? Payback?

282
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,333
Please stop it.

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,002
Damn it!

284
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,342
Get off me!

285
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,839
What's that? A toy gun?

286
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,345
You really are dumb.

287
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,954
Get up.

288
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,733
You...

289
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,234
What was that for?
To thank me for the burger?

290
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,235
Where did you even get that gun?
Who are you?

291
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,744
That was...

292
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:58,289
I found it and thought it was fake.
It's just to scare people off.

293
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:03,253
You know you pointed it at a person, right?
And you actually shot.

294
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,920
I can't believe it! You can't be like that.
You have issues.

295
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,963
I got fired from
my part-time job.

296
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,673
Was it my fault?

297
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,505
No, nothing to do with that burger.

298
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:55,009
But, that's why
I need a well-paid job.

299
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,970
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

300
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,150
- Does it hurt?
- Not really.

301
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,282
You're a runaway, aren't you?
I can tell.

302
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,702
But, you can't really enjoy Tokyo
with this kind of rain.

303
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,658
Huh? I guess.

304
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,660
Come with me.

305
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,935
It's going to clear up now.

306
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,064
Huh?

307
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,693
What do you mean?

308
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,303
A real Sunshine Girl?

309
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,262
I'm Hina.

310
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,841
- What's your name?
- Hodaka.

311
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,138
- How old are you?
- 16.

312
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,894
Younger than me.

313
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,978
I'll be 18 next month.

314
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,730
You don't look it.

315
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,736
You should treat your elders
with respect.

316
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,204
Pleased to meet you, Hodaka.

317
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,709
Me too.

318
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,665
Mom, there's a fish.

319
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,802
Yeah? Nice.

320
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,469
Don't say bullshit.

321
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,885
I'm serious. This way.

322
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,348
Look, over there.

323
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,732
Can't see anything.

324
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,482
It's there! Look harder.

325
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,539
What's that?

326
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:29,352
<i>The Kanto region is experiencing
record-breaking rainfall this summer.</i>

327
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,977
<i>It's been raining continuously
for two months.</i>

328
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,105
<i>The 30-day forecast predicts more
heavy rain for at least another month.</i>

329
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,320
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,320
<i>The 30-day forecast predicts more
heavy rain for at least another month.</i>

330
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:38,561
{\an8}Sunshine for You

331
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,029
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,029
<i>The meteorological agency said
it's an extremely exceptional...</i>

332
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,816
<i>The meteorological agency said
it's an extremely exceptional...</i>

333
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,537
Is that too expensive?

334
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,497
Hey!

335
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,121
Look, it's amazing.

336
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,629
{\an8}Did some stuff fell down
{\an8}with the rain?

337
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,126
{\an8}In the parking lot too?

338
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,628
{\an8}Raining animals!

339
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,046
It looks like a see-through jelly thing.

340
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,215
They kind of look like fish.
Did they really fell from the sky?

341
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,846
But, they left no trace...

342
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,473
They instantly disappear.

343
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,606
Look.

344
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,314
Remember what the guy
we interviewed said?

345
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,564
The sky has more
mysteries than the sea.

346
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,909
A cumulonimbus cloud can hold
as much water as a whole lake.

347
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,658
So, it could as well harbor an
uncharted ecosystem within itself.

348
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,699
You mean, like these things?

349
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,167
I guess. Amazing, isn't it?

350
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,082
If we write about it...

351
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,084
Maybe we can make good money.

352
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,675
Huh? What?

353
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,798
You're starting to sound like Kei.
You'll be a boring grown-up.

354
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,014
Anyway, don't stand up
your Sunshine Girl.

355
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,475
- You're going on a date, right?
- It's not a date!

356
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,602
I'm going to look for a job.

357
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,604
What? Isn't this your job?

358
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,102
I'm just hanging out.

359
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,273
I said it's not a date.

360
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,118
I understand how you feel,
Keisuke.

361
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,622
But, she finally stopped
asking for you all the time.

362
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,122
I think it'd be cruel to 
remind her of you right now.

363
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,087
But, I have the right to see her.

364
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,631
Besides, you smoke. Don't you?

365
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,178
Huh?

366
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,128
You know she's got asthma.

367
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,130
You're too inconsiderate.

368
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,600
I quit smoking a while ago.

369
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,142
Well, besides that...

370
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,055
You also give a bad impression.

371
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,862
It's raining all the time
this year.

372
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,160
She can't play outside
because of her asthma.

373
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,408
I feel sorry for
children nowadays.

374
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,918
We used fo have
beautiful springs and summers.

375
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,683
They can't stay there if it's
just the two of them.

376
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,514
You're right.

377
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,195
Hold on.

378
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,363
This is my first time...

379
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,237
visiting a girl's home...

380
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,153
and she lives alone!

381
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,455
Welcome, Hodaka.
You got lost, didn't you?

382
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,535
No, er... it's not much, but...

383
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,042
Wow, thank you. Come on in.

384
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,548
- Thank you.
- Sure.

385
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,138
{\an8}Potato Chips

386
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:49,924
{\an8}Potato Chips
{\an8}Instant Noodles

387
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,759
Hey, did you have lunch?

388
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,466
Not yet. Ah! But, don't worry!

389
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,475
Just sit there and relax.

390
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:57,977
Can I use these?

391
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,431
- Sure.
- Thanks.

392
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,495
So, do you live alone?

393
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,998
With my younger brother.
Although we have a few problems right now.

394
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,913
Problems?

395
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,045
How about you?
Why did you run away?

396
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,000
I found it suffocating
to live with my parents.

397
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,010
And in that town.

398
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,098
I see.

399
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,518
Shouldn't you go back though?

400
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,517
I don't want to.

401
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,603
Right.

402
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,533
Here you go.

403
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,535
Spring onions!
I forgot the spring onions.

404
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,536
So how do you like living in Tokyo?

405
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,535
Eh? oh.

406
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,712
Come to think of it,

407
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,125
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

408
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,040
Happy to hear that.

409
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,049
Thank you for the food.

410
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,729
What? An earthquake?

411
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:23,973
It's the train.

412
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,648
Are you serious, Hodaka?

413
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,815
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,815
Are you serious, Hodaka?

414
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:29,936
{\an8}Sunshine for You

415
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,063
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,063
Well, you're a real
Sunshine Girl, aren't you?

416
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,155
Well, you're a real
Sunshine Girl, aren't you?

417
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,574
You can clear up the sky
just by praying.

418
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,704
Yeah.

419
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,995
And, don't you need a job?

420
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,077
I do.
But, I can't charge people for that.

421
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,707
Well, I don't think you should be
working in a club like that either.

422
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,209
Hodaka.

423
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,833
What are you looking at?

424
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,089
I'm not looking at anything!

425
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,345
Sorry.

426
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,996
Isn't $50 too expensive?

427
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,012
Shall we do $30, then?

428
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,602
Considering living
expenses, though...

429
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,271
Maybe we need some graphics.

430
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,940
I'll draw them.

431
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,943
What's this? A hippo?

432
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,441
- It's a frog.
- Seriously?

433
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,065
It's done!

434
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:15,861
{\an8}Sunshine for You

435
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,238
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,238
Ok, I'll publish it.

436
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:17,358
{\an8}Sunshine for You

437
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,784
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,784
- Ok?
- Yeah.

438
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,152
{\an8}Sunshine for You

439
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,364
{\an8}Sunshine for You
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,364
Hi! I'm home.

440
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,282
I'd like some sardines...

441
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:25,875
Who are you?

442
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,121
You're the boy from the bus!

443
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,255
Do you know each other?

444
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,500
Hodaka, this is my brother Nagi.

445
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,087
Nagi, this is Hodaka.
He's my business partner.

446
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,224
{\an8}Request

447
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,055
We've got a request!

448
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,599
Is it already public?

449
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,970
They need good weather
for a flea market.

450
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,141
It's tomorrow!

451
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,103
Wait a minute!
Am I really gonna do this?

452
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,938
<i>Widespread rain tomorrow...</i>

453
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,484
It's gonna rain tomorrow!

454
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,154
That's the whole point.

455
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,065
Who the hell is that guy?

456
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,282
It'll be fine. I'll help you.

457
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,905
How?!

458
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,407
Please use this.

459
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,216
Sorry, I won't.

460
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,167
I've got another
secret weapon for you.

461
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,514
Sorry, don't need it.

462
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,728
Cut it out, Hodaka!

463
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,226
Who called those weirdos?

464
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,524
We thought it might
bring good luck.

465
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,612
Don't push yourselves too hard.

466
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,829
We're almost there!

467
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,244
Water, hina?

468
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,708
Do you want a candy?

469
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,957
- Tell them to go home.
- Ok.

470
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,206
- The sky's clearing up.
- No way!

471
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,220
- It cleared up.
- It's been ages, huh?

472
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,726
- Look! Look!
- Finally, after so long.

473
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,229
- The sky's so beautiful.
- Amazing.

474
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,779
What do you think?

475
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,193
- You're awesome, guys.
- You're a real Sunshine Girl.

476
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,234
- I'm so surprised.
- You're great.

477
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,240
- Even if it was a coincidence.
- It wasn't.

478
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,247
Here's $200.

479
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,375
It's too much.

480
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,166
You get a bonus
because you're cute.

481
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:35,748
Thank you so much.
We'll sell a lot more now.

482
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,764
Yaaay!

483
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,427
- Amazing!
- I feel I can do this.

484
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,724
Cool! Let's make money
with the weather.

485
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,017
Yeah!

486
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,285

487
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:18,085

488
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,011

489
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:21,634

490
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,177

491
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,388

492
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,097

493
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:26,430

494
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,548

495
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,470

496
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,893

497

498

499
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,612
The human mind
works in mysterious ways.

500
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:50,781
You just need to see the sun shining
in the morning fo feel energized.

501
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,618
A blue sky makes you feel
happy you are alive.

502
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,867
A blue sky makes you feel
happy you are alive.

503

505
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:54,617

506
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,043
It makes you feel more in love
with that someone by your side.

507
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,487
It makes you feel more in love
with that someone by your side.

508
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,125
It's a once in a lifetime event.
I want to wear white under a blue sky.

509
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,801
We need to watch the meteor shower.

510
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,380
It never wins on rainy days!

511
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,264
I've worked hard in that sweatshop
just for today!

512
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,221
I want to play outside.

513
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:12,184

514
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:12,517

518
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:14,512
Everyone had their own reasons
to want a little bit of sunshine.

519
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,002
Everyone had their own reasons
to want a little bit of sunshine.

520
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,981
Hina was able to clear only
small spots for a brief time.

521
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:21,523
But, the sky would always
answer her prayers.

522
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,343

523
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,783
She really was the
"100% Sunshine Girl.”

524
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,162

525
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,199

526
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,372

527
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,459

528
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,083

529
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,628

530
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:43,795
It was like the whole town
was dressing up.

531
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,840
It was like the whole town
was dressing up.

532
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:46,961
It was like the whole town

533

535
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,516
And I started thinking
What a wonderful world I was born in.

536
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,247
And I started thinking

551
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,103
Thanks a lot.

552
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,104
Thank you.

554
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,242
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

555
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,578
Humans are really influenced
by the weather.

556
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:18,084
I realized how much the human heart
is connected with the sky.

557
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,037
{\an8}Soup in the pot.
{\an8}-H.

558
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,549
I'm off!

559
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,762
Where to?

560
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,727
{\an8}Please be alert

561
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,430
- Is it canceled due to rain?
- It's past noon already.

562
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,726
When does it start?

563
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,144
{\an8}Tell us what's going on!
{\an8}I'm wearing expensive clothes.

564
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,516

565
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:41,857
{\an8}They'll probably cancel it.

00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:41,974
{\an8}They'll probably cancel it.

00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,297
Shall we go home?

568
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,961
{\an8}Let's all wear good-weather charms.
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,961
I'm tired.

569
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,442
I've read everywhere the
100% Sunshine Girl is amazing.

570
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:55,822
But, this is such a very big event.
Do you really want to rely on that?

571
00:38:55,959 --> 00:39:00,455
It's going to rain all week so
we can't postpone it anyway.

572
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,089
At this point we don't mind trying
one or two unorthodox methods.

576
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,643
with this Sunshine Girl job.

577
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:45,143
I finally found my role in life.

578
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:50,569
Maybe. Or maybe not.
Or maybe not not not not.

579
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,482
Maybe not not...?

580
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,778
Yes or no?

581
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,906
You're too serious.

582
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,743
Just wanted to say,
Thank you, Hodaka.

583
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,168
Weather is a mystery.

584
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,968
The way the sky looks
can move you so much.

585

Regarding the visit...

611
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,241
You're late, Kei.
You know it's an important interview.

Are we in a bad mood?
No luck with work, meow?

He's neglecting work lately.

00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,425
Just let him be.
We're not that busy.

618
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,511
He took in that cat.

619
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,804
You did the same with him.

620
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,759
Huh?

621
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,311
You helped him because
he reminded you of yourself.

622
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,393
How much are you paying him?

623
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,404
Only $300? That's so low.

624
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,316
- Nope. It's $30.
- What?

625
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,705
Are you serious? $30 a month?
That's exploitation.

Eyes on the road.

You're gonna get sued.
Actually, I'll report you.

628
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:56,835
He gets free food and a bed,
and we got him a phone.

629
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,341
Ugh!

630
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,254
No wonder he's got a second job.

631
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:08,304
I'm surprised.
It's really cleared up.

You kids are amazing.
It's a shame you're quitting.

We can't cope, so we'll do one more and
then stop for a while.

00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,823
She looks tired, too.

638
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,121
Got guests, granny?

639
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,866
Oh, you're here.

640
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,375
I came to help.

641
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,334
Hey guys.
Are you granny's friends?

642
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,466
Hello.

643
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,634
I've asked for nice weather on
my husband's first anniversary.

644
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,844
And it actually stopped raining, huh?

645
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,598
It'd be hard for him to come back
if it was raining.

646
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,770
Come back?

647
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:00,903
They say the dead come back
from the sky around August 15.

648
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,362
So, he died a year ago?

649
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,494
Yes.

650
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,907
My mom too.

651
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,416
You lost your mother last year?

652
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:14,867
Yes.

653
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:18,420
Light a welcoming fire for her.

654
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,919
She'll protect you.

655
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,469
Thanks.

656
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,932
They'll follow the smoke
and come back.

657
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,684
From where?

658
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,429
From the skies.

659
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,271
There's always been
another world up there.

660
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,950
Apparently, this is what
the Weather Maiden saw.

661
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,035
It's a mysterious painting.

662
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,739
Flying fish in the sky.
And even a dragon.

663
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,206
It's beautiful.

664
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,159
Right?

665
00:45:56,295 --> 00:46:00,205
This Weather Maiden...
was like a shaman, right?

666
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,502
Huh? What?

667
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,210
Was she like a shaman?

668
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,965
Yeah.

669
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,470
Fixing the weather is
the Weather Maiden's work.

670
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,602
- Fixing it?
- Sounds like a con.

671
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,102
Like this year's unprecedented rain?

672
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,605
There's nothing unprecedented about it.

673
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,736
They say "in recorded history,"

674
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,569
but when did records begin?

675
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,245
100 years ago at best.

676
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,248
How old do you think this is?

677
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,829
800 years old.

678
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:38,962
800?

679
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,250
Don't get too excited, grandpa.

680
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,631
The weather changes on a whim.

681
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,763
Regardless of human needs.

682
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,845
We can't even tell
what's normal and what's not.

683
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,140
We're only allowed to stay here temporarily

684
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,848
in the space between
the sky and earth,

685
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,860
clinging hard not to be shaken off.

686
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:09,441
We used to be well aware
of this in the past.

687
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:16,622
But, there's a thin thread
linking us humans and the sky.

688
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,617
And that is the Weather Maiden.

689
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,242
{\an8}I pray for good weather.
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,242
And that is the Weather Maiden.

690
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:20,367
{\an8}I pray for good weather.

691
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:25,954
{\an8}I pray for good weather.
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:27,529
A special girl who can take in
people's wishes and deliver them to the sky.

692
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,454

693
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:27,529

694
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:33,464
In ancient times, there was one
in every village and every country.

695
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,808
Kei, it sounds a lot
like the Sunshine Girl.

696
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,269
Are you sure you want to
keep listening to my grandpa?

697
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,479
It all sounds pretty fake.

698
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,522
It's a very interesting story.
We're thankful.

699
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:50,322
But, everything comes
with a price.

700
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:56,571
A tragic fate awaits
the Weather Maiden.

701
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,452
{\an8}Tachibana

702
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,324
{\an8}Tachibana
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,324
One, two, three.

703
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,909
One, two, three.

704
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,336
Your turn, sis.

705
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,964
One, two, three.

706
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,334
Thanks for keeping
granny company.

707
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,802
We're actually here
because of work.

708
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,595
Join us, granny.

709
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,683
They're having fun.
How old are you guys?

710
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,098
I'm 16. She's...

711
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,898
She said her is
birthday next week.

712
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,602
Really? You've gotta
buy her a present.

713
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,696
Come eat some watermelon.

714
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,112
- Yay!
- Thank you.

715
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,115
Hey, wait!

716
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,542
Dang.

717
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,968
Jeez. Why?

718
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,138
Wait a minute!

719
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:20,036
I didn't know she was
a minor, I swear.

720
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,624
It's not about that?

721
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,959
I told you it wasn't.

722
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,124
You made us run for nothing.

723
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,339
That's you, right?

724
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,673
Can you tell us about this boy?

725
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,679
A high school boy?

726
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,979
Maybe he picked up the gun
Shibata threw away.

727
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,192
In that case, he might
have posted about it.

728
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,650
Online, you mean?

729
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,780
Kids write all sorts of stuff
on social networks nowadays.

730
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,744
{\an8}I'm 16 years old...
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,744
Kids write all sorts of stuff
on social networks nowadays.

731
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,241
{\an8}What's the best birthday
{\an8}present for an 18yo girl?

732
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,708
{\an8}Posted

733
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,583
{\an8}4 answers

734
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,214
{\an8}Don't ask online.

735
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,386
Go, Nagi!

736
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,221
- You're amazing, Nagi!
- You're the best.

737
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,720
A ring. Definitely.

738
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,851
Really? Isn't it too serious?

739
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,100
It's for my sister's
birthday, right?

740
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,236
I've asked another woman
for reference, but...

741
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,063
What I'd like to get?

742
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,819
Hugs and kisses. Cash.

743
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,988
A decent boyfriend. And a job.

744
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,865
It wasn't helpful at all.

745
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,122
- A ring, huh...
- Bye bye, Nagi!

746
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,491
See you, Nagi.

747
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,502
You're in love
with Hina, aren't you?

748
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,495
What?

749
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,793
What?! It's not like that.

750
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,007
Or maybe it is?

751
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,507
Being ambivalent is
the worst thing for a guy.

752
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,342
Really?

753
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:06,018
Be clear when you want to start dating.
You can think more later. It's the basics.

754
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,518
Can I call you Nagi-sempai?

755
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:17,233
Hina's been working all the time
since mom died.

756
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:22,071
She's been doing it for me,
because I'm still too young.

757
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,163
So, I want her to do more
teenage-like stuff.

758
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,787
I still don't know if you're
the right guy, though.

759
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,288
Thank you very much.

760
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:41,295
Er, do you think she'll like it?

761
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
Huh?

762
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,554
It took you three hours
to choose it.

763
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,311
If I were her, I'd be very happy.

764
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,479
The best of luck.

765
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,561
{\an8}Longest rainfall record broken

766
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,652
{\an8}Longest rainfall record broken
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,652
Tomorrow's job will be our last.

767
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:05,743
A man requested good weather
at the park for his daughter.

768
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,666
After that, I'll give Hina the ring.

769
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,926
Daddy, do it again.
One more time!

770
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,425
Right. Ready?

771
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,263
Go!

772
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,941
Ouch. This is bad for my back.

773
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:40,480
Hey Mr. Suga, I was wondering,
Did you know this was my job?

774
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:44,950
You knew and said nothing?
Actually, do you have a daughter?

775
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:49,450
I'm stunned.
Today's forecast was 100% rain.

776
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,372
My daughter has asthma.

777
00:52:54,672 --> 00:53:00,215
She lives with her granny, who
won't let me see her on rainy days.

778
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,965
Nothing can beat
a gorgeous blue sky.

779
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,881
So, you're Hodaka's boss.

780
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,432
I also saved his life.

781
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,597
Why does she call you
like a little boy?

782
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,479
Hina's two years older than me.

783
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,941
Huh? 16, 17, 18. It's all the same.

784
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,439
- Right?
- It's not!

785
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,731
There you are!

786
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,237
Hi, guys!

787
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,200
Aren't you gonna be in trouble?

788
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,987
Does Natsumi know
you're married?

789
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,497
What's up with you guys?

790
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,504
Hodaka thought you were my...

791
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,169
Mistress?!

792
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,631
You didn't tell me
you were uncle and niece.

793
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,050
That's a disgusting fantasy.

794
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,514
You're dirty-minded.

795
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,225
Hey, Hodaka.

796
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,348
You looked at my boobs.

797
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,519
No, I didn't!

798
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,521
Natsumi!

799
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,485
Hello, Moka!

800
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,489
Daddy, I made a garland.
It's for you!

801
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,031
Really?

802
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,526
Come here, Hodaka.

803
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,990
Sempai's calling me.

804
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,657
Hodaka's hilarious.

805
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,367
He's such a kid.

806
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:20,249
Don't you think they're similar?

807
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,047
- Hodaka and Mr. suga?
- Yep.

808
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,796
Kei ran away from home and came
to Tokyo when he was a teen.

809
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,804
Then, he met his wife
and fell in love big time.

810
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,179
But, she died in an accident
some years ago.

811
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,553
He's still in love with her.

812
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,811
I've been dying to meet you
for so long, Hina.

813
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,860
The 100% Sunshine Girl.
You're amazing.

814
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,898
I wish I had a skill like that on my
resume. I hate looking for a job.

815
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,737
I wish I was still
in high school too.

816
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,575
Well... I can't wait
to be a grown-up instead.

817
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,494
I see. Good to see you're okay.

818
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,084
I was actually a bit worried.

819
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,805
Are you tired, Moka?
Here, take a breath.

820
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,019
One, two, three.

821
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,477
I'm fine. Let's play!

822
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,610
I don't think...

823
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,735
I guess we'll leave now.

824
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,026
I want to spend
more time with Nagi!

825
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,400
Why don't we all go
to dinner together?

826
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,367
But...

827
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,783
I'll go eat with Moka. Is it ok?

828
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,490
- Sure.
- Yay!

829
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,373
Hodaka, take Hina home.

830
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,255
Hey!

831
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,792
Thank you for bringing
the sunshine today!

832
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,221
Thank you.

833
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,964
I'm glad I made you happy.

834
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:12,316
Oh God, oh God.

835
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,325
I guess this is going to be...

836
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,494
The first time I tell
a girl I love her.

837
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,588
- Hina.
- Hodaka.

838
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,214
- Oh, sorry.
- It's ok.

839
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,880
- What is it?
- Nothing in particular.

840
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,632
What were you saying?

841
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,104
Hodaka, you know...

842
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,567
I...

843
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,915
Hina!

844
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,169
Hodaka!

845
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,583
Hina?

846
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,447
I think I became
the Sunshine Girl...

847
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,823
last year, on that day.

848
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:55,211
The day before I prayed for
good weather all day long.

849
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,218
I wanted to have one last day
under the sun with my mom.

850
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,731
It looked like a pool of light.

851
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,645
Praying with all my heart,
I crossed the shrine gate.

852
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,203
When I came around,
I was lying on the roof's floor.

853
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,333
And the sky was clear.

854
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,215
I think

855
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:46,015
that's when I got
connected to the sky.

856
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,652
Connected to the sky?

857
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,986
Stay in there, Hodaka.

858
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,991
Police.
Sorry for the late visit.

859
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,496
The police?

860
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,995
Are you sure
you've never seen him?

861
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:13,046
He's been seen many times
around here.

862
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,842
I haven't.

863
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,424
What has he done?

864
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,129
We want to ask him
some questions.

865
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:25,266
He's a runaway. His parents
filed a missing person's report.

866
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:31,307
Also, you're living alone
with your little brother, right?

867
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,273
That's right.

868
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,022
That's a bit of a problem too.

869
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,612
Without a guardian, he cannot—

870
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,741
But!

871
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:42,033
We don't bother anyone.

872
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,575
Hina.

873
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:51,293
She'll come back tomorrow
with Social Services.

874
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,291
What can I do?
They'll separate us!

875
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,542
{\an8}Mr. Suga

876
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,477
Hodaka! The police was...

877
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,515
I know. Go home,
I'll come back later.

878
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,894
<i>Temperatures have fallen
sharply after sunset.</i>

879
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,361
Mr. Suga?

880
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,064
Surprised by my new look?

881
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,073
I'm in disguise.

882
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,572
The police came to my office.
They're treating it like a kidnapping.

883
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,368
I denied any involvement,
but they suspect me.

884
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,746
Take it. It's part of
your severance pay.

885
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:40,712
Please, don't come back to the office,
or they'll arrest me.

886
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:49,221
I filed for my daughter's custody.
It's a delicate time. I'm sorry.

887
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,100
Just go back home tomorrow.

888
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,978
Then everything will
go back to normal.

889
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:00,566
It'll be best for everyone.

890
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,194
It's time to grow up, kid.

891
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:16,126
We can't stay here anymore.

892
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,208
But, where are you...

893
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,673
I don't know, but...

894
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,258
Anywhere will do.

895
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,718
As long as I'm with you.

896
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,303
Hodaka, you'd better go home
before you get caught.

897
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,555
At least you've got
a place to go back to.

898
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,224
That's not...

899
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,232
We'll be fine.

900
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,231
I'm not going back.

901
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:43,734
Let's run away together!

This is not a place for kids.

951
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,075
You guys...

952
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,410
Are you runaways?

953
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,129
Hina, Hodaka, look!

954
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,210
Snow?

955
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,449

956
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:54,428
{\an8}Midsummer snow

957
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:06,016
Is Hina really connected
with the sky?

958
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,450
It's freezing!

959
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,455
Hey Kei, it's snowing in August.

960
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,586
The world's finally gone crazy.

961
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,050
Oh?

962
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,669
<i>It's unbelievable, but
it's snowing here in Tokyo.</i>

963
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,220
Kei, wake up.
You'll catch a cold.

964
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,600
Asuka.

965
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,725
Asuka. And you too, Kei.
Smile.

966
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:47,728

967
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,736
Brrr!

968
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:55,114
You sound like an old man, Kei.

969
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,241
You know, once you grow old

970
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,747
You can't help others
even if you want to.

971
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,493
What are you saying?
Where's Hodaka?

972
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,625
Did you kick him out?
I can't believe it!

973
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:14,796
I told you, the police showed up.
I have got to protect myself.

974
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,263
Huh?! So you smoked a pack of cigarettes
and got drunk because you felt guilty.

975
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,762
That's so not cool, meow.

976
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,767
Even Rain's saying it.

977
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,981
Really not cool. So last century.
Yeah, stay away. You smell old.

978
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,019
Hey, you're uncool too.
What's her name... Hina.

979
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,776
If the story about the
Weather Maiden being...

980
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,116
a human sacrifice is true,
then one day she'll...

981
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,777
But, that's...

982
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,283
What should I have done, then?

983
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,290
Don't get so uptight.
It's just bullshit.

984
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,745
But, if it were true...

985
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:59,296
If we could fix this mess outside with the
sacrifice of a single person... It's tempting.

986
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,803
Everyone would agree.

987
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:08,016
<i>A heavy rain and heavy snow warning
has been issued.</i>

988
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,283
<i>Don't go outside if it's not
strictly necessary.</i>

989
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,186
{\an8}Heavy Rain Special Warning

990
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,689
{\an8}Heavy Rain Special Warning
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,689
<i>Please follow your local government's
evacuation instructions.</i>

991
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:13,809
{\an8}Heavy Rain Special Warning

992
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:14,310
{\an8}Heavy Rain Special Warning
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:14,310
You kids, wait.

993
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,322
You kids, wait.

994
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,488
It's dangerous to walk around
unsupervised.

995
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,612
Are you all siblings?

996
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,745
Well...

997
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,654
We're going home.

998
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,698
I'm a college student.
They're my younger brothers.

999
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,581
I see. Can you show me your ID?

1000
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,829
I don't have it on me.

1001
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,748
Maybe it's him.

1002
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,884
<i>He may be carrying a gun.
Be careful.</i>

1003
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:42,846
And you? Are you in high school?
That's a big backpack.

1004
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,470
Can you remove your hood?

1005
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:47,969
Hina.

1006
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,189
Run away.

1007
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,234
Hey! Wait!

1008
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,107
Stop!

1009
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,112
- Got you!
- Let me go!

1010
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
Resisting arrest!

1011
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,283
- Let me go!
- Stop struggling.

1012
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:08,792
Hodaka!

1013
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:11,375
Stop!

1014
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,417
Hina?

1015
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,089
Please!

1016
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,026
It's dangerous!

1017
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,067
Let's go, Hina.

1018
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,865
- Jeez.
- Let's go take a look.

1019
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,072
Sempai.

1020
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,874
It's $280 a night.

1021
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,252
$280. Can you pay?

1022
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,879
Huh? Yes. I'll pay.

1023
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,851
Seems like I'm a wanted man now.

1024
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,649
That's so cool.

1025
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,985
- I was really worried.
- You almost got arrested.

1026
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:28,156
I totally panicked.
There's nothing to laugh about.

1027
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,456
This room is huge!

1028
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,907
The bed's huge!
The bathroom's huge!

1029
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,915
Sis, Hodaka.

1030
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,713
Let's take a bath together.

1031
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,835
Do it alone.

1032
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,802
Hodaka, let's take a
boys-only bath together then.

1033
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,925
It's so warm.

1034
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,430
What's this?

1035
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,606
- Wow!
- Amazing.

1036
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,683
Switching!

1037
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,694
There's a lot of stuff.

1038
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,568
- What do you want?
- Let's try them all, Sempai.

1039
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,908
- Are you sure?
- I got severance pay.

1040
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,278
Hina, we're having
a superb dinner tonight.

1041
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:11,912
Looking forward to it.

1042
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,950
{\an8}Fried Chicken

1043
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,455
I'm back.

1044
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,875
Welcome back.

1045
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,473
Thank you for the food.

1046
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,347
Let me try that, Hodaka.

1047
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,806
- The curry's yummy.
- Yakisoba's delicious.

1048
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,391
I want some too.

1049
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,563
Aren't you opening it too early, Hodaka?

1050
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,478
Tastes better if you only
wait two minutes.

1051
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,276
~The fortune cookie in love~

1052
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,696
~The future's not looking so grim~

1053
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,244
~The thing that's in your heart~

1054
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,118
~The thing that soon will disappear~

1055
01:10:55,251 --> 01:11:00,001
Dear God, if you really exist,
somewhere out there, I beg of you.

1056
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:04,215
This is more than enough.
We don't want anything else.

1057
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,759
We'll manage somehow.

1058
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,806
So please, don't give us
anything more,

1059
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,138
and don't take away anything
more from us.

1060
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,935
I beg of you, please, dear God.

1061
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,685
Let us be together, like this, forever.

1062
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:27,904
Hina.

1063
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,283
Happy 18th birthday.

1064
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:36,281
It's cheap, but I tried picking
something that'd look good on you.

1065
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:40,962
Thank you.

1066
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,801
Hey, Hodaka.

1067
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:50,886
You'd also like this
rain to stop, right?

1068
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:53,809
Hmm, yeah.

1069
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,482
I was chosen to be
a human sacrifice.

1070
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,567
Natsumi told me about
the Sunshine Girl's fate.

1071
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:16,196
She gets sacrificed and disappears,
then the weather goes back to normal.

1072
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,416
Come on.

1073
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:23,787
They're always telling weird stories.
It's not like people disappear...

1074
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,721
What are you looking at?

1075
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,639
I'm not looking!

1076
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,401
I'm looking at you.

1077
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,154
Why are you crying?

1078
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:58,116
The more I pray for sunshine, the more
my body becomes transparent.

1079
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,997
I'm sure that,
if I die this way,

1080
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:05,002
the usual summer will come back.

1081
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,504
- Take care of Nagi.
- No!

1082
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:11,133
No way.
You're not going anywhere.

1083
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:13,009
We'll live together.
The three of us.

1084
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,139
Hodaka.

1085
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,760
Let's make a promise, Hina.

1086
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:18,845
We'll always be together.

1087
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,480
I'll work.
I'll earn enough for all of us.

1088
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:28,275
You quit the Sunshine Girl job.
Your body will go back to normal.

1089
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,484
So—

1090
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,798
I had a dream.

1091
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,879
When I was still on the island.

1092
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,893
I already wanted to leave.

1093
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:07,105
I was rushing desperately,
trying to reach the light.

1094
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:13,817
When I thought I finally did,
I just reached a dead end instead.

1095
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:19,030
Then, I decided I wanted
to enter that light

1096
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,540
and at the edge of it,
I found you.

1097
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,627
I had a dream.

1098
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,623
The day I met you.

1099
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,920
You looked like a lost kitten.

1100
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,428
But you found meaning
for my existence.

1101
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:48,101
I kept working as the Sunshine Girl
because it made me happy to make people smile.

1102
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,895
I'm really glad I met you.

1103
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,947
So, don't cry, Hodaka.

1104
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,082
What is this place?

1105
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,631
Hodaka...

1106
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,102
Hina?

1107
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,602
Hina, where are you?

1108
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,024
Hina?

1109
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,853
- Hina?
- What's wrong, Hodaka?

1110
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,819
Hina disappeared!

1111
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:23,112
I just dreamed...
that she was disappearing in the sky.

1112
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,161
Don't tell me...

1113
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:32,796
Open the door!

1114
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,875
- Open up!
- What?

1115
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,383
Hodaka Morishima, right?

1116
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:47,008
You're a missing person and suspect
of carrying an illegal weapon.

1117
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,385
- Come to the police station.
- Let me go!

1118
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,395
- I won't hurt you.
- Let me go, I said!

1119
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:53,397
- Hodaka!
- Sempai!

1120
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,641
Don't struggle.

1121
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,656
Keep going.

1122
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:19,460
<i>After months of rain, the Kanto region is
finally seeing some brilliant sunshine.</i>

1123
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,468
<i>It almost seems unreal.</i>

1124
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,928
<i>In the last few hours,
a sudden change in...</i>

1125
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,382
<i>By 8 A.M. the temperature
raised to over 77°F.</i>

1126
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,932
{\an8}It's a miracle!
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,932
<i>Many areas around the
Arakawa River are flooded.</i>

1127
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:29,140
<i>Many areas around the
Arakawa River are flooded.</i>

1128
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,476
{\an8}Flooded but it's sunny!
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,476
<i>Many areas around the
Arakawa River are flooded.</i>

1129
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:30,683
<i>Many areas around the
Arakawa River are flooded.</i>

1130
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:30,847
{\an8}Thanks Sunshine Girl!
{\an8}I saw her in a dream!
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:30,847
<i>Many areas around the
Arakawa River are flooded.</i>

1131
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:30,968
{\an8}Thanks Sunshine Girl!
{\an8}I saw her in a dream!

1132
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,060
{\an8}Thanks Sunshine Girl!
{\an8}I saw her in a dream!
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,060
<i>The transport system is still paralyzed...</i>

1133
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:32,393
<i>The transport system is still paralyzed...</i>

1134
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:32,762
{\an8}I think I had the same dream!
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:32,762
<i>The transport system is still paralyzed...</i>

1135
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:32,886
{\an8}I think I had the same dream!

1136
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:33,683
{\an8}I think I had the same dream!
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:33,683
<i>The extent of the damage
has yet to be assessed.</i>

1137
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,502
<i>The extent of the damage
has yet to be assessed.</i>

1138
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,324
<i>It will take at least
a few days for recovery.</i>

1139
01:17:38,332 --> 01:17:40,026
<i>Everyone looks happy
this morning.</i>

1140
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,259
<i>It's the first sunny day in 72 days.</i>
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,259

1141
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,156
- Hey, look at the sky.
- Wow, finally.

1142
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,192
- It's sunny.
- It cleared up!

1143
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,201
The sky's so clear.

1144
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,158
I feel like crying.

1145
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,499
<i>Finally, the real summer
has arrived.</i>

1146
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,964
What are you doing?

1147
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:09,719
Hina...

1148
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,476
She sacrificed herself.

1149
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,311
- Hina! Tell me it's not true!
- Hey!

1150
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,060
Hina! Hina!

1151
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,066
I've got a question.

1152
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:30,278
The girl who was with you yesterday
is 15-year-old Hina Amano, correct?

1153
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,239
Do you know where she is?

1154
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,076
Hina's 15?

1155
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,335
Not 18?

1156
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,169
She faked her resume at work.

1157
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,844
I guess she had to make a living,
but that's her actual age.

1158
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,634
The compulsory school age.

1159
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,389
Didn't you know?

1160
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,138
What the heck?

1161
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:58,229
I'm the oldest one.

1162
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,190
What a pain.

1163
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:04,486
Don't you know where she may be?

1164
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:10,408
The sky has cleared because
she offered herself in exchange!

1165
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,864
And nobody knows that.
I can't take it.

1166
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,953
This is a pain.

1167
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,868
Will we need a medical expert?

1168
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:24,877
It's so sunny...

1169
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,018
Daddy! Hey, did you look outside?

1170
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,311
Yeah, I did.

1171
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,776
I dreamed of Hina.

1172
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,901
I'm sure it was her
who made it sunny again.

1173
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,162
Yeah.

1174
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:56,117
Maybe you're right.

1175
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,325
{\an8}Ikebukuro Police Station

1176
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,647
{\an8}Ikebukuro Police Station
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,647
Excuse me.

1177
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,624
Detective,
I've got a favor to ask you.

1178
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,633
What?

1179
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:10,636
Let me go look for Hina.
It's my turn to help her now.

1180
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,638
I'll come back
as soon as I find her.

1181
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:16,551
I'll listen to you in here.
Come on.

1182
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,063
Tell Mr. Yasui that we'll
interrogate him now.

1183
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,191
Yes, sir.

1184
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,187
Hey! Wait!

1185
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,487
Wait!

1186
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,111
Someone stop him!

1187
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:33,526
Stop!

1188
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,698
- That brat.
- Don't let him get out of the station.

1189
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,793
Stop!

1190
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,743

1191
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:44,463
Stop!

1192
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:50,500
Bastard!

1193
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,182
What the hell?!

1194
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,802
Cheeky bastard.

1195
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:57,935
Quick, cross the street!

1196
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:06,909
Darn!

1197
01:21:15,645 --> 01:21:16,645
Hodaka!

1198
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,290
- Natsumi?
- What are you doing?

1199
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,830
I'm going to find Hina.

1200
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:28,714
Get on.

1201
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:35,845
That brat!

1202
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,844
Nagi called.

1203
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,098
He said Hina disappeared
and you got arrested.

1204
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,311
Where is he?

1205
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,855
At the Child Consultation Center.

1206
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:54,615
How exciting. We're outlaws now!

1207
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,988
Where are we going, then?

1208
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,575
What? Another visitor?

1209
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,377
{\an8}Visitor:
{\an8}Ayane Hanazawa

1210
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,833
Oh, it's another girl.

1211
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,714
He's popular, huh?

1212
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,458
{\an8}Visiting Room

1213
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,470
{\an8}Visiting Room
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,470
Nagi.

1214
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,799
Ayane! You're here too.

1215
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,427
- Kana, this is Ayane.
- Pleased to meet you.

1216
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,641
- Ayane, this is Kana.
- Nice to meet you.

1217
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,725
And she's officer Sasaki.
She'll be here with me all day.

1218
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:29,733
You're like a VIP, Nagi.
Pleased to meet you.

1219
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:30,977
{\an8}Today's Meeting Record

1220
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,028
{\an8}Today's Meeting Record
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,028
Thank you so much for coming.

1221
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,022
Sorry for the sudden call.

1222
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:39,068
For real! When I heard they took you
into custody, my heart almost stopped.

1223
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,445
Same for me.
My heart's still pounding.

1224
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,534
Touch and feel it, Nagi.

1225
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:46,916
Oh, you're right.

1226
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,256
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1227
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:56,881
It's my first visit
so I'm a bit nervous.

1228
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,794
Ah.

1229
01:22:57,907 --> 01:23:00,254
You know...
I need to use the toilet.

1230
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,886
Oh, right. Okay.

1231
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,394
Thanks, I owe you one.

1232
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:11,607
Jeez. You call your ex
whenever you need something.

1233
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,154
Here.

1234
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,896
Look the other way.
I'll take my clothes off.

1235
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,124
Mr. Keisuke Suga.

1236
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,622
Thank you for yesterday.

1237
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,294
You again?

1238
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:34,665
Summer's finally back
the way it should, huh?

1239
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,839
I told you I know nothing
about that runaway boy.

1240
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,880
Can we check out
your office for a minute?

1241
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,924
- Hey, what's that for?
- Oh, it's flooded.

1242
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,934
Didn't you catch him already?

1243
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:51,189
Well, it's a bit
embarrassing, but...

1244
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,442
Huh? Did he run away...

1245
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:54,985
from a police station?

1246
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,445
That abandoned building in Yoyogi?

1247
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,652
Yeah, that's where she
became a Sunshine Girl.

1248
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:00,900
Bend down!

1249
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:07,455
She said she got connected to the sky
on the roof of that building.

1250
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,284
So, if I go there, I'm sure...

1251
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,297
Whoops!

1252
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,887
You, on that bike! Stop!

1253
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,135
Hold tight!

1254
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:32,598
Whoa!

1255
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,485
Natsumi!

1256
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:37,736
Am I awesome or what?
I think I was born for this.

1257
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,483
Maybe...

1258
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:43,116
I should become a speed cop!

1259
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:46,490
They won't hire you now!

1260
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:52,830
As for the reason for his escape...

1261
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:57,581
I think he may be searching
for the girl who was with him.

1262
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:01,005
{\an8}I went shopping!

1263
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,005
Well, let's me think...

1264
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:06,260
He said she's disappeared
in exchange for this good weather.

1265
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,844
What? Don't tell me you...

1266
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,266
No, I don't believe it.

1267
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:16,312
But, he's throwing his life away.

1268
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:22,610
And all because there's a girl
he wants to be with so badly.

1269
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,905
{\an8}Moka 3yo
{\an8}Moka 2yo
{\an8}Moka 1yo
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,905
Makes me feel a bit envious.

1270
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,072
There's not point
in telling me that.

1271
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,211
Mr. Suga, you...

1272
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,340
Huh?

1273
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,211
Are you feeling okay?

1274
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:41,420
Why?

1275
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,924
Well, you are...

1276
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,756
crying.

1277
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,817
Oh, no.

1278
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,443
We're jumping in!

1279
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,498
Can't go any further.

1280
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,409
Go! Hodaka.

1281
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,210
Thank you, Natsumi.

1282
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,463
Hodaka!

1283
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,382
Get her back!

1284
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,957
Hina. Hina. Hina. Hina!

1285
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:04,298
Are you there? Hina!

1286
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,715
Hey, Hodaka.

1287
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:09,971
It's all clear and shiny now.

1288
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,892
It's for you.

1289
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,227
You've only drunk liquid for dinner
three nights in a row.

1290
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,563
Does it hurt?
You're a runaway, aren't you?

1291
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:21,061
But, you can't really enjoy Tokyo
with this kind of rain.

1292
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,563
Younger than me.

1293
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,401
I'll be 18 next month.

1294
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,424
I'll be 18 next month.

1295
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,728
You should treat your elders
with respect.

1296
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,273
Hey, did you have lunch?

1297
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:28,569
Sit there and relax.

1298
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,075
So how do you like living in Tokyo?

1299
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:32,077
Come to think of it,

1300
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:35,117
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

1301
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,824
Happy to hear that.

1302
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:41,586
I'm in love with...
this Sunshine Girl job.

1303
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,340
Just wanted to say,
Thank you, Hodaka.

1304
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,340
Someone got onto the tracks.

1305
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,346
- Who's that?
- Hey, you!

1306
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:54,094
It's dangerous!

1307
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,724
Hey! What are you doing?

1308
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,806
It's dangerous! Stop!

1309
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,228
- What's that? Hilarious.
- What is he doing?

1310
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,602
- There's someone running.
- He'll get arrested.

1311
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,521
There are idiots like that.

1312
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,504
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1313
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,172
I'm sorry, Hina!

1314
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,208
I made you do that
Sunshine Girl thing.

1315
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,632
And you've been shouldering
all the responsibility.

1316
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,058
Hey, Hodaka.

1317
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,058

1318
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,847
You'd also like this
rain to stop, right?

1319
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,084
Mr. Suga?

1320
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,341
I was looking for you, Hodaka.

1321
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,255
Why?

1322
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,550
Do you realize
what you're doing?

1323
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,222
Hina's disappeared.

1324
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,597
It's my fault.
The Sunshine Girl job was my idea.

1325
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:20,593
Hodaka, you...

1326
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,683
It's my turn to help her now!

1327
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,183
I must go.

1328
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:28,189
Wait!

1329
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,193
Where are you...

1330
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,438
I can go to where she is
through there!

1331
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:35,571
What are you saying?

1332
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:38,657
She's in the sky!
I'll use the emergency stairs.

1333
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,286
- She can't be up there.
- I have to help her!

1334
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,201
Get a grip!

1335
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:47,750
Calm down, please...

1336
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,790
Go back to the police station.

1337
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,963
They'll understand.
You've done nothing wrong.

1338
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:57,972
If she's gone but you keep running
after her, you'll end up like me. Get it?

1339
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,975
Suspect's car found.
Going to apprehend him.

1340
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,229
Don't worry, I'll come with you.

1341
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,974
Let's explain everything
together, ok?

1342
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,441
Let me go! Please!

1343
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,443
Calm down.

1344
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:11,572
Get off me!

1345
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,734
You bastard!

1346
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,994
Don't stand in my way!

1347
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,699
Hodaka. That's...

1348
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:27,077
Let me go see Hina!

1349
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:42,433

1350
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:48,769

1351
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,350
Hodaka Morishima!

1352
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:51,980
Drop the gun!

1353
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,609
Hey, wait a minute.

1354
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:59,075
It's a misunderstanding.
I'll explain.

1355
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,319
Right, Hodaka?

1356
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,871
You...

1357
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,374
Put the gun down, young man.

1358
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,376
Please don't make me shoot.

1359
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:21,892
Hodaka.

1360
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,601
Come on Hodaka,
just put it down.

1361
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:28,347
What's wrong with you guys?
He's just a kid!

1362
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:29,897
Leave me alone!

1363
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:35,062
Why are you holding me up? You don't know
how I feel. You pretend you don't.

1364
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:38,568
I just want to see her...

1365
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:39,994
one more time!

1366
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:47,543
Got him!

1367
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,578
Let go of me!

1368
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,589
Take your hands off him.
Assholes!

1369
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,176
You bastard!

1370
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,805
Hodaka, go!

1371
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:05,936
Stop!

1372
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,147
Hodaka!

1373
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:10,691
Nagi!

1374
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,110
Hey!

1375
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,602
Hodaka, it's your fault!

1376
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,613
Bring my sister back!

1377
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:30,458

1378
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:38,549

1379
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:45,928

1380
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:52,517

1381
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:53,435

1382
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,350
Dear God,

1383
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:59,317
please, please, please,

1384
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:00,317
Please!

1385
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,267
Sky fish?

1386
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:02,171
Hina!

1387
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,189
Hina!

1388
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,567
Hina!

1389
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,416
Hina!

1390
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:42,423

1391
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,421
- Hina!
- Hodaka?

1392
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:44,421

1393
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:49,468

1394
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,720

1395
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,430
- Hodaka!
- Hina!

1396
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:53,676

1397
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:54,427
Jump!

1398
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:56,012

1399
01:34:57,233 --> 01:35:02,606

1400
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:06,480

1401
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,195
Hina, I found you!

1402
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:08,362

1403
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,197
Hoda—
Hodaka!

1404
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:10,614

1405
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,953
- Don't let go of my hands.
- Okay.

1406
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:11,991

1407
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:12,953

1408
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:17,409

1409
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:23,960

1410
01:35:27,361 --> 01:35:28,359
Ah!

1411
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:31,892
Hina!

1412
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:33,515
Hodaka!

1413
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:38,100

1414
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,106

1415
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:42,308
Hina, let's go home!

1416
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,308

1417
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:42,900

1418
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:46,028
But, if I do, the weather will...

1419
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:44,352

1420
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:46,028

1421
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:46,145

1422
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,437
Doesn't matter!

1423
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,069
It's enough!

1424
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:49,315

1425
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,568
You don't have to be
the Sunshine Girl anymore!

1426
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:50,441

1427
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:51,568

1428
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,786

1429
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:57,122

1430
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,247

1431
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:04,383

1432
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:07,884
Who cares if we don't
see the sun again!

1433
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:11,053
I want you more
than any blue sky!

1434
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:14,341
The weather...

1435
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,510
can go to hell!

1436
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,555

1437
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:23,941

1438
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,149

1439
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,439

1440
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:31,024

1441
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:34,197

1442
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,204

1443
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,248

1444
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:42,789

1445
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:48,841

1446
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,302

1447
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,180
This time, pray for yourself...

1448
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:00,352
Hina.

1449
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:02,733
Okay.

1450
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:23,834
Hodaka...

1451
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:48,021

1452
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:55,111

1453

1454
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:07,586

1455
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:13,592
The rain started falling again
that day, and never stopped.

1456
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:17,676
It's slowly sinking Tokyo
into the water.

1457
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:22,594
And it's still falling now,
three years later.

1458
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:32,983

1459
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:41,157

1461
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:00,821
For real...

1462
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,809
{\an8}Congratulations
{\an8}on your graduation

1463
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,809
Do you really want me to sing?

1464
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,604

1465
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,047
Morishima-sempai!

1466
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:13,486
Er... You're moving
to Tokyo, aren't you?

1467
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,362
Huh? Yeah.

1468
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:18,945
Come on, ask him.
It's now or never.

1469
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:21,740
Eh? Is this really...

1470
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:26,786
You know... there's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1471
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:29,126
the first time someone
tells me they love me?

1472
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:32,379
I'd like to know...

1473
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:33,758
Is it...

1474
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:37,506
Is it true you're wanted
by the police in Tokyo?

1475
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:39,514
Huh?

1476
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:46,177
That summer three years ago,

1477
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,932
I was arrested and went on trial.

1478
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:54,978
They put me on probation
until graduation.

1479
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:58,273
The island, my parents' house,
and the school...

1480
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,946
They all were the same old places
they forced me to live at.

1481
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:06,664
But, I just kept quietly waiting
for graduation.

1482
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:08,919
I haven't...

1483
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:13,504
seen Hina since that day.

1484
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:18,426
I have no idea what I'll feel

1485
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:23,051
seeing Tokyo in its current state

1486
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:26,384
nor what I'll say to her.

1487

<i>It will rain again all day.</i>

1490
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:35,526
Now I need to find
a part-time job.

1491
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:36,981
{\an8}Job Search

1492
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:42,115
{\an8}Hiring part-time
{\an8}Looking for food service worker

1493
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:48,164
<i>The high will be 59°F. Same or slightly
hotter than today in most areas.</i>

1496
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:50,687
Oh, right...

1497
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,160
Speaking of part-time jobs...

1498
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:57,874
{\an8}Sunshine for You

1499
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,125
It's still there.

1500
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,125

1501
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,387
{\an8}1 request.

1502
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,133
It was a Sunshine Girl request

1503
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:09,514
from two years ago.

1504
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:13,098
<i>Next stop: Takashimadaira.</i>

1505
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,608
Look who's here. Are you alone?

1506

{\an8}Tachibana
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,644
Where's the Sunshine Girl?

1507
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,147
She's no longer a Sunshine Girl.

1508
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:24,408
I came just to tell you that.

1509
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:26,906
Don't trouble yourself.

1510
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:32,620
You moved. You used to live
in an older house downtown.

1511
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:36,374
The whole area
is under water now.

1512
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,667
I'm sorry.

1513
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:39,916
Why do you apologize?

1514
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:41,428
No, it's...

1515
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:50,017
You know, that area
used to be under the sea.

1516
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:54,100
Until 200 years ago.

1517
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:58,734
In old times, Tokyo
was just a bay.

1518
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:03,234
Human beings and the weather
changed it, little by little.

1519
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:10,287
So, well... I think it's just
gone back to its original self.

1520
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:12,952
What the heck.

1521
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,452
You've been thinking
about that crap for three years?

1522
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:16,877
Don't say it like that...

1523
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:20,881
You're about to start college,
but you're still talking like a kid.

1524
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,008
But, that day we...

1525
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:28,221
What? You two caused this?
Did you break the world?

1526
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:34,763
Not at all, dummy.
Don't flatter yourself.

1527
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:39,228
Look, look. I went on a date
with my daughter.

1528
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,981
And Natsumi and Nagi
came along too.

1529
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:47,237
Anyway, stop brooding over
stupid stuff and go see her.

1530
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,783
Why haven't you?

1531
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:52,488
I was on probation so
I didn't want to cause her trouble.

1532
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,623
She doesn't even have a cellphone.

1533
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:56,959
And I'm so nervous.

1534
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,707
I don't know what to say to her.

1535
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:08,212
Rain? You're so big now.

1536
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:11,973
Come on, get out of here.
Go now. I've got work to do!

1537
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:14,010
Just go to her already.

1538
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,269
Thank you for your time.

1539
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:17,684
Come back again.

1540
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,432
Hey.

1541
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,565
Really, stop worrying, kid.

1542
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,611
The world's always
been crazy anyway.

1545
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:46,883
- Looking forward to the picnic.
- Yeah!

1546
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:00,557
It was under the sea, huh?

1547
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:06,020
And the world's always
been crazy anyway.

1548
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:12,989
So, it's no one's fault
that it's like this.

1549
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:16,914
Is that what I should
say to her?

1550

No. That's not it.

1555
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:55,612
That day, I...
We changed the world.

1556
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:57,780
I made a choice.

1557
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:01,537
I chose her over this world.
Nothing else should matter.
I chose to live with her!

Yeah.
