1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,438
- You ready?
- Yep. All set.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,440
All right. Ready to roll?

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,883
A camera rolling.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,488
<i>Oh, shit, I don't...</i>

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,864
Let me mentally prepare myself

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,908
'cause I know my parents
are gonna watch this one day.

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,035
So, just... Um...

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,914
Look, if I would've known
that accepting this woman's invitation

9
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,540
to go back to her hotel room

10
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,210
would've led
to a scandal involving the president

11
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,486
of the largest
Christian university in the world

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,988
and the president of the United States,

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,367
I would've walked away
and just enjoyed my private life.

<i>If you go
to the Fontainebleau on a Saturday,</i>

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,266
<i>it looks like you're in Vegas.</i>

17
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,923
<i>And if you don't have the connections,</i>

18
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>you're gonna wait two hours in line.</i>

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,594
<i>It's a big party scene,
everyone's having a good time,</i>

20
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,121
<i>people are drinking, there's cabanas.</i>

21
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,542
<i>People ordering bottle service,
spending a lot of money.</i>

22
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>The waitresses would get hit on,
you know, us guys would get hit on too.</i>

23
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,007
That's why it's a fun job.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,390
<i>My job as a pool attendant
at the Fontainebleau was very simple.</i>

25
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,581
<i>Folding towels,
fixing the chairs, umbrellas,</i>

26
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>and just interact with the guests.</i>

27
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,199
<i>March 2012 was like any other day.</i>

28
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,994
I'm doing the usual, just, uh,
changing towels, talking to the guests.

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,264
That day, I...

30
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,600
I was flirting
with, you know, some girls.

31
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,143
<i>They were about my age.</i>

32
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,562
<i>And then I look over,
you know, behind my shoulder,</i>

33
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,129
<i>and I see this woman looking at me.</i>

34
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,050
<i>She was just laying back,
sipping on a drink,</i>

35
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,053
and just eyeing me down,
just staring at me.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,472
<i>She was actually snapping pictures of me.</i>

37
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,683
<i>She was in her 40s,
more than twice my age.</i>

38
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>She was attractive.</i>

39
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>Yeah, she was a cougar.</i>

40
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,834
And I'm like,
"Why are you taking pictures of me?"

41
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,169
<i>And then she tells me,</i>

42
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,670
<i>"Don't waste your time
with the younger ones.</i>

43
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,134
<i>They don't know what they're doing."</i>

44
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,450
And at that moment, I knew
that she probably wanted something more.

45
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,245
<i>It started intensifying.</i>

46
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,598
<i>She makes a proposition.</i>

47
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,475
<i>She's like,
"You wanna go back to my hotel?"</i>

48
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,644
<i>I'm like, "Let's go back. I'm down."</i>

49
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,898
Like, I... I don't think any 20-year-old
would reject this proposition, right?

50
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,109
If an attractive woman tells you
to go back to the hotel room,

51
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,611
you're probably gonna take it.

52
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,863
<i>And then she told me,
"But one thing, though.</i>

53
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,764
<i>My, uh, my husband wants to watch."</i>

54
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,287
<i>â™ª</i>

55
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,691
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. is officially out
as President of Liberty University.</i>

56
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,171
<i>The evangelical leader resigning
from the college his father founded</i>

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,488
<i>under a cloud of scandal.</i>

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,051
<i>His fall from grace was swift and steep.</i>

59
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,596
<i>A one-time Miami pool attendant,
Giancarlo Granda,</i>

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,433
<i>claiming he had a seven-year affair
with Falwell's wife, Becki,</i>

61
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,127
<i>and that Falwell watched
when they were intimate.</i>

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,607
<i>It is the latest
in a shocking string of scandals</i>

63
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,693
<i>to hit one
of the most influential families</i>

64
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,011
<i>in the evangelical Conservative movement.</i>

65
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,983
<i>I grew up in, uh, Westchester, Miami,</i>

66
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:22,054
which is a predominately Cuban,
working-class, uh, neighborhood.

67
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,450
<i>He was a cute, little, blond baby.</i>

68
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,577
<i>Everyone loved him... Adorable.</i>

69
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,747
He was the typical,
annoying little brother.

70
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,023
We have a seven-year difference.

71
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,336
<i>My childhood was pretty much normal,</i>

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,819
<i>you know, in Miami standards.</i>

73
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:43,009
<i>Giancarlo may seem
a little aloof, a little guarded.</i>

74
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,595
That's just him
being a product of his upbringing.

75
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,891
He was raised in a conservative
Catholic family in Miami.

76
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,142
- Write to me, Jerry Falwell...

77
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,187
<i>His mom grew up
on</i> The Old-Time Gospel Hour,

78
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,564
<i>courtesy of Jerry Falwell Sr.</i>

79
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,066
<i>She was very religious.</i>

80
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,008
<i>She was a true believer.</i>

81
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,655
<i>As a child,
he was always the social kid.</i>

82
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,681
<i>He made friends everywhere he went.</i>

83
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,393
- I went to a Catholic high school
called St. Brendan High School.

84
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,996
<i>Once he got into the teen years,</i>

85
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,165
<i>there was a little bit of a switch in him.</i>

86
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,917
<i>He got really into video games.</i>

87
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,526
It was an addiction.

88
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,089
<i>Just spent an unhealthy amount of time
playing video games.</i>

89
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,507
<i>It became a problem.</i>

90
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,093
<i>My personality
just completely transformed.</i>

91
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,970
<i>I started to isolate, withdraw.</i>

92
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,455
- He became introverted, antisocial.

93
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:35,395
<i>My ability to feel comfortable
in a social setting was, uh, compromised.</i>

94
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,648
Like, I just...
I didn't wanna be out with friends.

95
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,965
I didn't feel comfortable.

96
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,818
<i>It was rough to experience</i>

97
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,802
<i>'cause no one really knew
how to handle it.</i>

98
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,822
<i>My parents, my sister,</i>

99
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,240
<i>they were very supportive
during that time.</i>

100
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,807
<i>It was a dark period for me.</i>

101
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,579
- It was sad and... and hard
for all of us, especially my parents

102
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,022
because they didn't really know
how to handle it.

103
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,669
<i>After high school,
I told myself, "I need to change my life,"</i>

104
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,755
<i>so I started eating healthy,
started working out.</i>

105
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,924
<i>But I was still that shy, reserved kid.</i>

106
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,742
<i>I still had insecurities.</i>

107
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,013
I wanted to... to work and experience life,

108
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,289
and... and actually,
make money and save money.

109
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,262
<i>So I reached out to a friend
that worked at the Fontainebleau Hotel.</i>

110
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,899
- That's when he really started
coming out of his shell,

111
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,276
dating girls, having a social life.

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,111
He was doing good.

113
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,822
He was excited about school,
excited about his future.

114
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,741
<i>I worked
at the Fontainebleau for one year.</i>

115
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,118
<i>I was working full-time
and going to school part-time.</i>

116
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,455
There's days where I was making,
like, $200 to $500 a day in cash.

117
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,165
It was pretty good for a 20-year-old.

118
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,251
- From that dark time
when he was, like, 15

119
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,612
to where he was at now,
like, it was just a different kid.

120
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,927
<i>When he started busting out,
that was a whole new world for him.</i>

121
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,096
And he went off the deep end head-first.

122
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,438
<i>After my shift, I'm driving home.</i>

123
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,130
I tell my sister what's gonna happen.

124
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,234
- This is a terrible idea.

125
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,235
Like, this is weird.

126
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,111
Who are these people? Where are they from?

127
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:11,515
<i>Are they just here in Miami
just to do sexual escapades?</i>

128
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,716
- She's like, "Oh,
this doesn't sound like a good idea."

129
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,205
- There's only so much I could tell him.

130
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,541
Like, once he makes up his mind
and is gonna do something,

131
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,376
he's gonna do it.

132
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
- I probably should've listened to her.

133
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,965
- That's been our relationship
our entire lives.

134
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,509
Like, if you'd just listened to me
from the beginning,

135
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,785
your life would be a lot easier.

136
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,957
<i>That night, I get a phone call
from a blocked private number,</i>

137
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,084
<i>and, uh, it was the woman.</i>

138
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,314
She said, "We rented a hotel room
at the Days Inn just around the block."

139
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,983
They didn't wanna
do it at the Fontainebleau

140
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,487
'cause their kids were staying there.

141
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,072
<i>My brother calls me on his way</i>

142
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,700
<i>so someone knew what he was doing
and where he was going.</i>

143
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:58,145
In case things got weird,
someone knew where to go to get him.

144
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,626
<i>I walk into the... to the lobby.</i>

145
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,361
<i>I'm nervous.
I'm like, "What the hell am I doing?"</i>

146
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,758
Again, this is a very stupid scenario
I got myself into.

147
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,802
And I'm trying to talk myself out of it,

148
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,346
but then, I'm also thinking,
"Eh, who cares? I'll just do this."

149
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,039
I was a horny 20-year-old.

150
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,168
Uh, there... There really
is no other explanation other than that.

151
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,772
<i>This guy was as green as they come.</i>

152
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,007
He never even had
a high school girlfriend.

153
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,652
<i>She's sitting there on the couch.</i>

154
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,904
<i>I sit down. I'm nervous.</i>

155
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>She's like, "Hey, I'm Becki.
Take this to... to calm down."</i>

156
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,284
She told me that,

157
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,686
<i>"The night before, we were
at a swingers club called Miami Velvet."</i>

158
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,855
I'm like, "Oh, shit."

159
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,001
<i>"No, that's not our thing,
it's too public."</i>

160
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,336
<i>"We want something more private."</i>

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,821
<i>"We were looking around for other people,
and you were perfect."</i>

162
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,283
<i>She stroked my inner thigh.</i>

163
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,744
She did a very good job at seducing me.

164
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,873
<i>And the Jack Daniels definitely helped.</i>

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,104
<i>And she said, "All right,
let's just go up to the room."</i>

166
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,106
I'm like,
"All right. Shit, let's do it."

167
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,136
<i>It's a small hotel room. There's two beds.</i>

168
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,325
<i>As I walk in, it's just her husband,</i>

169
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,370
<i>he's laying on the bed,
jeans are unzipped.</i>

170
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,412
<i>He's having a drink,</i>

171
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,106
<i>kinda giggling to himself
'cause he... he's excited.</i>

172
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,503
<i>We did small talk, trying to just get
comfortable with each other.</i>

173
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,213
I told the husband, I'm like,

174
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,632
"Hey, if you get jealous,
or you don't like this

175
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,883
"and you... you don't want me here,

176
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,718
just let me know
and I'll walk out, no problem."

177
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,846
<i>"Oh, no.
Don't worry about it. Just go for it.</i>

178
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,849
<i>I'm gonna sit right here,
and, uh, you guys do your thing."</i>

179
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,768
<i>We start kissing,
we were feeling each other up.</i>

180
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,937
<i>"And then she said," Anything but.</i>

181
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,256
<i>No penetration,
no actual sex, just oral sex."</i>

182
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,135
<i>We're kissing, and,
you know, we go back to the bed.</i>

183
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,263
Oh, shit, I don't...

184
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,284
Yeah, it's... Ev... Ev...
Whenever I think of it,

185
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,578
I just... I cringe
at the thought of it but...

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,044
<i>The husband gets up,
and I get... I get a little nervous.</i>

187
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,046
I'm like, "What is he doing behind me?"

188
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,031
Uh, but he goes to the corner of the room.

189
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:19,929
<i>He took off his jeans
and then he just started, uh, jacking off.</i>

190
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,348
<i>Let's talk about cuck theory.</i>

191
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,417
<i>Ultimately, it's a guy who likes to watch.</i>

192
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,563
<i>"I'm fulfilled on a sexual level</i>

193
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,774
<i>by watching my wife
with a Cuban stallion."</i>

194
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,444
<i>I kept looking back,
and I saw him, like, in the corner.</i>

195
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,279
<i>He was trying to hide.</i>

196
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,864
<i>He didn't want
himself being exposed or anything.</i>

197
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,516
<i>He just wanted to observe the situation.</i>

198
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,535
I wish the husband wasn't there.

199
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,037
That would've been a better situation.

200
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,622
That's what
I was telling myself at the time.

201
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,165
<i>As a horny 20-year-old,</i>

202
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,317
<i>I'm like, "I'm gonna block this out,
I'm gonna have sex with this cougar."</i>

203
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,795
Instantly, like,
there was this connection.

204
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,047
<i>She was staring at me.</i>

205
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,740
<i>I could tell that
she obviously wanted to do this again.</i>

206
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,415
<i>The next day,
we hung out again at the Fontainebleau.</i>

207
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,043
<i>I knew what
I was getting myself into at that point.</i>

208
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,671
<i>After we finished,</i>

209
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,441
<i>we actually hung out and we talked.</i>

210
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,444
And they said what their names were,
you know, Jerry and Becki.

211
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,345
"Wow, nice to meet you guys."

212
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,076
<i>They said that
they help out a lot of young people,</i>

213
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,644
<i>and if I ever need help
that they can definitely help me out.</i>

214
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,873
We were talking about politics.

215
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,000
We had, you know, common beliefs.

216
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,086
I... I was raised Republican.

217
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,238
I remember Becki said, "He's perfect."

218
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,925
<i>It was nice connecting with them</i>

219
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,094
and just humanizing the situation.

220
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,678
It wasn't just these strangers anymore.

221
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,014
<i>After they left Miami,</i>

222
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,291
<i>she gave me a really good review
on Tripadvisor.</i>

223
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,686
<i>I didn't have her last name.</i>

224
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,104
<i>I didn't really know who they were,</i>

225
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,839
until I... I got an email on March 22nd.

226
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,025
<i>And it actually came from Jerry.</i>

227
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,279
<i>It was a picture of us that we took
at the Fontainebleau Hotel.</i>

228
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,030
<i>There's a picture with me and Becki,</i>

229
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,699
<i>and then one with Jerry.</i>

230
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,077
<i>He sent the email saying,
"Becki wanted me to send this to you."</i>

231
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,415
- Immediately, I was like, "Who?"

232
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,375
- And she's like, "Oh, Jerry Falwell?"

233
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,710
She... She recognized the name.

234
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,130
She's like, "Isn't that,
like, the famous pastor, preacher?"

235
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,339
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

236
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,969
This cannot be the same people
that I'm thinking about right now.

237
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,953
- And I'm like,
"I... I honestly don't even know."

238
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,456
<i>So I ended up Googling him.</i>

239
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,377
<i>- Becki, would you stand
in your Liberty Flames dress?</i>

240
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,817
I think it's very fitting
that she's wearing that dress

241
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,278
because I believe
she's the hottest first lady

242
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,887
of any college in the country.

243
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,993
<i>"Oh, so he's the President
of Liberty University."</i>

244
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,603
I didn't know what Liberty University was,
never heard of it.

245
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,546
- Liberty University
is a one-of-a-kind school

246
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,089
<i>in Lynchburg, Virginia.</i>

247
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,259
<i>It's a nonprofit Christian university,</i>

248
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,578
<i>where both students and faculty
practice what they preach.</i>

249
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,020
<i>I knew immediately
that they were successful,</i>

250
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,774
<i>and then I started learning that they were
not just successful and had money,</i>

251
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,818
<i>but they were powerful and well-connected.</i>

252
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,446
- My father founded
Thomas Road Baptist Church in 1956.

253
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,490
<i>It is now located next door to campus.</i>

254
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,741
- Good morning.

255
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,202
And I welcome you to the morning service

256
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,289
at the Thomas Road Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Virginia.

257
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,708
- The church services
were broadcast nationally

258
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,585
<i>in the 1970s and '80s.</i>

259
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,379
<i>TV preacher, Dr. Jerry Falwell,</i>

260
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,339
<i>whose doctorate is honorary, not earned,</i>

261
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:46,469
<i>turned a small Virginia church of 35
into a Christians communications empire.</i>

262
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,514
<i>Falwell preaches
to a church of 4,000 each Sunday,</i>

263
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,599
<i>with a TV audience of 20 million.</i>

264
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,726
<i>I believe these are the last days.</i>

265
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,770
What is the thing
that interests God the most?

266
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,689
Getting people ready for his coming,

267
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,275
<i>getting people ready
for the sounding of the cross.</i>

268
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,403
- He founded Liberty University in 1971.

269
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,822
<i>A school for 50,000 students,</i>

270
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,159
<i>from kindergarten
right through a doctoral program.</i>

271
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,536
- We have what we think
is a boot camp here for the Lord,

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,454
training soldiers for Christ.

273
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,623
- He founded
Moral Majority a few years later.

274
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:20,086
<i>Moral Majority was a coalition that shared
pro-life and pro-family values.</i>

275
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,172
- One man for one woman for one lifetime.

276
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,756
It's called the traditional family.

277
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,216
It's worked for 6,000 years.

278
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,010
- Many credited Moral Majority

279
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,596
with the election
of Ronald Reagan in 1980.

280
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,331
<i>I told Jerry,
"I found out more about your dad.</i>"

281
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,687
<i>"I read about what he would say,</i>

282
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,024
blaming, uh, 9/11 on homosexuals."

283
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,569
- The abortionists and the feminists
and the gays and the lesbians,

284
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,987
<i>all of them,</i>

285
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,197
<i>you helped this happen.</i>

286
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,807
- "Honestly, if you wanna know my opinion,
I think your dad was a piece of shit."

287
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,912
<i>"He's like," Eh, you know,
yeah, a lot of people think that.</i>

288
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,164
<i>But I'm completely different.
I'm not like my dad."</i>

289
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,750
<i>He said, "I'm a business guy,
and I see the future,"</i>

290
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,774
and I liked that.

291
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,588
<i>The Falwells are the Southern Gatsbys.</i>

292
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,508
They're wealthy
and they're sloppy as fuck.

293
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,259
- How old was Becki when you guys met?

294
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,928
Uh, some of our freshmen
don't know this story.

295
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,971
- No, we don't need to get on that story.

296
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,224
<i>She was 13 and I was 18 when I met her.</i>

297
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,875
<i>All right, let's not get, um...
So, Candace.</i>

298
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:21,523
Hey, girls, let's take a look at the ring
on Candace's finger, by the way.

299
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,857
- I think it's 13 carats,

300
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,961
the same age that you were,
Becki, when you guys met.

301
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,571
<i>Becki grew up in North Carolina.</i>

302
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,907
<i>They were a religious family.</i>

303
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,536
She told me that her father was in timber.

304
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,372
I later found out
her father was in trailer parks,

305
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,916
<i>and went to prison for tax evasion.</i>

306
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,067
- Becki, tell 'em how you proposed to me.

307
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,757
- Falwell Jr. went to Liberty University
with Becki's older sister.

308
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,551
- Yeah, I proposed to Jerry.

309
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:53,954
He had finished law school,
and he had taken the bar exam.

310
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,517
<i>She dropped out of Liberty
to support Jerry,</i>

311
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,853
<i>who was down
at the University of Virginia.</i>

312
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,272
- And I said, "Can we get married now?"

313
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,297
And he said, "Yes."

314
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,734
<i>Becki said to me,
with sort of embarrassment,</i>

315
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,362
"Oh, we had the most boring wedding
of anybody ever.

316
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:13,182
There was no drinking alcohol.
There was no dancing. It was just awful."

317
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,077
<i>And they popped out three kids,</i>

318
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,746
<i>Trey, Wesley, and Caroline.</i>

319
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,747
<i>These are two people</i>

320
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:23,793
<i>who have, for a long time,
been and remain very much in love.</i>

321
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,962
<i>I don't see any daylight between them.</i>

322
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,132
They're just extremely intertwined,
psychologically and emotionally.

323
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,093
It's very unusual
to come across a married couple like that.

324
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,620
<i>My father,
he would tell his congregation,</i>

325
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,849
"Don't get mad
when people tell lies about you,

326
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,542
"just be glad
they don't know the truth." So.

327
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,147
<i>In some ways, Jerry was a black sheep.</i>

328
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:49,486
<i>A son who was not able
to access the kind of religious fervor</i>

329
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,472
<i>that defined his father
and that was going to define his family.</i>

330
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:57,076
- Jerry Jr. had not been
a conventional evangelical.

331
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,329
He believed that his role
to support the ministry

332
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,353
would be in business.

333
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,249
<i>He did set out doing real estate law</i>

334
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,752
<i>and not working with his father.</i>

335
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:10,340
<i>He came back to help get
the university out of financial distress.</i>

336
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,176
<i>I spent many days
negotiating with creditors</i>

337
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,180
and spent many weekends begging
and borrowing from donors and lenders

338
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,390
to cover the paychecks
that had already been issued

339
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,767
on the Friday before.

340
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,230
<i>Falwell Jr. was never
a good fit to be in a public-facing role.</i>

341
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,274
It wasn't something
that he sought out and asked for.

342
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,300
He inherited it
when his father passed away.

343
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,695
<i>He was a hero to Liberty, financially.</i>

344
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,949
<i>It brought Jerry Falwell money.
It brought him power.</i>

345
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,660
It gave him
the tacit approval of his father,

346
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,143
even after his father's death.

347
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,997
<i>If you're part of this dynasty,</i>

348
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,125
<i>then you can do
whatever the fuck you want,</i>

349
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,527
<i>and that couple did it to the hilt.</i>

350
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,201
<i>He was beloved
by a lot of students for his quirkiness.</i>

351
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,097
<i>People didn't treat him
like he was the spokesperson</i>

352
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:03,810
<i>for one of the largest Christian
and Conservative institutions
in the world.</i>

353
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,771
People treated him
like he was a cartoon character,

354
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,189
or their crazy uncle.

355
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,775
<i>He realized that
that familiarity students felt with him</i>

356
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,217
<i>gave him a lot of power.</i>

357
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,574
<i>What my brother did</i>

358
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,201
was with almost like the first family

359
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,854
of, like,
the evangelical Christianity Church.

360
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,753
<i>Becki calls me,</i>

361
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,281
<i>and she says they got a hotel
at the Cheeca Resort in the Keys.</i>

362
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,136
<i>This trip was different</i>

363
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,598
<i>because I wasn't just meeting them
and going back home.</i>

364
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,558
<i>I'm actually gonna
stay there for the weekend.</i>

365
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,727
<i>I remember driving down to Cheeca,</i>

366
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,437
<i>"I'm like," Wait,
we're gonna be in the same room.</i>

367
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,921
<i>Where's Jerry gonna be?"</i>

368
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,233
Uh, so that was... that was a concern.

369
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,902
<i>The sleeping arrangement was,</i>

370
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,029
<i>I slept on the bed with Becki</i>

371
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,097
<i>and, you know,
Jerry slept, uh, next to the bed.</i>

372
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,893
<i>Which, you know,
thinking back, it's kind of strange.</i>

373
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,997
<i>It was, I don't know,
like 5:00 in the morning,</i>

374
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,957
<i>and I just... I randomly woke up,</i>

375
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,734
<i>and I look over to the side
and Becki's just staring at me.</i>

376
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,570
<i>She has these dark black eyes.</i>

377
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,924
<i>I obviously kept hooking up with her,</i>

378
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,759
<i>but, you know,
I'm like, "This is kinda weird."</i>

379
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,701
<i>I'm like... I was startled by it.</i>

380
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:26,392
<i>The dynamic
of the relationship outside of the sex,</i>

381
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,186
<i>he liked being around them.</i>

382
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,232
<i>Jerry had the business acumen,
he was kind of a goofball.</i>

383
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:36,861
<i>And Becki Falwell
was Giancarlo Granda's warm bathwater.</i>

384
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,095
<i>She held his hand.</i>

385
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,574
- When we're talking,
it... it just felt natural.

386
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,202
<i>We really connected
'cause we would talk about business,</i>

387
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,578
<i>how he was a real estate attorney,</i>

388
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,163
how he developed real estate.

389
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,873
And he would tell me
about Liberty University,

390
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,584
<i>how, you know,
they were doing over $100 million</i>

391
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,901
<i>in construction projects.</i>

392
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,088
<i>You go to Lynchburg, Virginia,</i>

393
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,798
and they own
half of the real estate in that town.

394
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,508
He was impressed by them.

395
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,510
- Your ego is being stroked,

396
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:05,265
and you have Becki on one hand
telling him how beautiful he was,

397
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,684
<i>and then you get Jerry telling him,</i>

398
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,210
<i>"You're a bright kid,
and I like your thinking."</i>

399
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,982
- After the Cheeca trip,
we're talking on the phone every day

400
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:14,983
and texting every day.

401
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,151
She became my girlfriend.

402
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,952
<i>Becki was texting him 24/7.</i>

403
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:30,564
They didn't end a day
without at least one hour on the phone.

404
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,320
- She's really making an effort
to maintain this relationship.

405
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,090
<i>She said, finally she met somebody,</i>

406
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:42,260
<i>and she felt that she was having
an adventure.</i>

407
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,511
<i>She was having an affair.</i>

408
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,764
She was living this carefree,
youthful lifestyle

409
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,291
<i>that she never got to experience
when she was young.</i>

410
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,729
<i>Becki was the first woman
outside of my family,</i>

411
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,230
<i>uh, to say, "I love you."</i>

412
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,024
This is three weeks after meeting 'em.

413
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,508
I'm like...

414
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,238
<i>He's a kid,
he doesn't know what love is.</i>

415
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,116
And this is where
it became dangerous down the line.

416
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,078
But in the beginning, it's like,
"Whoa, I'm being lavished with attention.

417
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,355
"She wants to do it again?

418
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,752
Which exotic locale are we going to now?"

419
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,422
<i>Shortly after the Cheeca trip,</i>

420
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,591
<i>they invited me to New York.</i>

421
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,009
<i>They were gonna go there for business.</i>

422
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,093
<i>And they're like, "Hey, come over</i>

423
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,537
and we can discuss
how we can become business partners."

424
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,164
<i>So I meet them,
and I stayed the weekend with them.</i>

425
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,852
<i>We stayed at the Gansevoort Hotel
on Park Avenue.</i>

426
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,646
<i>We're at dinner at STK,</i>

427
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,690
<i>and I was really worried
that someone was gonna discover us</i>

428
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,943
<i>and it's gonna end up in the tabloids.</i>

429
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,778
<i>We're looking through the dessert menu,</i>

430
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:45,031
<i>and Becki spotted
the Carnival Menage A Trois.</i>

431
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,015
<i>And she was like, "Oh, let's get this."</i>

432
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,661
And I... I remember just feeling awkward

433
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,479
when she ordered
the Carnival Menage A Trois.

434
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,150
<i>Like, they're not being subtle about this.</i>

435
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,754
<i>But after dinner, we're talking,</i>

436
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,549
<i>and that's when he said,
"You need to make money yourself.</i>

437
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:06,386
<i>"With my past in real estate,
it's a great way to build wealth.</i>

438
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,889
<i>"We'll acquire a property
and we'll give you an equity stake in it.</i>

439
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,391
<i>"You just have to manage it.</i>

440
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,184
<i>"And then, you know,
when you make your first million,</i>

441
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,519
<i>"we'll all drink champagne together</i>

442
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,003
<i>and life is gonna be great."</i>

443
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,609
<i>Deep down,
I always wanted to invest in real estate.</i>

444
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,944
<i>I wanted to get in the game.</i>

445
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:23,969
I'm like, "This is it!"

446
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,032
- I thought, "Well,
maybe they can help him in some way",

447
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:31,494
"and however weird this thing started,

448
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,121
maybe it'll turn into something good."

449
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,081
They did what they wanted to do,

450
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,291
everyone had their fun,

451
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,276
and now let's go and be... adults.

452
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,422
<i>But Jerry quickly wanted to cut to,</i>

453
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,032
"Hey, let's go back to the hotel room
and do what we have to do."

454
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,538
<i>"Becki, she said," I have some good news.</i>

455
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,567
<i>We can go all the way this time."</i>

456
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,852
<i>They were both ready for me.</i>

457
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,586
<i>They both felt comfortable with me.</i>

458
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,550
- They thought it was the right time
to actually go forward with it.

459
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,992
- And there's no holding back anymore.

460
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,480
<i>As the relationship grew
and it intensified,</i>

461
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,778
<i>Jerry could sort of move out
of that creepy corner that he was in.</i>

462
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,549
<i>Jerry, you know,</i>

463
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,594
<i>he went from just, you know,
masturbating in the corner</i>

464
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,787
<i>to whenever I would finish,</i>

465
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,667
<i>he would go in, uh, for round two.</i>

466
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,730
<i>They were both
kind of looking for these things</i>

467
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,900
<i>that weren't actually available to them
within their religious community.</i>

468
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,986
Granda is part of that desire
that they shared.

469
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,780
<i>He was that element of kink</i>

470
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:53,225
<i>that they needed for them
to become closer, if you will.</i>

471
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,497
<i>Fast forward,
I'm back in Miami looking for properties.</i>

472
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,624
<i>I actually started
driving around by myself.</i>

473
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,275
I narrowed it down to Miami Beach.

474
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,419
- What is happening?

475
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,547
What do you know about any of this?

476
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,881
Like, you're 20.

477
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,259
He was like,
"I know, like, what I'm doing,

478
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,510
"I know the right people.

479
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,178
Like, we're gonna get this done."

480
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:16,683
And he relied on the Fernandezes.

481
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,312
<i>I reached out
to a friend of mine at the time,</i>

482
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,522
<i>Jesus Fernandez Jr.</i>

483
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,357
<i>We called him Tito.
That was his nickname.</i>

484
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,944
<i>And his dad, Jesus Fernandez Sr.,
he was a broker.</i>

485
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,697
<i>Him and his dad
are like your classic wannabe,</i>

486
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,657
<i>just Miami bullshit artists.</i>

487
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,451
It never really made sense
how he was friends with him, honestly.

488
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,896
- I met Giancarlo through Jesus.

489
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:43,960
<i>Giancarlo and Jesus
were kind of like best friends.</i>

490
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,255
<i>I was Jesus' girlfriend,
and I was very close with them.</i>

491
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,300
<i>I mean, everybody changed
in the five years that I dated Jesus,</i>

492
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,742
<i>they kinda grew up.</i>

493
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:56,472
<i>But Giancarlo did not strike me
as having any street smarts.</i>

494
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,558
<i>Nothing, not even an instinct.</i>

495
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,335
He doesn't really have a hustle spirit.

496
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:05,923
<i>Jesus was the street-smart hustler
of the group.</i>

497
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,611
<i>When I met him,
I was absolutely under the impression</i>

498
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,178
<i>that that was a wealthy family.</i>

499
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,574
<i>Jesus Fernandez Sr. was, at one point,</i>

500
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:18,953
<i>a big-time real estate investor
and a broker.</i>

501
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,290
<i>That family had lived the American Dream.</i>

502
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,858
<i>The houses that they lived in
were gorgeous.</i>

503
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,296
<i>Unfortunately, none of them lasted long</i>

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,990
before... the sheriff's department came.

505
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,763
<i>If you look at Jesus Sr.'s rap sheet,</i>

506
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,015
<i>there was a major bankruptcy,</i>

507
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,017
there were allegations of fraud.

508
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,354
The guy didn't even have
a broker license anymore.

509
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,923
None of this was disclosed to Giancarlo.

510
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:49,859
<i>By me reaching out to them</i>

511
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,153
<i>and telling, "Hey,
you're gonna get a commission from this,"</i>

512
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,738
I felt like I was helping them out.

513
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:16,243
<i>I was an assistant general manager
working at South Beach Hostel.</i>

514
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,390
I mean, in Miami, hostels,
you build it and it's gonna be filled.

515
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,166
<i>It's like a fail-safe business.</i>

516
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,030
- Jesus knew the real estate side,
I knew the hostel side,

517
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,200
and Giancarlo had the financial backing.

518
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,703
- I called Jerry, I said, "Hey, come down.

519
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,897
I have some guys that are gonna
find the best investment property."

520
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:49,502
<i>Jesus and Giancarlo,
his father eventually found a property.</i>

521
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,361
<i>It was Miami Hostel.</i>

522
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:56,176
<i>The first floor had a restaurant
and a liquor store.</i>

523
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,012
<i>It was just in the heart
of South Beach, which is perfect.</i>

524
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:01,079
<i>The land itself is very valuable.</i>

525
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:05,727
<i>Once the Fernandezes saw
these evangelicals come down here,</i>

526
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:09,254
they probably saw, you know,
just nothing but money signs everywhere.

527
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:14,152
<i>This is a guy from Lynchburg
trying to do business in Miami.</i>

528
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,279
<i>He didn't know where the fuck he was.</i>

529
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,097
They should've done diligence
on these guys.

530
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,452
<i>I understood flying him places,</i>

531
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,270
but I have never heard of anybody

532
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,750
buying some kid,
that they met at the Fontainebleau pool,

533
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,585
<i>a four-and-a-half-million-dollar business.</i>

534
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,903
What the fuck? Like, what's going on?

535
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,132
<i>Tito and his dad were both very curious,</i>

536
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,301
<i>and they were trying
to find out what was going on.</i>

537
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,261
And they kept trying
to get answers out of me.

538
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,930
I'm like, "No,
they just wanna help me out."

539
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,473
Obviously, that didn't make sense.

540
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,297
That... That was just... That was...
You know, it wasn't a good excuse.

541
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,394
I think that they... they were convinced
there was more to it,

542
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,098
and they were right, there was more to it.

543
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:54,317
- Now you got
the Fernandezes working Giancarlo,

544
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,612
<i>because they're smelling money,
real money.</i>

545
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,823
<i>The long con had already started.</i>

546
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:04,601
<i>Who knew what a buddy fucker
Jesus Fernandez turned out to be, right?</i>

547
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,897
<i>It was a few months
for the deal to actually close.</i>

548
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>Throughout this process,</i>

549
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:16,071
my brother and Tito,
their friendship started fracturing a bit.

550
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,050
<i>The Fernandezes received their commission</i>

551
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,260
<i>on the sale of the property,</i>

552
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,720
and we didn't really talk much after that.

553
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,180
It was just like,
all right, the deal closed,

554
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,873
and then they kind of just vanished.

555
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,768
<i>Between the time that he met the Falwells</i>

556
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:32,021
<i>to when they closed on that property
was less than a year.</i>

557
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,773
- About 11 months after meeting them,

558
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,176
<i>we're closing on
a 4.65-million-dollar commercial property.</i>

559
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,320
<i>It just felt like I was living in a movie.</i>

560
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,572
It just didn't feel real.

561
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,931
I'm like, "Why am I here?
Why am I a part of this?"

562
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,118
<i>Imagine the first property you own</i>

563
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,328
<i>is a four-and-a-half-million-dollar
property.</i>

564
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,789
<i>I saw it as a big opportunity to learn,</i>

565
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,291
<i>to grow within business.</i>

566
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,649
<i>It was tough to turn down.</i>

567
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,295
- Okay, so how did the deal break down?

568
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,130
<i>Who was the principal in name?</i>

569
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,214
<i>It wasn't Jerry.</i>

570
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,550
<i>He didn't want his name
anywhere near that deal</i>

571
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,343
<i>with a 20-year-old pool boy,</i>

572
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,161
<i>so he put it in Becki's name.</i>

573
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,848
- At this point,
my dreams were coming true.

574
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,850
I can see
how I can make that first million.

575
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,144
- How do you keep Giancarlo on a leash?

576
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,979
Go into business with him.

577
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:17,150
<i>And Jerry was looking
at keeping his wife happy at that point.</i>

578
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,651
<i>Where she was happiest</i>

579
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,262
was when Giancarlo Granda
was balls-deep inside of her.

580
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:29,370
- So from March 2012
till about, like, June, June, July,

581
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,231
you know, we had this sexual component
with the relationship.

582
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,459
I broke it off.

583
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,126
I told Becki, I'm like,
"We can't have sex anymore

584
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,878
"'cause I found a girl my age.

585
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:40,590
<i>I wanna date her, I like her a lot.
We obviously can't be doing this."</i>

586
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,091
<i>She didn't take it very well.</i>

587
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>Becki cried.
She made me feel guilty for it.</i>

588
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,180
"Oh, you replaced me for someone younger."

589
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,682
<i>She would tell me, "God put us together."</i>

590
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:53,186
<i>I'm like, "I need to live my own life.
I need to find someone my age."</i>

591
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,438
<i>And then Jerry said,
"Well, she doesn't have to know.</i>

592
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,357
<i>We won't tell her."</i>

593
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,066
And I said,
"No, I'm sorry, I just... I can't.

594
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,359
I... I don't feel comfortable doing it."

595
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,861
What I did agree to,
and it's not... it's not right,

596
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,822
I continued the emotional connection.

597
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,199
I kept texting her,
I kept talking to her every day.

598
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,850
I felt like I was living a double life.

599
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:12,163
<i>Becki, she would call me every day,
she would text me every day.</i>

600
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:15,416
<i>If I didn't respond to her right away,
she would call me crying.</i>

601
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,086
<i>If I didn't respond for a couple days,
then Jerry would call me.</i>

602
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,087
<i>He was disappointed.</i>

603
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,214
<i>"He'd say," Hey, what's going on?
Like, she loves you so much.</i>

604
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,591
<i>"Why are you trying to break away?
She's been so nice to you.</i>

605
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,219
<i>"And we're going to bat
for you for this property.</i>

606
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:27,661
Why... why break up now?"

607
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:32,809
Things started slowly morphing into,
"Oh, this is just sex and friendship,"

608
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,085
to "Now we're gonna control you."

609
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,439
<i>Imagine how sick and twisted that is.</i>

610
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:43,194
Like, you're middle-aged people
calling him, making him feel bad

611
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,113
because he's not texting your wife?

612
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,573
What the fuck is wrong with you?

613
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:47,574
- So I had two options:

614
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,784
I could just walk away
and never talk to 'em again

615
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:53,204
and lose out on this multi-million-dollar,
uh, commercial property,

616
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,147
or just trust them and see what happens.

617
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,417
<i>These are predators.</i>

618
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:02,213
<i>Becki, she was addicted to the idea
of being in love with this kid,</i>

619
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,198
and she was not gonna let go.

620
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,097
<i>One day, Becki texted me,</i>

621
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,583
"I was watching
some video clips on my phone... Wow."

622
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,862
At that moment,
that just, like, set off an alarm.

623
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,989
And that was the first time
that I realized,

624
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,973
<i>"Oh, they were recording everything."</i>

625
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,662
I felt like it was a subtle hint as to,

626
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,439
you know, "We got the goods on you too.
Like, don't forget that."

627
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,251
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr., at the time,</i>

628
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,379
<i>was everything
that Giancarlo wanted to be.</i>

629
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,799
Giancarlo wanted all of this
and they knew it.

630
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,553
<i>So they were using it
as a method of control.</i>

631
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,931
<i>"Hey, you know,
have fun with your little girlfriend,</i>

632
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,265
but we own your ass."

633
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,511
- You're fired.

634
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,659
<i>September 2012,</i>

635
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:15,203
<i>Becki gives me a call saying,
"Hey, do you wanna meet Donald Trump?"</i>

636
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,664
<i>'Cause at the time,
he wasn't who he is today.</i>

637
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:21,459
<i>He wasn't running for president.
He was just the star on</i> The Apprentice.

638
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,545
<i>They knew that I liked Donald Trump,</i>

639
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,839
<i>that I read his book,</i> The Art of the Deal.

640
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,924
<i>My brother loved business</i>

641
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:30,593
and thought Donald Trump was great,
and so he was like...

642
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,618
- Yeah, absolutely!

643
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,681
<i>They were bringing him into a world</i>

644
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,016
<i>that he couldn't even imagine.</i>

645
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,962
<i>"Real estate, politics,
my future, everything is here."</i>

646
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,441
<i>He had never in his life imagined</i>

647
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,344
<i>being able to be allowed entree
into that world.</i>

648
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,367
<i>I paid
for the ticket from Miami to Lynchburg,</i>

649
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,952
<i>then they put me at a hotel.</i>

650
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,288
But after a day, they're like, "Hey,
you don't need to stay there actually.

651
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,105
Just come stay with us at our house."

652
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,001
<i>It was the first time
that I met their kids.</i>

653
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:05,253
<i>I don't think they suspected anything
at the moment.</i>

654
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:08,464
Jerry and Becki did tell the kids
they were helping me out,

655
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,242
that they wanna give me
the opportunity to rise within business.

656
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,347
<i>Jerry was the leader
of this Christian university,</i>

657
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,707
<i>so they're around young adults.</i>

658
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,477
It's actually pretty reasonable.

659
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,104
No one really asked why I was around.

660
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,963
I just kind of blended right in.

661
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,692
<i>I was kind of expecting</i>

662
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,196
<i>this weird Bible college
in the middle of nowhere,</i>

663
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,389
<i>but Liberty University is one
of the nicest campuses I've seen.</i>

664
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:36,951
<i>Jerry was very proud,</i>

665
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,562
<i>and he mentioned that the endowment
was about two billion dollars.</i>

666
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:45,210
<i>Coming from Miami where you have
people from all parts of the world,</i>

667
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,461
<i>it's a melting pot,</i>

668
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:50,715
<i>but what I did notice at Liberty,
there weren't many Black students.</i>

669
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,325
<i>It was mostly white evangelicals.</i>

670
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,806
<i>Today,
I want to say to the people of America</i>

671
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,457
<i>and the nations of the world,</i>

672
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,418
we are not about to turn around.

673
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,921
We are on the move now.

674
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,926
<i>Yes, we are on the move,
and no wave of racism can stop us.</i>

675
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:17,408
- March 1965 is a big turning point
for many white evangelical pastors

676
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,285
to understand that the world was changing.

677
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,787
<i>They would have to consider</i>

678
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,581
<i>what side of that world
that they wanted to be on.</i>

679
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:27,001
<i>Would they be on the side
of the Civil Rights Movement,</i>

680
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,754
or would they be on the side
of white supremacy?

681
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,822
And Jerry Falwell Sr. made a choice.

682
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,951
<i>I remember preaching a sermon
justifying the segregationist position.</i>

683
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,180
One can make the Bible say almost anything
he wants to make it say.

684
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,558
- Our God is marching on.

685
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,542
Glory hallelujah!

686
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,836
Glory hallelujah!

687
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,255
Glory hallelujah!

688
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:54,195
- Jerry Falwell Sr. says that ministers
should not be involved in the political,

689
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:58,116
they should only be involved
in preaching the Gospel of Jesus.

690
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,434
<i>But later on, his game had changed.</i>

691
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:04,080
<i>School districts began desegregating today</i>

692
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,564
<i>under Supreme Court orders.</i>

693
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,418
- Jerry Falwell Sr. was not happy

694
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:11,713
about the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>
decision.

695
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,506
- But as the public schools reopen,

696
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,886
<i>a number of new private schools,
all white, sprang into existence.</i>

697
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,221
- He started his own
segregation academy there

698
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,748
in conjunction with
the Thomas Road Baptist Church.

699
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,460
- These segregation academies
were not called segregation academies.

700
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,480
<i>They had Christian names.</i>

701
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,398
<i>But they were built to make sure</i>

702
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:35,320
<i>that white children did not have to be
in contact with African American children.</i>

703
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:39,240
- The IRS wants to revoke
the tax exemptions for private schools

704
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:42,577
which discriminate racially
in their admissions policies.

705
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:45,121
<i>In the 1970s, the IRS determines</i>

706
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,291
that if you were
a charitable institution by definition,

707
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,335
so it means you get tax exemption,

708
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,027
you cannot practice segregation.

709
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:56,073
<i>And one of the things they'd then target
are these Christian-segregated academies.</i>

710
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:00,428
<i>So this really wakes up Falwell
and a number of other ministers,</i>

711
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,431
and they realize that if they don't have
allies in the Federal Government,

712
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,055
they're not gonna be able
to keep doing what they're trying to do.

713
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,977
<i>I preached a few years ago</i>

714
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,522
<i>that Christians
shouldn't be involved in politics,</i>

715
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,357
but I think we have every right to speak.

716
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,691
We're citizens too.

717
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:17,987
- He actually at least had the integrity
to acknowledge that he was a hypocrite.

718
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:22,033
- Jerry Falwell Sr.'s idea
about ministers being involved in politics

719
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,518
was to support the status quo
of white supremacy.

720
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,164
- Falwell is really at the ground level
doing this through his school,

721
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,232
<i>through his academy
in Lynchburg, Virginia.</i>

722
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,799
- We're waiting in this back area.

723
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,242
I'm with Becki and the kids.

724
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,429
<i>And then Trump and Jerry walk in.</i>

725
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,474
<i>Immediately, Trump just
sucked up the energy of the room.</i>

726
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:49,769
Jerry says, "I wanna introduce you
to our business partner in... in Florida.

727
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,513
He... He used to work
at the Fontainebleau."

728
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:58,218
<i>And then he signed my book, and he wrote,
you know, "Giancarlo, work hard!"</i>

729
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,494
<i>And it was... it was a cool moment.</i>

730
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,449
<i>And it just reinforced all the things
that Becki was telling me,</i>

731
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,578
<i>that I'm very lucky
to be mentored by Jerry.</i>

732
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,121
<i>I mean, he's clearly well-connected.</i>

733
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:10,999
<i>He's in a powerful position,
there's a lot of influence.</i>

734
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:13,585
If I learn from him,
look what I can potentially become.

735
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,503
I felt special.

736
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:19,632
Like I was part of this exclusive club,
part of their inner circle.

737
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,074
It was intoxicating.

738
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,368
<i>Michael Cohen was present.</i>

739
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,722
<i>I didn't know who he was,</i>

740
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:29,958
<i>I just saw him as, uh, like,
"Oh, his attorney or business associate."</i>

741
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,378
Michael Cohen kinda leaned over,
he's like, "Who is that guy?"

742
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,316
<i>Like, he just didn't really get it.</i>

743
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,694
<i>He's like, "What? I mean,
this guy's, you know, 21 years old."</i>

744
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,318
At that moment,
I'm like, "Does he know?"

745
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,907
Like, it was just this moment
like, "Why... Why did he ask him?

746
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,617
Why did he react that way?"

747
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:49,162
- He was paid,
you know, to dig up dirt on people

748
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,040
and to be able
to control them with that dirt.

749
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:56,068
- At that moment, he registered
that there may be something here.

750
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,033
<i>Liberty University has this big arena.</i>

751
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:05,868
<i>I walk in.</i>

752
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,181
I'm not sure
how many people are seated there,

753
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,142
I don't know what the capacity is,
but thousands.

754
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,209
Thousands of students.

755
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,563
<i>We're on the big screen
and people were clapping for us</i>

756
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,106
as we were walking to the front row.

757
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,651
<i>We are the sole focus of the show.</i>

758
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:20,955
<i>I... I just couldn't believe it.</i>

759
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:24,346
<i>Trump was speaking
at this thing they called the Convocation.</i>

760
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,247
I didn't know what Convocation was.

761
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:32,664
<i>Convocation is sort of like a big chapel.</i>

762
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,207
<i>It's three times a week.</i>

763
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,126
<i>If you live on campus,
you are required to be there.</i>

764
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,361
- You have no right to be ordinary.

765
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,009
<i>The person that comes up to speak,</i>

766
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:49,222
<i>they get the blessing of having
a stage that they can stand on</i>

767
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,540
<i>that has spiritual legitimacy.</i>

768
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:55,210
So it's especially nefarious
when that stage is abused.

769
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,105
And that stage is abused all the time.

770
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,023
Good morning, Liberty University.

771
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,799
Are you excited to be here?

772
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,404
- Mr. Trump
single-handedly forced President Obama

773
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:06,305
to release his birth certificate.

774
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:13,187
I would like to ask Donald Trump
to join me at the podium.

775
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,624
<i>Donald Trump gave a speech.</i>

776
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:21,212
- You know, your founder,
Jerry Falwell, was a great man.

777
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:25,490
So impressive, so smart,
so tough when you had to be tough.

778
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,344
<i>When I'm sitting there in the front row,</i>

779
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,745
<i>I started to think to myself,</i>

780
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,308
<i>"Everything about Liberty University
and the Falwells is all about power,</i>

781
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,751
and making sure
that people are aware of this power."

782
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:39,713
- Don't let people take advantage...
This goes for a country too, by the way.

783
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,276
Don't let people take advantage.

784
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,384
Get even.

785
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:47,197
<i>And then I find out</i>

786
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,240
<i>that the students
aren't even allowed to dance,</i>

787
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,808
or drink alcohol,
or hold hands or hug, or anything.

788
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,415
- The Liberty Way is this set of rules

789
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,899
that students have to live by.

790
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,628
<i>Dress modestly.</i>

791
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:03,028
<i>You cannot attend a dance.</i>

792
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,881
<i>You're not allowed to drink</i>

793
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:08,617
<i>And it controlled
the sexual conduct of the students.</i>

794
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,888
<i>And you agree that, you know,
"The school can fine me</i>

795
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,914
<i>if I violate one of these rules."</i>

796
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:17,936
<i>For a small violation like swearing,</i>

797
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,731
you're probably just gonna end up
getting a few points put on your record.

798
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,526
<i>For something more serious,
like possession of alcohol,</i>

799
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,052
<i>right away, you could get a $300 fine,</i>

800
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:32,975
<i>which is the same potential fine
for committing a felony, like rape.</i>

801
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,620
- They run a Christian university,
but this is what they're doing.

802
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:38,124
<i>They're staying at the Fontainebleau
and partying and drinking.</i>

803
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,792
<i>This is Jerry Falwell Jr.,</i>

804
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,460
<i>this is Becki Falwell,</i>

805
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:47,090
and this is their ultimate hypocrisy.

806
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,883
<i>Becki and Jerry as a team,</i>

807
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,970
<i>they didn't play
by anyone's rules but their own.</i>

808
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,346
<i>I started feeling guilty.</i>

809
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,933
<i>The students, they have no idea
what's really going on behind the scenes.</i>

810
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,919
They all think that the Falwells
are this godly, perfect family.

811
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:02,963
<i>I just felt very awkward.</i>

812
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:08,403
- You know, it's not too late to get back
in the presidential race, is it?

813
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:09,469
I don't know.

814
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,449
- Jerry and his family
have absolute control,

815
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:17,871
and no one is going to stand up to them
'cause they're gonna get crushed.

816
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,873
- My brother was so into this world,

817
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:23,543
<i>he was, like, high
off the power and the money,</i>

818
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,963
<i>and being around
all these powerful people.</i>

819
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,382
<i>He owned this building on Miami Beach.</i>

820
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:31,074
<i>He was, like, on top of the world.</i>

821
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,515
<i>When my ex-girlfriend and I broke up,</i>

822
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,601
<i>Becki pretended like she was sad,</i>

823
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,293
but she was obviously very excited

824
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,105
<i>because it meant
that we were gonna go back</i>

825
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,441
<i>to the original nature
of the relationship.</i>

826
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,277
You know, we just started up again
as we did on day one.

827
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,364
A part of me
felt like I... I owed them this.

828
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:56,367
They had this weird
psychological hold over me

829
00:41:56,391 --> 00:42:00,705
with these constant guilt trips
and me being financially tied to them.

830
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,374
I can't really explain it,
but I felt like I had to.

831
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,486
<i>I get invited to Trey's wedding.</i>

832
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,633
<i>There's like the first level of weirdness</i>

833
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:12,634
<i>about the whole thing,</i>

834
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:17,305
and then what really took
my weird feelings to the next level

835
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,665
<i>is when he started
being friendly with the kids.</i>

836
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,418
<i>The Falwells stayed
at the Presidential Suite.</i>

837
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,606
- Why the fuck
are you going to that wedding?

838
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,924
<i>I mean, why are you invited to that?</i>

839
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:34,364
- And I would just sneak away,
go to the room, and we would have sex.

840
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,991
<i>The idea of getting caught</i>

841
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,369
<i>was part of their sexual kink.</i>

842
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,663
<i>Why else would you be so reckless?</i>

843
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:44,624
<i>There was a sense
that if they just went along</i>

844
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:45,917
<i>and got the university rich,</i>

845
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,377
<i>that people would leave them alone</i>

846
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,280
and that they could pursue
this very racy private life.

847
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,092
<i>Becki would refer to Trey</i>

848
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,035
and their other son, Wesley,
and their daughter as my siblings.

849
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,430
<i>If you look at it,
it's a good cover story.</i>

850
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,723
<i>They were always gonna be able to say,</i>

851
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,017
<i>"Yeah, you know what?
We saw him as a son</i>

852
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,602
<i>and we were just trying to help him out."</i>

853
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,313
Christians are known
to reach out to people that are vulnerable

854
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,377
and going through a tough time,
and lifting them up.

855
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,508
<i>The kids saw it as something admirable.</i>

856
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,528
<i>They had no idea</i>

857
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:17,556
that their dad liked to watch his wife
get fucked in a room by a younger guy.

858
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,202
<i>Involving your kids with this person</i>

859
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,204
<i>that you had
this sexual relationship with,</i>

860
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:26,749
<i>they're the adults in the room,
they run a university, they're parents.</i>

861
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,627
He was at the age of,
like, I think, one of their sons.

862
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,570
<i>The whole thing was just, like, icky.</i>

863
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,591
<i>With family vacations,
whenever they went down to Miami,</i>

864
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,219
<i>Becki would just sneak away
and, you know, have sex with me.</i>

865
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:41,347
<i>There was a running joke
amongst the kids and everyone,</i>

866
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,724
they're always like, "Where's Becki?"

867
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:44,267
She was always... She was always missing.

868
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,061
<i>They actually made a shirt
that said, "Where's Becki?"</i>

869
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,314
<i>It was a little inside joke
amongst everyone.</i>

870
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,547
She was hanging out with me.

871
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:54,027
Jerry, his job was to distract the kids.

872
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,153
<i>"All right, let's go to the beach.</i>

873
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,739
<i>Let's go to the pool.
Let's go get drinks. Let's go explore."</i>

874
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,866
<i>And then Becki and I
would just hang out in the hotel.</i>

875
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,434
<i>As long as we recorded it,
he was okay with it.</i>

876
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,787
<i>A lot of pressure came from Jerry.</i>

877
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:10,251
<i>Basically, her job was to seduce me
and successfully have sex with me.</i>

878
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,612
<i>And if she wasn't able to do that,
Jerry would get upset.</i>

879
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,115
<i>The lies just started building up.</i>

880
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:19,135
<i>I had to lie to my girlfriends,</i>

881
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,929
<i>I had to lie to my family.</i>

882
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:22,430
<i>It was exhausting.</i>

883
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,642
If you look at the Falwells,
they were living their best life.

884
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,168
They were professionals
at living a double life.

885
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,731
<i>Over the years,
it just... it weighed on me.</i>

886
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:34,400
<i>When you're forced
to hold this secret and lie to everyone,</i>

887
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,860
<i>you start to become a liar.</i>

888
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,362
<i>And I didn't like who I was becoming.</i>

889
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:40,026
At a certain point, you just...
You just don't wanna do it anymore.

890
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:45,870
<i>And then all of a sudden,</i>

891
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:51,334
the Fernandez duo, father and son,
started making claims what they would do.

892
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,294
And they started making threats,

893
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,404
and they started being a pain in the ass.

894
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:58,591
- I think that visions of grandeur
and money,

895
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,134
that was in everybody's head.

896
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:01,636
Everything kind of turned sour.

897
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,704
Greed fucks everybody up.

898
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,809
<i>I hadn't heard from the Fernandezes</i>

899
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,310
<i>since the deal closed,</i>

900
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,856
then all of a sudden, in fall, 2014,

901
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,360
I received a letter from an attorney
who was representing them.

902
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,760
<i>And it had to do with breach of contract.</i>

903
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:23,867
<i>They were claiming that they were promised
50% of my equity stake,</i>

904
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,893
<i>but they weren't promised an equity stake.</i>

905
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,496
- To the best of my understanding,

906
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,958
the agreement
was a real estate commission.

907
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:35,670
I've never heard of them speaking
about being 50-50 in the property.

908
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,505
<i>I give him a call.</i>

909
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,550
- Hello, Mr. Giancarlo Granda.

910
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:41,926
- Just being theatrical.

911
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,304
- As a devout Christian, I'm heartbroken

912
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:48,266
about the things that my client
is telling me about the Falwells.

913
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,459
<i>He referenced compromising images,</i>

914
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,586
<i>photos of me and Becki.</i>

915
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,941
Obviously, I'm like, "Oh, my God,
everyone's gonna find out."

916
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,526
"My family's gonna find out.

917
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,195
"This is all gonna crumble.

918
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,696
"Oh, my God, what... what do they have?

919
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,699
"Did they have the videos of me and Becki?

920
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,576
<i>Do they have that?
I didn't... I didn't really know."</i>

921
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,453
It does not feel good when you know

922
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,897
that this secret part of your life
is about to be exposed.

923
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:13,750
- He was definitely nervous.

924
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:18,880
I think this also started
his becoming a little paranoid.

925
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,073
Who do you trust? Who you can't trust?

926
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,343
<i>I was so frustrated</i>

927
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:27,680
<i>at the fact that I was being betrayed
by someone who I saw as a friend.</i>

928
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:28,997
<i>It's just disgusting</i>

929
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,751
to threaten to reveal our private lives.

930
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:36,564
<i>You know, later, I found out that
his dad owed a lot of money.</i>

931
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:39,984
<i>He owed like, I don't know, like,
34 million dollars or something like that.</i>

932
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:44,823
<i>So the $15,000 that they got
from commission wasn't gonna put a dent.</i>

933
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:49,369
<i>Jesus and his father
are always looking for the next hustle,</i>

934
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,478
and that was Jerry Falwell Jr.

935
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,499
- I just told him, "You're gonna
be hearing from my attorney."

936
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,668
Called Jerry immediately after.

937
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:59,152
I said, "It seems like
we're being blackmailed here."

938
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,302
<i>There's a mediation.</i>

939
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,870
<i>Jerry flies down to Miami.</i>

940
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:13,393
- The Falwell attorneys
actually made an offer to the Fernandezes.

941
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,752
<i>But you see, greed doesn't play that game.</i>

942
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:18,106
<i>The reason why it was a shakedown</i>

943
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,774
<i>and not just a normal legal dispute</i>

944
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,652
<i>is because they were claiming
for half of my equity stake</i>

945
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:23,677
<i>and anything that I made.</i>

946
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:27,407
<i>And we offered it to 'em,
and they declined.</i>

947
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:30,034
- They figured
they could get a hell of a lot more.

948
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:33,246
- They didn't really want half
of the equity stake, they wanted millions.

949
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,082
He disguised this shakedown as a lawsuit.

950
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,168
It was just them saying,

951
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,795
<i>"We know what happened
with this relationship.</i>

952
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,464
<i>"Not only do we know,
but we have compromising material.</i>

953
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:44,656
<i>We have photographs."</i>

954
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,420
<i>"If you don't pay us,
then it's gonna become public."</i>

955
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,858
<i>At this meeting, they showed the images,</i>

956
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:04,319
<i>and it was the images
that she shared with me.</i>

957
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:06,654
<i>Pictures? Okay.</i>

958
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,641
Like, pictures of you guys doing stuff?

959
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:11,911
- Yeah.

960
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,310
- Well, you're fucked.

961
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:17,123
- I told Jerry, I'm like,
"Like, I didn't give it to them.

962
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,066
They just somehow obtained them."

963
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:22,587
<i>And Jerry's like, "Look, I trust you.
Don't even worry about it.</i>

964
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,211
<i>I know we're all on the same team here."</i>

965
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,382
I tell him, like,
"We need to call the FBI."

966
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:28,086
"We shouldn't pay them,
you know, a penny."

967
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:32,764
<i>But it seemed like Jerry, he never
really wanted to testify under oath.</i>

968
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,122
<i>He has a lot to hide.</i>

969
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,894
<i>He knew the volatility in those photos,</i>

970
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:43,441
<i>and he knew that they had something
that could literally destroy him.</i>

971
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,860
<i>- I told Jerry, I'm like,
"What did you tell your attorneys?"</i>

972
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:48,738
<i>And he's like, "Well, I told them
that you had a crush on Becki,</i>

973
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:53,058
<i>and you somehow got, you know, the images,
and then your friends got it somehow."</i>

974
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,519
I'm like, "Uh, that's not what happened."

975
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,123
And at that point, I'm like,
"Is this... Am I being represented here?

976
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,709
"Like, are they looking out
for my best interests

977
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,419
at this point for this lawsuit?"

978
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,964
I mean, I was concerned
because, obviously, Jerry has influence.

979
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:07,781
<i>He has power. He has connections.</i>

980
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,971
<i>I just saw how easy it was for them
to just spin this to favor the Falwells.</i>

981
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,831
At that point, I'm like, "I'm screwed."

982
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:25,358
- Once the threat
of the Fernandezes started getting real,

983
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,026
things might come out.

984
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,196
He, I think, thought,
"Well, let me tell my parents

985
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,990
before they find out any other way."

986
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,826
- "I don't want any secrets.
This is what happened. It was stupid.

987
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,203
"But we are business partners,
and that's it.

988
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:40,314
It was stupid,
I was young, but I'm moving on."

989
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:43,418
<i>Obviously, my parents were upset.</i>

990
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,128
<i>My mom was blown away by that.</i>

991
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:46,236
<i>She was shocked.</i>

992
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,757
<i>You know, she really thought
that they were an amazing family</i>

993
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,967
<i>for helping me out.</i>

994
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,201
<i>It broke her heart.</i>

995
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:58,415
<i>Becki called me.</i>

996
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,394
<i>I told her I was stressed out.</i>

997
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,479
<i>I want no part of this.</i>

998
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:03,813
I'm... I want out.

999
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,483
<i>"Oh, the lawsuit?
Don't even worry about it.</i>

1000
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:07,859
<i>"We called our friend, Michael Cohen,</i>

1001
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,164
<i>"and he's gonna take care
of those guys that are suing us.</i>

1002
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:13,347
<i>It's never even gonna go public.
We're in good hands."</i>

1003
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,285
<i>Whenever you need something
to go away or get settled,</i>

1004
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,746
or any sort of legal dispute
to be, uh, resolved,

1005
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,440
then, uh, people within Trump's orbit,
they would reach out to Michael Cohen.

1006
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,587
<i>After Michael Cohen intervened,</i>

1007
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:30,423
it seemed like
our problems just went away.

1008
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:33,259
The Fernandezes
and the lawsuit just vanished, you know?

1009
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,701
And it did for a while, at least.

1010
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:49,442
- It's true that Michael Cohen
helped them out with the legal dispute.

1011
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:53,303
But he didn't just help 'em out,
now he owns the compromising material.

1012
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,366
<i>This story isn't quite over</i>

1013
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,286
in terms of Michael Cohen
and what his business was

1014
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,706
and may still be with the Falwells.

1015
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,983
<i>Who owns who in this situation?</i>

1016
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:13,633
<i>I'm at the hostel doing work.</i>

1017
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:16,094
<i>I get a phone call from Jerry and Becki,</i>

1018
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:17,971
and they told me they were in Miami.

1019
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,514
<i>And they said,
"Hey, come over to the Loews,</i>

1020
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,164
<i>we gotta talk about something serious."</i>

1021
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,876
And I'm like, "Oh, shit, what's going on?"

1022
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,379
<i>So the first thing that Jerry says...</i>

1023
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,693
<i>He offered me
1.1 million dollars for my equity stake</i>

1024
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:32,944
in the property in South Beach.

1025
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:36,698
<i>And then he also said
he owns a hotel in... in Lynchburg,</i>

1026
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:37,907
<i>it's La Quinta.</i>

1027
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:42,895
<i>And they... they offered me an equity stake
just equivalent of $50,000 a year.</i>

1028
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:45,582
He said, "Do you want it?"
And I said, "Yeah."

1029
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:47,417
I accepted immediately
right there on the spot.

1030
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:51,045
<i>"But he's like," We're gonna have
to wait till we settle this lawsuit</i>

1031
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,590
<i>because there's this legal claim on us."</i>

1032
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:54,966
It's like kind of, like, having a lien.

1033
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,409
I was essentially
handcuffed to this property.

1034
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,557
- I think at this point, he was
very much over the bullshit of it all.

1035
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,392
<i>Over the years,
Jerry would always tell me,</i>

1036
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,769
<i>"Wouldn't it be nice
if you just come work over at Liberty?"</i>

1037
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,754
<i>He just really wanted me in that world.</i>

1038
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:13,842
I asked, "Why are you being so generous
with this proposition? What's going on?"

1039
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,280
Then he told me, he's like,
"Michael Cohen approached me,

1040
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,949
<i>"and Donald Trump's
gonna run for president,</i>

1041
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,892
<i>and they want my endorsement."</i>

1042
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:25,955
<i>I didn't take it seriously.
I'm like, "You can't be serious, right?"</i>

1043
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,457
<i>Like, it's probably for ratings.</i>

1044
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,167
<i>There's no way he's actually running.</i>

1045
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:31,336
<i>He's like,
"No, no. He really wants to run.</i>

1046
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,695
<i>And, uh, we believe
that he can actually win."</i>

1047
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:37,675
<i>If Jerry was gonna get
more involved with politicians,</i>

1048
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,135
<i>just like how his dad did,</i>

1049
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:42,287
he had to ensure
that all loose ends were tied.

1050
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,351
<i>In the 1970s,</i>

1051
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,896
<i>when the evangelicals and Jerry Falwell
became engaged in politics,</i>

1052
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,190
<i>they realized that
the civil rights issue was wrong,</i>

1053
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:53,942
<i>like, they... they were
on the wrong side of that one.</i>

1054
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,860
And so they begin
to shift towards other issues.

1055
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:58,947
- There was a kind of a period
of almost market testing

1056
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:03,100
to see which issues would grab
these evangelical voters.

1057
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,328
<i>They go after the feminist movement.</i>

1058
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,081
<i>God didn't make women
for NFL football or combat,</i>

1059
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:09,249
<i>or a lot of other things.</i>

1060
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:14,295
I don't believe we should demean womanhood
by saying that men and women are the same.

1061
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,321
- They also began to go after pornography.

1062
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:19,592
<i>Until once again
the pornographers are looked on</i>

1063
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:23,179
as the sleazy merchants of garbage
as they once were,

1064
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:25,348
and in fact, still are, we haven't won.

1065
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,016
- They go after the gay rights movement.

1066
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,478
- The scriptures are very clear
that homosexuality is moral perversion.

1067
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,606
And that's in violation of everything
that the Word of God teaches.

1068
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,109
- In a nation
that's becoming ever more diverse,

1069
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,154
Falwell is trying to roll back
any progressive change

1070
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:40,196
<i>that's gonna happen.</i>

1071
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,701
- In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court
today legalized abortions.

1072
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:47,412
The majority, in cases
from Texas and Georgia said

1073
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:51,124
that the decision to end a pregnancy
during the first three months

1074
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:54,752
belongs to the woman and her doctor,
not the government.

1075
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:59,841
- Abortion was considered a Catholic issue
by evangelicals in the 1970s.

1076
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:03,386
- Evangelicals really felt
like abortion was a personal decision

1077
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,471
that could be made
with a minister and a doctor.

1078
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:08,123
What they don't want
is the state telling people what to do.

1079
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,478
<i>It wasn't until the '78 midterm elections,</i>

1080
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:14,772
<i>abortion finally begins
to appear on the radar screen</i>

1081
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,733
<i>of American evangelicals.</i>

1082
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:20,820
- Abortion could be
the most volatile, single, political issue
in the country today,

1083
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:24,240
and the right-to-lifers,
the most powerful, single issue block.

1084
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:28,685
<i>Several conservative activists,
pro-lifers, Roman Catholics,</i>

1085
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,247
<i>target four senate races.</i>

1086
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,292
<i>Right-to-lifers passed out
300,000 leaflets</i>

1087
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,919
<i>the weekend before the election.</i>

1088
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,086
<i>Two days later,</i>

1089
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,299
<i>all four Democratic nominees
who were highly favored</i>

1090
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:44,952
<i>lost to anti-abortion Republicans.</i>

1091
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,556
<i>At that point, Falwell realized</i>

1092
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,083
they had an issue
that would work for them politically.

1093
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:57,315
- Jerry Falwell Sr. does not preach
his first sermon against abortion

1094
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:00,068
until five years after <i>Roe v. Wade.</i>

1095
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:01,903
<i>Abortion is a moral issue.</i>

1096
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,446
<i>It is a human rights issue.</i>

1097
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:07,075
An issue that concerns the human rights
of unborn babies,

1098
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:12,330
who, by the hundreds of thousands,
are being murdered.

1099
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:15,083
<i>Abortion becomes
the number-one wedge issue</i>

1100
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:18,545
that they can all agree on,
and all get in line behind.

1101
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,005
<i>Jerry Falwell Sr. saw that as a way</i>

1102
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:24,634
<i>to put himself in the forefront
of the culture wars of the day.</i>

1103
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,929
<i>It's much easier
to say you don't want abortion</i>

1104
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,807
<i>than to say you don't want
a little Black child on the school bus</i>

1105
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:31,951
with your little white girl.

1106
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,729
<i>And this becomes
a very lucrative business proposition.</i>

1107
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,274
- I want every one of you
to leave here this morning

1108
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:41,901
without a penny, a nickel,
a dime, or a quarter.

1109
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:43,153
No change left.

1110
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,512
This is the cash receipts department.

1111
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:50,034
I'm guessing, today,
they will probably do $200,000 here.

1112
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,352
- $200,000 a day?

1113
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,080
<i>At its peak,</i>

1114
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:58,459
<i>Falwell's ministry brought in
nearly 100 million dollars a year.</i>

1115
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:03,131
- This is the country God has raised up
for the purpose of world evangelisation.

1116
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,215
<i>Jerry Falwell,</i>

1117
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,302
<i>a Lynchburg, Virginia, preacher
who runs Moral Majority,</i>

1118
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:09,929
<i>a new political machine
that's anti-abortion,</i>

1119
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,348
<i>anti-ERA, anti-gay rights,</i>

1120
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:14,851
<i>and for, what he calls, a "Moral America."</i>

1121
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:18,271
- All the moral issues that count today
are in the political arena.

1122
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:21,232
There's no way to fight these battles
except in that arena.

1123
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,277
<i>Moral Majority claims
47 state organizations</i>

1124
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:27,238
<i>and a network of 72,000 preachers,</i>

1125
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:30,909
<i>combining to form, what some call,
a Christian political machine.</i>

1126
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,119
<i>They want to use political power</i>

1127
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:35,538
<i>to help elect a president
who can appoint judges</i>

1128
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,291
<i>to reverse
the Court's decision on abortion.</i>

1129
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:41,085
- We're gonna make it impossible
for a fellow to run for dog catcher

1130
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,253
if he's pro-abortion.

1131
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,923
<i>Liberty University
is going to be the essential stop</i>

1132
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:46,508
<i>for political candidates,</i>

1133
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:47,926
<i>especially Republican Candidates,</i>

1134
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,303
<i>especially Conservative
Republican Candidates,</i>

1135
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,471
<i>for getting out your message</i>

1136
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,248
<i>and for substantiating
what you wanted to do with the country.</i>

1137
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:59,294
<i>This is an NBC News Special Report.</i>

1138
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:03,257
- Donald Trump is lining up,
what could be, key endorsements.

1139
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:08,238
<i>For Trump,
a major evangelical endorsement,</i>

1140
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,948
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr.</i>

1141
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:13,243
<i>Falwell could give Trump
the credibility he needs.</i>

1142
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,703
- Can we just put our hands together
for our great president?

1143
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,247
President Falwell, everybody. Come on.

1144
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:29,133
- Matthew 7:16 tells us
that by their fruits, you shall know them.

1145
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:32,929
In my opinion, Donald Trump
lives a life of loving and helping others

1146
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,139
as Jesus taught in the great commandment.

1147
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:39,084
Please welcome back
to Liberty University, Mr. Donald Trump.

1148
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,211
- Wow.

1149
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:44,339
It's an honor to be here.

1150
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,025
I wrote <i>The Art of the Deal,</i>

1151
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,110
I wrote many bestsellers.

1152
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:51,573
I always say,
a deep, deep second to the Bible.

1153
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:53,265
The Bible is the best. The Bible.

1154
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:57,328
<i>Jerry was entrenched
in, now, the political world</i>

1155
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,122
in campaigning for Donald Trump.

1156
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:02,292
- Evangelicals are tired
of being betrayed.

1157
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:05,920
<i>And I think the song from 1971 by The Who,</i>

1158
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:10,300
Won't Get Fooled Again,
<i>is very pertinent in this situation.</i>

1159
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,993
<i>And I think
that's how a lot of evangelicals feel.</i>

1160
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:15,537
We don't wanna get fooled again.

1161
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:19,225
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. was so helpful.
He was so helpful.</i>

1162
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,978
You know,
I'm leading with the evangelicals.

1163
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,062
<i>I'm a good Christian.</i>

1164
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:25,023
- The majority of evangelicals believe

1165
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:27,734
that Donald Trump is best equipped
to save the country.

1166
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:31,279
<i>He was one
of the very first Christian leaders</i>

1167
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,615
who made it possible
for other Christian leaders

1168
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:34,533
to get on board

1169
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:36,957
and get their congregations on board
with the Trump campaign.

1170
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,953
- The evangelicals, they're with me

1171
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,039
'cause they know one thing about me,
I'm not a liar.

1172
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,999
- Well, you just heard it
from Donald Trump.

1173
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,626
Christians love him.

1174
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,461
<i>If Trump didn't get
into real estate development,</i>

1175
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,695
he could've been an evangelical preacher.

1176
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:51,007
- There's 15 devils.

1177
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:52,467
<i>And he's a character.</i>

1178
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:54,969
<i>All these pastors, they're all characters,</i>

1179
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,221
<i>they're putting on a show.</i>

1180
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:57,764
- Everybody wants to talk about my hair.

1181
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:00,350
- Maybe they don't like my hair,
which is real, by the way.

1182
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:01,374
Look at that sucker.

1183
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,062
<i>You can make a case that Donald Trump</i>

1184
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:07,315
<i>is very much in the tradition
of the televangelist.</i>

1185
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:09,716
He was an evangelist for capitalism.

1186
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,862
- Many of you would need
to anoint your billfold with this oil

1187
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,096
for a financial blessing.

1188
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,200
<i>Trump Steaks are by far the best tasting,</i>

1189
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:19,226
most flavorful beef you've ever had.

1190
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,790
<i>And so, Donald Trump emerged
as the champion for the religious right,</i>

1191
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:25,232
much like Reagan did in 1980.

1192
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,045
I was asked once what book I would choose

1193
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:30,988
if I were shipwrecked on an island.

1194
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:32,488
The Bible.

1195
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,385
<i>What this is, is politics.</i>

1196
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,761
<i>Politics in the pulpit.</i>

1197
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:38,346
<i>Few concern themselves</i>

1198
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,432
<i>with the delicate balance
between church and state.</i>

1199
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,500
Mr. Reagan's enemies are my enemies,

1200
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:45,270
and they're yours too.

1201
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,839
- Donald Trump is the only candidate
who cannot be bought.

1202
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:54,362
- I am the law and order candidate.

1203
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:56,239
- You wanted law and order in this town,

1204
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:57,389
<i>you've got it.</i>

1205
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,916
- All of us are sinners.
All of us are redeemable.

1206
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,293
- Falwell stood by his side

1207
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:11,087
<i>and continued to argue
that Christians should support him.</i>

1208
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,505
<i>Five years from now,</i>

1209
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,757
when the Supreme Court is stacked

1210
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,468
<i>with people who will rip
our Constitution to shreds,</i>

1211
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,179
<i>get rid of the Second Amendment,</i>

1212
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,556
nobody's gonna be thinking
about what Donald Trump said

1213
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,766
on a videotape in 2005.

1214
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,769
<i>Evangelicals didn't care
about Donald Trump not being Christian.</i>

1215
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:30,106
<i>They were willing to take a man
who had been married three times</i>

1216
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,758
and had five children
from three different mothers,

1217
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:36,553
<i>just like they didn't care
that Ronald Reagan wasn't evangelical.</i>

1218
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:38,948
<i>Here you have Jimmy Carter,</i>

1219
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:43,495
<i>a born again,
Southern Baptist, progressive evangelical.</i>

1220
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,956
And evangelicals,
they turned dramatically against him

1221
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,083
<i>and then settled, improbably,</i>

1222
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:54,380
<i>on a divorced and remarried,
former Hollywood actor,</i>

1223
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:57,884
<i>who, as Governor of California in 1967,</i>

1224
01:00:57,908 --> 01:01:01,179
<i>signed into law the most liberal
abortion bill in the country.</i>

1225
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:04,456
- When you interrupt a pregnancy,
you are taking a human life.

1226
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:06,250
- As you know, I'm pro-life.

1227
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,186
<i>Should the woman be punished</i>

1228
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,187
<i>for having an abortion?</i>

1229
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,980
- There has to be some form of punishment.

1230
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,106
For the woman?
- Yeah.

1231
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,317
- Moral Majority founder,
the Reverend Jerry Falwell

1232
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,194
<i>is quoted as saying,</i>

1233
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:18,488
he expects a reshaped Supreme Court
by President Reagan

1234
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,281
would outlaw most abortions.

1235
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:23,117
- Do you wanna see the Court
overturn <i>Roe v. Wade?</i>

1236
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,496
- Well, if we put
another two or perhaps three justices on,

1237
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,123
that's really what's going to be...
That will happen.

1238
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:32,418
- Evangelicals,
all they wanted to do was win,

1239
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:35,672
and they were willing to win
with anyone that they possibly could.

1240
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:39,300
We will make America great again.

1241
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:42,953
- In 1984, my father stood
at this convention

1242
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,181
and offered the opening prayer

1243
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,142
before our party's candidate,
Ronald Reagan.

1244
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,710
- We pray for our beloved president.

1245
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,522
Upon a man that many of us believe,

1246
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:55,799
indeed, to be our greatest president
since Lincoln.

1247
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,321
- Ronald Reagan went on
to accept the nomination

1248
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,805
and win in a landslide.

1249
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:04,242
A little over 30 years later,

1250
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:07,328
I stand here with the sincerest prayer

1251
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:12,149
that history is about to repeat itself
with the election of Donald J. Trump.

1252
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:20,925
<i>Just about four days
before the Republican National Convention,</i>

1253
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:22,868
<i>I received a text message from Jerry.</i>

1254
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:26,347
<i>He said that
"You have equity in the company,</i>

1255
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,225
<i>you've worked really hard
in maximizing the value of this company."</i>

1256
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,268
No matter what happens,

1257
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,104
whether he buys it out
or we sell the property,

1258
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:36,507
that he would ensure
that I get no less than $600,000.

1259
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,735
I was making it clear
that this legal dispute

1260
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:41,613
was, you know,
taking a toll on my mental health.

1261
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,514
I just wasn't feeling well. I wanted out.

1262
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,014
<i>He probably wanted
a clean cut from everything too.</i>

1263
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:50,872
<i>This was just another form
of trapping my brother in,</i>

1264
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:53,082
giving him a reason
to, you know, stay close.

1265
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,793
Now there was this whole new dynamic.

1266
01:02:55,817 --> 01:03:00,632
<i>Jerry Falwell was getting himself involved
with the future president of this country,</i>

1267
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:03,801
<i>so he needed to make sure
that his circle was tight,</i>

1268
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:08,372
and that no one was gonna be out there
saying anything crazy about them.

1269
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:13,168
<i>Fox News decision desk has called</i>

1270
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,838
<i>Pennsylvania for Donald Trump.</i>

1271
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:19,442
<i>This means that Donald Trump will be</i>

1272
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:23,112
<i>the 45th president of the United States.</i>

1273
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,697
<i>Evangelicals have played a role</i>

1274
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:28,284
<i>in electing every Republican president
since Ronald Reagan.</i>

1275
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:30,203
<i>The numbers were overwhelming.</i>

1276
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:34,040
<i>81% of self-identified white,
born again, or evangelical Christians</i>

1277
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,333
<i>ultimately voted for Trump.</i>

1278
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,460
<i>It was an evangelical turnout for Trump</i>

1279
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:40,129
<i>that exceeded George W. Bush in 2004,</i>

1280
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,006
<i>John McCain in 2008,</i>

1281
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,490
<i>and Mitt Romney in 2012.</i>

1282
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:47,554
<i>Much like his father before him,</i>

1283
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:50,706
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. is now a kingmaker.</i>

1284
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:54,310
<i>After Trump was inaugurated as president,</i>

1285
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,044
Falwell felt invincible.

1286
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,191
<i>And he was increasingly weaponising
Liberty University,</i>

1287
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:03,510
<i>and making it into an arm
of the Trump Administration.</i>

1288
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:07,347
- I call Liberty the Fox News Network
of the academic world.

1289
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,785
- Why is it that the left mocks God?

1290
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:15,540
- Welcome to the United States of America,

1291
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:19,836
where illegal aliens have more rights

1292
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,589
than American citizens.

1293
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:25,717
<i>Enough. Enough of the PC garbage.</i>

1294
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,386
Enough of the never-ending movement
of the woke.

1295
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:33,391
- Gun owners know that the only
truly free people that have ever lived

1296
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:34,917
have been armed people.

1297
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:39,588
- President Jerry Falwell,
I'm inspired by the work you're doing.

1298
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:43,693
<i>You're forcing them
to attend every single speech,</i>

1299
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,320
<i>and you're repeating the same rhetoric.</i>

1300
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,614
To me, that's...
That's kind of like indoctrination.

1301
01:04:47,638 --> 01:04:48,639
- Praise Jesus.
- Yes.

1302
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:51,451
- Jerry and I have gotten
to be friends over the last year,

1303
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:53,661
and I can tell you,
my respect for him is boundless.

1304
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:58,208
- It's so refreshing
to come to a university

1305
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,376
where people care about their country,

1306
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,444
and... and it's okay
to say, "Merry Christmas."

1307
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,506
John Kelly, Rex Tillerson,

1308
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:07,884
lots of deep state people,
really run the government.

1309
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:11,638
- That issue of the Confederate flag
was not about hate.

1310
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:15,058
- As Christians,
we should be unbelievably concerned

1311
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:18,836
that the left, first and foremost,
they wanna turn government into God.

1312
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:22,649
<i>Jerry and Charlie Kirk
founded the Falkirk Center.</i>

1313
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:25,485
<i>It operates as Liberty's think tank.</i>

1314
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:27,821
But they don't do actual research.

1315
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:31,491
<i>There's no academic product
that comes from the Falkirk Center.</i>

1316
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:34,619
<i>It's just like a big Trump troll farm.</i>

1317
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:38,581
<i>The launch of this center
is answering the important questions:</i>

1318
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:40,500
Was Jesus Christ a socialist?

1319
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:43,253
<i>Jerry had the board under his thumb.</i>

1320
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:45,571
And as soon as someone
from the board spoke up,

1321
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,155
boom.

1322
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:48,551
<i>New this morning,</i>

1323
01:05:48,575 --> 01:05:51,344
<i>a Liberty University board member
has resigned</i>

1324
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:54,264
<i>after publicly criticizing
the school's president.</i>

1325
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:58,560
<i>Mark DeMoss was Jerry Falwell Sr.'s
personal chief of staff.</i>

1326
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:01,354
<i>DeMoss speaks
to the</i> Washington Post <i>and says,</i>

1327
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:05,316
<i>"Donald Trump's behavior
does not reflect the Christian values</i>

1328
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,944
<i>that have been taught
at Liberty for generations."</i>

1329
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:12,055
<i>That was the last time a board member
stood up to challenge Falwell.</i>

1330
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:14,909
<i>At this point,
I noticed that Jerry's behavior</i>

1331
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,829
was becoming more
just egotistical and arrogant.

1332
01:06:17,853 --> 01:06:19,539
- Can you imagine
if the governor was trying

1333
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,666
to take away our First Amendment rights?

1334
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,836
Second Amendment's
just as... just as sacred.

1335
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,921
- The culture at Liberty was affected

1336
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:29,507
by this permissiveness
that Falwell Jr. felt.

1337
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,968
- I think they're gonna be faced
with civil disobedience,

1338
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:35,329
not just by citizens
but by police officers.

1339
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:39,475
<i>Jerry was offered
the position of secretary of education.</i>

1340
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:41,293
<i>They said, "Are you gonna take it?"</i>

1341
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:43,021
And he said,

1342
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:46,566
"My dad told me that it's better
to be a kingmaker than a king."

1343
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,360
<i>I think he was just, like, drunk on power.</i>

1344
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:50,487
<i>And literally drunk,</i>

1345
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:53,031
with his bottle of tequila
in his hand at all times.

1346
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,266
- Mr. Trump learned about Clyde Fra...
Ooh, sorry.

1347
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,580
- He would walk around campus
with a water bottle

1348
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:02,749
<i>with half-water, half-tequila.</i>

1349
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,918
- A lot of people at Liberty had told me

1350
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:08,171
that Jerry was drinking during the day
at the university,

1351
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:11,466
<i>that he was going into meetings
smelling of alcohol.</i>

1352
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,009
<i>He literally said...</i>

1353
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:16,119
- I couldn't say half the things I say
at any other university either.

1354
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:18,932
<i>Which was exactly right.</i>

1355
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:21,392
He couldn't, uh, because
someone would hold him accountable.

1356
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,102
But nobody at Liberty ever did.

1357
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,503
- Look at this.

1358
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,316
- Jerry texted me a picture

1359
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,468
<i>of a former student
exposing herself at his private property.</i>

1360
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,698
<i>Just think of that young girl's parents.</i>

1361
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:37,700
They're paying
for their kid to go to Liberty,

1362
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,953
and this is the receipt they got?

1363
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:41,645
- He was basically untouchable.

1364
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:47,085
<i>They own, like, a 500, 600-acre farm</i>

1365
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:49,862
<i>with a Confederate cemetery on it.</i>

1366
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:52,465
<i>Shooting guns in the backyard.</i>

1367
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,676
And then Jerry said,
"Well, the good thing is,

1368
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,053
"now I know if Becki
were to run away with someone,

1369
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,054
<i>I know who it is."</i>

1370
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,431
<i>He said, "If that were to happen,
if she tried to divorce me,</i>

1371
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:01,748
<i>I'd probably have her killed."</i>

1372
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,336
At that moment,
I really took it as a serious threat.

1373
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:10,942
<i>People have so much influence,
they control this town.</i>

1374
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:15,179
If they wanted to make me disappear,
they could do it without a trace.

1375
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:16,990
<i>I mean, at the end of the day,</i>

1376
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,242
<i>Jerry endorsed the guy
who ended up becoming president.</i>

1377
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:21,828
<i>So you're like,
"I don't wanna fuck with these people.</i>

1378
01:08:21,852 --> 01:08:24,539
<i>I don't know what they would do to me
to keep their charade going."</i>

1379
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:26,332
<i>You don't know
what lengths people are willing to go,</i>

1380
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:28,275
<i>especially when they have so much to lose.</i>

1381
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,712
<i>As time went on,</i>

1382
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,238
<i>his behavior continued
to become more radical.</i>

1383
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:37,635
- How the establishment, the deep state...
They look at all of us as deplorables.

1384
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,431
But I have the distinct honor
of being the first person

1385
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:43,725
that Hillary Clinton called a deplorable.

1386
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:48,980
It was 2015, and it was right after
the San Bernardino shootings, and I said...

1387
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,317
<i>If some of those people
in that community center</i>

1388
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:55,177
had had what I've got
in my back pocket right now...

1389
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:02,869
If more good people
had concealed carry permits,

1390
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:04,662
then we could end those Muslims

1391
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,064
before they...
Before they walk in and kill.

1392
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:12,462
- At this point, I didn't really see
much common ground with Jerry anymore.

1393
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:16,508
- It just boggles my mind
that anybody would be against

1394
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:19,636
what Jesus told his disciples
in Luke 22:36.

1395
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,556
He told 'em if they had to sell their coat
to buy a sword, to do it.

1396
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,517
Because he knew danger was coming,

1397
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,668
and he wanted them to defend themselves.

1398
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:32,607
<i>We have seen the divide happen
between Conservatives and Liberals,</i>

1399
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,234
<i>and, you know, he was cognizant of that.</i>

1400
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,485
<i>He would just always bring it up.</i>

1401
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:39,072
- Virginians, including my family,
went to war in the Revolutionary War.

1402
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:41,306
Revolution always bubbles up.

1403
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,452
Wow, good shot!

1404
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:46,788
- That's what's happened
with President Trump.

1405
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,916
And so they can...
They can oppress people for a while,

1406
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,919
but, eventually,
people speak for themselves,

1407
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:53,986
<i>and they've had enough.</i>

1408
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:57,322
<i>He would say,
"We're so close to a civil war."</i>

1409
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,217
- Got it.

1410
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:03,829
- I'm noticing this really obvious,
blatant divide within our country.

1411
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:09,435
<i>This extreme violent rhetoric
being pushed by Trump</i>

1412
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:11,920
<i>and everyone within his orbit,
including Jerry.</i>

1413
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:15,150
I started noticing that there's
actual consequences to these words.

1414
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:16,294
It's not just words anymore.

1415
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,010
It's leading to violence.

1416
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,321
<i>People proudly had
their Confederate flags.</i>

1417
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:21,781
<i>They're not talking about racism.</i>

1418
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:22,824
<i>They love their flag.</i>

1419
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,076
It represents the South.
They like the South.

1420
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,518
People, right now, like the South.

1421
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,789
<i>A young white man
accused of killing nine people...</i>

1422
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:31,958
<i>Roof revealed that he chose the church</i>

1423
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:34,752
<i>because it was
a historic African American church.</i>

1424
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:38,339
- Corrupt, power-hungry globalists.

1425
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:39,883
<i>You know what a globalist is, right?</i>

1426
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,575
<i>You know what a globalist is.</i>

1427
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,429
<i>A gunman
burst into the Tree of Life Temple</i>

1428
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:46,788
<i>down the tree-lined streets
of Squirrel Hill.</i>

1429
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:48,600
<i>11 people killed.</i>

1430
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,751
<i>The shooter's social media page stating...</i>

1431
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:57,799
<i>Do you think
somebody's helping that caravan?</i>

1432
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:02,864
<i>I wouldn't... I don't know who,
but I... I wouldn't be surprised.</i>

1433
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,032
<i>A lot of people say, "Yes."</i>

1434
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:07,911
- The shooter had posted
about the caravan of migrants

1435
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:11,915
moving up from, uh, Central America,
called them invaders.

1436
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:15,067
- That's an invasion.
That's not... That's an invasion.

1437
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,384
- And then, you... you have
what happened in Charlottesville.

1438
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:26,054
<i>Hundreds of white nationalists,</i>

1439
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,931
<i>some wearing what appeared to be uniforms,</i>

1440
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:30,832
<i>carrying weapons, Confederate flags,
and Nazi symbols...</i>

1441
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:36,147
<i>A horrifying scene, as this car
plowed into a crowd of people.</i>

1442
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:38,149
- Very bad people in that group.

1443
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:43,762
But you also had people
that were very fine people on both sides.

1444
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:46,574
- Falwell rushed to Donald Trump's defense

1445
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:47,641
as eagerly as ever.

1446
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,245
<i>One of the reasons I supported him</i>

1447
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:54,165
<i>is because he doesn't say
what's politically correct,</i>

1448
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,793
he says what's in his heart,
what he believes.

1449
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:58,569
And sometimes, that gets him in trouble.

1450
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:02,507
<i>The seeds of that were
in the work of people like Jerry Falwell</i>

1451
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:04,092
<i>generations earlier.</i>

1452
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:06,553
He laid the foundations
for... for this kind of political violence

1453
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:08,638
that we've seen, really, since the 1990s.

1454
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:11,224
- The man charged
with killing an abortion doctor

1455
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:13,792
says he has a defense, the Bible!

1456
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:20,591
- <i>Roe vs. Wade</i> has resulted
in 10 to 12 million deaths
of little children.

1457
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:24,362
<i>Jerry Falwell has unleashed demons</i>

1458
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:25,971
<i>that he can no longer control.</i>

1459
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:29,784
<i>Contrary to the wishes of the founders</i>

1460
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:33,997
<i>who wanted neutrality as the policy
of the government toward religion,</i>

1461
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:36,207
in fact, the government
was becoming hostile,

1462
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:37,709
in my opinion, towards religion.

1463
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:39,335
- This new Christian nationalism

1464
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:41,713
gives rise to things
like the Oklahoma City bombing...

1465
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,966
<i>It looks like part of the building
has been blown away.</i>

1466
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:47,218
<i>- Look at that shot.
- Wow. Holy cow!</i>

1467
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:48,803
<i>It is absolutely incredible.</i>

1468
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,704
- And nobody's bothering you, right?
- Well...

1469
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:54,767
<i>The bombing
at Centennial Olympic Park this morning</i>

1470
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,627
was an evil act of terror.

1471
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,313
<i>Eric Rudolph is charged with</i>

1472
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:01,107
<i>the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing.</i>

1473
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:05,069
<i>Rudolph next struck at a Sandy Springs,
Georgia, abortion clinic,</i>

1474
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,404
<i>then a gay bar in Atlanta,</i>

1475
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:09,532
<i>and finally, another abortion clinic
in Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

1476
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:12,785
<i>Rudolph is believed
to belong to the Christian identity</i>

1477
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:15,038
<i>known as a white supremacist sect.</i>

1478
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:16,664
<i>One thing Jerry Sr. taught us</i>

1479
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:21,044
<i>was that politics, demagoguery,
and hysteria is a way to make more money,</i>

1480
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,668
<i>give them more influence and more power.</i>

1481
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,923
<i>And so, Jerry Jr. recognizes this</i>

1482
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:27,550
<i>and really picks up
with what his father had started.</i>

1483
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:31,638
- I did notice that the only time
the president calls me to go on TV

1484
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:33,014
is when he's in real trouble.

1485
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:35,600
- I felt guilty.
I'm like, "I know the truth about Jerry."

1486
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,602
"He's trying to appear
as this, like, strongman,

1487
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:40,504
<i>but I know him as just the cuck
in the corner of the room."</i>

1488
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:47,028
<i>I started looking at Jerry Falwell,</i>

1489
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:49,763
<i>in part, because
of his endorsement for Trump.</i>

1490
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:51,825
<i>For a lot of people, it was a surprise.</i>

1491
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:55,227
Trump didn't fit the model, necessarily,
of the evangelical candidate.

1492
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:56,812
<i>It was a puzzle.</i>

1493
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:01,084
<i>One of the things you routinely do
as a... as a journalist</i>

1494
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:02,585
<i>is you look at people's backgrounds,</i>

1495
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,004
<i>and one of those things is litigation.</i>

1496
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:08,657
And that's where I saw,
you know, this... this... this lawsuit.

1497
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:13,096
<i>The lawsuit alleged</i>

1498
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:18,142
that this father and son
had been inappropriately cut out

1499
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,769
of this business transaction

1500
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:23,630
<i>involving this youth hostel,
Giancarlo Granda, and Falwell.</i>

1501
01:14:24,882 --> 01:14:27,110
I did my best to find Giancarlo Granda.

1502
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:28,927
I did my best to figure out who he was.

1503
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:32,907
<i>Aram Roston texted me,</i>

1504
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:35,201
<i>introducing himself,
that he's a journalist,</i>

1505
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:37,186
<i>and he would like
to have a conversation with me.</i>

1506
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:41,249
He was asking questions about the lawsuit,

1507
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:43,001
<i>about Michael Cohen.</i>

1508
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:45,277
<i>I realized that this was gonna get messy.</i>

1509
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,089
<i>But I was instructed by the Falwells</i>

1510
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:49,174
to give him no comment,

1511
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,117
<i>and just to communicate
with my attorney, or Jerry.</i>

1512
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:54,804
<i>What do you do, right?</i>

1513
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,306
He didn't know what the right thing was.

1514
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:00,018
And then has the Falwells
really putting the pressure on him now

1515
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,020
like, "This is the time.
We gotta stick together.

1516
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:03,188
They don't have anything."

1517
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,648
But at the end of the day,
you know, my brother was worried,

1518
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:06,774
as he should've been,

1519
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:10,028
because people are gonna dig
and more things are gonna come out.

1520
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:14,157
- Everything that I was afraid of
was about to actually materialize here.

1521
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:16,326
Uh, the whole world
was gonna find out about it.

1522
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:20,663
<i>Our first</i> BuzzFeed <i>story,</i>

1523
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:23,791
<i>it disclosed the existence
of this business relationship,</i>

1524
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:26,711
<i>this unusual litigation,</i>

1525
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,570
this unusual youth hostel,

1526
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,341
<i>the involvement of the pool attendant.</i>

1527
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,468
It also mentioned Michael Cohen.

1528
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:37,663
<i>And it also mentioned the endorsement
and how important that endorsement was.</i>

1529
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:43,836
A source said that
even before announcing his candidacy,

1530
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:46,731
this source believed
there was an understanding

1531
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,882
<i>that Trump would get
Falwell's endorsements,</i>

1532
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:51,694
<i>which meant
there was some sort of relationship</i>

1533
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,488
between Falwell and Trump,

1534
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:54,952
and I was trying to understand that.

1535
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:59,869
<i>What was clear was that we didn't know
as much as we thought we knew</i>

1536
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:01,311
<i>about the Falwells.</i>

1537
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:08,837
- I should tell you that they don't have
what you're telling me they have,

1538
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:12,215
because he made it
sound like they told him...

1539
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,175
- Mm-hmm.

1540
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,636
- ...that they have pictures
that supported their theory...

1541
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,471
- Mm-hmm.

1542
01:16:17,495 --> 01:16:20,265
- ...that there was something
going on between you and me.

1543
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:21,266
- Yeah.

1544
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:23,393
- Just wanna let you know,
this is gonna work out fine.

1545
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,418
- Yeah.

1546
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,021
- I'm going to bed. Good night, y'all.

1547
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,314
- Okay.
- All right, have a good night.

1548
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:30,048
- You wait. You can talk to me.

1549
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,610
- I'm actually really tired too.

1550
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:34,178
- I'm sure you are.

1551
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:36,930
It's so hard.

1552
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:38,891
- Yeah.

1553
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:40,994
- Especially when we're not talking,

1554
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:42,311
I just feel lost.

1555
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:47,774
I'm sorry about all this.

1556
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:50,235
- Anyways, I'm gonna go to bed, okay?

1557
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,297
- Okay.

1558
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:53,989
- All right. Good night.

1559
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:56,491
- I love you.

1560
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:58,493
- Love you too.

1561
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:02,664
- After the <i>BuzzFeed</i> story,
Giancarlo's fucked.

1562
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:05,226
<i>You go on the Internet,</i>

1563
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,397
<i>and anything attached to his name
read "Pool Boy,"</i>

1564
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,984
which became a meme in short order

1565
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:17,322
<i>and really started
to upend Giancarlo's life.</i>

1566
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:19,240
- They don't really have all the facts.

1567
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:20,807
<i>They started just spreading lies.</i>

1568
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:23,703
<i>My brother now, he's in a bad place.</i>

1569
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:27,123
He's upset,
falls into, like, this depression.

1570
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:29,399
- It was the first time
my name appeared in the press.

1571
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,920
No one taught me how to deal with it.

1572
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,111
<i>It sucks.</i>

1573
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:37,634
<i>Imagine that your job
that you had when you were in college</i>

1574
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,093
<i>for one year of your life,</i>

1575
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:42,371
<i>that that's what
now you're associated with forever.</i>

1576
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:46,601
- This is definitely
a manifestation of my worst fears,

1577
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,044
from... dating back to 2012.

1578
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:53,817
<i>Perhaps</i> BuzzFeed <i>did him a favor,</i>

1579
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:56,468
'cause it planted the seeds
for his escape.

1580
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,826
<i>And as if this story
can't get more bizarre,</i>

1581
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,351
enter Tom Arnold.

1582
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,895
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, buddy. Tom Arnold.

1583
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:08,456
<i>Tom, how are you?</i>

1584
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,333
- Happy 4th of July.
Happy Independence Day.

1585
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,876
<i>Same to you. Same to you.</i>

1586
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,044
<i>How are you doing?</i>
- I'm doing well.

1587
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:18,341
<i>So Tom Arnold audiotaped
a conversation he had with Michael Cohen</i>

1588
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:20,593
about the Falwells.

1589
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:25,932
And Michael Cohen
told Tom Arnold about this episode.

1590
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:27,559
<i>And I'm just disappointed.</i>

1591
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,978
<i>Donald doesn't speak to me anymore.</i>

1592
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:33,314
<i>Um, even the Falwells,
who I brought to the table.</i>

1593
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:34,816
- Yes, you did. You did.

1594
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,110
<i>None of the evangelicals
wanted to support Trump.</i>

1595
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,404
- Right. Well,
you definitely brought the Falwells in.

1596
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,447
You definitely... With that...

1597
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:45,243
I mean, you did the deal
with, uh, the pool, uh, the pool boy.

1598
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:48,413
And Michael Cohen
laid out for him the scenario

1599
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:49,747
where he said there were,

1600
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,750
what Michael Cohen called,
personal photos.

1601
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,669
Uh, he said
that they were the type of photos

1602
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:57,797
that a couple wants
to keep between themselves.

1603
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:58,549
- Yeah.

1604
01:18:58,573 --> 01:19:01,050
<i>But there's a bunch of photographs,</i>

1605
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:03,386
<i>you know, personal photographs, you know?</i>

1606
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,889
<i>The evangelicals
are kinkier than Tom Arnold.</i>

1607
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:09,058
- I became a little obsessed
with this Jerry Falwell thing

1608
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:12,353
because Jerry Falwell gave license
to all the other evangelicals

1609
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:14,379
<i>to go, "Yeah, this is the guy."</i>

1610
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:17,108
<i>I had a show called</i>
The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.

1611
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:19,611
<i>I... I wanted to meet
everybody in Trump's world</i>

1612
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:20,820
<i>that was kinda pushed out.</i>

1613
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:23,656
And so I just wanted to connect the dots...
I wanted the truth.

1614
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,991
<i>It's terrible, you know?</i>

1615
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:28,244
<i>Nobody wants their...
You know, their private photos.</i>

1616
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:29,954
<i>Especially not when you have children</i>

1617
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,372
<i>and now grandchildren.</i>
- Oh, geez.

1618
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,958
<i>So my heart went out for Becki, you know?</i>

1619
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,085
<i>I loved them. They were like family to me.</i>

1620
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,879
- He goes, "No, no, what I did,"

1621
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,197
and he explains
what he did for the Falwells.

1622
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:44,802
And he's like, "No, it wasn't like sex.
It's like a boudoir picture of Becki."

1623
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:45,803
And then he says...

1624
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:47,287
<i>I actually have one of the photos.</i>

1625
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,641
- He has...
He showed me some pictures.

1626
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:53,252
I feel like
a bit of a scumbag too because

1627
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:57,297
even the "boudoir" pictures are like porn.

1628
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,758
But that's not the end of this story.

1629
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:05,448
<i>"Michael Cohen used the pictures
to say, "Hey, look what I did for you.</i>

1630
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,200
<i>Now I need you to do something for me."</i>

1631
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:09,142
<i>It... It was a quid pro quo.</i>

1632
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:12,872
- The Falwells enlisted
Michael Cohen's help

1633
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:15,291
<i>to make this blackmail threat go away.</i>

1634
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:17,085
<i>Then the following January,</i>

1635
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:18,545
<i>Cohen helped persuade Falwell</i>

1636
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,363
<i>to issue his endorsement
of Trump's presidential candidacy.</i>

1637
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:25,134
- When Michael Cohen published his book,
he was very specific.

1638
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:30,098
<i>He said he would call in this favor,
not for himself but for the Boss,</i>

1639
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:34,144
<i>at a crucial moment
in his journey to the presidency.</i>

1640
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:36,771
- It's fair to say that Jerry
was gonna endorse Trump,

1641
01:20:36,795 --> 01:20:40,441
but the compromising material
that Michael Cohen had,

1642
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,443
I think that was just insurance.

1643
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:54,205
- These events may have
changed the course of history,

1644
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:58,543
but in the <i>New York Times'</i> quest
to explain why Falwell endorsed Trump,

1645
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:02,112
they left the most important question
unanswered:

1646
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:04,489
Did someone fuck the pool guy?

1647
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:21,399
- My brother, in 2018, gets accepted
into grad school at Georgetown,

1648
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:22,400
to the master's program.

1649
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:24,319
So we make a road trip out of it.

1650
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:32,976
<i>It's me, my mom,
my brother, and the dog.</i>

1651
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:39,900
<i>We go to DC.
My family's helping me move
into my new apartment.</i>

1652
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:48,259
I get a phone call from Jerry.

1653
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:51,012
He said, "Hey, we have
this event at the White House",

1654
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:53,515
"but after that,
we're going to the Trump Hotel.

1655
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:54,619
You guys should come over."

1656
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:02,273
<i>They were at the White House for...</i>

1657
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:04,192
<i>It was some sort of evangelical event.</i>

1658
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:08,053
<i>Every top preacher in the country
was there that night at the White House.</i>

1659
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,889
<i>Meet up with the Falwells
at the Trump Hotel.</i>

1660
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:17,247
- Everyone's drinking
and having a really good time.

1661
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,999
There was one in particular
that, I had no idea who she was,

1662
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:22,359
but my mom's like,
"Oh, she's on TV. What's her name?"

1663
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:28,907
- Her act is... is crazy!

1664
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,306
But when you meet her in person,
she's nothing like that.

1665
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:38,709
She's kinda flirting with people.
She was flirting with me.

1666
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:43,857
- I think that night my mom had
a kind of a... a come-to-Jesus moment.

1667
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:47,527
- She's like,
"Oh, I understand now. It's all a show."

1668
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:49,237
They have a public image,

1669
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:52,598
but behind the scenes, they're all freaks.

1670
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:57,495
<i>I think my mom was like,
"Okay, um, I think we're good.</i>

1671
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:59,205
"We don't need to be around them anymore.

1672
01:22:59,229 --> 01:23:00,248
Like, ever again."

1673
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:09,841
<i>I'm in my first semester of grad school,</i>

1674
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:11,867
and I'm trying
to just move away from the Falwells.

1675
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,929
<i>Once he starts school,</i>

1676
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:15,930
<i>he's loving it.</i>

1677
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,640
<i>He loves DC.</i>

1678
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:19,100
<i>He's making new friends.</i>

1679
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:20,959
<i>He starts applying for jobs.</i>

1680
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:25,440
It's a little difficult for him
to even get people to call him,

1681
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:26,941
because they're Googling his name,

1682
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:29,259
<i>and no one wants
to be associated with this.</i>

1683
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:31,613
<i>It was just 'cause they were worried.</i>

1684
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:33,781
<i>Like, why would they go with me</i>

1685
01:23:33,805 --> 01:23:36,576
<i>where there's so many other people
with a similar resume</i>

1686
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,411
with no national scandal?

1687
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:41,915
- But he finally gets
this interview with this company.

1688
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,458
<i>He's super excited.</i>

1689
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:45,084
<i>- The hiring manager emailed me</i>

1690
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:49,172
<i>saying, "Congratulations.
We wanna move forward with hiring you."</i>

1691
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,548
Right there, he offered me the job.

1692
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:56,012
<i>Finally, he sees some sort of light
at this end of this, like, insane tunnel.</i>

1693
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:57,514
- It was exactly what I needed.

1694
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:01,375
<i>I was so excited,
that, um, I just... I shared it with Becki.</i>

1695
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,127
<i>The following week,
I get an email from the firm,</i>

1696
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,005
<i>and the hiring manager
rescinded the offer.</i>

1697
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,694
<i>And, you know,
there's times where I felt like</i>

1698
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:14,531
<i>he was purposefully
sabotaging everything around me</i>

1699
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:18,350
in order to keep me close
and them being my only option.

1700
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:20,435
<i>I just felt so overwhelmed.</i>

1701
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:24,666
<i>That's it.
I'm forever attached to the Falwell name.</i>

1702
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,209
I was so loyal to this family.

1703
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,503
I protected them. I lied for them.

1704
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:31,172
And I end up
getting attacked by the media,

1705
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:32,406
and I'm still defending them.

1706
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:35,009
<i>Everything was crumbling.</i>

1707
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,469
<i>I felt like there's no way out.</i>

1708
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:37,929
It's all over for me.

1709
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,348
- He felt like
that was just really the end of the world,

1710
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:42,350
so he went into a really dark place.

1711
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:45,002
<i>It was a really difficult time.</i>

1712
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,940
- I started contemplating suicide.

1713
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:51,151
I just wanted to go away peacefully.

1714
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:52,652
And I told Becki, I said,

1715
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:55,846
"My life and my reputation,
everything is completely ruined."

1716
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:03,729
Um...

1717
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,732
Then at that moment,
I just thought about my, uh,

1718
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:10,485
I thought about my mom,
and my dad, and my sister

1719
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:13,381
<i>and I just... I couldn't...
I couldn't make them go through that,</i>

1720
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,115
<i>so I just... I stopped.</i>

1721
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:18,368
Just... I... I need a moment.

1722
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:24,601
<i>You know, getting calls from your brother</i>

1723
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,936
telling you that he wants to kill himself,

1724
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,504
that there's no way out of this,

1725
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:30,899
he's never gonna recover.

1726
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:31,924
It's...

1727
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:37,155
It's hard to
explain what that feeling is like

1728
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,533
when someone that you love so much,

1729
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:44,478
someone that you want
nothing but the best for, is...

1730
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:47,731
Is thinking of hurting himself.

1731
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:58,593
- That was obviously a dark time,

1732
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:02,305
so... just had to relive it
at that moment there.

1733
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,540
But should be good now.

1734
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:10,772
- And then, to add insult to the injury,

1735
01:26:10,796 --> 01:26:14,567
for an undisclosed amount
to make this lawsuit disappear,

1736
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:18,303
Jerry Falwell Jr.
Settles with Tito Fernandez.

1737
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:22,075
<i>There were three events
that pushed me to rock bottom</i>

1738
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:24,410
and left me at a crossroads.

1739
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:27,855
The first one
was losing out on the job offer.

1740
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:32,359
The second was Jerry settling with Tito.

1741
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:46,099
- Meanwhile, my brother,
who actually worked his ass off for years

1742
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:49,376
<i>running this building,
managing it, overseeing it,</i>

1743
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:51,712
<i>he had actual stakes in it.</i>

1744
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,149
- How do you think Giancarlo felt

1745
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:59,928
knowing that of all people to get a check,
it would be Jesus Fernandez?

1746
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:02,574
<i>I was upset because they settled,</i>

1747
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:05,410
but there was no more talks
about buying me out

1748
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:08,955
or any word from Jerry saying
that he was gonna honor his promise.

1749
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:10,623
They just kept stringing me along.

1750
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:13,918
- They, you know, dangled the carrot
of, like, "We're gonna help you."

1751
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:17,130
<i>"We're gonna set you up with,
you know, real estate and get you going</i>

1752
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:19,382
<i>so you can fulfill all of your dreams."</i>

1753
01:27:19,406 --> 01:27:22,034
<i>And they just
completely fucked him in the end.</i>

1754
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,161
<i>I texted Jerry.</i>

1755
01:27:32,044 --> 01:27:33,897
"Just own up to your promises

1756
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,121
and we can move on with our lives
in a peaceful manner."

1757
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:40,278
- He wasn't threatening them,
he was saying, "I want my life back."

1758
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:41,488
"Give me what you owe me.

1759
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:45,033
"Let's call it a day.
Let's go our separate ways.

1760
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,409
Let's be done with this."

1761
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:50,288
- The third and final blow
was... what broke all of us.

1762
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:51,647
It was summer 2020.

1763
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,000
<i>In just a few short months,</i>

1764
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:58,171
<i>this pandemic has infected
some two million here at home.</i>

1765
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:00,256
<i>So by the summer of 2020,</i>

1766
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,635
the mood in this country
was like, "Is the world gonna end?

1767
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:06,888
Was Jerry Sr. right?
Are end times upon us?"

1768
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:11,250
<i>I mean, it's biblical
how fucked up this world had become.</i>

1769
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:13,311
<i>100,000.</i>

1770
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:17,106
<i>The obituary names grow daily
with no end in sight.</i>

1771
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,608
<i>There's some bad strain of the flu</i>

1772
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:20,151
<i>that comes in every two years.</i>

1773
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,153
For some reason,
it's always on election years.

1774
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:23,822
I don't... I don't know why that is.

1775
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:26,241
<i>2020, it was a terrible year.</i>

1776
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:27,492
<i>We had the pandemic.</i>

1777
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:28,600
George Floyd's murdered.

1778
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,206
<i>Civil unrest is unfolding,</i>

1779
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,230
it's intensifying.

1780
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,419
<i>And then you have Trump just,
uh, kind of doubling down</i>

1781
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,839
and not trying to unite the country.

1782
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:42,173
<i>Instead, he was enjoying this.</i>

1783
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:43,824
<i>And he was magnifying this division.</i>

1784
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:47,160
<i>You know what I say?
Protesters, your ass.</i>

1785
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:50,348
<i>These are not acts of peaceful protest.</i>

1786
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:53,250
<i>These are acts of domestic terror.</i>

1787
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:55,728
- You know, initially, going back to 2012,

1788
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:56,938
I admired Trump.

1789
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:59,506
I thought he was someone
I would like to become.

1790
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:02,759
<i>But now he aspired to be a dictator.</i>

1791
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:07,323
My family fled a country
where there was a dictator

1792
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,807
<i>that consolidated power.</i>

1793
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:13,353
I didn't feel optimistic
about our country's future.

1794
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:15,498
<i>At that moment, I realized</i>

1795
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:19,294
<i>how much weight there was
behind, uh, Jerry Falwell Jr.'s words.</i>

1796
01:29:19,318 --> 01:29:23,965
<i>And if this man was able
to anoint Donald Trump in 2016,</i>

1797
01:29:23,989 --> 01:29:27,993
<i>then why wouldn't he have
that same power in 2020?</i>

1798
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:34,851
<i>Giancarlo certainly feels like
Jerry is responsible for all this chaos.</i>

1799
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,502
<i>You know, and why wouldn't he?</i>

1800
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:38,754
<i>The kingmaker, right?</i>

1801
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:40,631
Now, look what happened.

1802
01:29:43,759 --> 01:29:46,070
<i>When I hit rock bottom, I had two choices:</i>

1803
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:48,823
take my own life or take back control.

1804
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:54,019
And, um, you know, one big takeaway
from, uh, from Trump's speech in 2012,

1805
01:29:54,603 --> 01:29:58,249
in his advice to win
in real estate or business,

1806
01:29:58,273 --> 01:29:59,709
or whatever you're doing is...

1807
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:02,736
- Don't let people take advantage.

1808
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:04,238
<i>Get even.</i>
- Get even.

1809
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:07,950
It feels like right now,
this is happening for a reason.

1810
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:10,369
Me confessing to the world
what happened...

1811
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,225
would somehow stop
one of Trump's closest allies,

1812
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,684
which is Jerry Falwell Jr.

1813
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,252
I felt like I had a responsibility.

1814
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:20,337
<i>I texted Jerry.</i>

1815
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:45,713
- I think he just wanted
to just unburden himself of all of this

1816
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:47,966
and just say,
"This is what actually happened."

1817
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:50,218
He had no other choice left at that point

1818
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:53,596
but to just come out and speak his truth.

1819
01:30:56,206 --> 01:30:59,310
- I'd been trying
to talk to Giancarlo Granda

1820
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:01,563
since I first started working on this.

1821
01:31:01,587 --> 01:31:03,589
And I... I didn't have any luck.

1822
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:06,025
<i>I texted him.</i>

1823
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:08,361
<i>"I said," Hey, I would love
to meet with you</i>

1824
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,185
<i>and just talk about everything
that happened."</i>

1825
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:14,808
- I finally met Giancarlo near DC.

1826
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:17,745
<i>Obviously, he was shocked,</i>

1827
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:21,440
but, like, it kinda confirmed
everything that he, uh, speculated.

1828
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,377
- There was an element of hypocrisy here

1829
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:26,195
<i>that was very glaring.</i>

1830
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:31,384
To stand up our story,
we needed some corroborating evidence.

1831
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:36,914
- I had certain evidence
dating back to 2012, 2013, 2014.

1832
01:31:38,123 --> 01:31:39,708
<i>There were these texts.</i>

1833
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:43,462
<i>Sort of romantic, loaded phrases.</i>

1834
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,840
And another one was this audio recording.

1835
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:50,570
- All right.
- Gian's been very busy lately, studying.

1836
01:31:50,594 --> 01:31:51,905
- Yeah, yeah, sorta.
- It's good, good.

1837
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:55,116
- His new thing is, like, telling me
every time he hooks up with people,

1838
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,368
like, I... like I don't have feelings
or something.

1839
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:59,245
- You're gonna make her jealous, Gian.
- Yeah.

1840
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:00,914
- Aw. I'm not trying to do that.

1841
01:32:00,938 --> 01:32:04,626
- Like a week ago,
I was in tears for a whole freakin' day.

1842
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:05,817
Completely depressed.

1843
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,755
- Come on. You don't...
You don't care about me anymore.

1844
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:10,965
- Maybe the more you tell me,
the more I'll get used to it.

1845
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:12,366
- You don't care about me anymore.

1846
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:14,451
- Oh, yeah? Really?

1847
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:16,703
Yeah, obviously.

1848
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:18,432
- In an ideal world,

1849
01:32:18,456 --> 01:32:20,266
you'd have videotape
of everything that ever happens,

1850
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:22,751
but this is not the way the world works.

1851
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:26,648
<i>When I showed them the video,</i>

1852
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:28,423
<i>I mean, it was case closed right there.</i>

1853
01:32:29,132 --> 01:32:31,969
<i>On January 16th, 2019,</i>

1854
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:35,305
Becki and I, uh,
we hop on a FaceTime call,

1855
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:37,933
<i>and she's drinking white wine,</i>

1856
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:41,728
<i>and then she starts stripping,
uh, completely naked.</i>

1857
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:44,499
<i>She's walking around the house.</i>

1858
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:47,961
<i>She's going from room to room,
the places where we've had sex.</i>

1859
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,254
<i>She's says, "Oh, do you remember this?"</i>

1860
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:51,446
<i>She's going to the kitchen,
she's showing the island.</i>

1861
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,716
<i>"Oh, I know you remember doing it there."</i>

1862
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,177
<i>And then she went into the kids' rooms,
"Remember doing it there?"</i>

1863
01:32:56,201 --> 01:33:00,330
Which is crazy, as, you know,
we... we had sex in, uh, their kids' rooms.

1864
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:03,792
<i>"So, do you remember this spot?
Do you remember this spot?"</i>

1865
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:05,812
<i>And at one point,</i>

1866
01:33:05,836 --> 01:33:08,672
<i>Jerry Jr. appears to peek out
from behind a doorway.</i>

1867
01:33:11,592 --> 01:33:13,695
<i>"And at that moment,
I'm like," Oh, my God,</i>

1868
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:16,823
<i>"I finally have
the smoking gun that I needed,</i>

1869
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:18,515
<i>uh, to prove my side of the story."</i>

1870
01:33:20,893 --> 01:33:22,102
- Well, that helped.

1871
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:26,291
I mean, that...
That was the... the, you know?

1872
01:33:26,315 --> 01:33:28,501
That was, uh, very helpful,

1873
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:32,571
the, uh, FaceTime video with Becki naked.

1874
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:38,285
<i>Like, this is 100% true,
and Jerry has been involved since day one.</i>

1875
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:42,599
- Well, we wouldn't have been able
to run the story

1876
01:33:42,623 --> 01:33:44,267
if we hadn't been convinced,

1877
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:47,252
if there wasn't the corroboration
that there was.

1878
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:52,984
- A photo posted then deleted
from Jerry Falwell Jr.'s Instagram

1879
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:54,235
is now going viral.

1880
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:57,363
<i>A Houston Chronicle reporter
posted this screenshot</i>

1881
01:33:57,387 --> 01:34:01,034
<i>showing Liberty University's president
with his pants unzipped...</i>

1882
01:34:01,058 --> 01:34:04,078
<i>And it was an atomic scandal at Liberty.</i>

1883
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:07,665
All these things that were not permissible
inside the Liberty community,

1884
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:09,292
are contained in this photograph.

1885
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:14,297
- This scandal was just another thing
that was going to back me up.

1886
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:15,840
<i>And I'm just gonna throw it to you.</i>

1887
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:17,717
<i>What was up
with that picture on Instagram?</i>

1888
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:19,636
<i>You know, it was weird</i>.

1889
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,012
<i>She was... She's pregnant,</i>

1890
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,914
<i>so she couldn't get her...
She couldn't get her pants zipped.</i>

1891
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:27,167
<i>And, uh, I was, like, trying to, like...</i>

1892
01:34:28,293 --> 01:34:31,439
<i>My... I had a pair of jeans
that I haven't worn in a long time,</i>

1893
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:33,149
<i>so I couldn't get mine zipped either.</i>

1894
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:35,568
- It was evident
that he was drunk on that call.

1895
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:37,028
I mean, he was slurring his words.

1896
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:39,739
<i>I promised my kids I'm gonna try to be...</i>

1897
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:42,200
<i>I'm gonna try
to be a good boy from here on out.</i>

1898
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:43,827
- It just showed you who he really was.

1899
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:45,662
He was just... He was a mess.

1900
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:49,040
- This announcement was made
just before 05:00 this afternoon.

1901
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:51,376
It followed a meeting
of the Executive Committee

1902
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,503
<i>of Liberty's Board of Trustees.</i>

1903
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:57,507
<i>The committee requested Falwell
take an indefinite leave of absence.</i>

1904
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:58,740
<i>Falwell agreed.</i>

1905
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:03,263
- Liberty's board was going to pay
for Falwell's rehab,

1906
01:35:03,287 --> 01:35:06,790
and they fully anticipated
to bring him back, uh, afterwards.

1907
01:35:07,457 --> 01:35:09,936
<i>Either they didn't think
that they would get caught</i>

1908
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,396
<i>or that it would come back to them,</i>

1909
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:14,274
<i>or on some level,
Jerry Falwell just didn't care.</i>

1910
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:16,192
Because there was
some part of him that thought,

1911
01:35:16,216 --> 01:35:20,822
<i>"If I can't live my life
in this very fun way,</i>

1912
01:35:20,846 --> 01:35:22,431
<i>then I don't even want this life."</i>

1913
01:35:24,433 --> 01:35:27,686
<i>My brother was talking
to the reporter for months.</i>

1914
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:30,623
<i>I, at one point, had to speak to him</i>

1915
01:35:30,647 --> 01:35:33,751
because they really
just went through every detail,

1916
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:35,360
they fact-checked everything.

1917
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,989
- I'm an investigative reporter,
so I take a long time with stories.

1918
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:43,702
You know, we never publish
until we get it, you know, damn solid.

1919
01:35:44,536 --> 01:35:45,638
<i>It was a tough process,</i>

1920
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:46,973
and there were certain times
where I'm like,

1921
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:48,391
"I don't think this is gonna happen.

1922
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:49,684
I think it's gonna get killed."

1923
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:51,811
- At this point, he knows

1924
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:57,442
that perhaps Falwell and his team
are planning something nefarious.

1925
01:35:57,466 --> 01:35:58,467
To his credit,

1926
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:00,737
Giancarlo was right.

1927
01:36:02,888 --> 01:36:06,868
<i>The night before
we were going to run our story,</i>

1928
01:36:06,892 --> 01:36:12,457
a local newspaper here in Washington
published this statement by Jerry Jr.

1929
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:14,751
<i>That laid out this alternate account</i>

1930
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:19,047
of the entire relationship
between Giancarlo and the Falwells.

1931
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:20,340
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr.,</i>

1932
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:24,427
<i>the son of one of the most influential
TV evangelists of all time,</i>

1933
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:27,889
<i>is publicly sharing a story
of his wife's infidelity,</i>

1934
01:36:27,913 --> 01:36:31,267
<i>which led to, what he describes as,
an extortion scheme.</i>

1935
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:33,686
<i>Although I was expecting it,
when you actually see it written,</i>

1936
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:37,023
"Oh, extortionist. He's a criminal,"
this and that, it... it hurts.

1937
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:39,883
It's like, uh... It's like
just getting punched in the gut.

1938
01:36:40,384 --> 01:36:42,779
- It's extremely fucked up how,

1939
01:36:42,803 --> 01:36:45,073
for my brother
to be able to tell his story

1940
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:46,282
and to come public with it,

1941
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:48,535
it had to go through months of vetting,

1942
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:51,830
and then on the flip side,
you have the Falwells

1943
01:36:51,854 --> 01:36:57,168
<i>who just email someone
that they know at the</i> Washington Examiner <i>,</i>

1944
01:36:57,192 --> 01:37:02,298
<i>and they just basically
copy and paste whatever Jerry said,</i>

1945
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:04,551
<i>and then it gets published that same day.</i>

1946
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:07,929
- They published this,
uh, this bullshit article

1947
01:37:07,953 --> 01:37:10,831
to attempt to discredit my move
of coming forward.

1948
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:12,433
<i>Falwell writes,</i>

1949
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:16,312
<i>"Becki had an inappropriate
personal relationship with this person,</i>

1950
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:18,690
<i>something in which I was not involved."</i>

1951
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:23,945
<i>It deteriorated into, what he describes
as, a fatal attraction type of situation.</i>

1952
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:26,447
<i>The man is Giancarlo Granda,
who worked poolside...</i>

1953
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:27,991
<i>The main takeaway was,</i>

1954
01:37:28,015 --> 01:37:31,018
that motherfucker
just threw his wife under the bus.

1955
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:34,038
- And they were doing everything possible,

1956
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:35,790
everything in their power
to kill that story.

1957
01:37:35,814 --> 01:37:37,625
And they almost did.

1958
01:37:37,649 --> 01:37:39,484
But I was waiting. I was waiting.

1959
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:42,821
And the next day,
you know, the <i>Reuters</i> article comes out.

1960
01:37:57,503 --> 01:37:58,670
<i>And then Becki texted me.</i>

1961
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:03,026
"Jerry just resigned."

1962
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:05,195
<i>This morning, Jerry Falwell Jr.'s time</i>

1963
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:08,305
<i>as president of Liberty University
may be coming to an end.</i>

1964
01:38:08,805 --> 01:38:10,909
<i>Falwell telling</i>
The Wall Street Journal <i>overnight</i>

1965
01:38:10,933 --> 01:38:12,994
<i>he submitted his resignation letter.</i>

1966
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:15,622
<i>"Because I don't want
something my wife did</i>

1967
01:38:15,646 --> 01:38:18,291
<i>to harm the school
I've spent my whole life building."</i>

1968
01:38:18,315 --> 01:38:22,045
<i>Today's news comes
amid allegations that Jerry Falwell Jr.,</i>

1969
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:25,757
<i>while president of one of the nation's
largest Christian universities,</i>

1970
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:29,576
<i>used to watch his wife Becki have sex
with another man.</i>

1971
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,914
- Quickly, the empire starts crumbling,
as it should.

1972
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:38,478
<i>Liberty University is suing
its former president, Jerry Falwell Jr.,</i>

1973
01:38:38,502 --> 01:38:41,105
for upwards of 40 million dollars.

1974
01:38:41,129 --> 01:38:44,275
<i>It alleges he was dishonest
with the Executive Committee</i>

1975
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:46,486
<i>when negotiating
a generous severance package.</i>

1976
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,696
<i>Now, the school claims during that time,</i>

1977
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,243
<i>Falwell Jr. knew a brewing sex scandal
would likely force him out at some point.</i>

1978
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:56,412
- Giancarlo took on
all these people by himself.

1979
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:58,331
That's a fucking lonely place.

1980
01:38:58,355 --> 01:39:00,291
Giancarlo put a stake in his heart.

1981
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:01,483
<i>He just buried it.</i>

1982
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:04,838
- Jerry was, you know,
in the room, laying...

1983
01:39:04,862 --> 01:39:07,447
You know, there's two beds,
he was laying on one bed.

1984
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:10,742
<i>So Jerry texted me
after the article was published,</i>

1985
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,912
and, uh, he wasn't too happy about it.
He texted me...

1986
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:19,185
I mean, he's obviously...
He's kind of fucked at this point.

1987
01:39:19,209 --> 01:39:21,354
- Jerry Falwell, as you know,
has accused you of lying,

1988
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,481
saying that while you did
have an affair with his wife,

1989
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:25,108
he was not involved in any way.

1990
01:39:25,132 --> 01:39:26,109
- Jerry's lying.

1991
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:28,069
Um, that was his game plan
from the beginning,

1992
01:39:28,093 --> 01:39:30,738
to just throw her under the bus,
um, which I...

1993
01:39:30,762 --> 01:39:34,766
- The Falwells are predators,
and they prey upon people.

1994
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:38,079
<i>It's psychologically so abusive.</i>

1995
01:39:38,103 --> 01:39:41,457
<i>Granda also calling
Jerry Falwell Jr. a predator,</i>

1996
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:43,209
<i>alleging Falwell sent him an image</i>

1997
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:47,589
<i>of a Liberty University student
exposing herself at their farm.</i>

1998
01:39:47,613 --> 01:39:49,424
<i>In the middle of the media blitz,</i>

1999
01:39:49,448 --> 01:39:50,949
<i>Politico</i> drops a bombshell.

2000
01:39:51,366 --> 01:39:54,971
<i>And in this article,
one of Trey's bandmates,</i>

2001
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:57,307
<i>he claimed that, uh,
Becki jumped into bed</i>

2002
01:39:57,331 --> 01:39:58,766
<i>while he was sleeping</i>

2003
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:01,627
<i>and she started performing oral sex.</i>

2004
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:04,004
<i>But he didn't really want it.</i>

2005
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:07,317
<i>The Falwells deny the allegation.</i>

2006
01:40:07,341 --> 01:40:09,611
- When he mentioned
that, uh, she was pursuing him,

2007
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:14,157
sending him, uh, like, love songs
and, uh, inspirational quotes,

2008
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:16,409
<i>it just reminded me of my younger self.</i>

2009
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:19,078
<i>I'm like, "Yeah, that's exactly
what she was doing with me."</i>

2010
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:23,565
- Anytime you have sex,
and then lies, and then mix religion,

2011
01:40:25,108 --> 01:40:27,402
I mean, that's some nasty, nasty shit.

2012
01:40:28,862 --> 01:40:33,510
<i>What Granda did
was to make it possible for other students</i>

2013
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:37,764
<i>or other victims
of the Falwells and of the culture</i>

2014
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:39,724
<i>to come forward with their stories.</i>

<i>A new lawsuit says Liberty University
"Enabled on-campus rapes."</i>

2016
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:49,526
- According to over 50
former female students and staffers...

2017
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:53,220
- I was drugged and forcibly raped

2018
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:55,931
by multiple people.

2019
01:40:56,932 --> 01:40:59,452
<i>Heather filed this police report</i>

<i>naming her alleged attackers.</i>

2021
01:41:01,728 --> 01:41:05,315
- My assailants were prayed for
and let go back into society.

2022
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:10,713
<i>They also allege that LU weaponised
its honor code, The Liberty Way.</i>

2023

<i>Jane Doe 6 claims</i>

<i>for drinking alcohol.</i>

2027
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:23,542
- I think 100% the Liberty Way has been
weaponised against women on campus.

2028
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:29,840
<i>I'm very proud of my brother.</i>

2029
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,026
To see these other stories come out,

2030
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,945
I was like, "You did this."

2031
01:41:33,969 --> 01:41:38,348
Like, "You came out, you told your truth,
you went through so much shit,

2032
01:41:39,057 --> 01:41:41,369
but now there's, like,
a light at the end of the tunnel."

2033
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:43,746
Like, "People believe you
because you're telling the truth."

2034
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:47,959
"You put a spotlight on the grossness
that was going on in the school,

2035
01:41:47,983 --> 01:41:49,443
the abuse of power."

2036
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,172
<i>This is who these people really are.</i>

2037
01:41:52,196 --> 01:41:56,950
<i>They're not the good Christians
that they try to portray themselves to be.</i>

2038
01:41:58,035 --> 01:42:00,680
- I am a survivor of... of abuse,

2039
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,289
and I believe Giancarlo is.

2040
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:05,876
<i>Because now we... we think of abuse
in a lot of different ways.</i>

2041
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:11,858
- Coming forward and exposing
your... your... your, uh, private life,

2042
01:42:11,882 --> 01:42:15,302
and everybody knowing your...
your... your business, it's not fun.

2043
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:17,387
<i>But I knew that I did the right thing.</i>

2044
01:42:19,765 --> 01:42:22,202
<i>Jerry,
he has literally been kind of exiled</i>

2045

from the place that he built
and his family's sort of legacy.

2046
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:29,918
<i>You have to remember,
his parents are buried on that campus.</i>

2047
01:42:29,942 --> 01:42:32,837
By banning him,
they have effectively prevented him

2048
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:34,321
from visiting his parents' graves.

<i>"Bottom line, it's an election year

2054

<i>Falwell Jr. didn't make
any more political appearances,</i>

2055

<i>and no more endorsements of Donald Trump.</i>

2056
01:42:59,555 --> 01:43:02,116
- The Fox News decision desk
can now project

2057
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:07,205
that former Vice Present Joe Biden
will win Pennsylvania and Nevada,

2058
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:11,042
putting him over
the 270 electoral votes he needs

2059

to become the 46th president
of the United States.

2060

<i>After the election,</i>

<i>about what had happened in the election
and... and trying to spread doubt.</i>

2064
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:36,025

Donald J. Trump will stand again

01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:05,579
<i>to go to the insurrection rally
on the... the 6th of January.</i>

2074
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:09,666
<i>That money could have come
from Jerry Falwell and Liberty University.</i>

2075
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:18,318
<i>These are people parading around</i>

2076
01:44:18,342 --> 01:44:20,487
<i>with Christian symbolism,</i>

2077
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:24,949
<i>and invoking God, and Jesus, and the Bible</i>

2078
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,994
<i>in the service of sedition.</i>

2079
01:44:28,018 --> 01:44:29,370
- We fight like hell.

2080
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:32,689
And if you don't fight like hell,
you're not gonna have a country anymore.

2081
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:35,084
<i>There was nothing Christian, obviously,</i>

2082
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:37,319
<i>about what happened on January 6th.</i>

2083
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:42,050
<i>There's nothing Christlike
about Trumpism or Christian nationalism.</i>

2084
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:45,678
<i>Thank you, Heavenly Father,
for blessing us with this opportunity.</i>

2085
01:44:45,702 --> 01:44:46,846
<i>We love you and we thank you.</i>

2086
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,348
<i>In Christ's holy name, we pray.</i>

2087
01:44:48,372 --> 01:44:49,974
Amen!

2088
01:44:49,998 --> 01:44:52,477
<i>Christian extremism is just as dangerous,</i>

2089
01:44:52,501 --> 01:44:55,063
<i>or even more dangerous
than Islamic extremism</i>

2090
01:44:55,087 --> 01:44:56,648
<i>for one very big reason:</i>

2091
01:44:56,672 --> 01:44:58,650
<i>Christian extremists live next door to us.</i>

2092
01:44:58,674 --> 01:45:01,802
<i>They sit in the pews next to you,
and they work with you.</i>

2093
01:45:05,347 --> 01:45:06,347
- Help!

2094
01:45:07,015 --> 01:45:09,536
<i>And the attack in the Capitol on 1/6</i>

2095
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:10,995
<i>was Christian jihad.</i>

2096
01:45:11,019 --> 01:45:15,124
- We are gonna have one nation under God,
we have to have one religion under God.

2097
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:16,876
<i>Evangelicalism today</i>

2098
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:20,547
<i>inserts their belief system
into the government of America,</i>

2099
01:45:20,571 --> 01:45:25,552
<i>hoping to change it into a theocracy
ruled by white Christians specifically,</i>

2100
01:45:25,576 --> 01:45:27,286
<i>and men in particular.</i>

2101
01:45:27,911 --> 01:45:31,766
<i>You cannot be a Christian
and vote Democrat in this nation!</i>

2102
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:36,229
They are God-denying demons
that butcher babies and hate this nation!

2103
01:45:36,253 --> 01:45:38,398
<i>The Supreme Court has ruled</i>

2104
01:45:38,422 --> 01:45:41,985
<i>on the future of abortion rights
in the United States.</i>

2105
01:45:42,009 --> 01:45:44,821
<i>The landmark decision
from the United States Supreme Court</i>

2106
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:48,449
<i>which has ended
Constitutional protections for abortion</i>

2107
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:51,077
<i>that had been in place
for nearly 50 years</i>

2108
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:54,497
<i>Evangelicals became
fully radicalized in the goal.</i>

2109
01:45:54,521 --> 01:45:58,376
<i>That was the justification
for the religious right's deal
with Donald Trump.</i>

2110
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,337
<i>He single-handedly shifted
the Court far enough to the right,</i>

2111
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:04,239
<i>it could finally undo
abortion rights in this country.</i>

2112
01:46:04,907 --> 01:46:06,593
<i>In a very real way,</i>

2113
01:46:06,617 --> 01:46:10,221
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. has now
officially completed the work</i>

2114
01:46:10,245 --> 01:46:11,580
<i>that his father began.</i>

2115
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:16,936
<i>The black sheep and the rejected member
of the evangelical community</i>

2116
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,690
<i>actually has delivered to them
in a very tangible way,</i>

2117
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:22,591
<i>the one thing that they most sought.</i>

2118
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:26,237
<i>One of the great glories of this nation,</i>

2119
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:30,283
<i>and I believe America's best idea,
is the First Amendment</i>

2120
01:46:30,307 --> 01:46:32,267
<i>and the separation of church and state.</i>

2121
01:46:35,103 --> 01:46:38,333
<i>This whole so-called
Christian nationalism movement</i>

2122
01:46:38,357 --> 01:46:43,654
<i>that insists that America was
and always has been a Christian nation,</i>

2123
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:46,925
<i>the founders were
very, very clear about that.</i>

2124
01:46:46,949 --> 01:46:49,076
<i>Their intention
was precisely the opposite.</i>

2125
01:46:49,743 --> 01:46:53,681
<i>To protect the nation,
protect the government,</i>

2126
01:46:53,705 --> 01:46:57,543
<i>protect the people
from religious factionalism.</i>

2127
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,963
<i>Go back on that fundamental principle,</i>

2128
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:02,982
<i>to compromise that in some way,</i>

2129
01:47:03,006 --> 01:47:06,051
<i>I think is deeply, deeply perilous.</i>
