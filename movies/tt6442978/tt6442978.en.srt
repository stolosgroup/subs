<i>- Hey, Gypsy, this is Stan.
- Hi, Gypsy.</i>

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,472
<i>- I'll let you guys talk.
- Hi, I'm Det. Hancock.</i>

4
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,246
<i>I'm with Greene County Sheriff's Office.</i>

5
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,910
<i>- How are you today?
- I'm doing good.</i>

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>Good.</i>

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,245
<i>You need to be honest with me.</i>

8
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,547
<i>And if you're involved in anything</i>

9
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,902
<i>that I'm about ready to tell you,
then you need to tell me, okay?</i>

10
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,216
<i>- Absolutely.
- Um, your mom's dead, okay?</i>

11
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,103
<i>Now, what I want to ask you...</i>

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>- Wait, what, what?
- Your mom's passed away, okay?</i>

13
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,233
<i>She's deceased, all right?</i>

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,940
<i>Now, what I want to ask you...</i>

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>Did you have involvement in this?</i>

16
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,574
<i>- Okay.
- No, no...</i>

17
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,901
<i>Hang on, listen to me for
just a second, okay?</i>

18
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,486
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- <i>What happened</i> with your mom that night?

19
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,027
<i>Um...</i>

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,447
<i>I don't know what happened
with my mom at all.</i>

21
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,974
<i>- Help me. Please help me.
- Okay, you...</i>

22
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,918
<i>Just listen to me, okay, sweetheart?</i>

23
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,248
<i>You know what happened to your mom, okay?</i>

24
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>And I know that you know.</i>

25
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,627
<i>You think that it's me?</i>

26
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,473
<i>Why would you think that it's me?</i>

27
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,219
<i>I have always loved my mom.</i>

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,640
<i>My mom and I are best friends.</i>

29
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,218
<i>Listen to me.</i>

30
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,824
<i>Please don't dig yourself in this hole,</i>

31
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,558
<i>and that's what you're doing.</i>

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,310
<i>I really love my mom.</i>

33
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,904
- I know you do.
- Please.

34
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,689
<i>I know you... sweetheart,
I know you love your mom.</i>

35
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,733
<i>I have no doubt that you love your mom.</i>

36
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,123
<i>Now's the time to be truthful, sweetheart.</i>

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,740
<i>No more lies.</i>

38
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,038
<i>- Did you kill your mom?
- No. No, sir.</i>

39
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,753
<i>Did you help Nicholas kill your mom?</i>

<i>Breaking news this morning.</i>

55
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,744
<i>48-year-old Dee Dee Blanchard</i>

56
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,238
<i>was found dead inside her home.</i>

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>Her 19-year-old daughter Gypsy</i>

58
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,242
<i>is still considered missing.</i>

59
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,075
<i>It all started</i>

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,370
<i>receiving a call on June 14th</i>

61
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,044
to check the well-being of a family.

62
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,211
<i>Gypsy and Dee Dee</i>

63
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,424
<i>were Hurricane Katrina survivors.</i>

64
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,376
<i>Everybody believed that
they were coming here</i>

65
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,867
to the Ozarks to make a better life.

66
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,721
<i>There was a Facebook post</i>

67
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,386
<i>that was quite alarming.</i>

68
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,895
<i>We were actually thinking that it was
somebody that hacked into the Facebook</i>

69
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,149
<i>and it wasn't actually a threat.</i>

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,944
<i>Gypsy was in a wheelchair.</i>

71
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,258
She had leukemia and she
was having seizures

72
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,822
and she had to be tube fed.

73
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,158
<i>As the sheriff, my primary responsibility</i>

74
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,294
<i>at that time was really to ensure</i>

75
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,421
that her well-being was okay.

76
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,459
Whatever they were going through
was incredibly hard for them,

77
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,942
especially with the medical conditions.

78
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:20,376
And so, everybody gathered around them

79
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,547
<i>and would try to help them
out as much as possible.</i>

80
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,137
<i>It just proves that happy endings</i>

81
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,643
<i>are not just in fairy tales, they're real.</i>

82
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,362
The Facebook post was quote...

83
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,452
"The bitch is dead."

84
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,119
And another post stating,

85
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,948
"I fucking slashed that fat pig

86
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,954
and raped her sweet, innocent daughter.

87
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:50,536
Her scream was so fucking loud, LOL."

88
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,923
Okay, good morning.

89
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,798
I want to specify at the beginning
of this press conference

90
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,846
that this is an ongoing investigation.

91
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,311
And I want to start off with saying

92
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,813
things are not always as they appear.

93
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,085
<i>The truth is... okay, I'll admit it.</i>

94
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,359
<i>I did actually...</i>

95
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,704
<i>stab her.</i>

96
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>- I will admit it.
- I know, okay.</i>

97
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,491
<i>The only reason I did it is
'cause I did it for me and her.</i>

98
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,536
<i>- I would've never did it if it was not for me and her.
- Okay.</i>

99
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,671
<i>I know that he loves me, and...</i>

100
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,289
<i>he would do anything for me</i>

101
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,296
<i>and... to be with me.</i>

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,168
<i>Did Gypsy know that you were
going to kill her mother?</i>

103
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:47,047
<i>Um... honestly,</i>

104
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,847
<i>she asked me to.</i>

105
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,971
<i>Okay.</i>

106
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,352
<i>Both Facebook postings</i>

107
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,185
<i>were authored by Gypsy.</i>

108
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,526
<i>The prosecutor has filed
charges this morning</i>

109
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,240
<i>for first-degree murder.</i>

110
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,911
This is a tragic, tragic event

111
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,910
surrounded by mystery and public deception.

112
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,076
Gypsy can walk without assistance

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,705
or a wheelchair...

114
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,130
and she can do that very well.

115
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>Okay.</i>

116
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,609
This individual has alleged

117
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,116
to conspire with Nicholas Godejohn

118
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,078
to stab her mother to death

119
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,409
so that they could be together.

120
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,834
The penalty is life imprisonment or death.

121
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,248
<i>Seeing Gypsy Blanchard
walk on her own two feet</i>

122
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,337
<i>in a Wisconsin courtroom was a
shock to friends and neighbors.</i>

123
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,724
<i>Is she sick?</i>

124
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,431
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

125
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,801
<i>We're trying to figure that out.</i>

126
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,808
<i>Can she walk?</i>

127
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,139
<i>Um, yes.</i>

128
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,345
<i>Oh, son of a bitch.</i>

129
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,017
To see her walk...

130
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,436
was really upsetting.

131
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,033
<i>Obviously, if that's a lie,</i>

132
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,783
then who knows what all was a lie.

133
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,036
We really don't know the true
background of this family,

134
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,499
as we have unearthed the appearance

135
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,869
of a long financial fraud scheme.

136
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,876
<i>The family got medical airlifts,</i>

137
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,378
<i>Disney travel, and free
housing over the years</i>

138
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,381
<i>because of Gypsy's supposed disabilities.</i>

139
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,514
<i>It was a facade that translated online,</i>

140
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,071
<i>donations pouring in</i>

141
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,965
<i>for Gypsy's reported muscular dystrophy</i>

142
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,934
<i>and leukemia.</i>

143
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,387
<i>We have not confirmed the age of Gypsy.</i>

144
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,558
It appears that there is
several date of births

145
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,437
that have been used over a period of time.

146
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,154
I almost want to say, "Man,
I can't believe she..."

147
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,906
I even wanted to associate with...
why did I even help them?"

148
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,279
<i>I just never would see
that that little girl</i>

149
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,617
<i>really wasn't who she was supposed to be.</i>

150
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,393
Case exhibit 53.

151
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,023
Can I ask you if you'll
tell me what that is?

152
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,561
<i>Miss Blanchard is charged</i>

153
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,314
<i>with murder in the first degree.</i>

154
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,793
When you commit a first-degree murder,

155
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,027
you knowingly cause the
death of another person

156
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,650
after deliberation.

157
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,606
Analysis of cell phones

158
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,448
provided evidence of numerous text messages

159
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,124
between Gypsy Blanchard
and Nicholas Godejohn.

160
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,536
<i>Nicholas Godejohn was someone</i>

161
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,463
<i>that Gypsy Blanchard met online.</i>

162
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:08,093
They began a online dating relationship.

163
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,671
<i>During the attacks, the two discussed.</i>

164
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,177
<i>Nicholas killing Clauddine.</i>

165
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,413
At the beginning, it looks
like a tabloid case.

166
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,451
It looks like, "Here's some
people in some weird outfits",

167
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,706
and they're pretending to be disabled
and they're scamming everybody.

168
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,644
And then there's this, like,
sort of horrible murder,

169
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,980
and the Facebook status,
'That bitch is dead.'

170
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,924
Like, all of it is very tabloid.

171
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,375
And then, gradually, that story
just sort of fell apart.

172
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,556
<i>Still, it feels to me like it's
developing into something else.</i>

173
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,279
I still ask the question,

174
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,118
"How do you kill your own mother?"

175
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,623
I mean, there's got to be a reason.

176
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,124
There's got to be some abuse there.

177
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,206
You don't just... "I'm
gonna kill my mother

178
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,001
because I wanna be with a boyfriend."

179
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,745
Like I told my mom when I called my mom

180
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,666
and talked to her about it.

181
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,005
I said, "Mama, I've been... you
know, I was mad at you before,

182
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,642
but I've never, ever in a million years

183
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,760
thought about killing you."

184
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,807
I said, "For me to think
about killing you,

185
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,772
you'd have had to done some
pretty bad stuff to me."

186
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,524
Nobody wants to believe that
something like this can happen.

187
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,319
I think the initial reaction is...

188
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,703
Is that, you know, Gypsy's
been lying to everybody.

189
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,871
But when you look at the backstory,

190
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,541
when you look at how we got here,

191
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,620
this all started long before Gypsy

192
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:10,165
would've ever had any type of
say in what was happening.

193
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,304
Right from birth, three months old.

194
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,807
Dee Dee was telling me
that she had sleep apnea

195
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,641
and she needed a breathing machine

196
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,727
or breathing monitor machine,

197
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,274
which, I mean, I... to this day,

198
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,778
I don't know if that was
real or not, you know?

199
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,571
It escalated from then.

200
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,204
<i>Problems with her eyes, her hearing,</i>

201
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,953
<i>her digestive system.</i>

202
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,211
After that, Gypsy couldn't walk anymore.

203
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,500
She had a muscular disorder.

204
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,718
<i>And Dee Dee told me she
would need a wheelchair.</i>

205
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,389
You know, I asked her. I said,
"Man, she's got a lot of issues."

206
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,429
"What's going on?" You know, and, um...

207
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,193
They had done some tests and found
out she had a chromosome disorder

208
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,306
that was causing all of her
functions from developing...

209
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,555
Her digestive system and
her muscular system.

210
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,698
Dee Dee told me she's not going to live

211
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,568
to be, you know, 18 years old.

212
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,366
She may be an old teenager,
that's about it.

213
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,372
You know, I was like, "Really?"

214
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,794
You know, it was shocking,
it was disturbing.

215
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,254
And to see her at 23 years old now,

216
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,165
perfectly healthy...

217
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,554
It pisses me off, you know?

218
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,613
This picture here...

219
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:58,688
I don't know if this was the surgery

220
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,107
where she thought her stomach lining

221
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,946
wrapped around her esophagus.

222
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,991
No, she would've had that earlier.

223
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,405
She had that feeding tube way before then.

224
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,865
You know?

225
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,785
She was 10 here.

226
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,840
<i>This was probably close
to the first year or two</i>

227
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,381
<i>when she was in a wheelchair.</i>

228
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,755
Yep.

229
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,394
Breaks my heart...

230
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,060
knowing she got put through all of this

231
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,718
when she didn't need it.

232
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,809
Fourteen years.

233
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,608
To be confined.

234
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,074
The last 14 years in a wheelchair.

235
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,741
I couldn't imagine.

236
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,196
<i>I've never encountered anything</i>

237
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,287
<i>that is even close to what
Gypsy has gone through.</i>

238
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,342
<i>Her mother appeared to
have taken great steps</i>

239
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,340
<i>to keep Gypsy in a very juvenile role,</i>

240
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:06,844
<i>making her act several years
younger than her actual age.</i>

241
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
It appears that Gypsy was not even aware

242
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,854
of what her actual age was.

243
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,476
<i>I called her for her 18th birthday,</i>

244
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,323
and Dee Dee said, "Don't tell
her she's 18, you know?"

245
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,962
I'm like, "What you mean
don't tell her she's 18?

246
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,276
She knows she's 18. It's
her 18th birthday."

247
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,151
"Yeah, but she don't know she's 18.

248
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,448
She's... you know..."

249
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,031
I thought it was weird, you know?

250
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,576
I... she...

251
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,449
I mean, I always did know that she...

252
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,617
She told me her mental capacity was,

253
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,935
you know, like, five years behind.

254
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,959
When she was, like, 15, she was like,

255
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,303
"Oh, yeah, her learning is coming along,

256
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,168
but she's like, mentally,
at a 9 or 10-year-old."

257
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,637
She looks like she would be 10 and 11,

258
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,179
and she was probably like, 21, 22.

259
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,354
I wonder what she was thinking.

260
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
<i>Hello, everybody! This is Gypsy Rose</i>

261
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,653
<i>reporting from Aurora, Missouri.</i>

262
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,364
<i>I'm about to dive off our porch</i>

263
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,655
<i>into the pile of snow.</i>

264
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,159
<i>You ready?</i>

265
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,704
<i>That was so grand!</i>

266
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,288
<i>Whoo!</i>

267
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,923
<i>All right!</i>

268
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,999
<i>Yooh!</i>

269
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,285
<i>Yeah!</i>

270
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,837
<i>That's so cool. Let's do it again.</i>

271
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,375
<i>It's hard to answer a lot questions</i>

272
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,048
about who Gypsy is, right?

273
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,466
Because she was somebody
else for such a long time.

274
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,675
<i>And now we know her</i>

275
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,766
<i>as almost a completely different person.</i>

276
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,441
- I'm Erin, as you remember.
- I remember.

277
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,862
<i>I would be curious if
anybody Gypsy has talked to</i>

278
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,692
<i>feels they're getting the full story.</i>

279
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:51,068
This is actually kind of the
first time I've been honest

280
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,407
besides being honest, you
know, with my attorneys.

281
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,084
Even then, I haven't been
completely honest with them, so...

282
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,665
How would you describe your mom?

283
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,252
Um...

284
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,216
unique.

285
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,011
Um...

286
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,386
I mean, I used to always think

287
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,892
that maybe she was a little overprotective.

288
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,225
So, if I had to say one word about her,

289
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,231
it would be overprotective.

290
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,404
<i>How old are you?</i>

291
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,855
<i>You're one.</i>

292
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,073
<i>And where's your cranial?</i>

293
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,124
<i>Very good. And where's your phalanges?</i>

294
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,578
<i>Yes. Very, very good.</i>

295
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,540
I really didn't think
any abuse was going on.

296
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,713
Um... it's like when you're abused,

297
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,753
but you've lived that way your whole life.

298
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,457
You don't really know
that you're being abused.

299
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,878
You don't know any different.

300
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,757
Looking at the open ocean now.

301
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,006
And it's beautiful!

302
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,064
<i>I knew that I was different</i>

303
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,064
<i>or my life was different from other kids'.</i>

304
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,607
<i>But people thought of us, as, you know,</i>

305
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,742
the sweetest mother-daughter family ever.

306
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,951
<i>The best two people in the world.</i>

307
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,243
What illnesses did your mom

308
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,748
say that you had?

309
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,370
Um...

310
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,877
asthma, epilepsy, hearing impaired,

311
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,881
vision impaired, fed with a feeding tube,

312
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,135
paralyzed from the waist down.

313
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,679
Um...

314
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,812
slow, so retardation.

315
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,351
And... among other things,

316
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,354
I just can't remember them.

317
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,198
<i>I was on breathing medication.</i>

318
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,077
<i>Medication for seizures.</i>

319
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,496
<i>Medication to help go to the bathroom.</i>

320
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>Pain medication, anxiety medication.</i>

321
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,221
Just everything.

322
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,682
<i>I would have to put on the
breathing machine every night.</i>

323
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,845
I hated it, though,
because it seemed to make

324
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,694
my breathing worse, not better.

325
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,147
<i>And then another machine
was for the feeding tube.</i>

326
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,864
It was controlling what I'd eat.

327
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:39,276
My medications would be put through there.

328
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,447
<i>I really wouldn't even have to be awake.</i>

329
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,286
<i>So, she could put whatever in my body,</i>

330
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,042
<i>and I wouldn't even know.</i>

331
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,840
<i>Hey, you make me wanna yawn.</i>

332
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,840
<i>So, where are you going today?</i>

333
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,346
I'm going to Children's Mercy Hospital

334
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,270
to see my dentist.

335
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,059
For my teeth.

336
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,475
<i>And we'll be back.</i>

337
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,982
And we'll be back soon.

338
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,614
Not yet.

339
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,874
<i>If we'd be going to the doctor,</i>

340
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,254
<i>she would do all the talking.</i>

341
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,082
<i>I'd always have a stuffed animal</i>

342
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,997
<i>or a Barbie doll.</i>

343
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,166
<i>She'd just tell me just
play with my Barbie doll.</i>

344
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,473
<i>And if the doctor would
come to examine me...</i>

345
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,302
"Just stay in the wheelchair,"

346
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,927
be calm, play with your doll,

347
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,885
<i>and don't move your legs."</i>

348
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,950
<i>I was just as much in the
dark as everybody else.</i>

349
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,491
<i>The only thing I knew is that I could walk.</i>

350
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,035
<i>As for everything else,</i>

351
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,998
you had the leukemia and the epilepsy.

352
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,370
I was taking medication

353
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,496
that she said was cancer medicine.

354
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,293
<i>She would shave my head and say,</i>

355
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,957
<i>"Well, it's going to fall out anyway,</i>

356
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,255
<i>so let's just keep it nice and neat."</i>

357
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,390
I just went on blind faith
that a mother knows best.

358
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:35,226
You're supposed to love and
protect your children.

359
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,436
How could you do this to your child?

360
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,657
<i>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</i>

361
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,778
was as consistently.

362
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,405
And viciously subjected to,

363
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,599
in my opinion, Munchausen by proxy

364
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,623
as anyone I've come across.

365
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,547
<i>Munchausen by proxy involves a caregiver</i>

366
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:59,216
<i>who either feigns or actually
induces illness in her children.</i>

367
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,008
And her goal is some kind of
emotional gratification...

368
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:07,354
<i>Looking for sympathy, attention, care,</i>

369
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:11,272
<i>concern that she feels unable
to get in any other way.</i>

370
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:15,862
<i>It is a form of child
abuse, first and foremost.</i>

371
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,030
<i>The earliest surgery that I can remember</i>

372
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,699
<i>probably would be</i>

373
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,858
<i>having my feeding tube put in.</i>

374
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,695
<i>You have to have it constantly changed,</i>

375
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,535
<i>like every six months.</i>

376
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,080
And that would be pretty painful,

377
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,214
because they don't put
you under anesthesia,

378
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,541
they just take you in the emergency room,

379
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,206
rip the old one out, and put a new one in.

380
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,876
I don't know why these procedures were done

381
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:46,256
or how her mother was able
to convince the doctors.

382
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,805
"Mindboggling" is the only way

383
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,269
I can put her ability to manipulate people.

384
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,494
Basically, each one of these paperclips

385
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,793
is some medical record

386
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,159
where Dee Dee essentially lied

387
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,117
to the doctor about something.

388
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,038
Mentally, Gypsy is behind.

389
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,522
She's at the level of a seven-year-old

390
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,206
on mother's information.

391
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,206
And this is something that you see

392
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,718
almost across all of the records,

393
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:29,261
is "Upon mother's information,"
"Upon history by mother."

394
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,217
So she's talking to the doctor
here and she's talking about

395
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,978
how she has mental and developmental
delays, needs assistance.

396
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,232
Apparently, "while holding her
hands over Gypsy's ears,

397
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,355
so as not offend, history
of mental retardation...

398
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,573
seven-year-old level, per mom."

399
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:49,454
And so, this was the one time where
a doctor actually put in the record

400
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,664
that Dee Dee's got her
hands over Gypsy's ears,

401
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,285
so Gypsy can't even hear what
Mom is telling the doctor.

402
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,294
Then we get into the family history.

403
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,126
The family history changed

404
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,011
depending on what doctor she was at.

405
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,049
You'll notice here, we don't
get a whole lot of...

406
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,447
- She's at the cardiologist.
- Right, she's at the cardiologist,

407
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,601
and so they all died of a heart attack.

408
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,978
Now, this was the first one
that jumped out at me.

409
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,854
<i>She ends up going to the neurologist,</i>

410
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,188
<i>Dr. Flasterstein, and so...</i>

411
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,945
the very first thing right off the bat...
"Mother is not a good historian,"

412
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:30,908
<i>which is interesting, because he
puts that in bold and underlines it.</i>

413
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,372
<i>One of the things that
was a big discrepancy</i>

414
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,372
was that for a person that has not walked

415
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,865
for nine years, for years,

416
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,168
she should have, technically,

417
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,462
almost no muscles in her lower extremities.

418
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:49,007
<i>But she did have muscles
that looked quite normal.</i>

419
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,603
<i>And she was able to
support her body weight.</i>

420
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,099
<i>I remember her standing.</i>

421
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,312
So, I had a big doubt about the
whole thing, from the beginning.

422
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,403
<i>He says, "Since last seen,</i>

423
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,519
<i>I managed to talk to one
of her previous providers.</i>

424
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:07,318
<i>She specifically remembers Gypsy Rose and
mentioned that her previous neurologist</i>

425
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:12,243
<i>clearly reported the fact that Gypsy
does not have muscular dystrophy.</i>

426
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,325
Analyzing all the facts, and after
talking to her previous pediatrician,

427
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,621
- there's a strong possibility of Munchausen by proxy...
- What?

428
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,626
...with maybe some underlying, unknown
ideology to explain her symptoms."

429
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:32,552
Once in a while, we report
patients to Social Services.

430
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,267
We do that when we feel
that there's a neglect.

431
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,389
But a neglect is different
from what this mom was doing.

432
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,147
She wasn't really neglecting her,

433
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,229
she was overtreating her.

434
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,395
<i>We have a system,</i>

435
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,404
<i>which is a big integrated system,</i>

436
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,196
<i>that decided to adopt her
and bring her, support her.</i>

437
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,121
<i>So many people looking at her,</i>

438
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,201
knowing the history, knowing
what she was going through,

439
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,537
knowing what she went through,

440
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,043
I would have been rejected on the spot.

441
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,535
So all that I could do was
put that in my notes.

442
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,708
<i>Nobody in the system ever
said anything about it,</i>

443
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,378
and I didn't see it right to keep going

444
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:16,007
in convincing other people that
something is not right here.

445
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,307
- Now...
- Un-freakin'-believable.

446
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,191
...here's the interesting thing.

447
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,809
This is the last record

448
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,396
from Mercy, here in
Springfield, until 2015.

449
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,943
So, this is 2007.

450
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,816
Eight years.

451
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:35,243
What I couldn't figure out
was how Dee Dee figured out

452
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,954
that Dr. Flasterstein was on to her.

453
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,495
But if you look at a lot
these social work notes,

454
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,169
Dee Dee's requesting medical records.

455
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,710
She would have gotten a
copy of this letter.

456
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,134
But I still don't understand

457
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:54,684
why you put your child through this.

458
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,887
I don't know. I mean, the thing is...

459
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,603
- Good question.
- ...It just keeps going.

460
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,484
And it would have kept going

461
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:10,231
'cause her mama was an
insane, compulsive liar.

462
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,462
<i>Dee Dee and I met at the
bowling alley one night.</i>

463
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,129
<i>Met up again a couple of weeks later.</i>

464
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,798
<i>And then we started dating then.</i>

465
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,919
She got pregnant.

466
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,795
She got pregnant and...

467
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,683
being from the South, I guess, it was...

468
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,391
I was raised where you got a girl pregnant,

469
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,022
then you got married.

470
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,388
There was no other question
about what you did.

471
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,016
<i>I was 17.</i>

472
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,815
<i>I woke up on my 18th birthday</i>

473
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,400
and I'm like, "What am I doing here?"

474
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,236
<i>She was kind of into some dark...</i>

475
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,953
<i>Darkness... dark things.</i>

476
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,873
Uh...

477
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,848
she started talking a little
bit about witchcrafts

478
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:07,582
and just different weird,
dark stuff like that.

479
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,536
It was kind of weird.

480
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,207
She had a pet tarantula.

481
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,643
Dee Dee was my aunt.

482
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:25,851
Um, real... weird girl.

483
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:29,185
I would think she's bipolar, no doubt.

484
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,771
Multiple personalities, perhaps.

485
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,069
Definitely...

486
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,113
an evil person, I would say, you know?

487
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,924
To shave your kid's head and
say that she's got leukemia?

488
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,959
You're a sick individual.

489
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,877
<i>At this time, we'd like to present to you.</i>

490
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,836
<i>South Lafourche ROTC Military Queen,</i>

491
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,887
<i>Ms. Clauddinea Pitre.</i>

492
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,681
<i>Her escort... Sergeant Earl Longden.</i>

493
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,312
<i>Clauddine "Dee Dee" Pitre...</i>

494
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,292
What was Dee Dee like as a child?

495
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,751
What, baby?

496
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,961
What was Dee Dee like as a child?

497
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,461
- What was Dee Dee like as a child?
- Dee Dee?

498
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,375
She was okay.

499
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,674
We were pretty close, me and her.

500
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,337
Yeah, I would give her everything
that she wanted anyway.

501
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,508
Whatever she wanted.

502
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,137
Except a dog in the house.
I didn't want that.

503
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,144
Now we wind up... we got
two dogs in the house.

504
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:56,015
Ahem, but this... She was something else.

505
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,873
<i>She was a very filthy person.</i>

506
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,868
If it didn't go her way,

507
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,830
she'd see to it that you would pay.

508
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,501
And did we pay.

509
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,620
Paid a lot.

510
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,627
She opened credit cards in my dad's name,

511
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,049
my grandpa's name, ran up crazy bills.

512
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,049
Supposedly, America's Most Wanted
was looking for this girl.

513
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,978
Slidell... she was wanted.

514
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,730
Bad checks in New Orleans.

515
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,648
<i>No matter where she went,</i>

516
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,071
<i>she was doing all kind of stuff.</i>

517
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,650
She was poisoning my stepmother.

518
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,986
Supposedly, she was giving her some...

519
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,333
Roundup in her food and stuff.

520
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,159
She was putting some poison in my food.

521
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,456
The same thing she had put in the plant.

522
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,750
And she wind up... she stayed
nine months in bed after that.

523
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,174
She couldn't get up.

524
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,213
I didn't think she was going to make it.

525
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,416
There was nothing she
couldn't get away with.

526
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,643
<i>Her mama was a little bit like her.</i>

527
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,392
<i>Yeah, her mama, too.</i>

528
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:16,765
<i>Her mama was a shoplifter
and all kind of stuff.</i>

529
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,185
I don't know how many times
she had to go to court

530
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,815
for shoplifting and other things.

531
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,911
She had stolen how much
money from your daddy?

532
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,912
Before he got married, she had stolen

533
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,745
I think it's $3,000 or
$4,000 from my daddy.

534
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,588
<i>I think ever since my grandmother died,</i>

535
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,999
<i>Dee Dee kind of went off the deep end.</i>

536
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,553
The day that her mom died,

537
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,513
Dee Dee was in the house somewhere,

538
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,854
and Dee Dee was starving her.

539
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,140
Like, she wasn't... Dee Dee wasn't
giving her anything to eat.

540
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,020
I asked her sister...

541
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,624
You know, I was like, "I hate to ask this,

542
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,318
but you think Dee Dee had anything to do

543
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,729
with her mom's death?"

544
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,948
And she, you know, said,

545
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,660
"Now I wonder."

546
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,873
<i>That's how evil she was.</i>

547
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,245
To leave your mama dirty
and asking for food

548
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,003
and not want to feed her...

549
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,634
- Yeah.
- ...That's evil.

550
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,131
Were you sad at all when
you heard she was dead?

551
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,008
Me?

552
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:34,056
I didn't believe it.

553
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,731
- It didn't...
- It just didn't sink.

554
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,770
It took a few days before... you know?

555
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,935
I didn't believe that she was dead.

556
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,775
I thought it was another one of her tricks.

557
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,202
I said, "Who did Dee Dee piss off now?"

558
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,241
You know, what kind of shit
did Dee Dee get into?"

559
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,576
I wasn't thinking, "Oh,
God, my aunt's dead."

560
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,962
Because I figured that one
day she'd piss off somebody

561
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,039
to that point, you know?

562
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,504
And I actually did think that it
would probably be Gypsy, you know?

563
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,506
And whenever... We later got the word

564
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,090
that Gypsy was fine and she
was by her boyfriend's house,

565
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,114
we were like, "She killed her mama.
She finally did it.

566
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,428
She couldn't take it anymore.

567
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,867
She finally just said, "Fuck it all."

568
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,641
I'm killing this bitch."

569
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,104
Do you think she got what she deserved?

570
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,766
- According to Gypsy, yes.
- Yes.

571
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,855
Yeah, she got what she deserved.

572
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,242
I know all the brothers
and sisters don't care

573
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,450
about Dee Dee no more.

574
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,371
Gypsy... she got cremated.

575
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,450
She said, "What you want
me to do with the ashes?"

576
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,696
Everybody said, "I don't want her.
I don't want her."

577
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,918
- Darla said, "Flush 'em."
- I told her, "Flush that in the toilet."

578
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,379
I didn't want it.

579
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,920
Her sister said, "Flush
that in the toilet."

580
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,026
She said, "We're going to
bring that in Mama's room,

581
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,590
make her a mass and everything."

582
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,215
"You going to pay for it?
I'm not paying for it.

583
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,432
We can't afford it. Flush
it in the toilet."

584
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,790
<i>Prosecutors have decided not
to seek the death penalty</i>

585
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,002
<i>against a Springfield
woman and her boyfriend,</i>

586
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,462
<i>both of whom are accused of
murdering the woman's mother.</i>

587
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,884
<i>The announcement comes after
several conversations</i>

588
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,803
<i>between the defense and prosecution,</i>

589
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,472
<i>both agreeing this was the best decision.</i>

590
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,719
<i>Being a prosecutor,</i>

591
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,814
<i>the standard is to do what's right</i>

592
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,140
<i>and what's just.</i>

593
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,436
When you look at the mitigators

594
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,229
as well as the background of
these individuals as we know it,

595
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,114
as well as the facts of the case,

596
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,071
this case was not an appropriate
first-degree murder case

597
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,822
in which to seek the death penalty.

598
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,664
This is a case that we haven't dealt with,

599
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,831
and it's because it's so unusual.

600
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,951
I mean, it really is an unusual case.

601
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,041
<i>What we thought initially may be a victim</i>

602
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,745
<i>turns out to be a suspect,</i>

603
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,045
<i>and in the middle of a
story that is twisted.</i>

604
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,920
<i>We think we know who Gypsy is,</i>

605
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,888
<i>but once this trial starts,</i>

606
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,849
we'll be able to see her life unfold

607
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,100
and find out exactly
what she was all about.

608
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,773
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

609
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,476
<i>Right now, I'm in Cinderella's castle</i>

610
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,987
<i>eating some real mashed potatoes.</i>

611
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,861
<i>Mm!</i>

612
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,318
<i>That is good.</i>

613
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,915
<i>Gypsy loved Disney</i>

614
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,748
<i>because they were stories that resolved</i>

615
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,625
<i>in happy ways.</i>

616
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,221
And ultimately, her story was
not resolving in a happy way.

617
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,513
<i>I liked the Disney movie "Tangled."</i>

618
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,215
It's about Rapunzel.

619
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,096
<i>She's a princess in this kingdom</i>

620
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:09,555
and she's kidnapped by Mother Gothel

621
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,898
<i>from her real family.</i>

622
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,994
<i>And Mother Gothel keeps her</i>

623
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,740
<i>in this tower for all of her life</i>

624
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,163
<i>and tells her, "Don't leave this tower."</i>

625
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:24,082
And so, that is all she knows.

626
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,212
<i>I think that Gypsy just wanted her life</i>

627
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,170
<i>to be like any fairy tale princess</i>

628
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,501
<i>and have the perfect ending.</i>

629
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:35,418
You know, all the bad villains
get what they deserve.

630
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,179
<i>At the end, Mother Gothel died.</i>

631
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,432
<i>She got thrown out a window,</i>

632
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:47,064
um, because Rapunzel tried
to stand up for herself

633
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,194
and leave her tower.

634
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,691
But in Disney movies,
everything's a fantasy.

635
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,193
It's a fairy tale,

636
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,855
and life is not a fairy tale.

637
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,454
I learned all that the hard way.

638
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,304
<i>I don't think calling
Gypsy's life sheltered</i>

639
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,538
<i>would do it justice.</i>

640
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,871
I've kind of come to describe it

641
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,956
as a fairy tale nightmare.

642
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,514
<i>Her mother controlled almost
every aspect of her life.</i>

643
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,177
<i>The control was total</i>

644
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,759
in the same sense that the
control of a kidnapped victim

645
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,266
sometimes is total.

646
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,850
<i>Her daughter was, in essence, a hostage,</i>

647
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,686
<i>and I think we can understand the crime</i>

648
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,612
<i>that occurred subsequently</i>

649
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,030
in terms of a hostage
trying to gain escape.

650
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,873
<i>Any time Gypsy and I were together,</i>

651
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,580
<i>her mom was always present.</i>

652
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,121
She was immediately like a
filter for us, you know.

653
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,205
Like, Gypsy wouldn't talk
about anything personal

654
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,581
while we were together.

655
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,208
That's like, really, the big red flag,

656
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,295
thinking back on it all now.

657
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,262
Dee Dee would always hold
Gypsy's hand, you know?

658
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,974
It was like, I don't know... it
was almost like, you know, just,

659
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,135
"If I squeeze it, you'll know what to say."

660
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,354
I mean, that was just so strange to me.

661
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,104
Just to feel it now, I think
that was really strange.

662
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,307
<i>Even in videos I've seen since then,</i>

663
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:15,835
<i>I'm like, "Yep, it's just the same thing."</i>

664
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,029
<i>It's like she's holding her hand.</i>

665
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:25,275
I mean, now I'm... It was
maybe a control thing.

666
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:29,157
<i>The hand-holding and the tight hugs</i>

667
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,956
<i>is a way of asserting
mastery over another person</i>

668
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,630
and saying, "You're not free."

669
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,250
You are under my control at all times,

670
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,967
even in relatively benign situations

671
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,878
<i>like our being photographed</i>

672
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,177
<i>getting the Habitat for Humanity home.</i>

673
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,061
<i>You know, those are
innocuously happy occasions,</i>

674
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,389
but they were also occasions where Dee Dee

675
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,734
reasserted her mastery over Gypsy.

676
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,481
<i>My mom had cake...</i>

677
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,193
<i>If we were in a group of friends,</i>

678
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,379
you know, if I said something
that I wasn't supposed to,

679
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,613
she'd squeeze my hand,
and I'd know, "Zip it."

680
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,035
<i>I was just afraid, just too afraid.</i>

681
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,705
<i>I have a strong feeling</i>

682
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,880
<i>that the extent of the control over her,</i>

683
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,380
<i>heavily psychological as it was,</i>

684
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,133
would've involved physical
punishment as well.

685
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,085
She'd hit me with a coat hanger...

686
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,764
or her... or her palm.

687
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,434
And I'd have to take so many slaps

688
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,806
for... depending on what,

689
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,524
how severe it was, I did.

690
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,315
- Did you ever try to hit back?
- Never.

691
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,319
Never.

692
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,151
It's like if you have a baby

693
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,776
and you, like, get in its face

694
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,453
and the baby starts to struggle
and get away from you.

695
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,582
Now picture that happening
for your whole life, right?

696
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,750
Your mother is just in your
face and will not get away.

697
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,291
That's basically what Gypsy's
whole life was like.

698
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,046
<i>It's snowing.</i>

699
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,168
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

700
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,045
<i>They said it's snowing,</i>

701
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,802
<i>so I'm staying under my heating blankie.</i>

702
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:12,266
<i>And I'm not getting out, mm-mm.</i>

703
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,637
<i>She wants to get out.</i>

704
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,057
<i>Ain't gonna happen.</i>

705
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,476
<i>Let her doll take care of her.</i>

706
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,315
<i>Oh!</i>

707
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,408
Her mother was so suffocating,

708
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:37,285
so powerful, so manipulative

709
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:41,174
<i>that Gypsy may have felt
any efforts to escape</i>

710
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,553
<i>were bound to fail.</i>

711
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,125
The first time I ran away from home,

712
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,506
I had met a friend.

713
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:52,683
<i>We both went to this sci-fi fantasy
convention called Visioncon.</i>

714
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,725
I told him vaguely

715
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,310
about what was going on at home.

716
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:03,266
And he told me, you know,
"You just pack your stuff

717
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,238
and you can come live
with me in Arkansas."

718
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,030
And I said, "Okay."

719
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,124
<i>I stepped out, got a ride from a stranger,</i>

720
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,334
<i>and went over to his place.</i>

721
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,995
And then within, like, four hours,
my mom found me at his place

722
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,495
because we had mutual friends in common.

723
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:27,668
So she was threatening
to call the cops on him.

724
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,587
And she took me back home

725
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,006
and smashed my computer with a hammer,

726
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,825
smashed my cell phone
with a hammer and said,

727
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,059
"If you ever try to do that again,

728
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,231
I'm going to smash your
fingers with a hammer."

729
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,651
<i>It was a rough year.</i>

730
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,899
<i>I call that "the bad times."</i>

731
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,152
She had taken this dog leash

732
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,856
and clipped it to a pair of handcuffs,

733
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,367
and clipped the handcuffs to the bed

734
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,660
and kept... it was like
that for about two weeks.

735
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,996
My mom had actually convinced a lawyer

736
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,542
to draw up some papers saying
that I was incompetent.

737
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,628
So I thought if I had tried
to go to the police,

738
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:11,384
they'd look at these papers
and say, "She's retarded.

739
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,098
She doesn't know what she's talking about."

740
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,889
Gypsy has essentially fallen

741
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,562
through every crack there is in the system.

742
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,352
The Greene County sheriff's deputies

743
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,395
came out to the house
on an anonymous report

744
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,110
that Gypsy was potentially being abused.

745
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,401
And they came to the house,
they spoke with Dee Dee,

746
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:33,316
and Dee Dee did exactly what
she does all the time...

747
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,736
She manipulated the police officers,

748
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,825
showed them a few things, and they left.

749
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,292
And at that point,

750
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:44,002
Gypsy has absolutely nowhere else to turn.

751
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,384
Literally everyone failed her.

752
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,050
Literally.

753
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,418
<i>The doctors who were positioned</i>

754
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:53,296
as there to help her didn't help her.

755
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,085
<i>Her father,</i>

756
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,508
<i>who I think was in a
very difficult position,</i>

757
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,928
<i>couldn't help her.</i>

758
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,441
How was she supposed to
think anybody could?

759
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,334
I was just kind of at that
point where you're like,

760
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,858
"I'm angry at the world
and this is unfair."

761
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:15,454
Why couldn't anybody figure this
out before it got this bad?

762
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:25,325
<i>Gypsy. Over here, baby.</i>

763
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:29,457
We all kind of did see how Gypsy
was being treated by Dee Dee,

764
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,336
not that it was like horrible,
beating the shit out of her

765
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,835
in the back room with a
freaking cable, you know?

766
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,057
She would just... she put her
in a wheelchair and told her,

767
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,019
"Your leg's messed up. You can't walk."

768
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,319
Her sister told me once, "Rod, you know,

769
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
Gypsy can walk."

770
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,283
And I asked Dee Dee about it.

771
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,781
She's like, "Yeah, well,
with her muscular dystrophy

772
00:42:56,825 --> 00:43:00,945
or with her disease, her
muscles hurt sometimes.

773
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,826
So sometimes she can walk
when she's feeling okay,

774
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,583
but it's progressive.

775
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,415
It's going to get worse."

776
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,340
And it wasn't long after
that that they were...

777
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,841
They started moving
further and further away.

778
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,763
And there was nobody there to question...

779
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,473
Question that anymore, you know?

780
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:23,734
After all of the doors had been closed...

781
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,688
Family, friends, the police...

782
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,520
I think that Gypsy felt she had no other...

783
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,767
No other avenue.

784
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:41,239
<i>I met Nick through a
Christian dating website.</i>

785
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,446
<i>He was one of the profiles that I had saw.</i>

786
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,576
<i>Thought he was cute, so I checked
him out, sent him a wink.</i>

787
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,584
<i>He sent me one back.</i>

788
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,601
<i>Once you met on there, what happened?</i>

789
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,431
<i>We got closer on there,</i>

790
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:10,228
<i>and we connected more and more.</i>

791
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,855
<i>The way that we clicked,</i>

792
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,616
<i>we somehow just knew we
were right for each other.</i>

793
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,619
<i>Four days later, we started
a relationship together.</i>

794
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:41,223
<i>Gypsy had no template for romance</i>

795
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:45,772
<i>that wasn't this sort of heightened
Prince Charming narrative.</i>

796
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,523
And Nick just happened to be there.

797
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,523
<i>His background equipped him</i>

798
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,226
<i>with a bad narrative in different ways.</i>

799
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,026
So, it was like two bad narratives

800
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,610
collided with each other.

801
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:01,445
<i>What kind of person... If
somebody never met him,</i>

802
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,951
<i>what kind of person is Nick?</i>

803
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,122
<i>He's pretty quiet, kept
to himself, you know.</i>

804
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,502
<i>We always tell him he's got to
get out and mingle, you know.</i>

805
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,671
<i>- Sure.
- But he's like, "I'm afraid of getting backstabbed,</i>

806
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,420
<i>because everybody backstabs
you," and all that stuff.</i>

807
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,513
<i>He has autism, you know, Asperger's.</i>

808
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,630
<i>Has he been diagnosed with
autism and Asperger's?</i>

809
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,088
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

810
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,888
<i>Last doctor he talked to,</i>

811
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,641
<i>they said his mind is probably
always going to be 15, 16,</i>

812
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,524
<i>right around there.</i>

813
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,811
At first, it was all
lighthearted, you know.

814
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,305
"If you got married,

815
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,042
where would you like to
have your honeymoon?"

816
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,976
You know, "Where would
you like to get married?"

817
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,826
Where are all the places
you want to travel?"

818
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,282
Different things like that, normal stuff.

819
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,282
And as it progressed, things got weird.

820
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,754
He started talking about
something called BDSM.

821
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,099
<i>And at first, I didn't know what it was,</i>

822
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,219
<i>so I looked it up.</i>

823
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,346
And once I looked it up, I was
like, "I don't want to do this."

824
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,694
And then he kind of just talked me into it

825
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,731
and was like, "It'll be fine," you know?

826
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,395
"Try this with me."

827
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,744
And so, I agreed to it.

828
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:29,288
<i>I was taught that a woman's
role is to be submissive</i>

829
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,039
<i>and the man is dominant,</i>

830
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,580
<i>so I didn't think it was that outlandish.</i>

831
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:40,837
<i>Then his ex had messaged me.</i>

832
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:45,092
She told me, you know,
he's a really bad guy.

833
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,386
He thinks he's a vampire

834
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,060
and he's into all this
dominant/submissive stuff.

835
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,140
And I was thinking, it's just an ex.

836
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,556
You know, she's just badmouthing him.

837
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:59,225
She doesn't know anything. She's
jealous, blah, blah, blah.

838
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,775
She was right.

839
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,068
<i>Godejohn also has a criminal past.</i>

840
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,862
<i>In 2013 he was arrested
after investigators say</i>

841
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,617
<i>he was watching pornography
and fondling himself</i>

842
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,240
<i>in a McDonald's restaurant for nine hours,</i>

843
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,407
<i>police finding a large
knife during the arrest.</i>

844
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,457
I really don't know what's wrong with him,

845
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,422
but, I mean, it's not like I
ever had a boyfriend before,

846
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,514
so I really didn't know what
was a normal relationship.

847
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:28,012
<i>How don't know how much she
told you about me, but...</i>

848
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,221
<i>Have you been diagnosed with that?</i>

849
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,847
<i>I probably should be diagnosed with it</i>

850
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,773
<i>because it... it happens...</i>

851
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,482
<i>The thing is, I used to take a medication.</i>

852
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,943
<i>I used to hear voices in my head.
Then it went away.</i>

853
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,574
<i>And then somehow it's a part of myself.</i>

854
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,281
<i>Okay. Does Gypsy know that?</i>

855
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,952
<i>- Yes. She does know that.
- Okay.</i>

856
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:51,992
His multiple personalities would come out,

857
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,616
and he had talked to me one day

858
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,035
and he was just like,
"You know, I would like

859
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,384
my other personalities
to have a girlfriend."

860
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,711
So I made up some individual personalities

861
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,677
to match his other personalities.

862
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,645
<i>One side of her is named Kitty.</i>

863
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,691
<i>It's like a little girl inside of her.</i>

864
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,862
<i>We had another one called Candy.</i>

865
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,119
<i>She has an evil side of herself as well.</i>

866
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,703
<i>She used to call her Ruby.</i>

867
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,875
<i>It was deaf, dumb, blind love.</i>

868
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,593
And sometimes, it's a big crazy love.

869
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:51,144
<i>One of the most interesting
things about this case</i>

870
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,299
<i>is that no matter how much control</i>

871
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,218
<i>you have over an individual,</i>

872
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,556
<i>you can't stop adolescent
sexuality from blossoming.</i>

873
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,357
<i>Her whole life,</i>

874
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,518
this had been a subject
that was forbidden to her,

875
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,938
and, ultimately,

876
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,107
that turned into a really
destructive force.

877
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,463
<i>Probably about a year
into our relationship,</i>

878
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,170
<i>I just couldn't lie to him anymore.</i>

879
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,751
And I just told him everything.

880
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,338
<i>Why did nobody know she could walk?</i>

881
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,554
<i>Her mom wanted everyone to think</i>

882
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,925
<i>that she was, like, 16 the entire time.</i>

883
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:39,892
<i>So, yeah, she felt kind of
trapped on a wheelchair</i>

884
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,556
<i>when I actually was trying to encourage her</i>

885
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,285
<i>to be able to walk more and more and more.</i>

886
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,738
<i>It really didn't come up, like,
"I want you to kill her."</i>

887
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,121
But he had said, "I'll
protect you from anybody."

888
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,240
And I said, "Anybody?"

889
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,117
And he said, "Yeah."

890
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,924
And I said, "Even my mom?"

891
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,629
And he said, "Yeah."

892
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,129
And that's where it kind of
developed from there on.

893
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,256
<i>We'd call it "plan B."</i>

894
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,511
<i>But we always pushed it back.</i>

895
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,175
<i>You know, it was just a thought.</i>

896
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,643
<i>It was never reality.</i>

897
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,309
<i>We'll consider other options.</i>

898
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:30,738
<i>We had planned a meeting
at a movie theater.</i>

899
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,068
I and my mom was going
to go see "Cinderella,"

900
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,494
the live-action version of "Cinderella,"

901
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,793
and I was like, "This is a
perfect time for us to meet.

902
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,869
<i>I'll buy your ticket, and you
come to the movie theater.</i>

903
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,285
<i>We'll meet like we're just
meeting as new friends,</i>

904
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,495
<i>and it's going to be perfect."</i>

905
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,757
<i>She wanted to have sex with me, so I did.</i>

906
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,419
<i>Okay, she wanted to have sex with you?</i>

907
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,758
<i>- Yes.
- Wow, did her mom know?</i>

908
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,263
<i>Um, we kept it from her mom.</i>

909
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:01,346
<i>Okay. Where did you have
sex at in the theater?</i>

910
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,772
<i>- It was in the bathroom.
- Okay.</i>

911
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,890
<i>In the girls' bathroom or boys' bathroom?</i>

912
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,647
<i>She just took me in the boys' bathroom.
I didn't have any choice.</i>

913
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,835
<i>We went right into the boys' bathroom.
She was okay with it.</i>

914
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:11,899
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

915
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,423
<i>And then what happened after you
guys had sex in the theater?</i>

916
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:18,987
<i>We went to our movie and watched it.</i>

917
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,985
<i>They're all looking at you.</i>

918
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,118
<i>Believe me,</i>

919
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,165
<i>they are all looking at you.</i>

920
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,628
<i>I don't know what it was, but, apparently,</i>

921
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,960
<i>the night got ruined in some way.</i>

922
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,916
<i>I couldn't... I was trying to understand</i>

923
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,837
<i>what was going on with her mom.</i>

924
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,466
She despised him.

925
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:42,264
She was like, "He's creepy. He's weird."

926
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,308
He's coming to see a kids'
movie alone by himself."

927
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,193
<i>And now looking back on
it, yeah, it is weird.</i>

928
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,311
<i>We were the only people at the movies,</i>

929
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,108
and he didn't have a kid with him

930
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,322
or a girlfriend or nothing.

931
00:51:55,363 --> 00:52:00,243
He's just this guy going
to see this chick movie.

932
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,845
Couldn't you have said
that you have a friend

933
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,489
and you want to introduce them?

934
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:06,368
I wouldn't have had no way
to meet him, you know?

935
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,825
I can't say I met him online or...

936
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,037
She's... she was all the time with me,

937
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:15,628
so there would be no
other time to meet him.

938
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:22,428
Once all of those plans
seemed to fall apart,

939
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,273
I just got desperate.

940
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,082
<i>He took a Greyhound bus.</i>

941
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,416
<i>I managed to scrape up enough money</i>

942
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,461
<i>to pay for him a ticket.</i>

943
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,802
<i>And the next day, we went
to the grocery store,</i>

944
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,385
<i>came back home.</i>

945
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,511
She went to sleep very, very late,

946
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,978
and I was up texting Nick.

947
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,832
We painted each other's nails.

948
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:35,165
And I acted like everything was fine.

949
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,468
We had just recently got into an argument,

950
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,261
and we had made up.

951
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,966
And I said I was going to be a good girl.

952
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:52,895
And then she went to sleep

953
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,019
because I hurt her feelings or something.

954
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,857
She said, "I'm starting
to feel more relaxed.

955
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,704
Don't hurt me."

956
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:09,075
The last words she said to
me was "don't hurt me."

957
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,468
I went into the bathroom.

958
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,726
I got kind of in a fetal position

959
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,599
and I covered my ears.

960
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:37,686
And I heard my mom wake up.

961
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,031
And then she sounded startled.

962
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:47,121
And there was some noises
that I can't make out,

963
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:52,909
and I heard her say my name a couple times.

964
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:59,168
And she said, "Help me."

965
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,883
And then there was just silence.

966
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,969
Did she scream?

967
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,603
Yeah.

968
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,146
<i>This is about as clear
a premeditated murder</i>

969
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,398
<i>as I've ever seen.</i>

970
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,687
<i>It's brutal.</i>

971
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,197
<i>And I think it would be
very hard for anybody</i>

972
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,699
<i>to not have a moment of being taken aback.</i>

973
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:32,453
<i>Did you have sex with Dee Dee?</i>

974
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,996
<i>- No.
- You didn't stick your penis anywhere on her?</i>

975
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,461
<i>- Nope.
- Are you sure?</i>

976
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,000
<i>- Yep.
- Positive?</i>

977
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,844
<i>- I'm 100% positive.
- Okay.</i>

978
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,959
<i>Did you stick your penis in her mouth?</i>

979
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,416
<i>- Nope.
- Okay.</i>

980
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,626
<i>Did your penis touch
anywhere on Dee Dee's body?</i>

981
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,046
<i>- Nope.
- Okay.</i>

982
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,014
<i>Did your mouth touch
anywhere on Dee Dee's body?</i>

983
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,545
<i>- My mouth? No.
- Okay.</i>

984
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,388
<i>- You didn't kiss her or...
- Nope.</i>

985
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,733
<i>- ...lick her or anything like that?
- Nope.</i>

986
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,059
<i>Okay. What do you think about people</i>

987
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,564
<i>that have sex with dead bodies?</i>

988
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,147
<i>I mean, it's quite disturbing, honestly.</i>

989
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,403
<i>Okay, that's... That would bother you?</i>

990
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:06,565
<i>Yeah. I don't like necrophilia.</i>

991
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:09,114
<i>Okay, because I think one of the things</i>

992
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,738
<i>that she might have said
was that you had mentioned</i>

993
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,736
<i>that you'd like to rape her mom.</i>

994
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:17,458
<i>- Yeah, at one point, I was thinking about it.
- Okay.</i>

995
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,370
He had wanted to rape my mother.

996
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,878
That's what he wanted to do.

997
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,670
He was like, "I'm going to kill her,

998
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,673
but I'm going to do it my way,
and I'm going to rape her."

999
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,046
So what I did was I made a deal with him.

1000
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:34,175
I'd let him rape me, and...

1001
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:37,015
And then he wouldn't... He
wouldn't do that to my mom.

1002
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,480
<i>- So you guys have sex.
- Yes.</i>

1003
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:46,145
<i>And what kind of sex?
What is sex like to you?</i>

1004
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:50,485
<i>Well, to me, the kind of sex that it was</i>

1005
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:54,453
<i>was pretty much kind of con... consensual?</i>

1006
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:56,905
<i>Is that the word I'm looking for?</i>

1007
00:56:56,956 --> 00:57:00,036
<i>- Like, are you biting her?
- Are you punching her?</i>

1008
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,674
<i>No, no, I would never lay my hands on her.</i>

1009
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,051
<i>I didn't even bite her at all, actually.</i>

1010
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,169
<i>Not for a long time, that is.</i>

1011
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:11,087
<i>The very first time, she
whispered in my ear</i>

1012
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:13,467
<i>that that was a turn-on of hers is biting.</i>

1013
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,764
<i>- I bit her twice.
- Okay.</i>

1014
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,597
<i>The first time I can't remember.</i>

1015
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,692
<i>The second time I remember,
because I bit her a lot harder.</i>

1016
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,978
<i>However, she seemed to still enjoy it</i>

1017
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,272
<i>even though it was really hard.</i>

1018
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:27,726
<i>Technically, once we got to that point,</i>

1019
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,858
I screamed for him to stop, and he didn't.

1020
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,776
<i>So I don't consider it to be consensual.</i>

1021
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,041
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

1022
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,293
<i>Is there a reason you didn't feel pleasure?</i>

1023
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,955
<i>I don't know. It's really hard to say.</i>

1024
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,796
<i>I did make her have an orgasm once.</i>

1025
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:54,222
<i>- Okay.
- And then after that, I... she might've blew me a bit.</i>

1026
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,313
<i>And then after that, I think
we stopped because we realized</i>

1027
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,994
<i>there was a lot of packing and stuff to do.</i>

1028
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,098
<i>Okay, so you guys get everything packed.</i>

1029
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,765
<i>She wipes down the fingerprints.</i>

1030
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,313
<i>And then what do you guys do?</i>

1031
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:09,106
<i>We get in a taxi and we get to the hotel.</i>

1032
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,911
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

1033
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,454
<i>I'm filming.</i>

1034
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,595
<i>He's eating a brownie!</i>

1035
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,266
<i>But later, he will be eating me!</i>

1036
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,403
<i>I loved Nick very much at that time,</i>

1037
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,441
and being with him felt exciting

1038
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:53,696
because I was with someone I loved

1039
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,819
and someone I thought cared for me.

1040
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:03,372
<i>We took a Greyhound bus back to Wisconsin.</i>

1041
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:10,302
<i>My mind wasn't thinking back
to what was at my house.</i>

1042
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:12,509
<i>I just kept thinking, "I'm free, I'm free,"</i>

1043
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,339
<i>and that excitement of
being free and walking.</i>

1044
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,892
I always reference myself
to this little bluebird

1045
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,393
that was trapped in an invisible cage,

1046
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,845
and I felt like this bluebird was set free.

1047
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,608
<i>Did you guys talk about your future?</i>

1048
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,690
<i>What was your plans for your future?</i>

1049
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:35,645
<i>We wanted to have a family together,</i>

1050
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:39,278
<i>and we wanted to build a
life together and stuff.</i>

1051
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,986
<i>We thought we really had a chance to do it,</i>

1052
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,827
<i>so we were happy about that.</i>

1053
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:05,555
<i>Does your mom and stepdad
know what you did?</i>

1054
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,272
<i>No, they don't.</i>

1055
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,603
<i>And this is the first
time they ever met Gypsy?</i>

1056
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,148
<i>Yeah. In person, yes.</i>

1057
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,941
<i>Okay, and they agreed
to let her live there?</i>

1058
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,356
<i>- Yep.
- Okay.</i>

1059
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:20,525
<i>What did you do think about Gypsy?</i>

1060
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:24,996
<i>You know, it was weird because
when I picked them up</i>

1061
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,619
<i>from the bus station, I even asked her,</i>

1062
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,326
<i>"How's your mom doing? How is your..."</i>

1063
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,876
<i>'Cause I was told she was
in a homeless shelter.</i>

1064
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,090
<i>Her mom kicked her out.</i>

1065
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,670
<i>So I asked her how her mom was doing.</i>

1066
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,755
<i>This might have been the
first thing I asked her.</i>

1067
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,630
<i>No big deal, They acted like nothing.</i>

1068
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,048
<i>What was your impression?</i>

1069
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,386
<i>Did you feel like there was anything wrong?</i>

1070
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,493
<i>- Did you feel like everything was good?
- Everything seemed normal.</i>

1071
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,746
<i>The only thing that freaked me
out is she was wearing a wig.</i>

1072
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,560
<i>Okay.</i>

1073
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,895
<i>Did you remember getting in the mail</i>

1074
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,730
<i>an envelope or anything addressed to
Nick or Gypsy or anything like that?</i>

1075
01:00:55,778 --> 01:01:01,568
<i>There was one that just came in...
hmm... Saturday?</i>

1076
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:03,947
<i>I have no idea what was in it.</i>

1077
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,044
<i>That was my next question.</i>

1078
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,830
<i>I don't</i> go through mail. <i>- Okay.</i>

1079
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,044
<i>Maybe I should have.</i>

1080
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,272
<i>- That was the night that he had stabbed her to death.
- What?</i>

1081
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,206
<i>They mailed it from their
house there to your house.</i>

1082
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,127
<i>- Are you serious?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

1083
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,136
<i>- Oh, my God.
- And that was located in your house.</i>

1084
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,179
<i>My God.</i>

1085
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,523
<i>I think there was a little...</i>

1086
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:30,558
<i>Around $4,000-5,000 of cash</i>

1087
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,814
<i>that they had stolen from her mom.</i>

1088
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,396
<i>My God.</i>

1089
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,878
<i>Did you see the Facebook
post where it says...</i>

1090
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,572
<i>- No.
- Okay, that's right.</i>

1091
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,862
<i>On Dee and Gypsy's Facebook
post that they share,</i>

1092
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,947
<i>there are some horrible messages</i>

1093
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,952
<i>that were posted on there
that said, like...</i>

1094
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,084
<i>I believe, like, they slashed her...</i>

1095
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,752
<i>Like, "I slashed her. I killed her.</i>

1096
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,920
<i>And then I raped the girl,
and the girl's dead, too."</i>

1097
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:55,339
<i>Well, those all were
actually posted by Gypsy.</i>

1098
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,299
<i>Startlingly with Gypsy,</i>

1099
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:03,722
<i>who went online to announce, you know,</i>

1100
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:08,102
"That bitch is dead,"
and to go even further

1101
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:12,522
<i>and describe a scenario where she was raped</i>

1102
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,603
<i>is just perverse.</i>

1103
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,568
It implies a fair degree of sociopathy.

1104
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,109
<i>Just the way the girl acted...</i>

1105
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,985
<i>I mean, how can you do
something to your mother</i>

1106
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,282
<i>and lose your mother,
and just act like that?</i>

1107
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:30,576
<i>I was like... I'm just trying
to wrap my head around it.</i>

1108
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:32,662
<i>I mean, they acted like two normal people.</i>

1109
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:35,378
<i>- Yeah.
- That's what's really freaky.</i>

1110
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,999
<i>Yeah.</i>

1111
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,706
<i>How can you do that?</i>

1112
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,968
<i>Gypsy might have been
the mastermind herself.</i>

1113
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:45,841
I think it's most anybody's instinct to,

1114
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:48,758
"Oh, shit, you murdered
your mother," you know?

1115
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,847
Watch that girl.

1116
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:54,394
Don't turn your back.
You she might stab you.

1117
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,114
<i>I do think Gypsy is potentially dangerous.</i>

1118
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,699
Dee Dee was a master manipulator,

1119
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,200
and it's impossible that Gypsy would not

1120
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,372
have picked this up and used it.

1121
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,370
<i>- Yeah.
- You know?</i>

1122
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,455
<i>I know. I mean, that's the
way it works, though,</i>

1123
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,085
<i>when you have what he has.</i>

1124
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,551
<i>Your mind focuses on one thing.
Do you know what I mean?</i>

1125
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:25,262
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1126
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,092
<i>Do you think that if Gypsy hadn't
asked you to kill her mom,</i>

1127
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,508
<i>you'd have ever killed her mom?</i>

1128
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,886
<i>I know I wouldn't have done it.</i>

1129
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,813
<i>Okay. You just did it
because you loved Gypsy</i>

1130
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,141
<i>and Gypsy asked you to do it.</i>

1131
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,386
<i>Is that what I'm thinking?</i>

1132
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,807
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

1133
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:40,645
<i>For him to ruin his life over that,</i>

1134
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,782
<i>I'm sorry, but she's a beast.</i>

1135
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,820
<i>Yeah.</i>

1136
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:49,284
She now doesn't have a language

1137
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,736
beyond manipulation and retaliation.

1138
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,908
<i>I mean, is she taking any sort of...</i>

1139
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:59,208
<i>You know, is she like, "Well,
okay, it was me, too,"</i>

1140
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,772
<i>or is she to trying to put it all on Nick?</i>

1141
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,126
<i>She...</i>

1142
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,129
<i>takes some responsibility,</i>

1143
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,466
<i>but not much.</i>

1144
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,223
<i>Not much at all.</i>

1145
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,715
<i>- Did you kill your mom?
- No. No, sir.</i>

1146
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,387
<i>- Did you help?
- No, sir.</i>

1147
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,765
<i>- No one else killed your mom?
- No, sir.</i>

1148
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:20,904
<i>No, sir.</i>

1149
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,691
<i>Did you have knowledge that Nicholas</i>

1150
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,114
<i>was going to kill your
mom before he did it?</i>

1151
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,283
<i>No, sir.</i>

1152
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,989
<i>Okay. Sit tight for me, okay?</i>

1153
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,494
<i>It's okay.</i>

1154
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,934
I wonder if people feel that Gypsy

1155
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,010
is telling them the truth now.

1156
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,729
<i>Hello, you have a call from...</i>

1157
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,519
<i>Gypsy Rose.</i>

1158
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:05,114
She was still in Wisconsin
when she called me.

1159
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,242
<i>Hey, my sweetie.</i>

1160
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:10,239
<i>Hi! Is this Kristy?</i>

1161
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,782
<i>Yes, baby.</i>

1162
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,575
<i>Hi! Oh, my God.</i>

1163
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:15,989
<i>It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

1164
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:21,328
At that time, she still wasn't
trusting, really, anyone.

1165
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:27,006
She was still not telling Mike everything.

1166
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,839
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

1167
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:31,764
<i>It's a complicated situation,</i>

1168
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:36,263
<i>but what they say on the news is not true.</i>

1169
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,978
Then we went in the courtroom,

1170
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:43,019
<i>and that's when they showed
all the text messaging.</i>

1171
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:45,765
<i>And when they said they
were presenting that,</i>

1172
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,687
<i>she turned around and looked at us</i>

1173
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,567
<i>with fear in her eyes.</i>

1174
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,775
I guess she didn't think
that they were going to pull

1175
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,736
all of those messages up.

1176
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,252
Yeah, I did.

1177
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,349
They didn't get caught red-handed,

1178
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,179
but they got caught red-handed.

1179
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,774
You know, they have a lot of evidence.

1180
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:23,229
They have the murder weapon, texts, videos.

1181
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:27,271
I mean, no doubt they did it
or planned it and everything,

1182
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:31,357
so it was just a matter of why they did it,

1183
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:33,655
you know, and is that reasonable?

1184
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,990
Are you happy that your mom

1185
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,235
is not here to abuse you anymore?

1186
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:42,786
Yeah.

1187
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,673
But at the same time, I'm
not happy that she's dead.

1188
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:48,382
You know, I didn't want that.

1189
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:52,222
I know it sounds strange to plan something

1190
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,759
and go through the steps to make it happen,

1191
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:58,353
and then... but at the same
time not want it to happen.

1192
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:02,852
One of the problems with the legal system

1193
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,104
is that it demands that people
have this one intention

1194
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:08,267
and this one moment in time
and be certain about it,

1195
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,276
and I'm not sure that that really happens.

1196
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,648
And especially in this case,
I'm not sure that it happens.

1197
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:16,777
It's possible that Gypsy had
ultimately ambivalent feelings

1198
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:19,445
about killing her mother.

1199
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,180
I wonder what she was
thinking in the other room

1200
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,334
listening to her mother
screaming sometimes.

1201
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,213
I didn't think anything.

1202
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,171
I was scared.

1203
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:31,171
I was shaking.

1204
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,014
I just... I didn't have
a thought in my brain.

1205
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,182
<i>It was like it was all not real.</i>

1206
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:45,232
I was on a bunch of medications,
and I know that's no excuse,

1207
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,190
but on Xanax, I felt like I had no emotion

1208
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,192
and I wasn't thinking right.

1209
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:57,362
Munchausen by proxy
victims can lose contact

1210
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,117
with reality at times,

1211
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,869
and that may be part of the defense

1212
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,332
in Gypsy's case.

1213
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,962
<i>She may have trouble distinguishing</i>

1214
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,540
<i>what's real and what isn't.</i>

1215
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,125
<i>Is sickness real or is it fake?</i>

1216
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:15,721
Is death real, or is it
exaggerated or fake?

1217
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:19,589
<i>So, I think she had limited
capacity for reality testing,</i>

1218
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,928
which just means seeing
what's normal behavior

1219
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:24,223
and what's really strange behavior.

1220
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,940
<i>Gypsy grew up in essentially
an alternate reality</i>

1221
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,903
<i>to what the rest of us live.</i>

1222
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:38,905
<i>By her mother isolating her
from the outside world,</i>

1223
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:43,199
she doesn't know or understand
what normal really is.

1224
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,865
Hi.

1225
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,453
<i>In so many ways,</i>

1226
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:50,458
<i>I don't know what's right, what's wrong,</i>

1227
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:55,092
but to say that, yes, I did this.

1228
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,801
I'm sorry for it.

1229
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:58,932
I feel bad for it.

1230
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,764
It just feels good to be honest.

1231
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,857
<i>The only thing that I
could've done differently</i>

1232
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,566
<i>that I know better now
is reach out to my dad,</i>

1233
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,527
told my dad.

1234
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:27,078
And he could have came and got me,

1235
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,682
and I would've went and lived with him.

1236
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,899
There's a McDonald's right here

1237
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,633
where I'd visit with Gypsy.

1238
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:43,183
At that time, she was real young.

1239
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,641
I remember one visit...

1240
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,469
she was so scared of me, man.

1241
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,017
She was shaking.

1242
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,350
I don't know what Dee
Dee told her about me,

1243
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,817
but I probably was the big bad
wolf or something, you know?

1244
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:00,649
Gypsy must have been so confused, you know?

1245
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,341
She was probably telling her the day before

1246
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,325
that, you know, I don't love
her and all this stuff,

1247
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:09,998
and then here she is visiting
with me and telling her,

1248
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,870
"Look, that's your daddy.
Give him a hug," you know?

1249
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,303
That's old history now, so we're
just going to try to build

1250
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,380
a real father-daughter
intimate relationship,

1251
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,176
you know, like we should have.

1252
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,887
It's hard.

1253
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:32,635
Thinking what she had to go through

1254
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,977
and that she didn't have
to go through all that.

1255
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,653
- See this?
- Look at that.

1256
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,783
She would probably have
been a perfectly fine kid

1257
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,571
had it not been her mom was Dee Dee.

1258
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:48,026
Okay, y'all want to get
the table ready or what?

1259
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,868
- Yes.
- We're going to eat off the trays?

1260
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,663
<i>She could've had a normal life.</i>

1261
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:56,326
I hope she gets out, and
I don't know what...

1262
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:59,048
What she's going to do when she gets out.

1263
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,169
She was punished enough

1264
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,086
to where they should let her go free.

1265
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,675
That's the way I feel.

1266
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,390
'Cause that child's...
She's been through a lot.

1267
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,433
Look at her.

1268
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,686
- Is that Gypsy?
- Yeah, when she was normal.

1269
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:24,363
I blame myself now for not doing more.

1270
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:26,196
I mean, it is what it is.

1271
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:29,201
I'm not a "blame yourself" type of guy,

1272
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,124
but who else is there to look at, you know?

1273
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:10,829
Okay.

1274
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:13,289
This is... sorry.

1275
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,829
I didn't realize they were going
to bring you out immediately.

1276
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,625
This is the new charge... Class-A felony

1277
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,419
of murder in the second degree,

1278
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,133
and then acting in concert with another

1279
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:25,593
who knowingly caused the
death of your mother

1280
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,473
by stabbing her, okay?

1281
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,665
This is in the case of State of Missouri

1282
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,899
v. Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

1283
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,441
Please raise your right hand.

1284
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:45,205
Do you swear and affirm that the testimony

1285
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,797
you're about to give will be the truth,

1286
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,651
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

1287
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,448
Yes, sir.

1288
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,303
Would you state your name
for the record, please?

1289
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,737
- Gypsy Blanchard.
- And how old are you?

1290
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,908
I'm going to be 25 years old, but 24.

1291
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,877
<i>Okay. And how far did you go in school?</i>

1292
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,749
About the second grade.

1293
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,917
How do you plead to the class-A felony

1294
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,625
of murder in the second degree?

1295
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,215
- Guilty.
- The court finds that there is

1296
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,641
a factual basis for a plea of guilty.

1297
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,060
The court accepts
defendant's plea of guilty

1298
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,060
and finds the defendant guilty
thereof beyond a reasonable doubt.

1299
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,143
She's to be sentenced to 10 years

1300
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,438
in the Missouri Department of Corrections.

1301
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,902
She'll have to do 85% of her sentence

1302
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:29,203
before she's eligible for parole.

1303
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,529
Let's go off the record.

1304
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,750
There you are.

1305
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:47,173
<i>This case is unusual and extraordinary.</i>

1306
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:50,255
Gypsy Blanchard endured nearly two decades

1307
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:54,551
of systematic, purposeful abuse

1308
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:58,097
at the hands of her mother
for the purpose of fraud.

1309
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:00,693
And so, by amending to
murder in the second degree,

1310
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,688
we were able to both hold Gypsy
Blanchard accountable for the murder,

1311
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:07,862
which was not justified nor excusable,

1312
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:11,782
but yet account for those
mitigating circumstances.

1313
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:15,323
All of us involved are... It's a relief.

1314
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,288
You know, at the very beginning of this,

1315
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:20,908
there was the question of the
death penalty on the table.

1316
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,167
Ultimately, it's the best outcome for her.

1317
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,250
It's the best outcome for
the State of Missouri

1318
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:30,456
and ultimately the right
thing to do for everybody.

1319
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,048
That one's in this pocket.

1320
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,223
Ooh.

1321
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,182
I mean, it's a murder.

1322
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,658
There's nothing we can do about that,

1323
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,852
so, you know, that has to be dealt with.

1324
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:45,524
But ultimately, when you look at the fact

1325
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,855
that at the end of that 8 1/2 years,

1326
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,741
when she's already done a year of that,

1327
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,528
she'll be 32 years old.

1328
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:54,702
She'll be three years younger
than I am right now.

1329
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:57,451
So, I mean, she will actually be able

1330
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,333
to enjoy just the world.

1331
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,714
Do you think 10 years in jail is better

1332
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:08,712
than 10 years of living the
way that you had to live?

1333
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:12,045
Yes, it is.

1334
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,931
I need to start over like I'm newly born.

1335
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,990
- Honey?
- Yeah.

1336
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,242
- Green?
- Yeah.

1337
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,493
White or green?

1338
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,325
No, no, no, no, no.

1339
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,661
It's my favorite hat.

1340
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,115
No, other hat.

1341
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:51,166
I'm holding on to that girl.

1342
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,424
You know, it's going to be very emotional.

1343
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,416
Yeah, you're a big crybaby.

1344
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,570
You're probably gonna cry, too.

1345
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:57,894
And then when you're gonna cry,

1346
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,799
I'm going to cry

1347
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,467
because you're crying,

1348
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,676
because it's hard to see grown men cry.

1349
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,274
I don't cry.

1350
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,484
Bullshit.

1351
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,318
You cry.

1352
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,084
- Hello.
- Daddy.

1353
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,497
Oh...

1354
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,548
I've missed you.

1355
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,720
- You're so big.
- I know!

1356
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,727
I'm almost as tall as you.

1357
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,572
So how's everything going
with you health-wise?

1358
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,338
- You good? You feel good?
- It's going good, yeah.

1359
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,840
You've been exercising and everything?

1360
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:00,414
I've been going to the rec
yard, been exercising.

1361
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,490
That's good.

1362
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,405
My tube site is finally all healed.

1363
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:05,834
It's gone? That's good.

1364
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:07,752
Looks great. Looks good.

1365
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,460
All healed up, so...

1366
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,381
Every once in a while, I get a little pain,

1367
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,800
but I think it's just
phantom pain or something.

1368
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:15,959
Yeah.

1369
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,011
So, are you glad that it's...

1370
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:20,592
I'm happy that it's over.

1371
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:25,556
Yeah. We was... honestly,
we was hoping for less.

1372
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,100
I mean, I know it was your
decision and everything.

1373
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,725
- That's a gamble you take. I mean...
- Yeah.

1374
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:33,903
I look at it like you
could've got 30 years.

1375
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:38,191
I look at it that I could've
got life in prison, you know?

1376
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:42,107
I was hitting a really down point,

1377
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,528
and it was before...
Before the plea agreement,

1378
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:49,038
before I knew anything about it.

1379
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:52,922
I was thinking if I get life in prison

1380
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,960
and that is what I get,

1381
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,835
I'm committing suicide right now, you know?

1382
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:01,303
I was seriously considering it.

1383
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,625
- Well, baby...
- 'Cause I'm like, it could just be over.

1384
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:07,099
I just want to make sure you know that

1385
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,771
if I had done anything
wrong, I'm sorry, baby.

1386
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:11,601
No, I don't think you did anything wrong.

1387
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:15,396
I think it's just Mom was very
good at what she was doing,

1388
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,821
and I think you just was
completely in the dark.

1389
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,611
And I don't... I want you to know

1390
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:25,235
I don't blame you for any
of it, either of you.

1391
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,954
- Thank you.
- I take blame on myself.

1392
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:31,705
And I blame other people, but
I never once blamed y'all.

1393
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,709
Don't blame yourself, sweetie.

1394
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:38,632
We blame... I hold enough
for myself, you know?

1395
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,593
Accountability, it's...

1396
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:42,683
But, I mean, we're not gonna dwell on that.

1397
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,178
- No.
- No.

1398
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,300
We're gonna go forward,
and when you get out..

1399
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,597
- We'll heal together.
- ...you're still gonna be young.

1400
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:52,311
We can have a great relationship.

1401
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:55,353
Look, God pulled you through it.

1402
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:58,318
- Yeah.
- You know?

1403
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:01,569
The devil don't got you, baby. God got you.

1404
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,032
- Yeah.
- And we got you.

1405
01:19:08,703 --> 01:19:09,873
Give me a hug.

1406
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,416
Hang in there, baby.

1407
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,920
You need anything, call any time, okay?

1408
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,502
Oh, she knows.

1409
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:22,877
We'll come see you again
over there, wherever.

1410
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,085
Just hang tight. Stay strong.

1411
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:27,546
- We love you.
- I love you, too.

1412
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,676
I don't want to go.

1413
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,944
I don't want to go. I don't want to go.

1414
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:53,155
It's okay, baby. You can do it, okay?

1415
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,916
Just stay strong.

1416
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,708
You got this far, okay?

1417
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,213
The rest is gonna be easier.

1418
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:02,384
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

1419
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:06,878
You guys have a safe trip back.

1420
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,638
- Don't get in no trouble.
- I won't.

1421
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,009
- Be good.
- I'll be a good girl.

1422
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:12,346
- Follow the rules.
- I will.

1423
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,681
Bye.

1424
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,096
- Set a good example.
- I will.
