What are you guys
waiting for? Come on.

4
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,151
Come on!

5
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,851
Oh, come on! It's fine.

6
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,461
I think.

7
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,943
Yeah. It's definitely
up to code.

8
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,426
Oh, God!

9
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,558
Oh, my God.

10
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,474
Okay, okay.

11
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,650
You okay? Yeah?

12
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,384
Looks like a
nor'wester coming in.

13
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,604
Think we should
head down?

14
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:34,736
Yeah.

15
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,390
I wouldn't wanna
get caught...

16
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,221
Where are you going?

17
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,093
What'd you hear?

18
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,442
I don't know.

19
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,406
There it is again.

20
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,285
I don't hear
anything, man.

21
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,863
What is that?

22
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,492
Paul?

23
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,580
Paul!

24
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,408
Paul! Paul!

25
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,367
Paul! Paul!

26
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,283
You okay
down there, buddy?

27
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,373
Oh, shit.

28
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,767
Okay.

29
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,030
Paul!

30
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,293
Don't worry.
I'm gonna go down there,

31
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,511
and I'm gonna
get him, okay?

32
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,687
Paul!

33
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,429
I'm gonna get him, all right?
He's gonna be okay.

34
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,823
Okay, good!

35
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,741
All right,
be ready to pull him up.

36
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,316
Paul.

37
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,405
What are you doing, man?
Why didn't you answer me?

38
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,412
Paul.

39
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,038
What the fuck is this?

40
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:28,736
What...

41
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,697
What the fuck are you?

42
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:00,594
You all right?

43
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,945
Can you stand up?

44
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,861
If you touch me,
you'll die.

45
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,081
What?

46
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,042
If you touch me,
you'll die.

47
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,570
What do you mean,
if I touch you?

48
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,378
Come on.

49
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,772
Come on, man.
Come on.

50
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,653
Paul?

51
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:00,915
What is it, man?

52
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,005
Stop, stop, stop. Hey.

53
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,616
Hey, come on.

54
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,052
What's going on,
buddy?

55
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,837
Greg?

56
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,926
- What's going on?
- Hold on a minute!

57
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,016
Hey.

58
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,244
Paul, stop fucking around.

59
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,034
Come on, let's go.

60
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,078
Get up. Get up.

61
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,645
Come on. Come on,

62
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,038
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I'm getting you out.

63
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,736
Come on. Stand up.

64
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:41,999
I got him!

65
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,457
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

66
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,111
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

67
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,573
There's a house!

68
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:39,927
Hello!

69
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:42,059
Hello!

70
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,758
Hello? Hello?

71
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,760
Nobody's here!

72
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,326
Open the door!

73
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,166
Okay, okay.
I got him.

74
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,777
I got him.
I got him.

75
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,387
- Easy.
- I got him.

76
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:21,011
- Are you in any pain?
- I'm fine. No.

77
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,147
I'll be right back.

78
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,541
Okay.

79
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,847
Let's get his clothes off him

80
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,066
and check him
for insect bites.

81
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,983
Come on, Paul,
can't you say something?

82
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,637
Come on.

83
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,925
What's wrong with him?

84
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,101
I don't know.

85
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,190
There's nothing, um...

86
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,194
I think he's in shock.

87
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,983
Come on, Paul,
give us a sign, huh?

88
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,638
Just make sure
and yelp for me

89
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,858
if I hit any tender
spots, all right? Hmm?

90
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,443
How's he been lately?

91
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,620
Fine. He's been fine!

92
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,493
- Okay, okay. Calm down.
- He's been fine.

93
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:06,943
Here.

94
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,514
Some kind of
gas pocket, maybe?

95
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,909
I was breathing
the same air he was.

96
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,520
No sign of
a head injury at all?

97
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,522
No.

98
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,526
We need a scan
to be sure but...

99
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,355
What?

100
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,404
If it's not his head,
it's in his head.

101
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,364
We need to get him
to a hospital.

102
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,844
- How?
- I don't know.

103
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,019
There's gotta be somebody.
We can carry him.

104
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,152
We hiked in here,
Ruthie.

105
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,589
Listen to me.
We hiked in here, okay?

106
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,854
We are 5 miles
from the nearest road,

107
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,029
and I can't
carry him anymore.

108
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,508
Not in this weather.

109
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:58,516
Hey.

110
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,826
He's not physically injured.

111
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,567
Hey, he's not.

112
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,310
Let's keep an eye on him.

113
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,834
And if he doesn't
improve overnight,

114
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,923
then I will hike out

115
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,926
and I will find transport
to Jakar myself, okay?

116
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,191
I'm sure he'll be
fine in the morning.

117
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,824
Ruthie,

118
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,304
you gotta
eat something.

119
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,929
Come on.

120
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,463
We'll be
right back, okay?

121
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,352
Hello, can you help us?

122
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,794
Can you hear me?
We need help!

123
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,678
Go away! Go away!

124
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,203
Ruthie, open up!
It's us!

125
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,378
Greg?

126
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:00,296
Ruthie,
open the goddamn door!

127
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,473
Ruthie, open!

128
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,175
We can't
get through the pass.

129
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,828
Not in this storm.

130
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,049
Did you see
someone out there?

131
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,138
- No. Just you.
- What?

132
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,053
What were you
doing out there?

133
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,142
There... There...
There was someone out there.

134
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,578
He chased me.

135
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,232
- I wanna get outta here.
- Come on, calm down.

136
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,974
Do not tell me to calm down!
We need to leave!

137
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,411
Paul?

138
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,721
Paul?

139
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,683
Where are you?

140
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,955
Where is he?

141
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,174
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

142
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,305
Hey, Paul.

143
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,787
His jacket's gone.

144
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:28,314
For fuck's sake, Paul,
what are you doing?

145
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,793
What are you doing?

146
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,145
I am sick

147
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,278
of your "I'm so special"
bullshit, you know that?

148
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,410
That's not helping.

149
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,282
What's going on,
sweetheart?

150
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,805
- You can tell me.
- Oh, don't encourage him!

151
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,764
Just back off, Greg.

152
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:45,461
- Calm down.
- No, don't tell me to back off!

153
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,681
Do you want him
to get better or not?

154
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,204
No, I don't really give a shit.
This is his fucking fault.

155
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,901
It's not helping, what
you're doing. Just stop it.

156
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:51,989
I've been dealing
with this selfish bullshit

157
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,991
for 20 years!

158
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,428
He has us lost on a mountain
because he's having a bad day?

159
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,475
Would you fucking
say something?

160
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,521
I told you...

161
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,264
What?

162
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,742
Where were you?

163
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,616
Where were you?

164
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,974
Where were you?

165
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,811
Just this, please.

166
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,640
Yeah, you don't
want that one.

167
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:45,989
Well, it says
that one has more sprays

168
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,164
than the other ones.

169
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,296
Yes, that's right.

170
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,906
But it uses a formula

171
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,951
where you have to shake it
before you use it.

172
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,866
Oh.

173
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,389
Not something you're gonna
want in an emergency.

174
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,738
I'll show you
what you need.

175
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,479
It's actually cheaper,
anyway.

176
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,002
St. Louis. Todd 3-for-31

177
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,830
to open this year.

178
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,963
He really got into that ball.

179
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,444
It's 2-0.

180
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:08,011
Former Home Run Derby champ
Todd Frazier

181
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,752
trying to knock another one

182
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,841
outta the park
and up into the stands.

183
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,235
So it's three balls,
no strikes.

184
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,186
Hi. Don't go anywhere.

185
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,016
- This.
- Oh.

186
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,062
You might wanna
check it, see if it's expired.

187
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,281
Oh, of course.

188
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,065
And this is for you.

189
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,589
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

190
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,504
Well, I don't need
any change. It's fine.

197
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,142
Hello, Amanda.

198
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,756
Your mom know
you're here?

199
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,499
How's she doing?

200
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,284
I came here to find out
how you're doing.

201
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,202
I mean, it's been
almost a year.

202
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,945
I was concerned
about you.

203
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,775
Thank you.

204
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,777
Maybe you think
that's silly.

205
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,605
No.

206
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,786
Ever since
my father died,

207
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,268
and so soon after
when Allison and Henry...

208
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,794
It's okay.
It's fine.

209
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,013
I mean...

210
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,103
It was more than
any of us could bear.

211
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,409
Yeah.

212
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:12,631
Any of us.
I myself felt like

213
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,982
I was gonna burst
into a million pieces.

214
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,159
But I...
I came to tell you

215
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,641
that I found something
so wonderful

216
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,773
and so freeing.

217
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,952
And it's helped me to realize
that nothing can hurt you,

218
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,694
because nothing is real.

219
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,654
Amanda,

220
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,309
a lot of things are real.

221
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:41,094
Are they?

222
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,399
Yeah.

223
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,097
How could you know?

224
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,318
I've learned it
the hard way.

225
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,409
What's real starts here,

226
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,065
and it ends up out here.

227
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,069
What we think
about with focus

228
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:03,377
and intention and repetition,
we manifest.

229
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,075
It's the power
of positive thinking,

230
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,642
the power of negative
thinking. Right?

231
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,252
Right.

232
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:12,952
But what if
there's a secret truth?

233
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,172
What if our thoughts

234
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,653
actually begin
somewhere else?

235
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:21,090
And they travel
through us

236
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:24,224
like a signal
traveling down a wire.

237
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,488
Thoughts that are old
and hidden and singular.

238
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,579
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

239
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,933
Yes, you do.
Of course you do.

240
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,860
Duty calls.

241
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:54,428
Okay.

242
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,096
Can I tell her
that I saw you?

243
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:12,446
Yeah, of course.

244
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,319
Bye.

245
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,759
Thanks for checking on me.

246
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,040
Where were you?

247
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,787
Where were you?

248
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,702
Where were you?

249
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:52,921
Where were you?

250
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:12,898
Where were you?

251
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,533
Amanda, want any eggs?

252
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:43,363
We don't have any eggs.

253
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:46,366
Amanda?

254
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,896
Mandy, you up?

255
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:12,914
Amanda.

256
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,466
Hey.

257
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,515
It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

258
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,222
You already
called the police?

259
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,268
Uh-huh.
A few minutes, they said.

260
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,125
I'll be outside.

261
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,173
- Who are you?
- I'm James Lasombra.

262
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,870
Neighbor.
Family friend.

263
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,351
Didn't you used
to be a cop?

264
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:45,093
- Yes, I did. St. Louis.
- Undercover, right?

265
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,184
Yeah. I remember
hearing about you.

266
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,492
She came to
see you yesterday?

267
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,276
Amanda. Yes.

268
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,669
She say anything

269
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:56,713
to make you think
she was going somewhere?

270
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,541
No, not at all.

271
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,152
How about her father?
Where's he?

272
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,719
He died two years ago.
Heart attack.

273
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:06,549
Ma'am.

274
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,683
They were close?

275
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,557
She deal with any
depression after that?

276
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,603
- Any more than the usual?
- Just the usual.

277
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,344
- Nothing too... No.
- No?

278
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,519
How are things for your
daughter at school?

279
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:20,650
Any trouble?

280
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,131
Not at all.

281
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:26,134
She had, I mean,
a panic attack the other day,

282
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,570
but it was nothing serious.

283
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,007
She had
a panic attack?

284
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,399
I got a call
from the school.

285
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,097
- She'd been crying in class.
- Crying?

286
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,359
It was...
It was nothing.

287
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:34,925
She had a bad day,
that's all.

288
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,057
She has a lot of
schoolwork, you know?

289
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,537
Which is a lot of pressure.

290
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,104
Anything like
that happen before?

291
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:42,716
Um...

292
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:47,373
Would you say
you two were close?

293
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,288
Yeah, Amanda and I are great.
We're perfect.

294
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:50,419
Okay.

295
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,160
Listen, Mrs. Quail,

296
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,467
your daughter's
18 years old.

297
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,512
- She's a legal adult.
- She's in high school.

298
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:59,124
You say her suitcase
is missing,

299
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,430
and she appears to have deliberately
packed. She is free to...

300
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:02,736
That's not what happened.

301
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,608
I know my daughter.

302
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,610
Christ,
don't you think I'd rather

303
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,831
that was the case
than what I'm afraid of?

304
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:15,357
I understand
your concern.

305
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,621
We'll see
what we can find.

306
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:22,321
In the meantime,
if you hear anything, let me know.

307
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,197
Do you have any pets?

308
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,417
No, why?

309
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:32,983
No reason.

310
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,595
Have a good day, Mrs.
Quail. We'll be in touch.

311
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,599
Talk to you
outside?

312
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,552
Their theory is
Amanda is distressed

313
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,119
and she's acting out
to hurt you.

314
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,605
They're not gonna
do anything, are they?

315
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,825
No. Probably not.

316
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,893
Why did
they ask about pets?

317
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,158
I'm assuming they figure

318
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:01,333
the blood on the mirror
is not human.

319
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,206
God,
what am I supposed to do?

320
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,904
"He is here, he is there.
He is every-fucking-where."

321
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,210
Who's "he"?

322
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,691
- Probably Peter.
- Yeah?

323
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,824
Yeah, I don't know.

324
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,702
Why don't you make me a list
of Amanda's friends?

325
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,620
Thank you.

326
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,770
Excuse me, Davara.
Davara Walsh?

327
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:50,120
Hi, I'm James Lasombra.
I'm a friend of Amanda's.

328
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,819
- Yeah. I know who you are.
- You know who I am.

329
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:55,387
Uh, well, do you know
where Amanda is?

330
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,302
- No.
- No?

331
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:58,912
You know why
she might run off?

332
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,219
Can I have one?

333
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:04,961
You know smoking's
bad for you?

334
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,357
All right.
Get in the car.

335
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,324
Okay.

336
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,767
So Amanda's mom told me

337
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:28,942
she was crying in class
the other day.

338
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:30,639
She wasn't crying.

339
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,250
She was screaming.

340
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,566
All right, um...

341
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,658
The police, they, um...

342
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,617
They came to gym class today.

343
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,880
They asked us about Amanda.

344
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,752
What'd you tell them?

345
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,496
What didn't
you tell them?

346
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,325
You tell them
about the Empty Man?

347
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,808
That's just some
stupid kid's thing.

348
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,466
What is it?

349
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:17,338
I don't know.

350
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,862
Some story started
going around

351
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,474
that if you went
to a bridge after dark

352
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:25,259
and you found
an empty bottle,

353
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:29,742
and if you blew into it,
and you thought about him,

354
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,745
something would happen.

355
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,530
What happens?

356
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,448
You try it?

357
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:43,843
When?

358
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,846
Two nights ago,

359
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,892
a few of us were down on
the old Chain of Rocks Bridge.

360
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,155
You know where that is?

361
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,461
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

362
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,726
When I was little,
I had this theory

363
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,121
that I could prevent
anything bad from happening

364
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,471
by thinking
about it beforehand.

365
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,387
What do you mean?

366
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,520
It's like every time
I got into a car,

367
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,262
I'd think about
all the different ways

368
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,395
we could get
into a car accident.

369
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,136
Mm-hmm.

370
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,356
Because what are the odds
of getting hit by a bus

371
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,749
when you just thought about
getting hit by a bus?

372
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,621
Kids are fucking stupid.

373
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,278
Yeah.

374
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,845
He said,
proving his own point.

375
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,935
Dude, what the fuck?

376
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,070
Come on, let's bounce.

377
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:40,682
You missed some.

378
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,471
Who was there?

379
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:50,736
Lisa, Duncan,
Meyer, Brandon, and Amanda.

380
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,956
And Julianne was there too.

381
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,481
Bitch.

382
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:58,831
So,
do you still wanna go?

383
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:00,876
I don't know.

384
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:02,922
Not like before,

385
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,230
but sometimes I still feel
like I could just disappear

386
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:08,928
and no one would
even notice.

387
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,671
I get that.

388
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,805
Have you ever thought
about suicide?

389
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,416
Plenty of times.

390
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,418
I even tried it once.

391
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,205
Psych.

392
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,554
It's where I fell
through some French doors

393
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,164
rollerblading
in my house.

394
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,776
If I ever slit my wrist,
it'll be long and vertical.

395
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:35,824
Hey, wait.

396
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,659
We gotta try it.

397
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,400
Please don't be dumb.

398
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:47,706
Try what?

399
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,621
Calling the Empty Man.

400
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,450
Who's the Empty Man?

401
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:54,060
Well, supposedly

402
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,975
if you're on a bridge
and you find a bottle,

403
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:58,804
you blow into it

404
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,459
and you think
about the Empty Man.

405
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:04,723
Then after a little while,

406
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,029
you're supposed to hear him
coming for you.

407
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,075
Tell him the rest.

408
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,559
Well, so on
the first night, you hear him.

409
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,604
Then you can't stop
thinking about him.

410
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:19,955
And then
on the second night,

411
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,827
you see him.

412
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,959
Following you.

413
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,962
And on the third night?

414
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:28,877
Well, on the third night,
he finds you.

415
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:30,488
Oh, come on, Mandy.
How old are you?

416
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,707
Yeah, please, let's go home.
I've got swim at 6:00.

417
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,796
Nah, Amanda,
let's do it.

418
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,450
Brandon wants to
find out what happens.

419
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:37,582
Don't you, Brandon?

420
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,889
Not particularly. No.

421
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,863
Your turn, scrub.

422
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:18,971
Nailed it.

423
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:28,676
This is bullshit.

424
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,852
If it's bullshit,
why won't you do it?

425
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:33,072
You don't want everyone
thinking you don't blow,

426
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:34,987
right, Davara?

427
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:39,208
Fuck all you guys.

428
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:25,211
The Empty Man.

429
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:27,039
The Empty Man. The Empty Man.

430
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,168
- What?
- Shh!

431
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:36,456
Hey, who's out there?

432
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:51,601
Whoever's out there,
stop fucking around.

433
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:52,907
Yeah, that's really gonna
handle it. Thanks, Meyer.

434
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,474
Shut up.

435
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:56,389
It's just an asshole.
Some drunk or a bum or something.

436
00:44:58,434 --> 00:44:59,914
Let's go, please.
Please.

437
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:26,941
It's probably
just some dorks

438
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,073
messing with us, right?

439
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:31,337
Was that the last time
you saw Amanda?

440
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,774
I saw her at the mall

441
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:34,862
the next day
talking to Brandon.

442
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:43,218
But I didn't talk to her.

443
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:55,230
You okay?

444
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,287
No, I have to go.

445
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,768
Well, wait a second. Hey.

446
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,204
Could you give me
an address for Brandon?

447
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,951
- Here.
- Thank you.

448
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:38,099
- Hi.
- Yes?

449
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:42,190
Does Brandon Maibaum
live here?

450
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,931
Have you seen him?

451
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,541
He's not home?

452
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,284
No. He's not here.

453
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,939
Okay, uh, my name is
James Lasombra.

454
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:54,159
I'm a friend of
Nora Quail's, who's...

455
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:05,997
Hello? Lisa?

456
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:08,303
Mrs. Schwartz?

457
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:11,132
Anybody home?

458
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:14,005
Why didn't
you run, you fool?

459
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,007
You were nearly killed.

460
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:19,271
Quiet.
The god is coming.

461
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,014
What's he talking about?

462
00:47:23,188 --> 00:47:24,406
He said the god is coming.

463
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:26,278
Hello?

464
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:27,540
Which god?

465
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,892
His god. Aten.

466
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,329
- Aten?
- Look!

467
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,374
Lisa?

468
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:45,270
Hello?

469
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,098
Hey, Nora, it's me.

470
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,361
Listen, how well do you know
Amanda's friends?

471
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:51,363
Do any of them
seem kinda off to you?

472
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:52,668
Off how?

473
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,496
Into weird stuff.

474
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,976
What kind of weird stuff?

475
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,761
I don't know.
I'm just grasping, Nora.

476
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:01,068
I mean,
I don't wanna worry you,

477
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:03,027
but I tried to find, uh,

478
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:04,767
all of Amanda's friends
who were last seen with her,

479
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:06,944
and I just can't
seem to locate them.

480
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,423
None of them?

481
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:10,121
Aside from
Davara Walsh, no.

482
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,516
You ever heard
of the Pontifex Institute?

483
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,779
She ever mention that before?

484
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,391
- No. No. What is that?
- I don't know.

485
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:21,175
It might not have anything
to do with anything.

486
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,352
Listen, I got
a few more stops to make.

487
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,615
So, why don't we
talk about this later tonight?

488
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:30,097
Everything's gonna
be fine, Nora.

489
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,664
All right, bye.

490
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:48,040
Leave me alone!

491
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:32,824
What is your problem?

492
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:35,000
Why would she do that?

493
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,654
She knew Amanda Quail.

494
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:38,438
Is that why
you were talking to her?

495
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:41,572
Yeah, that's right.
They're friends.

496
00:56:41,746 --> 00:56:43,617
I was hoping
maybe she'd seen her.

497
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:44,966
And had she?

498
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,665
Not since yesterday
at school. No.

499
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,842
How well did you know
the Walsh girl?

500
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:52,409
Hardly at all.

501
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,542
What do you mean "did"?

502
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,719
Davara Walsh
died tonight.

503
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:02,984
Her body was found in a
spa earlier this evening.

504
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:06,553
Stabbed multiple times.
We don't know how many. A lot.

505
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,468
Oh, crap.

506
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,078
She was stabbed
in the face.

507
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,259
You have a suspect?

508
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:20,001
By all appearances,
it was a suicide.

509
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:22,961
People don't...

510
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:29,010
People just don't do that
to themselves.

511
00:57:31,056 --> 00:57:32,971
My point exactly.

512
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:41,675
You know this town.
One, two murders a year.

513
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:44,896
Three if we're frisky.
Now this?

514
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,508
It poisons the atmosphere.

515
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:51,816
Sure as sewage
would the water supply.

516
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,602
It's communicable.

517
00:57:58,692 --> 00:57:59,650
It changes people.

518
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:05,656
Three weeks ago,
in a house in Maryville,

519
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,919
a mother fed
her newborn infant

520
00:58:08,093 --> 00:58:10,748
to a pack
of stray dogs.

521
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:14,491
She said the baby
had been whispering to her.

522
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:17,755
In the kitchen,

523
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:21,889
she wrote "The Empty Man"
on the linoleum floor.

524
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:25,763
We found
the same thing tonight

525
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:27,504
near the body
of the Walsh girl.

526
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:30,463
I've come
to the conclusion

527
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:33,553
that there is no solving
crimes like these.

528
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,904
Sure, we can put
that mother in prison.

529
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:39,733
We can even put her
in the gas chamber.

530
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:43,041
But that's not solving it.

531
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,305
It's inexplicable.

532
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,918
It's too big. It's...

533
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:56,924
We can't indict the cosmos.

534
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:15,987
You tell
them about the Empty Man?

535
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:18,424
That's just
some stupid kid's thing.

536
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,208
What is it?

537
00:59:20,382 --> 00:59:22,471
It started
a while ago. I don't know.

538
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:26,388
Some story started
going around

539
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,913
that if you went to a bridge
after dark

540
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,698
and you found
an empty bottle,

541
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:35,136
and if you blew into it,
and you thought about him,

542
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,965
something would happen.

543
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,663
What happens?

544
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:42,404
On the first night,
you'd hear him.

545
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,842
And then the second night,
you'd see him.

546
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:46,626
On the third night...

547
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:49,847
you'd feel him.

548
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:17,891
- Hello.
- Are you all right?

549
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:19,676
Yeah, fine.

550
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:21,895
You don't sound fine.

551
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,897
It's just a bloody nose.

552
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,333
Oh, okay.

553
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,685
Um... I'm outside.

554
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:34,821
Hi.

555
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,258
I'm guessing
you forgot to eat.

556
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:40,697
No, I didn't forget.
It just never occurred to me.

557
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,221
Come inside.

558
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,882
- Plates?
- Next one on your right.

559
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:57,148
I just got you some, um,

560
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,933
egg rolls
and Szechuan beef,

561
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:02,066
a little egg drop soup.

562
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:05,809
There's a big vigil
in Slattery Park.

563
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,462
You know,
everyone's there.

564
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,290
I made some flyers,

565
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:11,379
I was gonna
put up around town...

566
01:02:17,908 --> 01:02:18,865
Hey.

567
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,563
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

568
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,391
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

569
01:02:23,565 --> 01:02:24,741
- None of this is your problem.
- Don't be sorry.

570
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:26,133
Don't be sorry.
You have nothing...

571
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:27,439
You have nothing
to apologize for. Okay?

572
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,791
All right?

573
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:33,227
Yes. Yes, I do.

574
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,536
I'm sorry.

575
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,279
I'm sorry
it's been so long.

576
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:44,456
And I'm sorry about why.

577
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:52,899
Do you think she's okay?

578
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,554
Come here.

579
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:00,994
It's okay.

580
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:06,957
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

581
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:15,400
May I stay?

582
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:25,410
God.

583
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,374
Boundaries.

584
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,074
You want a drink?

585
01:03:37,248 --> 01:03:38,292
Mm-hmm.

586
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,001
Where were you?

587
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:40,311
Where were you?

588
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:45,664
On the first night,

589
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,321
you hear him.

590
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:53,672
Hey, sleepyhead.

591
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:37,281
Hello?

592
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,613
...self-inflicted.

593
01:08:15,787 --> 01:08:17,658
Any reason
the group of friends

594
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:19,007
might have committed suicide
remain unclear at this hour.

595
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,487
Another member of the group,

596
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:21,401
Amanda Quail,
is still missing.

597
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,836
Welcome.

598
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,359
Go ahead and have a seat.
You're just in time.

599
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:09,667
Well, that's good news.

600
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:12,278
Can I ask you
a question?

601
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,585
How long you guys been
in business here?

602
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,544
We were established
in 2013.

603
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:20,547
But what we can offer you
is as old as time.

604
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,810
Okay.

605
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:54,364
Hi.

606
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:56,627
What is this?

607
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:58,455
That is your first step
on a journey

608
01:09:58,629 --> 01:09:59,760
to discovering
your deepest self.

609
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,109
Oh, yeah.
No, I get all that.

610
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:02,720
I grew up
in San Francisco.

611
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,201
What is this?

612
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,464
Welcome, everyone.

613
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:09,553
Please just have a seat.
I'll be with you in a moment.

614
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:16,777
Hey. Hey.
So I'm looking for someone.

615
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:18,475
Just make
yourself comfortable.

616
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:20,738
I'm sure you'll find the
answers you're looking for.

617
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:29,529
Follow me.

618
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,931
Sound check. One, two, three.

619
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:43,891
Check. One, two, three.

620
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:51,247
Each one of you
here today

621
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:53,249
is looking for something.

622
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:55,816
Why else would you be here?

623
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,647
We go looking for things
we have lost.

624
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,650
Yes? Well, I'm here
to tell you,

625
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:07,524
there is nothing
you have lost.

626
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:11,615
More than that, there is
no such thing as loss.

627
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,227
From our earliest days,

628
01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:17,447
meeting in garages,

629
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,884
living rooms,
church basements,

630
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:22,365
to this very moment,

631
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,889
our message
has always remained

632
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:28,980
"you are complete
in yourself."

633
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:31,461
There is no struggle.

634
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,638
Struggling has failed.

635
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:36,683
Struggling is what
wakes you up every day,

636
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,338
wondering how much more
you can acquire,

637
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,253
how much more you can use,

638
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:45,388
how much more space
can you take up in the world.

639
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:47,738
When the question we really
need to ask ourselves is,

640
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:50,697
how much less can you use?

641
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:55,049
How much less space
can you occupy?

642
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:58,662
There is no struggle

643
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:02,056
because there are
no distinctions.

644
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,624
To say that you are wrong,

645
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:07,627
or I am right,
is to divide us.

646
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,716
Therefore we deny
there is such a thing

647
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,892
as right or wrong.

648
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:14,460
These are
exclusionary constructs

649
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:18,290
designed to foster
the illusion of separateness.

650
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:23,556
There is no such thing
as disunity.

651
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:28,387
There is only
the great, binding

652
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:31,608
nothingness of things.

653
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:34,959
At one time we were one.

654
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:38,049
We will all be one again.

655
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:43,402
This message comes to you
directly from

656
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:45,578
the Empty Man.

657
01:12:45,752 --> 01:12:47,493
He beckons you

658
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:51,410
to discover the true face
of the world.

659
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:10,473
Can I ask you
to sign these?

660
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,563
Thank you.

661
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:16,696
Thank you for coming.

662
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,306
For a second there,

663
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,004
I thought you were
about to say "namaste."

664
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:21,440
I can if you like.

665
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:22,833
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

666
01:13:23,007 --> 01:13:24,225
- I grew up in San Francisco.
- Ah.

667
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,966
But towards the end
you did say...

668
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,141
"The Empty Man."

669
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,447
That's right.

670
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:29,840
That's an interesting phrase.

671
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:32,886
You could say
he called out to you.

672
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,801
- Or not.
- Hmm.

673
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,716
What does it mean?

674
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:39,763
The Empty Man is

675
01:13:39,937 --> 01:13:41,808
a meditation.

676
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:44,376
A focal point for
the targeted manifestation

677
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,030
of hidden energies.

678
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,727
Right. And already
you're starting to lose me.

679
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:51,383
Just as man feeds
and is fed

680
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:54,604
by the biosphere
and the atmosphere,

681
01:13:54,778 --> 01:14:00,218
so it is our thoughts feed
and are fed by the noosphere.

682
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:01,567
The noosphere?

683
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:05,005
The sum
of all conscious thought,

684
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:07,530
transmission from which
can be stimulated

685
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:10,446
through the application
of certain vectors,

686
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,491
very much like a virus.

687
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,539
You can't see it.

688
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,106
Well, what is it?

689
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:24,242
The veil between
form and flesh,

690
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,852
and the means by which
it can be pierced

691
01:14:26,026 --> 01:14:28,899
and the two allowed
to commingle.

692
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:34,774
We're each of us blind
in our way.

693
01:14:38,038 --> 01:14:39,910
Distractions
rob us of focus.

694
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,827
Technology robs us
of memory.

695
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:48,527
Repetition robs us
of comprehension.

696
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,661
You know
the child's game,

697
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,576
if you say your name
enough times,

698
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,491
it becomes gibberish?

699
01:14:57,101 --> 01:14:59,886
That holds true
for whole concepts,

700
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,411
even entire bodies
of thought.

701
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:06,937
For example,
take Nietzsche's old line,

702
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:11,071
"If you stare into an abyss,
it also stares into you."

703
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,334
Right? Well...

704
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,772
That has been
rendered meaningless

705
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:17,251
through repetition.

706
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:21,952
It's a refrigerator magnet.

707
01:15:22,126 --> 01:15:24,868
It's cliche.
It's harmless.

708
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:29,002
But when was the last time
you really thought about that?

709
01:15:29,176 --> 01:15:31,439
What is an abyss?

710
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,267
And if you
stare into it, why?

711
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:36,009
What about it calls to you?

712
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:38,142
And if it stares into you,

713
01:15:38,316 --> 01:15:40,753
it stands to reason
something in you

714
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,887
must also be
calling to it.

715
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:48,456
And that, my friend,
is anything but harmless,

716
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:49,806
if you really
reflect on it.

717
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,808
So the question becomes,

718
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:54,767
if profound meaning
can be robbed of something

719
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:59,467
by so simple a task
as repetition,

720
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,732
which is more fundamental?
Which is more true?

721
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:04,908
Your name

722
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,780
or the gibberish?

723
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:10,087
That is the Empty Man.

724
01:16:13,786 --> 01:16:15,483
I'm so glad
you came back.

725
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,268
Hope you stay longer
this time.

726
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:20,924
I've never been here before.

727
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:22,969
- And here.
- Hmm.

728
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:25,276
There must be
something about you.

729
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,105
Sir,
just one more signature.

730
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,901
Hey, man.

731
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:43,860
You, uh...

732
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:46,776
You seen this girl here?
She hang out here?

733
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:48,865
No?

734
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:51,389
Liar.

735
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:55,611
- Thank you so much.
- Give us a minute.

736
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:02,052
Hmm. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

737
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:04,750
Here.

738
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:49,839
Nothing exists.

739
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:54,191
Even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it.

740
01:17:56,062 --> 01:17:58,586
Even if something
can be known about it,

741
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:01,024
knowledge about it can't be
communicated to others.

742
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:06,246
Even if it can
be communicated,

743
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,813
it cannot be understood.

744
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:10,729
Nothing exists.

745
01:18:12,383 --> 01:18:16,561
Even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it.

746
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:20,826
Even if something
can be known about it,

747
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,047
knowledge about it can't be
communicated to others.

748
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:27,833
Even if it
can be communicated,

749
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:29,139
it cannot be understood.

750
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,552
...from his thoughts.

751
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:36,772
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

752
01:19:36,946 --> 01:19:38,948
From the dreams
comes the power.

753
01:19:39,122 --> 01:19:41,124
From the power
comes the bridge.

754
01:19:41,298 --> 01:19:43,561
From the bridge comes the man.

755
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:45,955
From the man
comes his thoughts.

756
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,174
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

757
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:50,394
From the dreams
comes the power.

758
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:53,223
From the power
comes the bridge.

759
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:54,746
From the bridge comes the...

760
01:19:58,271 --> 01:20:00,360
Shit. Shit. Shit.

761
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:04,800
Is there someone here now?

762
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:09,805
If you're here now,
show yourself.

763
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:12,329
Make yourself
known to us.

764
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:20,728
We hear you.

765
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:23,731
We're listening.

766
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:24,994
Welcome.

767
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:26,517
Show yourself.

768
01:20:28,345 --> 01:20:29,563
Show yourself.

769
01:20:58,157 --> 01:20:59,115
Would you
come with us, sir?

770
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:06,078
Huh.

771
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,515
How you doing?

772
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:12,041
Exit's that way.

773
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:28,535
You'll never get
anywhere like that, man.

774
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:30,929
Not with these cats.

775
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:32,931
Cats?

776
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:34,890
Man, these cats,

777
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:36,848
they're on another plane,
man. You know?

778
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:39,938
Like, far out
on the outer rim.

779
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,334
Aren't you a little young
for the Neal Cassady routine?

780
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,989
Who's that, man?

781
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,388
You got a smoke?

782
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:07,923
She's been here.

783
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,317
But she's not here now.

784
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:13,276
Got big plans for her.
They're moving her up.

785
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:15,104
Where is she?

786
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:16,714
Elsewhere.

787
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:19,847
Downstate.

788
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:22,459
Pontifex camp,
where they go to get PR'd.

789
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,026
What is that?

790
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:26,071
Pre-Released.

791
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:28,030
It's the First Threshold
to achieving Singularity.

792
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:30,293
Christ, this jargon.

793
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:33,078
They have bullshit names
for everything, man.

794
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,168
Comes to them in dreams,
they say.

795
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,475
His whispers.

796
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:40,956
Whose whispers?

797
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:43,959
I don't know.

798
01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:46,178
But they do.

799
01:22:50,313 --> 01:22:52,402
These aren't just flakes
and outcasts.

800
01:22:52,576 --> 01:22:55,535
They don't have 5-year plans,
they have 500-year plans.

801
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:58,321
You have no idea how dangerous
these people are, man.

802
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,105
Where's the camp?

803
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:02,978
In the forest.
Off Route 32.

804
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,588
Near the Meramec River Bridge.

805
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,357
Yeah, okay.

806
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,751
That's funny.

807
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:35,625
You guys are funny.

808
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,872
The Pontifex Society.

809
01:27:49,046 --> 01:27:51,396
We transmit. You receive.

810
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,008
Testing.

811
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:59,230
From his
thoughts comes the dream.

812
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:02,277
From the dream
comes the power.

813
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:04,844
From the power
comes the bridge.

814
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:07,325
From the bridge
comes the man.

815
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:27,693
We should turn it off.

816
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:36,789
Did you see that?

817
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:39,401
What?

818
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,578
Come give me
a hand with this.

819
01:28:55,025 --> 01:28:56,983
What the hell is he doing?

820
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:00,378
Fuck.

821
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:03,729
Nasty.

822
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:07,907
This is only getting worse.

823
01:33:30,169 --> 01:33:31,606
Yeah, no.

824
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:08,686
Come on.

825
01:34:11,036 --> 01:34:12,168
Come on!

826
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:36,235
What the fuck was that?

827
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:39,543
What the fuck was that?

828
01:34:50,423 --> 01:34:51,947
Will you be able to
identify any of them?

829
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:54,253
No. Way too dark, man.

830
01:34:54,427 --> 01:34:55,994
Uh-huh.

831
01:34:56,168 --> 01:34:59,737
And they attacked you
after you took these files?

832
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:01,478
Yeah, but that had...

833
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:04,133
There was two cabins.

834
01:35:04,307 --> 01:35:05,830
I took the files
from the first cabin.

835
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:07,919
But they wouldn't know that.
They couldn't see it.

836
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:09,399
Were these
cabins locked?

837
01:35:10,443 --> 01:35:12,881
No, they were not locked.

838
01:35:13,055 --> 01:35:15,100
Was the road
into the camp blocked?

839
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:16,580
What are you trying to say?

840
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:17,799
You're saying
that I was trespassing?

841
01:35:17,973 --> 01:35:20,062
I am trying to determine

842
01:35:20,236 --> 01:35:22,194
if you have irretrievably
fucked this investigation.

843
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,718
You can check out
the Pontifex Institute.

844
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:25,241
Major Cases
is already on it.

845
01:35:25,415 --> 01:35:26,764
This is bad news.
This is weird occult shit.

846
01:35:26,938 --> 01:35:27,722
And you are
not a cop anymore.

847
01:35:32,465 --> 01:35:33,902
Come on, Lasombra.

848
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:39,777
Just write a statement.

849
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:41,736
Everything that happened.

850
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,390
I'll be right back.

851
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,560
Nora!

852
01:36:27,346 --> 01:36:28,304
Hi.

853
01:36:29,522 --> 01:36:31,176
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

854
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:34,005
- Has anyone come by?
- No.

855
01:36:34,179 --> 01:36:35,572
- Contacted by anybody?
- Like who?

856
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:37,313
What are you doing?
James?

857
01:36:37,487 --> 01:36:39,097
Do you have a place
you can go for a few days?

858
01:36:39,271 --> 01:36:40,359
What?

859
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:42,709
I don't want
to scare you...

860
01:36:42,884 --> 01:36:45,451
Well, you are.
You are scaring me.

861
01:36:49,368 --> 01:36:51,153
James.

862
01:36:51,327 --> 01:36:53,155
Maybe I want to scare
you a little bit.

863
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:54,373
Do you remember
the Pontifex Institute?

864
01:36:54,547 --> 01:36:55,679
I told you about them.

865
01:36:55,853 --> 01:36:57,376
- Yes.
- I checked them out.

866
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,204
On the surface,
it looks like some sort of

867
01:36:59,378 --> 01:37:01,903
self-empowerment "oneness"
hippy bullshit.

868
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:04,819
But they're dangerous.

869
01:37:06,255 --> 01:37:09,954
Are you saying that
Amanda has joined a...

870
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:11,869
- A cult?
- Maybe.

871
01:37:12,043 --> 01:37:13,088
They're not connected
to any sort of

872
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:14,045
fucking church
I've ever heard of.

873
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:15,786
Oh, my God.

874
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,179
And whoever they are,
they seem to believe

875
01:37:17,353 --> 01:37:19,050
that they can channel
some sort of entity.

876
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:22,793
The Empty Man.Yeah.

877
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:23,925
Do you have place you can go?

878
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:27,189
I... I have to work.
I mean, what am I...

879
01:37:27,363 --> 01:37:28,625
Hey, hey, hey.

880
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:32,237
I think they killed
those kids, Nora.

881
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:34,413
And they know
where you live.

882
01:37:38,548 --> 01:37:39,854
Get it.

883
01:37:42,378 --> 01:37:43,379
Hello?

884
01:37:47,905 --> 01:37:49,037
Give it to me.

885
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:00,439
We need to go right now.

886
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:10,058
Get in your car,
follow me.Okay.

887
01:38:26,596 --> 01:38:28,206
I don't think
we've been followed.

888
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,470
If you see
anything suspicious,

889
01:38:31,644 --> 01:38:33,081
you'll let me know?

890
01:38:33,255 --> 01:38:34,125
Anything at all?

891
01:38:34,604 --> 01:38:35,692
Okay.

892
01:38:39,304 --> 01:38:41,002
She's dead, isn't she?

893
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,829
No, no.

894
01:38:43,004 --> 01:38:45,180
No, she's not dead.

895
01:38:45,354 --> 01:38:48,009
I think the fact that she
wasn't under that bridge

896
01:38:48,183 --> 01:38:50,272
means she's not.
Okay?

897
01:38:53,405 --> 01:38:54,363
Hey.

898
01:38:56,974 --> 01:38:58,280
Does she know?

899
01:38:58,454 --> 01:38:59,629
About what?

900
01:39:02,414 --> 01:39:04,199
About us?

901
01:39:04,373 --> 01:39:06,288
You mean the thing
we never talk about?

902
01:39:08,377 --> 01:39:10,596
No, no, I don't think so.

903
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:12,990
Why?

904
01:39:13,164 --> 01:39:14,252
You never told her?

905
01:39:15,297 --> 01:39:16,602
Why would I?

906
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,088
Do you think maybe

907
01:39:24,262 --> 01:39:26,177
we've punished ourselves
long enough?

908
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,294
Where were you?

909
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:10,439
Where were you?

910
01:40:10,613 --> 01:40:11,614
On the second night...

911
01:40:11,788 --> 01:40:12,745
On the second night,

912
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:16,445
you see him.

913
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:21,537
Where were you?

914
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:02,600
All available doctors

915
01:45:02,774 --> 01:45:04,385
to Med Wing 3.

916
01:45:04,559 --> 01:45:06,822
All available doctors
to Med Wing 3.

917
01:45:21,967 --> 01:45:26,407
EKG stat to ER.
EKG stat to ER.

918
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:38,130
All right,
I'll see you next week.

919
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:39,567
You got it.

920
01:46:48,924 --> 01:46:50,012
How you doing,
Neal Cassady?

921
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:54,799
Come here.

922
01:46:54,973 --> 01:46:56,018
Get in the car.
Get in the fucking car!

923
01:46:57,454 --> 01:46:58,716
Give me your hands.

924
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:17,256
I didn't know what
they were gonna do, man.

925
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,519
- They just told me to tell you about it. That's all.
- That's bullshit!

926
01:47:18,693 --> 01:47:19,911
Who's that guy
in the hospital?

927
01:47:20,085 --> 01:47:21,652
I saw you, freak show.
You and your buddies.

928
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:23,393
Jesus, this shit
really stings, man.

929
01:47:23,567 --> 01:47:24,655
I don't give a shit.
Who was he?

930
01:47:24,829 --> 01:47:26,135
It's hard to explain.

931
01:47:26,309 --> 01:47:27,441
Why don't you
give it a go, man?

932
01:47:27,615 --> 01:47:28,442
I'm your only friend
right now.

933
01:47:28,616 --> 01:47:30,661
He's like an antenna.

934
01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:32,533
Tuned to frequencies
we only get through him.

935
01:47:32,707 --> 01:47:34,143
He transmits, we receive.

936
01:47:35,144 --> 01:47:36,145
Fuck.

937
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,022
Get the fuck
out of the car.

938
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,332
Get on your knees.
On your knees!

939
01:47:49,506 --> 01:47:50,507
All right. Fuck.

940
01:47:51,682 --> 01:47:52,727
You say something
that makes sense,

941
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:53,902
or I swear
to fucking God...

942
01:47:54,076 --> 01:47:55,469
Thought is communicable.

943
01:47:55,643 --> 01:47:56,774
That is what
they say, okay?

944
01:47:56,948 --> 01:47:58,776
- What?
- Transmittable.

945
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:01,736
The noosphere is the sum
of all consciousness.

946
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:04,303
Not just human.
Other minds are there, too.

947
01:48:04,565 --> 01:48:05,870
- Ancient, and angry.
- You guys are all

948
01:48:06,044 --> 01:48:07,437
- fucking morons!
- You get glimpses

949
01:48:07,611 --> 01:48:08,917
in dreams and fevers,
right?

950
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:11,702
Deja vu?

951
01:48:11,876 --> 01:48:13,008
Every nightmare
you've ever had

952
01:48:13,182 --> 01:48:14,879
was just
a fucking documentary.

953
01:48:15,053 --> 01:48:16,881
But once in a while,
there's a man.

954
01:48:17,055 --> 01:48:19,754
Sometimes, only one
in 1,000 years.

955
01:48:19,928 --> 01:48:22,147
- The prophet of the other.
- The other? What other?

956
01:48:22,931 --> 01:48:24,933
The between one.

957
01:48:25,107 --> 01:48:26,935
He needs an empty man
to be a bridge

958
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:29,328
to the rest of the world.

959
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:31,896
He comes to erase
all boundaries.

960
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:34,551
The only reality is
there is no reality.

961
01:48:34,725 --> 01:48:36,771
Except for him.

962
01:48:36,945 --> 01:48:40,862
His endless, black chaos.

963
01:48:41,036 --> 01:48:44,300
Ah, things are
gonna slide, man.

964
01:48:44,561 --> 01:48:46,258
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

965
01:48:52,917 --> 01:48:55,224
You're coming down
with him already, aren't you?

966
01:48:57,705 --> 01:48:59,533
You don't even know it.

967
01:48:59,707 --> 01:49:02,884
You've got the itch
in the brain.

968
01:49:11,153 --> 01:49:13,547
I'm so sick
of your fucking shit, man.

969
01:49:15,287 --> 01:49:18,203
I grew up
in San Francisco.

970
01:49:18,377 --> 01:49:20,162
I just wanna know one thing.
Where's Amanda Quail?

971
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:25,559
She's on the bridge.

972
01:49:25,733 --> 01:49:28,910
Bridge? What bridge?

973
01:49:29,084 --> 01:49:30,738
There is no bridge.

974
01:49:30,912 --> 01:49:33,218
Haven't you been fucking listening?

975
01:51:45,263 --> 01:51:46,874
What is this?

976
01:52:09,461 --> 01:52:11,115
How do you have this?

977
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,307
How do you have any of this?

978
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:41,102
You're fucking with me.

979
01:52:57,901 --> 01:52:58,772
Where were you?

980
01:52:59,381 --> 01:53:01,078
Where were you?

981
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:06,344
Coming down with it...

982
01:53:09,217 --> 01:53:11,741
He transmits, we receive.

983
01:53:11,915 --> 01:53:13,177
On the third night...

984
01:53:13,351 --> 01:53:15,919
You've got an itch

985
01:53:16,093 --> 01:53:17,312
in the brain.

986
01:53:17,486 --> 01:53:18,792
He finds you.

987
01:53:19,053 --> 01:53:21,969
On the third night,
he finds you.

988
01:53:22,143 --> 01:53:23,971
You feel...

989
01:53:24,145 --> 01:53:25,189
In the brain.

990
01:53:25,363 --> 01:53:27,017
You feel him.

991
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:31,195
He transmits,
we receive.

992
01:53:51,868 --> 01:53:52,956
Can I help you?

993
01:53:53,914 --> 01:53:55,480
Yes.

994
01:53:55,654 --> 01:53:59,136
My name is James Lasombra.
I'm a private detective.

995
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:01,617
Been hired
to find someone,

996
01:54:01,878 --> 01:54:03,097
and I have
reason to believe

997
01:54:03,271 --> 01:54:04,620
they are a patient
in your hospital.

998
01:54:04,794 --> 01:54:07,449
So, maybe you could just
tell me about that guy,

999
01:54:07,623 --> 01:54:09,364
in that room, right there?

1000
01:54:10,974 --> 01:54:13,890
I can't divulge
patient information, sir.

1001
01:54:14,064 --> 01:54:15,936
Of course,
you can't do that.

1002
01:54:16,110 --> 01:54:18,895
Maybe you could just tell
me how long he's been here.

1003
01:54:19,983 --> 01:54:21,855
I could cross him
off my list.

1004
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,032
He's been here
for some time.

1005
01:54:25,206 --> 01:54:26,860
Since before
I started here.

1006
01:54:27,686 --> 01:54:29,210
How long ago was that?

1007
01:54:30,428 --> 01:54:32,039
Almost a year.

1008
01:54:33,431 --> 01:54:34,476
Is he stable?

1009
01:54:35,477 --> 01:54:36,478
Well, he's not
on life support,

1010
01:54:36,652 --> 01:54:37,914
if that's what you mean.

1011
01:54:38,088 --> 01:54:39,960
Oh, but he's
unresponsive?

1012
01:54:41,265 --> 01:54:43,006
He fluctuates between
a three and a nine

1013
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,660
on the Glasgow
Coma Scale.

1014
01:54:46,444 --> 01:54:47,968
Usually, he's a three.

1015
01:54:48,969 --> 01:54:50,318
What does that mean?

1016
01:54:50,492 --> 01:54:53,495
Unresponsive to stimuli,
non-vocal, eyes closed.

1017
01:54:53,669 --> 01:54:56,237
Uh-huh.
Is it common

1018
01:54:56,411 --> 01:54:59,196
for someone who's stable to
be in the ICU for that long?

1019
01:55:00,284 --> 01:55:01,329
No.

1020
01:55:03,244 --> 01:55:05,028
It's not common.

1021
01:55:05,202 --> 01:55:06,900
What makes him
so special?

1022
01:55:10,991 --> 01:55:14,298
He was admitted to Bellevue
23 years ago.

1023
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:16,257
Five years later,

1024
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:19,390
he was transferred
to Stockham Health.

1025
01:55:19,564 --> 01:55:22,437
Then a private clinic
in Cedar Rapids,

1026
01:55:22,611 --> 01:55:24,569
until two years ago.

1027
01:55:27,137 --> 01:55:28,660
Then who brought him here?

1028
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:30,967
I don't know.

1029
01:55:31,141 --> 01:55:34,884
Maybe they were
treating him experimentally

1030
01:55:35,058 --> 01:55:36,277
and he took a turn.

1031
01:55:36,451 --> 01:55:38,540
- Took a turn?
- Took a turn for the worse.

1032
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:42,022
Maybe he took a turn
for the better.

1033
01:55:43,371 --> 01:55:45,286
Either way,
they sent him on to us.

1034
01:55:46,983 --> 01:55:49,029
I suppose it won't hurt
to tell you.

1035
01:55:51,031 --> 01:55:54,121
As far as I know,
he doesn't have a name.

1036
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:56,645
- He's a John Doe?
- Mm.

1037
01:55:58,212 --> 01:56:01,215
And who pays John Doe's bills?

1038
01:56:01,389 --> 01:56:03,565
I'm sure
I don't know.

1039
01:56:03,739 --> 01:56:06,698
But he certainly gets
a lot of visitors.

1040
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,527
They come and go all the time.

1041
01:56:09,701 --> 01:56:11,965
There's one in there
with him right now.

1042
01:56:21,409 --> 01:56:23,324
So, what do you think?

1043
01:56:25,369 --> 01:56:28,068
Is he the man
you've been looking for?

1044
01:56:30,287 --> 01:56:31,593
I don't know.

1045
01:56:34,683 --> 01:56:36,163
May I?

1046
01:56:37,425 --> 01:56:39,035
Go right ahead.

1047
01:57:04,408 --> 01:57:05,366
Hello, Amanda.

1048
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,499
Been looking for you.

1049
01:57:08,673 --> 01:57:10,066
Well, you found me.

1050
01:57:22,818 --> 01:57:24,080
Who is he?

1051
01:57:25,429 --> 01:57:26,561
You know who he is.

1052
01:57:26,735 --> 01:57:28,432
No, I don't.

1053
01:57:28,606 --> 01:57:29,955
What's his name?

1054
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:32,349
I have no idea.

1055
01:57:32,523 --> 01:57:34,656
You can call him
whatever you'd like.

1056
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:37,311
I like to think of him
as a carrier.

1057
01:57:37,485 --> 01:57:39,661
Because he's like a disease,
in a way.

1058
01:57:39,835 --> 01:57:44,448
But he's also like
a carrier signal, you know?

1059
01:57:44,622 --> 01:57:47,103
Modulated by
an input signal.

1060
01:57:47,277 --> 01:57:49,932
He transmits, we receive.

1061
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:52,065
And his message is contagious.

1062
01:57:55,807 --> 01:57:57,244
I need to call your mom.

1063
01:58:04,468 --> 01:58:06,122
- Hello?
- Nora, it's me.

1064
01:58:06,296 --> 01:58:07,428
I found Amanda.

1065
01:58:07,602 --> 01:58:09,212
I'm sorry, who is this?

1066
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:11,649
It's me, James.

1067
01:58:11,823 --> 01:58:12,955
Who are you calling for?

1068
01:58:13,129 --> 01:58:14,217
Nora? Yes?

1069
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:15,566
It's me.

1070
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:17,786
Nora, it's me. I'm so sorry.

1071
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:18,917
It's James. My name... I think you have
the wrong number.

1072
01:58:19,179 --> 01:58:20,658
I'm James.

1073
01:58:25,576 --> 01:58:27,404
What the fuck is going on?

1074
01:58:27,578 --> 01:58:29,711
He's weakening now.

1075
01:58:29,885 --> 01:58:31,669
There's only so long
a human body can withstand

1076
01:58:31,843 --> 01:58:33,671
this kind of power.

1077
01:58:35,499 --> 01:58:37,675
We need to find a replacement.

1078
01:58:41,157 --> 01:58:42,637
And soon.

1079
01:58:43,855 --> 01:58:45,683
Replacement?

1080
01:58:45,857 --> 01:58:47,207
Well, there were 500 years

1081
01:58:47,381 --> 01:58:49,426
between the last carrier
and this one.

1082
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,299
We didn't have
that kind of time.

1083
01:58:52,473 --> 01:58:55,737
So we decided to try something
a little bit radical.

1084
01:58:56,868 --> 01:58:58,696
An experiment.

1085
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:01,046
What kind of experiment?

1086
01:59:01,221 --> 01:59:02,657
We decided to make one.

1087
01:59:10,621 --> 01:59:12,101
It's getting hard
to tell what's real

1088
01:59:12,275 --> 01:59:14,277
and what's in your head
anymore, isn't it?

1089
01:59:14,451 --> 01:59:16,627
Listen to your thoughts.
You can hear him, can't you?

1090
01:59:16,801 --> 01:59:18,934
Squirming his way in,

1091
01:59:19,195 --> 01:59:20,588
crowding you out.

1092
01:59:20,762 --> 01:59:22,503
Did you know that
the brain can itch?

1093
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:26,246
Imagine an overwhelming itch

1094
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:27,812
deep in the base
of your skull.

1095
01:59:28,422 --> 01:59:29,336
That's him.

1096
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:31,076
You're fucking crazy.

1097
01:59:31,251 --> 01:59:33,427
It's not real.
It's not fucking real.

1098
01:59:33,601 --> 01:59:36,343
Of course it's not,
so why fight it?

1099
01:59:36,517 --> 01:59:38,475
You must detach
from a false reality

1100
01:59:38,649 --> 01:59:40,434
in order to attach
to a new one.

1101
01:59:40,608 --> 01:59:42,175
A stronger one.

1102
01:59:42,349 --> 01:59:43,959
You're fucking crazy.

1103
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,482
I bet you thought
I didn't know about

1104
01:59:45,656 --> 01:59:47,441
your little indiscretion
with my mother.

1105
01:59:47,702 --> 01:59:49,225
No!

1106
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:51,401
Well, I not only
knew about it,

1107
01:59:51,575 --> 01:59:53,273
I made it happen.

1108
01:59:53,447 --> 01:59:55,710
I wrote it into your script
when we created you.

1109
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:58,974
What are you talking about?

1110
01:59:59,235 --> 02:00:00,889
What high school
did you go to?

1111
02:00:02,499 --> 02:00:03,805
Crossroads.

1112
02:00:05,285 --> 02:00:06,547
What hospital
were you born in?

1113
02:00:07,678 --> 02:00:10,594
Emancipated Heart.

1114
02:00:10,768 --> 02:00:12,770
- And what day were you born?
- November 7th.

1115
02:00:12,944 --> 02:00:16,818
No, it was three days ago,
remember?

1116
02:00:16,992 --> 02:00:18,689
You spent it alone
in a Mexican restaurant

1117
02:00:18,863 --> 02:00:21,301
and the waiters all
sang you Happy Birthday.

1118
02:00:21,475 --> 02:00:23,694
We made you as a group.

1119
02:00:23,868 --> 02:00:25,566
We wrote up a complete
biography for you,

1120
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:28,395
and focused on it intently
for several sessions

1121
02:00:28,569 --> 02:00:30,310
to conjure you
into being.

1122
02:00:32,877 --> 02:00:34,227
You are our Tulpa.

1123
02:00:34,792 --> 02:00:37,491
Our Empty Man.

1124
02:00:37,665 --> 02:00:41,408
Thought plus concentration
plus time equals flesh.

1125
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,498
Your flesh.

1126
02:00:47,936 --> 02:00:50,286
We tried once before
but failed.

1127
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:51,722
The signal can
only penetrate

1128
02:00:51,896 --> 02:00:55,465
through the cracks
of sorrow, grief, and guilt.

1129
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:58,512
Fear. That's what
we were missing.

1130
02:00:58,686 --> 02:00:59,600
Shut up.

1131
02:00:59,774 --> 02:01:01,645
So we built you that way.

1132
02:01:02,777 --> 02:01:04,561
Shut up!

1133
02:01:04,735 --> 02:01:07,260
What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

1134
02:01:09,349 --> 02:01:12,134
Go on. You can say it.

1135
02:01:15,398 --> 02:01:17,270
Fuck you!

1136
02:01:20,969 --> 02:01:23,493
It was the death of
Allison and Henry, wasn't it?

1137
02:01:29,064 --> 02:01:31,284
The death of your wife
and son.

1138
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:38,334
And where were you

1139
02:01:39,422 --> 02:01:41,294
when they needed you the most?

1140
02:01:43,034 --> 02:01:46,299
Nothing you do
is in your control.

1141
02:01:46,473 --> 02:01:49,084
You cannot make
your own choices.

1142
02:01:49,345 --> 02:01:52,305
You're not your own man.
You're our man.

1143
02:01:55,438 --> 02:01:57,875
But isn't that
a relief, really?

1144
02:01:58,049 --> 02:02:00,574
Isn't that what
you want most anyway?

1145
02:02:00,748 --> 02:02:02,315
So just let go.

1146
02:02:03,881 --> 02:02:07,885
Wouldn't it be easier
to just let go?

1147
02:02:08,059 --> 02:02:10,453
From the bridge comes the man.

1148
02:02:10,627 --> 02:02:12,890
From the man
comes his thoughts.

1149
02:02:13,064 --> 02:02:14,892
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

1150
