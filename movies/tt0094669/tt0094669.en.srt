2
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,706
- Did you get soaked, Ginny?
- Begin Mr. Cope.

3
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,442
- Of course I didn't.
- Very well.

4
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:58,493
Don't worry about me.

5
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:05,864
In this will your late husband left you
a life interest in his entire estate.

6
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,952
After your death it is to be
distributed equally among the children.

7
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:15,129
As you know, Elmer relied upon you
to look after them.

8
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,752
No more than my duty
when I became their stepmother.

9
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:22,132
However Mrs Boynton, there is a second will.

10
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,135
Second will?

11
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:26,895
Signed two days before he died.

12
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:31,315
This is the last will and
testament of Elmer D. Boynton...

13
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,461
of Milk House, Spiddletown, New Jersey...

14
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:36,203
Just the meat and potatoes Mr. Cope.

15
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,695
The estate is to be divided equally.

16
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:44,535
You and the children
receiving approximately...

17
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,198
$200,000 each.

18
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:50,119
I don't believe it.

19
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,879
Bring that here. I want
to see that for myself.

20
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:58,209
Elmer knew the children were not fit
to take control of their own affairs.

21
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:00,211
He must've changed his mind.

22
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:03,590
Elmer changed his mind
only under my direction.

23
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,769
It's perfectly valid Mrs Boynton.

24
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,020
Shall we read the will?

25
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,478
Have you ever done a discreditable act,
Mr. Cope?

26
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,564
Not professionally, I hope.

27
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:25,071
The affair of the Bolivian silver-mining
corporation slipped your memory?

28
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,657
I'm not sure what you're...

29
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,914
It used to be called share pushing Mr. Cope.

30
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:33,577
If it were to come to the attention
of the United States Law Society...

31
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:38,333
you'd be instantly disbarred
and probably go to prison as well.

32
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:40,169
How did you know about that?

33
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,839
I did not serve in the prison
service 14 years for nothing.

34
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:49,935
People trusted me with their little secrets.

35
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,354
Your partner, for example.

36
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:58,267
She went inside, didn't she?

37
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:04,193
She told me all about you,
and I can prove it.

38
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:09,655
Well Mrs Boynton,
I was, I was young, ambitious.

39
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,579
This room has gotten a little chilly.

40
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:16,253
Why not get a nice cheerful blaze going?

41
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,341
Go ahead.

42
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,886
A wise decision Mr. Cope.

43
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:35,304
Now we'll call the others.

44
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,276
Bring in the children.

45
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:49,699
My dearest children, Lennox...

46
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:54,542
Carol, Raymond and Ginevra...

47
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,127
I leave in the good and loving hands
of Emily Boynton.

48
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:04,091
And to my wife, Emily Boynton,
I leave a life interest in my estate.

49
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,130
On her death I leave it shared equally...

50
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:11,343
among my aforementioned and beloved children.

51
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:13,808
- No.
- Jesus Christ, what?

52
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,604
Impossible.

53
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,231
I don't believe it.

54
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,728
And now, children, I have a lovely surprise.

55
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,813
Another one, Stepmother?

56
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:28,568
My three stepchildren, whom I love
as I do my own daughter Ginevra...

57
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,907
and you, Nadine, my dear daughter-in-law...

58
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:37,330
I've arranged for us all to go
to Europe and the Holy Land.

59
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,953
It will clear the air of death.

60
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,168
- Does that include Mr. Cope?
- Certainly not.

61
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,674
Mr. Cope has work to do here.

62
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,053
Smile.

63
00:04:58,243 --> 00:04:59,263
Attagirl.

64
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:01,349
Come on.

65
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,146
Like that.

66
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,325
That's pretty.

67
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,390
Oh, my.

68
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:57,803
Just as I thought.

69
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,039
That will look great.

70
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,575
Nadine, please, my medicine.

71
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,373
Quickly, please.

72
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,489
Yes Mother.

73
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,168
Someone should be with Mother.

74
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,295
I'd like to push her over.

75
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:55,840
You really think there was another will?

76
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,418
I know there is. Father told me.

77
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:02,927
Daddy said
I was to have $200,000 all to myself.

78
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,216
You see?

79
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,772
What's the point of knowing about it
if we can't do anything about it?

80
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,816
Oh, my dear...

81
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:14,191
It's all right, some girl got to help her.

82
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,358
So I see.

83
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,864
Can I help you? I am a doctor, well, just.

84
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,358
Just?

85
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:24,783
Nadine, over here quickly.

86
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:28,677
When I get back
I'm going to have it out with Cope.

87
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,914
You can do it now.

88
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,040
- Don't be silly, Ginny.
- Look, he's here over by the car.

89
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,626
Let me see.

90
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,795
She's right, he's there.

91
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,590
Cope us here Mother, did you ask him?

92
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:50,181
Of course he's not here.
Here, give a lira to that girl for her help.

93
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,899
- He's not really here, is he?
- Sure he is, by the terrace cafe.

94
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,230
Nadine, where are you going?

95
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:06,660
Excuse me.
My mother asked me to give you this.

96
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,285
I can afford to buy my own cup of coffee,
thank you.

97
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,044
I helped your mother because I'm a doctor.

98
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,247
You are?

99
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:18,298
Yes, I've just graduated.

100
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,005
I'm sure you did.

101
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,258
Excuse me.

102
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,815
What is the point in authorizing a guide...

103
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:38,514
if, as you say Miss Quinton,
he gets his facts wrong?

104
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,148
It's easy to make a mistake
about dates, Lady Westholme.

105
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:47,117
Confusing Romanesque and Gothic
is not a mistake. It is ignorance.

106
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,448
What's the matter Miss Quinton?

107
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,032
I seem to have lost my cigarette case.

108
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:55,709
That man masquerading as a guide
probably stole it.

109
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,375
Where is he?

110
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,218
Officer.

111
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:03,045
I want that man arrested.

112
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,507
I am Lady Westholme,
a member of the British Parliaments.

113
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,435
That man there is a thief.
You must arrest him.

114
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,431
Officer, I told you. You must arrest him.

115
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,984
Oh, dear.

116
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,105
Hi.

117
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,708
- I told you not to come.
- I had to.

118
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:42,793
My husband tells me there's another will.
Is that so, Jefferson?

119
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:46,097
Nadine darling, I'm your mother's attorney.
I can't divulge that.

120
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:50,398
You think if there's no money for him I'll be
forced to leave Lennox and come with you.

121
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
I think you'll come anyway.

122
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:08,654
Well, now what if Lennox sees that?
When can I use it with that inscription?

123
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,913
Whenever you want.

124
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:14,114
You want him to find out, don't you?

125
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,209
Mademoiselle.

126
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,416
Poirot.

127
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,089
- Hercule Poirot.
- Yes.

128
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,378
Thank you.

129
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:30,051
What are you doing in Trieste?

130
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:35,302
I'm taking a well-earned vacation Miss King.
Or is it already Doctor?

131
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,390
It's Doctor. I graduated with honors.

132
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:39,743
Probably passed it on to an accomplice
by now.

133
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,274
Oh, dear.

134
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:45,490
I have heard you enough
for the rest of my life.

135
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:48,777
Lady Westholme is always arguing
with somebody.

136
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:51,989
Lady Westholme? But she sounds American.

137
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, her name was Laura Vansittart.

138
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:58,370
She met Lord Westholme on a boat trip
back from America.

139
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:02,037
You know, within a month they were married...

140
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:05,169
and 10 years later
she's a member of our Parliament.

141
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,262
Which shows the danger of ocean travel.

142
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,884
This will be good fun.

143
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,634
Go away, Ray.

144
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,472
Look who I found.

145
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,639
Get up with me, Nadine.

146
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:24,360
Lennox, you take Ray and Carol and walk.
We're going back to the ship.

147
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:25,857
Yes Mother.

148
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:28,616
Lennox.

149
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,453
Good morning, Emily. I decided to join you.

150
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,489
You should be in America, Jefferson,
sorting out the family's affairs.

151
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,621
Yes, well,
I thought I might sort affairs out here.

152
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,373
Driver. To the port.

153
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,678
You know that young man?

154
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,771
His mother nearly became my first client.

155
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,264
Look here. I've found it.

156
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:07,276
I've got a deep and awful fear that those
ladies are going to be on the ship with us.

157
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,080
Lennox, Nadine, come along.

158
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:22,460
Mrs Boynton.

159
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,872
What have you got there? It's a duck.

160
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:28,125
Oh, God. It's a dead duck.

161
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:30,798
Good evening.

162
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,431
Miss Quinton, I thought we'd lost you.

163
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,225
- A friend of mine from England.
- No, thank you.

164
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,225
- May I have some barley water?
- Seems a very nice person.

165
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,104
Miss Quinton has to be careful.

166
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,771
She is to take charge
of the excavations at Qumran.

167
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,653
Hercule Poirot?

168
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,948
The Belgian?

169
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:59,823
He's missing an excellent Meursault.

170
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,848
Ray, will you dance with me?

171
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,221
You're tired, Ginevra. Better go to bed.

172
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,634
I'm not tired Mother. Come on, Ray.

173
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:23,097
- It's 9 o'clock. You go to bed, young lady.
- I won't.

174
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,851
Come on, Ginny. I'll go with you.

175
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:29,005
Sit down, Nadine.
The child prefers to go by herself.

176
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,864
Yes, I'd rather go alone. Thank you, Nadine.

177
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,501
Mrs Boynton, would you care to dance?

178
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:52,458
You don't mind, do you, Lennox,
if I take your wife for a spin?

179
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:57,549
- He's very daring.
- I'll say he's got a lot of nerve.

180
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:00,393
You may call me Nadine if you like.

181
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,102
Okey-dokey, Nadine.

182
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:08,025
When we get to Jaffa
why don't we just disappear...

183
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,730
you and me together?

184
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,939
Why Mr. Cope, the things you do say.

185
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:34,337
Young man, look through here.
And this is how you get it to focus.

186
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,301
You understand? You move this.
But not until I tell you.

187
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,011
Ready?

188
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:44,927
One, two, three.

189
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:47,223
You took it too soon.

190
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,395
- This is charming.
- Yes, indeed.

191
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:53,650
Have a good time.

192
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,195
- Sarwazi Swizzle.
- Sì, signore.

193
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:05,828
Hello.

194
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:12,213
- We met in Trieste.
- Yes. You're from England?

195
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:17,125
We went there. It rained.

196
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,304
It often does.

197
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,348
What's that?

198
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,014
When we get to Jaffa, let's just disappear.

199
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,227
What do we use for money?

200
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:37,105
I'm not trained for anything.
You're not even a qualified nurse.

201
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,943
It'd be hopeless.

202
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:42,071
Not as hopeless as living with your mother.

203
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:44,036
She can't live forever.

204
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:46,166
She'll live.

205
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:53,626
Good morning Monsieur Poirot.
How are you feeling today?

206
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:57,209
You're going to administer
the last rites, Doctor?

207
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,508
I have some Hyoscine syrup.

208
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:02,171
Here, two drops will cure you.

209
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,327
Four drops will kill me,
so count them carefully in that case.

210
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,900
Don't mess with me, Jefferson.

211
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,010
You're having an affair
with a married woman...

212
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,993
who happens to be my daughter-in-law.

213
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:28,034
When we get to Jaffa, I suggest you
leave us and go back to America.

214
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,326
They know about the will, Emily.

215
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,211
Elmer told Lennox, and he told Ginevra.

216
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:42,295
Why don't you give them some money?
Let them enjoy it while they're still young?

217
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,473
I spent 14 years in prison, Jefferson.

218
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,310
As a matron.

219
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,388
It was still prison.

220
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,022
I'm used to prison.

221
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,151
You're not.

222
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:59,819
Elmer never made a second will.
Do you understand? Never.

223
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,274
Stay away from my family.

224
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:07,154
I've done things in my life
that I'm not proud of, Emily.

225
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:13,581
Right now, I must tell you,
it surprises even me.

226
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,584
I'm ready to do something decent.

227
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,461
I want those children of yours
to have a chance.

228
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,679
You may be right.

229
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:31,478
I'm sorry that I threatened you, but...

230
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,813
Join us tonight for dinner, will you?

231
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,098
Well...

232
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:39,812
One way or another
you're one of the family after all.

233
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,417
That's terribly nice of you, Emily.

234
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,407
- It'll all work out.
- I'm sure it will.

235
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,489
Now just let me get some rest.

236
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:57,253
See you at dinner.

237
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,818
She fixed the will. We're trapped.

238
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:29,120
You do see, don't you?
She's got to be killed.

239
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:31,572
She's not even our mother.

240
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,616
Look what she's doing to us now.

241
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,442
She treats us like we're puppy dogs.

242
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:44,516
Exactly. Can you think of any other way?

243
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:15,454
Monsieur Poirot, at last you surface
to join us at the Captain's table.

244
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,291
Look at them. So garish.

245
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:22,004
I am sometimes ashamed
of my fellow countrymen.

246
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:24,920
Yes, but you are British now, Lady Westholme.

247
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:28,592
In fact you are a member of Parliament.
Is that not unique?

248
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:31,598
I've been British for 10 years, monsieur.

249
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:35,801
I consider myself merely a colonial
who returned to the fold.

250
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,345
Oh, my dear.

251
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:44,103
A magnum of Louis Roederer Cristal, 1928.

252
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,485
To celebrate our last night on the ship.

253
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,186
Lennox darling,
I must've left my watch in the cabin.

254
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,743
Be a dear and get it for me, would you?

255
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,610
Of course.

256
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,948
Nadine, how careless of you.

257
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,622
Cope's coming.

258
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,084
- Mother asked him.
- She did?

259
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:03,333
Good evening, everyone.

260
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:05,706
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Jefferson.

261
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,131
Ravishing.

262
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,680
Excellent.

263
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,349
No, no, no. Let me.

264
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:16,969
It's lucky to pour your own wine.
Your glass, Carol.

265
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,814
Hi. Do you loop-de-la?

266
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:21,013
Loop-de-la?

267
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,609
Jitterbug?

268
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:26,488
I nearly tried
that once, I think I fell over.

269
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,066
Jefferson, your glass.

270
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,272
Fell over?

271
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:32,320
Well, doesn't everyone?
It's such a strange dance.

272
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:36,787
Well, listen, some of the guys in the band...

273
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:40,249
you know, when the old fogies
have gone to bed...

274
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,874
they really start to boogie.

275
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:45,919
Here, around midnight, would you?

276
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:49,258
I'd be most interested in boogieing with you,
Mr. Boynton.

277
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:50,423
Great.

278
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:51,793
Jefferson.

279
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:53,963
Thank you.

280
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,140
See you later.

281
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,521
Ray, your glass.

282
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:02,231
Careful, it's very full.

283
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,688
- There you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

284
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,942
Do you think we'll get much time?

285
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,523
Lennox not back?

286
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,820
- He won't be a minute.
- Never mind.

287
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,153
Get up.

288
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:19,363
To us all, the family and our dear lawyer.

289
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,249
Health and happiness.

290
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,220
You bastard.

291
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,476
I knew no good would come
from him being here.

292
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:43,183
Good God.

293
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:46,019
He's such a nice young man usually.

294
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,278
Oh, no.

295
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:53,280
To my dearest Nadine,
may we always be together.

296
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,819
Lennox shouldn't have hit him.
It's no way for a gentleman to behave.

297
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:59,409
It was just a figure of speech.

298
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,369
Get him, get him away from me.

299
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:06,494
Off.

300
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,334
All right, let's settle down, take it easy.

301
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:14,503
Did you see him? He's a mad man.

302
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,801
These Americans, scandalous behaviour.

303
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,511
What next, I wonder?

304
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:24,605
Next, madam, we arrive in the Holy Land.

305
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:52,713
Come along, Dr. King.
I've arranged a little priority for us.

306
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:55,375
- Priority?
- Baksheesh is the word.

307
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,215
Poirot.

308
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,137
Poirot, good to see you, old fellow.

309
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:05,513
Yes, Colonel Carbury. May I present Dr. King?

310
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,141
This is Colonel Carbury.
He's an old friend of mine...

311
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:13,648
and he is responsible
for keeping the peace in this Holy Land.

312
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,739
Colonel.

313
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,948
Colonel, are you here to meet me?

314
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:21,700
I am Lady Westholme,
a member of His Majesty's government.

315
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:26,948
Your Ladyship, the Governor's
representative Mr. Bickerstaff is over there.

316
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,267
- Where have you been?
- Good morning, Lady Westholme.

317
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,748
Are you staying at the American Colony,
Miss King?

318
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:37,654
- We are on the same tour.
- Well, let me take you there.

319
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,842
Thank you.

320
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:40,757
Poirot and I are old friends.

321
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,926
We were together in India.
In Burma, I believe it was.

322
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:48,015
What on earth has brought you out here,
old chap?

323
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:51,477
Oh, I don't know. A nose for murder, perhaps.

324
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:53,736
Murder? Where?

325
00:25:53,831 --> 00:25:56,110
Oh, no, it hasn't happened yet.

326
00:25:57,085 --> 00:26:00,905
I hope it doesn't happen.
Quite enough to keep us busy here already.

327
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,367
This vehicle is disgusting.

328
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:07,874
We have you down for six days
in Jerusalem Mr. Cope...

329
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,498
and then Qumran for another four.

330
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:14,039
Qumran is particularly interesting.
It's on the Dead Sea.

331
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:15,211
Excuse me.

332
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:16,661
I'll wait for you here sir.

333
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,228
Miss Quinton, isn't it?

334
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:25,806
Oh, you were the young man
who was involved in the incident last night.

335
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:29,761
How nice of you to call me young.
Where are you going in Palestine?

336
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:35,064
To Qumran. I'm an archaeologist.
I love digging.

337
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:37,478
I'm a lawyer. I like digging too.

338
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:44,658
- How long have you been an archaeologist?
- About 10 years.

339
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:47,748
I'll deal with this, Nadine. Jefferson.

340
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,124
Would you excuse me?

341
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:56,749
I think it best, Jefferson, if you
distanced yourself from us for a while.

342
00:26:56,978 --> 00:27:02,009
As a matter of fact, Emily, I have only just
made arrangements to fore go Jerusalem.

343
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:05,348
I will be going directly to Qumran to dig.

344
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:10,021
Digging too much can be dangerous.

345
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:19,529
Jerusalem was the capital
of Judea and Samaria.

346
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:22,782
The Jewish people had a state here
in Biblical times.

347
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,869
Yes, now they flock in
from every country in Europe.

348
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:28,659
Makes a lot of
trouble for us, I can tell you.

349
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,450
Well, I thought that man, Weizmann,
put it rather well the other day...

350
00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:34,999
before Lord Peel's
commission here in Jerusalem.

351
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:37,918
There are six million
Jews in Europe, he said...

352
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,010
for whom the world is divided into two parts.

353
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:45,674
Places in which they are not allowed to live
and places they cannot enter.

354
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:48,008
It will have to be solved.

355
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,935
Do you want to go out tonight, Poirot?

356
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:58,689
Give me one good night on Terra firma.
I'll do anything you want tomorrow.

357
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,195
- Well, let me see you in then.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

358
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:15,040
Isn't that the girl from the ship?

359
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:31,603
Smile.

360
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:37,640
Lennox, if Daddy had
intended to leave me a lot of money...

361
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:40,024
wouldn't he have told Mr. Cope about it?

362
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:43,528
And why did Mr. Cope disappear?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

363
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:48,821
They turned me out
because I have on a sleeveless dress.

364
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,872
Apparently, the Almighty
doesn't like my arms...

365
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:54,868
in spite of having made them.

366
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,162
Sleeves are holy.

367
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:09,256
So picturesque. I just love it.

368
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,102
Young man, press that. Not yet.

369
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,145
Lady Westholme.

370
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,322
This is the men's section.
You are not allowed.

371
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:28,738
Press the button. Press the button.

372
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:34,705
This is the back of the
Holy Sepulchre Church, you understand.

373
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:36,286
Mind the steps.

374
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:39,496
Wait now. Don't all rush.

375
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:43,082
Raymond, come here.

376
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:46,003
Is all well, madame?

377
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:49,762
What are my sufferings
compared to those of our Redeemer?

378
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,845
Of course. I thought
since my friend there is a doctor...

379
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,186
Hi, can I see you tonight after dinner?

380
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:59,603
Oh, I...

381
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,894
The Cafe El Arish.
It's in the square behind the hotel.

382
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:05,393
- Right.
- Raymond.

383
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:11,695
Now where are Nadine and Lennox?

384
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:13,985
Smile.

385
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:17,873
Come on. You're not still sulking
over Jefferson, are you?

386
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,047
It's a good one.

387
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:29,297
I love you, Lennox. You know that.
I want our marriage to work.

388
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,130
Nadine. Lennox.

389
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:35,976
But it won't unless we can get away
from your mother.

390
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,556
Come here.

391
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:47,280
We have so much to see.
Goodbye Monsieur Poirot.

392
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,562
Goodbye, madame.

393
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:49,819
Come along, children.

394
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,408
- Mother, can I go swimming?
- Swimming is dangerous, Ginevra.

395
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,056
May we go to the Dead Sea?
I hear it's full of salt.

396
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:58,664
The proud mother hen with her chicks.

397
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,494
She's a monster.

398
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:04,086
Are you getting emotionally involved,
dear Doctor?

399
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:06,789
Come.

400
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,739
Dr. King.

401
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,238
Hi, I'm Carol Boynton.
I have a message for you from Raymond.

402
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,742
I had a feeling he might not turn up.

403
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:48,044
He wanted to, but he wasn't feeling well.
My stepmother went on at him.

404
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:49,843
About me?

405
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:55,175
Before her marriage,
our stepmother was a wardress in a prison.

406
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:58,510
My father was the governor,
and he married her.

407
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:03,035
- And she still a wardress to us.
- How old are you?

408
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:06,282
Twenty two, Ray is a year older than I am.

409
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,735
Why don't you leave home?

410
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:11,489
We wouldn't know where to go or what to do.

411
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:14,279
No one outside can really understand.

412
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,819
I think I understand quite well.

413
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:25,706
Please, Ray is very sorry.
He really would like to meet you.

414
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:39,892
You're back early, Dr. King. Why don't you
join Colonel Carbury and myself?

415
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:42,138
- I could do with a drink, thank you.
- Yes.

416
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,999
Sit down here. I'll order for you.
What would you like?

417
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,899
This is an awful lot of money.
You'd better do the job properly.

418
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:00,072
Are you sure this is the normal fee
for the work?

419
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,528
I thought you ought to see this sir.

420
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,044
Oh, Lord.

421
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:17,633
Something serious?

422
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,297
Some American is disappeared from Qumran.

423
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:23,061
Qumran? Isn't that by the Dead Sea?

424
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,219
This American, do we have anything on him?

425
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:30,811
- His name is...
- Jefferson Cope.

426
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:32,984
How on earth did you know that?

427
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:35,740
Ascribe it to the little Grey cells.

428
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:40,243
I have some slight knowledge of the fellow.

429
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:42,869
Perhaps I could help?

430
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:45,077
Would you?

431
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,999
Will you be going out today sir?

432
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:49,196
- Good morning, Hercule.
- Bonjour, Doctor.

433
00:33:56,606 --> 00:34:00,925
Mother, please. I'm not a child anymore.

434
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,143
That voice.

435
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:07,355
Go upstairs, Ray darling,
and get my digitalis. I don't feel very well.

436
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:11,101
Will you be going out, then?

437
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,073
Mrs Boynton...

438
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:25,923
you have tried to prevent your son
and daughter from making friends with me.

439
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:28,791
Well, it's just
pathetic and rather ludicrous.

440
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:32,911
Why be an ogre?
You could be kind if you tried.

441
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:37,541
I never forget. Remember that.

442
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,213
I never forget anything...

443
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,301
not an action...

444
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:46,800
not a name, not a face.

445
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,269
Dr. King.

446
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:55,871
I believe you too, are going
by car to Qumran?

447
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:56,894
Yes.

448
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,250
I've already complained
about the first one our tour company sent.

449
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:02,816
I am insisting on decent transport.

450
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:07,244
Perhaps you will accord me
the pleasure of coming to Qumran with me?

451
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,500
Colonel Carbury has placed
a car at my disposal.

452
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:14,834
Monsieur Poirot, did I hear you say
you had a car available?

453
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:17,416
I shall be going with Monsieur Poirot.

454
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,564
- Be sure I get a complete rebate.
- I'll do my very best for you, madam.

455
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,214
A most gracious gesture.

456
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:26,511
I think so, yes. All
right, let's go to Qumran.

457
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:38,021
I'm so looking forward to this.
The desert, the sand, local animals.

458
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:40,771
I do hope I've brought enough film
for my camera.

459
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,191
I have so much I want to record.

460
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:51,119
Thank you. I'm Hercule Poirot.

461
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:52,746
The Hercule Poirot?

462
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:55,122
- My name is Healey sir.
- Oh, yes.

463
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:56,775
We work along the same lines...

464
00:35:56,776 --> 00:36:00,976
putting together a case from little scraps
of evidence that don't seem to make sense.

465
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:03,712
And what news of Mr. Cope?

466
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,764
Not a thing, I'm afraid.

467
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,308
And there's more bad news.
Miss Quinton has vanished too.

468
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:11,185
Miss Quinton and Mr. Cope?

469
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,058
I can't believe it.

470
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,644
What are those people doing?

471
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:21,314
- Why, they're digging Mrs...
- Lady Westholme.

472
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:25,572
Why are they digging when they should be
searching for Miss Quinton?

473
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:27,203
Sarah King.

474
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:30,580
Here. Here. Here.
I wish you all would please listen to me.

475
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,374
We have a lady missing.

476
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,120
- There's so much coming and going.
- I want you to stop your digging now.

477
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:39,129
Visitors and archaeologists
and other excavations.

478
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:42,335
It was only today we realised
that Miss Quinton had gone.

479
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:46,179
She's very small, very petite.
Why don't you all pay attention?

480
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:49,183
- Did they both go together?
- Well...

481
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,029
Hello, lady. Look, I found something.
For the cigarette.

482
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:56,524
And what do you think of that?

483
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,767
Think of what, madame? What is it?

484
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:01,604
Miss Quinton's cigarette case.

485
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,274
She's always losing it.

486
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,941
It is a vital clue to her whereabouts.

487
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:09,448
What is that?

488
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,864
Horsemen. Quite a lot of them.

489
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,036
Well, maybe it's their abductors.

490
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:18,495
I think the truth
is probably more prosaic than that.

491
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,717
It usually is you know, Dr. King,
despite appearances.

492
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:27,128
Goodness me, there she is.

493
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,130
How immensely theatrical.

494
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:34,303
I hoped to see something like this.

495
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:36,431
Remind me not to do this again.

496
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,232
Miss Quinton, you've caused much anxiety.

497
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:45,021
Oh, really? Oh, dear.
Well, we were only in the next valley.

498
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:48,069
- You were?
- We enjoyed an Arabian night in the desert.

499
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:49,655
It was great fun.

500
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,489
I can imagine it was.

501
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:55,497
Shucran. Thank you very much.
See you again, I hope.

502
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:00,082
Well, we rejoice that the lambs
that were lost have returned to the fold.

503
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:05,170
Now that that has been established,
could we have some lunch Mr. Healey?

504
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:08,546
That's the most sensible thing
you've said all morning.

505
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:15,513
There's no need for that noise, madam.
This is not New York.

506
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:17,681
It is a site of history.

507
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:25,275
Why, that woman is of the commonest type,
gross and offensive.

508
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:28,531
Lunch is served a little further up the hill.

509
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:31,029
Look at that.

510
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:33,777
The Arabs have a nose for who tips the most.

511
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,699
Afternoon.

512
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:48,008
I've been thinking about you.

513
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:53,298
I know it seems odd
after such a short acquaintance...

514
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,515
but I think I'm in love with you.

515
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:01,973
Well, if you are, you'd better learn
to stand up for yourself a little.

516
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:05,353
Behave like a man. Don't you think?

517
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:11,737
It's never as true as it is about food
in this region.

518
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:14,702
It looks like lamb.

519
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:20,909
Avery nice meal, wasn't it, children?
Considering it was prepared by foreigners.

520
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:23,665
Poirot.

521
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:27,335
- Is that...
- Poirot.

522
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:33,473
Since there is no mystery for me to solve...

523
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:38,054
Colonel Carbury has persuaded me
to visit the town of Acre with him.

524
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,040
Well, I shall just have to manage
without you Monsieur Poirot.

525
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,974
You will do it all too well.

526
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:47,519
Small ones in the front,
tall ones in the back. That's it.

527
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:51,361
I'm coming, Carbury. Excuse me. I must hurry.

528
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:54,821
I'm sorry.

529
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:56,074
I'll bet you are.

530
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,035
Goodbye.

531
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:07,256
I think you should all take a little walk.

532
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:10,252
It will do you good to get away
from me for a little while.

533
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,458
Smile.

534
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,253
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

535
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:19,015
Lennox will settle me
in my chair outside my tent...

536
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,305
and, Nadine, you'll see
that I have my medicine.

537
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,356
I don't want to go to bed.
Why should I go to bed? I'm not going to.

538
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:31,107
Ginevra, go to your tent.

539
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:32,740
I'm not tired.

540
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:36,484
- Of course you are, go to rest at once.
- All right.

541
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:37,990
- Raymond.
- Yes, ma'am.

542
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:42,990
Why don't you ask Dr. King
if she'd like to join you on your walk?

543
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:46,119
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

544
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:47,808
And while you're there...

545
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:51,879
ask Lady Westholme if she could spare me
a moment while you're all gone.

546
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:58,512
Jefferson Mother suggested we go for a walk.

547
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:01,471
You know Qumran.
Where do you think we should go?

548
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:03,052
Well...

549
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:07,226
back in the hills.

550
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,312
It's quite lovely.

551
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:11,563
I've been there before.

552
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,576
- I bet you have.
- Would you like me to take you?

553
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:22,824
- Mother.
- Come now. Let's all be friends.

554
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:26,912
This is too confined a spot for tribulation.

555
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:32,914
Excuse me. I was wondering, Dr. King,
if you'd care to accompany us on our walk?

556
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:35,176
I should like that very much.

557
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:40,547
I do not believe in exercise after lunch.
I think I'll go to my tent and work.

558
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:44,771
My stepmother would like
a word with you later, Lady Westholme.

559
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:46,052
She would?

560
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:48,900
Shall we go?

561
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:50,640
So do I.

562
00:41:50,747 --> 00:41:52,697
I thought we were all going for a walk.

563
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:56,898
I have permission to go with Miss Quinton.
She's going to explain the diggings to me.

564
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,743
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.

565
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,323
Bye.

566
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:04,326
They've found some bronzes
with very odd markings on them.

567
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:07,749
All ready? Off you go, then.

568
00:42:08,056 --> 00:42:10,856
I guess it must be very different
from England Miss King.

569
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:13,005
Of course it's different.

570
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,563
- I've had enough.
- What's up, Lennox?

571
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,844
I'm going down.

572
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,317
Aren't you feeling well?

573
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,183
There he goes.

574
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:35,888
Well, what's the old saying?
You shouldn't join if you can't take a joke.

575
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:43,068
Don't you think we should go down with him?

576
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,963
You said I should behave like a man.

577
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:06,594
I'm going back now.

578
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:10,307
No, on my own.

579
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,651
There's something I have to say and do
to prove to you that...

580
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:19,407
You don't have to prove anything
to me, Raymond.

581
00:43:19,502 --> 00:43:21,116
To myself then.

582
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:46,801
- Where is everyone?
- They've gone down below, haven't they?

583
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:50,180
They've gone to see what was found today
at the digging.

584
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:02,826
No. No. No, please. Will you please...

585
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:14,542
Thank you, Carbury.

586
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,510
I don't know I'm sure whether
we should partition Palestine or not.

587
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:29,764
Maybe we should've left it to the Turks.

588
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:34,349
I never studied all that.
I was too busy with my medical curriculum.

589
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,687
It's a pity.

590
00:44:37,622 --> 00:44:41,146
You learn so much about a place,
but only if one has prepared.

591
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:45,069
In my view the British...

592
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,993
Excuse me, Lady Westholme.

593
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:03,421
- Let me. I'm a doctor.
- She no answer, lady.

594
00:45:09,654 --> 00:45:12,762
Let me do it, Ginny. Let me do it.

595
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:14,266
- Excuse me.
- Let me see.

596
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:17,017
What does she want?

597
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:20,982
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

598
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,234
Mr. Boynton, I'm sorry.
Your stepmother is dead.

599
00:45:28,882 --> 00:45:31,658
- Careful Margaret.
- You've got to take care of her.

600
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:33,208
There you are.

601
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:40,540
It's all right. It's all right.

602
00:45:50,403 --> 00:45:54,177
But I just spoke to her an hour ago.
It's not possible.

603
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,246
What, in your opinion,
was the cause of death, Dr. King?

604
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:26,966
Heart failure seems the most likely.

605
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:29,889
And can you estimate a time of death?

606
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:34,144
Well, I'm not very experienced
at that sort of thing...

607
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:38,311
but I'd say a couple of hours ago at least.

608
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,596
I see.

609
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:43,395
You noticed the marks
on the wrist, of course?

610
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:46,321
No, what kind of marks?

611
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:49,610
Oh, yes, little pin pricks.

612
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:54,222
She had a bad heart condition.
I'm convinced she died of natural causes.

613
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:57,712
You know, when someone is hated
as much as Mrs Boynton was...

614
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:03,042
a sudden death by natural causes
seems a little too convenient.

615
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:08,960
Do you think you've stumbled
on another murder Monsieur Poirot?

616
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:13,845
Would you oblige me
by opening your medical bag?

617
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:15,632
Yes, of course.

618
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,687
Though, I really don't see what possible...

619
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,862
Someone has been here.

620
00:47:29,002 --> 00:47:30,402
Excuse me.

621
00:47:32,088 --> 00:47:35,529
This bottle of digitalis, was it empty?

622
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,958
No, it was full.

623
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:51,668
Really, Poirot...

624
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:55,624
are you sure you're not letting your
professional instincts run away with you?

625
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:58,182
Why should I do that Mon colonel?

626
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:00,429
Old woman with a heart condition...

627
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:02,397
- walking, heat.
- Yes...

628
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:05,593
Yes, I know she had pricks in the arm,
a family that hated her.

629
00:48:05,688 --> 00:48:08,232
She could easily have taken
an overdose of her own medicine.

630
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:11,398
No, because it was her habit
to take that drug in water...

631
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:14,030
administered by her daughter-in-law.

632
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,910
You mean, she's a suspect?

633
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:18,748
My dear Colonel, everybody is a suspect.

634
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:21,667
Well, you're the expert,
but what do you want me to do?

635
00:48:21,763 --> 00:48:26,710
That Doctor, what's her name?
Dr. King thought it was natural causes.

636
00:48:27,393 --> 00:48:32,542
I'm convinced that Mrs Boynton was murdered.

637
00:48:33,024 --> 00:48:35,302
Can you show me any evidence?

638
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,850
I can do better than that.
I can identify the guilty party.

639
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:41,365
Oh, my dear fellow,
I couldn't possibly ask you to do that.

640
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:43,166
I mean, you're on holiday after all.

641
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,771
I give you my word of honor.

642
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:47,169
You mean you'll give us a case
that will stick?

643
00:48:47,205 --> 00:48:51,939
I don't know that I can do that,
but I can tell you who the murderer is.

644
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:57,117
Well, how long will it take? I can't keep
all these people here as suspects forever.

645
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,114
They'll soon run out of day trips
to take and insist on going home.

646
00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:05,039
I will give you the truth in two days.

647
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:07,956
Very well. Very well, 48 hours.

648
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:11,334
In time for the coronation junket
at the American Colony.

649
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:13,295
You seem very certain.

650
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:16,637
I am very certain because, you see,
people like to talk...

651
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:19,297
and in talking they tell the truth.

652
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:24,889
Why? It puts much less of a strain
on the memory.

653
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:29,308
Oh, but, of course
you have to have the genius to listen.

654
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:40,158
Thank you very much.

655
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:41,575
Dr. King.

656
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,543
Very pretty, miss, for you special price.

657
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:48,004
Twenty dinars.

658
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,832
Offer him five.

659
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,383
But sir...

660
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:56,046
Tea time. Come along.

661
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,638
Five dinars. I give in.

662
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:09,051
You still think someone killed her
with an injection?

663
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:12,707
Someone? You had as good a motive as anyone.

664
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,895
Me?

665
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:18,190
Well, you called Mrs Boynton an ogre,
did you not, back at the hotel?

666
00:50:18,296 --> 00:50:19,646
I criticized her behaviour.

667
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:21,743
And how did she respond to that?

668
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:23,989
Well, all she said was...

669
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:26,158
I never forget anything...

670
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,537
not an action...

671
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:32,875
not a name...

672
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,383
not a face.

673
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:38,878
Then you fell in love with Raymond Boynton.

674
00:50:38,983 --> 00:50:41,890
Of course his stepmother
could never allow such a marriage.

675
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:44,763
In any case he could never
leave home of his own accord.

676
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:48,222
That's rubbish. He'd already made up
his mind to do exactly that.

677
00:50:48,326 --> 00:50:49,857
You had discussed it with him?

678
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:51,139
Yes.

679
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:53,643
Earlier yesterday afternoon?

680
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:55,481
Yes, as a matter of fact.

681
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:59,947
Dr. King, could you tell me exactly
what happened yesterday after lunch...

682
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:01,744
when I was no longer there?

683
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,370
Well, as you know...

684
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:05,516
- we were all going off for a walk.
- Yes.

685
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:08,293
It must've been about 3:15
when we left the camp.

686
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:11,290
Nadine was flirting dreadfully with Mr. Cope.

687
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:14,547
Lennox was sulking,
and then suddenly he said...

688
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:16,252
I'm going down.

689
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:18,297
And what time was it?

690
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:20,546
- About quarter to 4 o'clock.
- And then?

691
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:23,767
I stayed and talked to Raymond.

692
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:27,894
He said he was going back.
He said he had to prove something.

693
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:31,847
There's something I have to say and do...

694
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,518
It was 5 o'clock, I'd say.

695
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:38,153
Perhaps he decided to murder his stepmother.

696
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:41,448
Raymond is incapable of such a thing.

697
00:51:41,546 --> 00:51:46,244
Excuse me, I heard him plot
exactly such a thing with his sister Carol.

698
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:48,574
I heard them by chance, aboard ship.

699
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:54,454
How is it you're always in the right place
to hear threats and plots Monsieur Poirot?

700
00:51:56,102 --> 00:51:58,713
Put it down to a gift, if you will.

701
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,963
When did you return to the camp?

702
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:03,467
About 6 o'clock.

703
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:07,341
I saw Mrs Boynton. The Arab
was having trouble waking her for dinner.

704
00:52:07,447 --> 00:52:09,511
You were arriving then yourself.

705
00:52:09,824 --> 00:52:12,897
And you insist that Mrs Boynton
had been dead for two hours?

706
00:52:12,994 --> 00:52:14,181
I do.

707
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:18,985
In other words, when Raymond came down,
he said he spoke to his stepmother.

708
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:22,240
He must've been speaking to a corpse?

709
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,323
I thought Monsieur Poirot, we were friends.

710
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:29,620
We were while I was still on holiday...

711
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:32,869
but now I have been empowered
by His Majesty's representative...

712
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,228
to conduct an inquiry.
All suspects are equal.

713
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:41,082
And you really believe, monsieur,
that I am a suspect?

714
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:44,039
Why not? It would be very easy
for you to go to your tent.

715
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,678
On the way back
you stop briefly at Mrs Boynton...

716
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:50,931
and you give her her fatal dose.
After all, you're a doctor.

717
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:56,229
And to put the clock back two hours
would protect both you and dear Raymond.

718
00:52:57,455 --> 00:53:01,691
- That is the most...
- Dr. King, I suspect...

719
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:05,824
that your butterfly is on upside down.

720
00:53:32,657 --> 00:53:34,271
Hercule Poirot.

721
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,063
Thank you.

722
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:41,608
It was quite extraordinary really, I...

723
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,942
Enter.

724
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:48,405
May I present Monsieur Poirot, Lord Peel.

725
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:49,871
A distinct honor.

726
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:53,616
I extended my morning break, when I heard
you were coming Monsieur Poirot.

727
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:55,896
Lord Peel heads a Royal Commission.

728
00:53:56,222 --> 00:53:59,912
On his judgment alone
rests the fate of Palestine.

729
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:03,047
A task for Solomon.

730
00:54:03,146 --> 00:54:05,377
The Arabs wouldn't think so.

731
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:10,091
Excuse me Monsieur Poirot,
Lady Westholme Miss Quinton.

732
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:12,259
Delegations await me.

733
00:54:12,363 --> 00:54:14,891
I hope they're not getting too impatient.

734
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:18,349
Lady Westholme, I badly need your help.

735
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:22,273
Fire away.
Miss Quinton and I will do our best.

736
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,693
When it comes to matters of public duty,
one must be punctilious.

737
00:54:27,045 --> 00:54:31,364
As my dear father used to say,
When the stern call of duty comes...

738
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,697
What is it you want to know?

739
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:36,157
Well. No thank you, very much.

740
00:54:36,262 --> 00:54:40,795
I'm particularly interested in the period
yesterday after we finished lunch.

741
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:44,381
You did not immediately
go for your walk, I believe.

742
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,508
Knowing I was to meet Lord Peel today...

743
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:50,724
I attempted to study my papers
on the history of Palestine.

744
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:53,726
I was asked to have a conversation
with Mrs Boynton.

745
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,135
- And you went?
- Indeed.

746
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:59,563
Pardon my, what did you talk about?

747
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:01,595
She started to attack me...

748
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,901
because the British do not want
Mrs Simpson to marry their King.

749
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:08,449
It must be the only subject
on which she and I could possibly agree...

750
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,407
but she would not listen to me.

751
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:12,036
And then?

752
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:14,326
Having failed to ruffle my feathers...

753
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:17,083
she picked an argument with one of the Arabs.

754
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:19,369
She seemed very annoyed with him.

755
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:23,506
Having servants about who cannot speak
a word of English is very trying.

756
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,334
Could you identify this man?

757
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:28,593
I couldn't see his face.
I had returned to my tent...

758
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,340
but I can tell you
he was of more than average height.

759
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,975
He wore the usual native headdress.

760
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,844
In addition, he had on a pair
of torn and patched breeches...

761
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:41,520
and his puttees were wound most untidily.

762
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:44,486
And after that you went for your walk?

763
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:49,196
No, I waited for Miss Quinton to return
and suggested that we ask Mrs Boynton...

764
00:55:49,294 --> 00:55:54,407
if she wanted anything before we left
the camp. That would've been about...

765
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:55,777
4 o'clock.

766
00:55:57,302 --> 00:55:59,414
- 4 o'clock.
- 4 o'clock.

767
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:04,963
We're going for a walk Mrs Boynton.
Is there anything we can do for you?

768
00:56:06,144 --> 00:56:08,173
She grunted like a pig.

769
00:56:09,272 --> 00:56:10,886
Most offensive.

770
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:16,308
Quite obviously, she drinks.
Come along Miss Quinton.

771
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:19,497
She's not the sort of person
we should talk to.

772
00:56:19,498 --> 00:56:21,020
And when you came back?

773
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:25,816
We didn't talk to Mrs Boynton again.
I returned to my work.

774
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:28,441
And I went down to the huts below...

775
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,899
to see if anything significant
had been unearthed that day.

776
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:36,362
Telephone for you, Lady Westholme.
It is Lord Westholme from England.

777
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:38,945
- May I?
- Madame.

778
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,715
I hope the line is clearer than it was...

779
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:50,712
A providential phone call.

780
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:55,008
Did you actually see
Mrs Boynton speak to an Arab boy?

781
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:57,762
I did see someone in white approach her.

782
00:56:58,363 --> 00:57:02,267
The sun was in my eyes,
but I thought it might be...

783
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:03,518
It might be?

784
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:08,649
The sheik who brought us back.
But, of course, it wasn't.

785
00:57:08,748 --> 00:57:12,070
No. And then?

786
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:14,482
I went back to Carol Boynton.

787
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:18,320
Well, it's been most informative.
Thank you so much. Yes.

788
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:22,083
- There was something else.
- Oh?

789
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,164
But I can't remember what it was.

790
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:29,299
Well, when you think of it,
don't hesitate to tell me.

791
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:33,093
Oh Mr. Cope and I are to go to Petra.

792
00:57:33,523 --> 00:57:38,720
Petra? The rose-red city half as old as time.

793
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:41,558
Roses. That's it.

794
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:43,721
Something to do with roses?

795
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:48,808
Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe.

796
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:52,022
Syringe?

797
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,070
While I was walking back down...

798
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,281
I saw this little box.

799
00:57:56,379 --> 00:58:01,446
I picked it up, and inside
was one of those hypodermic things.

800
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,623
To whom did it belong?

801
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:07,327
It was Carol Boynton's.

802
00:58:07,432 --> 00:58:10,789
She thanked me for finding it
and took it with her...

803
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:12,923
when she went to fetch Ginevra.

804
00:58:15,356 --> 00:58:19,391
Colonel Carbury phoned.
He asked us all to stay in Jerusalem.

805
00:58:19,986 --> 00:58:22,348
Only for a day or two, madame.

806
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:23,551
For what?

807
00:58:23,656 --> 00:58:28,390
You can't seriously suggest that I murdered
that ludicrous Boynton woman?

808
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:32,612
I'm terribly sorry, but once my
investigation is under way, it's...

809
00:58:32,707 --> 00:58:35,187
Monsieur Poirot,
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

810
00:58:35,293 --> 00:58:37,405
Come along Miss Quinton.

811
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:46,203
I'm so sorry.

812
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:49,496
The British aristocracy is
well known for its bad manners.

813
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,874
They call it eccentricity.
Oh, I'm quite used to it.

814
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,803
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

815
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:05,886
He's coming over.

816
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,103
Colonel Carbury said you wanted to see us.

817
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:10,563
I'm investigating your mother in law's death.

818
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:13,412
It doesn't need investigating.
She died quite naturally.

819
00:59:13,413 --> 00:59:18,028
I think not. If I might have a few moments
with your husband?

820
00:59:18,962 --> 00:59:20,762
I've a good mind to call our consul.

821
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:23,464
Oh, that's your right.
I mean, if you object to my...

822
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:25,320
We don't. I'll wait in the lobby.

823
00:59:25,677 --> 00:59:27,492
Thank you very much.

824
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:38,420
Well, you have your freedom at last.

825
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:39,674
Freedom?

826
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:42,966
Well, at least you've managed
to save your marriage.

827
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:47,349
You go too far Monsieur Poirot.
I'll speak of that day.

828
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:49,146
Tell me about it.

829
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:54,190
When you returned from your walk
that afternoon, you were alone?

830
00:59:54,289 --> 00:59:55,903
That's right.

831
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:59,523
And at what time did you reach the tents?

832
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:03,911
Soon after 4 o'clock. I looked in on Ginny.
She was asleep.

833
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:07,080
And what exactly did you say
to your stepmother?

834
01:00:07,177 --> 01:00:09,177
She said I hadn't been gone very long...

835
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:11,326
and I said how hot it was.

836
01:00:13,057 --> 01:00:14,327
That's all?

837
01:00:14,434 --> 01:00:15,799
No, she...

838
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:18,884
She asked me what time it was,
since her watch had stopped.

839
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,338
I took it off her, wound it up,
and set it to the correct time.

840
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:23,890
Which was?

841
01:00:23,985 --> 01:00:26,429
Just a quarter after 4 o'clock.

842
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:27,846
And then?

843
01:00:27,947 --> 01:00:30,475
Then I asked her
if there was anything she wanted.

844
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:32,937
She said no. She was rather tired.

845
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:38,234
Soon after that I left her
to join Carol and Ginny at the excavations.

846
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:43,526
And she told you of no annoyance
caused by an Arab boy?

847
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,030
No. No, she didn't.

848
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:48,655
No, you saw no one of that description then.
An Arab boy?

849
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,833
- Not a soul. Except down below, of course.
- Yes, of course.

850
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,327
Well, thank you very much indeed Mr. Boynton.

851
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:57,707
If I may have a few moments
of your wife's time.

852
01:01:03,608 --> 01:01:06,716
Why do you think Mrs Boynton
was murdered Monsieur Poirot?

853
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:08,220
Well, from all I've heard...

854
01:01:08,321 --> 01:01:11,679
it's difficult to understand
why she wasn't murdered before.

855
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:18,602
I don't regret her death,
but I do feel responsible.

856
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:23,566
My married life has not been
particularly happy Monsieur Poirot.

857
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,865
I came to the Boynton house a poor girl...

858
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:30,965
hoping to pay for the rest of my nurse's
training by taking care of the old lady.

859
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:33,665
Then I fell in love with Lennox.

860
01:01:33,763 --> 01:01:36,063
Mrs Boynton's condition
for letting us marry...

861
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,041
was that we both
continue to stay living with her.

862
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:41,977
I assumed
that this would only be temporary...

863
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:45,917
but I underestimated her hold on my husband.

864
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:49,351
So in the end I came to a decision.

865
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:53,270
When did you come to this decision?

866
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:56,024
On the afternoon of my mother in law's death.

867
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,605
I have to tell Emily darling.

868
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:02,905
I decided to leave Lennox
for an old flame, Jefferson Cope.

869
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:07,278
Oh, a flame perhaps, but hardly an old one.
What happened?

870
01:02:08,756 --> 01:02:12,245
I returned to the camp
about 10 minutes after Lennox.

871
01:02:12,844 --> 01:02:15,158
About 4:30?

872
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:18,087
I decided to tell her there and then.

873
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:21,173
Oh, before you told your husband?

874
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:23,049
How did she react?

875
01:02:24,397 --> 01:02:26,379
She took it very badly.

876
01:02:26,649 --> 01:02:30,221
I refused to listen to her insults
and left to join the others.

877
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:34,598
Do you think it was the shock
of your decision which killed her?

878
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,810
But when did you tell your husband?

879
01:02:38,828 --> 01:02:40,878
My husband and I talked down at the huts.

880
01:02:40,879 --> 01:02:45,114
Madame, do you by any chance
own a hypodermic syringe?

881
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:50,452
I carry one in my medicine chest,
but I didn't take it to Qumran.

882
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:54,953
Mrs Boynton was taking
a medicine called digitalis?

883
01:02:55,553 --> 01:02:57,535
I usually gave it to her in water.

884
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:00,250
And if she had taken an overdose...

885
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:05,883
Well, it would've killed her certainly, but
she was always very careful, and so was I.

886
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:10,214
You don't think there's any chance
the chemist who was making it up might've...

887
01:03:10,215 --> 01:03:12,423
It's highly unlikely Monsieur Poirot.

888
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:16,806
Well, I suppose
the analysis will tell us all.

889
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,274
No, unfortunately the
bottle containing her medicine...

890
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,028
was broken when we brought her back.

891
01:03:28,461 --> 01:03:30,861
I did not kill my mother-in-law,
Monsieur Poirot.

892
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,413
She was alive and well when I left her.
We've all suffered for so long.

893
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:39,628
What good does it do to bring ruin
and misery to the lives of innocent people?

894
01:03:39,722 --> 01:03:42,036
But who are these innocent people?

895
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:47,208
At least one of you is very guilty indeed.
Good day, madame.

896
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,510
Don't worry darling.

897
01:03:54,404 --> 01:03:56,101
- Room 21.
- Certainly sir.

898
01:03:57,156 --> 01:03:59,020
Mr. Cope...

899
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:01,775
I thought that Colonel
Carbury's representative...

900
01:04:01,786 --> 01:04:03,934
asked you not to leave Jerusalem?

901
01:04:04,038 --> 01:04:05,439
Yes, well...

902
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,735
I have Colonel Carbury on the line.

903
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:10,492
Perhaps if you do not care
for this accommodation...

904
01:04:10,587 --> 01:04:13,743
you could move
to British military headquarters?

905
01:04:14,674 --> 01:04:16,952
Rather less comfortable.

906
01:04:17,844 --> 01:04:20,870
Take the gentleman's bags back to his room.

907
01:04:21,723 --> 01:04:25,792
No. No, now that your clothes
are on their way back to their cupboard...

908
01:04:25,894 --> 01:04:28,255
perhaps we could take a walk?

909
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:30,170
There's really nothing I can say.

910
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:33,548
Come Mr. Cope.
You've had a most eventful vacation.

911
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:36,195
First of all, you almost persuade
an attractive young woman...

912
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:37,466
to leave her husband.

913
01:04:37,572 --> 01:04:40,812
Secondly, another young woman
falls for your charms.

914
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:45,773
Thirdly, another one is dead,
not inconveniently for you.

915
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:52,905
I enjoyed a long and rewarding association
with Emily Boynton and her husband.

916
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:56,413
In fact, her death
came as a double blow to me.

917
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:59,577
The lady I one day hoped to marry...

918
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:04,704
as a result of her husband's new
acquisitions of wealth and freedom...

919
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:07,294
decided to remain with him.

920
01:05:07,393 --> 01:05:10,466
Now what sort of convenience
has this tragedy for me?

921
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:15,511
Mr. Cope Mrs Boynton made you present
to the family a will made out in her favor...

922
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,360
which was invalidated by another one
made out in favor of the children.

923
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:21,595
You were about to be discovered.

924
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:24,690
Mrs Boynton's death saved you from scandal.

925
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:27,444
- Please.
- From disgrace.

926
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:31,528
Rest assured my only interest
is the crime of murder.

927
01:05:34,504 --> 01:05:37,067
When did you return to the camp?

928
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:40,033
I stayed a few more moments with Nadine.

929
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:44,121
It was obvious that Dr. King and Raymond
had no desire for company...

930
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:46,002
so I started back.

931
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:50,382
I guess I must've got back
to the camp at about 5 o'clock.

932
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:54,845
Shortly after that
Carol Boynton came up for Ginevra.

933
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:57,883
Which gave you plenty of time to go
into Dr. King's tent...

934
01:05:57,986 --> 01:06:02,435
take the hypodermic syringe and put an end
to a long and valued friendship.

935
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:06,352
I've made mistakes in my life,
Mr. Poirot, many of them...

936
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:08,060
but I am not a murderer.

937
01:06:08,162 --> 01:06:10,192
Allow me to judge that.

938
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,948
There are so many possibilities.
I'm totally baffled.

939
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:21,621
Well then Mon Cher colonel, I wish you to
address yourself to the following questions.

940
01:06:22,218 --> 01:06:27,332
The time of death. Is Dr. King
telling the truth? If not, why not?

941
01:06:28,558 --> 01:06:32,758
Why did Madame Boynton
encourage her family to go away?

942
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:38,010
And why was it Mahmoud
who tried to wake Mrs Boynton?

943
01:06:38,109 --> 01:06:41,716
Why did not some member of the family
attempt this earlier?

944
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:44,977
- You want me to question Mahmoud?
- You know the lingo.

945
01:06:45,074 --> 01:06:48,978
And see where he and the other Arabs
were at the crucial time?

946
01:06:49,078 --> 01:06:52,982
It may have been one of them
who was seen arguing with Mrs Boynton.

947
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:57,781
Perhaps. I go now to question
the last of our little group.

948
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:01,997
The concierge tells me
that they went sightseeing to Bayt Jibrin.

949
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:04,287
Well, I'll report to you at dinner.

950
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:05,406
What fun.

951
01:07:05,929 --> 01:07:07,495
Fun?

952
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:13,497
Everything is always fun for you English.
The sun will never set on your games.

953
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:18,047
Well, I hope it will always be so.
Although I have my doubts.

954
01:07:19,025 --> 01:07:20,025
Thank you.

955
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:30,932
What are you doing there, miss?

956
01:07:33,122 --> 01:07:35,354
Hiding from the light of day.

957
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,986
Only the guilty hide.

958
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:40,115
I'm guilty of nothing Monsieur Poirot.

959
01:07:40,213 --> 01:07:43,570
Well, suppose you tell us
what happened that afternoon.

960
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:47,281
After that you can explore
the darkness to your heart's content.

961
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:51,557
Miss Quinton showed me
the ivories that they had discovered...

962
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:53,207
and then I went up for Ginevra.

963
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:54,626
What time did you go up?

964
01:07:54,727 --> 01:07:57,041
About a quarter past 5 o'clock.

965
01:07:57,146 --> 01:08:00,801
Did you talk to your stepmother?

966
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,680
As a matter of fact I did.

967
01:08:02,777 --> 01:08:07,226
She was sitting by her tent, and I said
I was going to get Ginevra, and she said...

968
01:08:07,323 --> 01:08:11,310
Let her sleep. No time asleep is wasted.

969
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:14,686
It's like money in the
bank, a store of health.

970
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:19,734
I got Ginny, and she was chattering to me
about a sheik visiting her in her tent.

971
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:22,315
Now, my stepmother was asleep
when we went by...

972
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:25,911
and Ginny kept insisting
that a sheik had come to take her away.

973
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:28,287
Yes, of course, that is your story...

974
01:08:28,386 --> 01:08:32,076
but you could quite easily have taken
your hypodermic syringe...

975
01:08:32,182 --> 01:08:34,875
the one Miss Quinton found
where you dropped it...

976
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:37,800
and you could've killed Mrs Boynton.

977
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,553
I don't know how that got where it did.

978
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:43,198
Do you really think that I would kill
my own mother?

979
01:08:43,234 --> 01:08:45,797
But she's not even our mother...

980
01:08:45,904 --> 01:08:49,226
you said to your
brother Raymond on the boat...

981
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:52,065
when he was determined that she should die.

982
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,264
You heard?

983
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,683
I heard every word.

984
01:08:55,788 --> 01:08:58,649
We were mad even to think about it,
but we were desperate.

985
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:03,117
It was intolerable what she was doing
to Ginny and to Nadine and Lennox.

986
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:04,613
And so you killed her.

987
01:09:04,714 --> 01:09:07,407
No, we talked about it, but we didn't do it.

988
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,071
In the morning
the whole thing seemed ridiculous...

989
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:13,085
like one of those dramas
that you dream up in the dark.

990
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:14,931
I had nothing to do with her death.

991
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:17,558
You do believe me, don't you Mr. Poirot?

992
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:20,172
I've not said that I don't.

993
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:27,841
You can come out now Mr. Raymond.

994
01:09:29,447 --> 01:09:31,145
Hello Monsieur Poirot.

995
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:38,017
So you overheard our conversation
just as I overheard your conversation.

996
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:43,192
Yeah, but we didn't go ahead
with that stupid plan to kill our stepmother.

997
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:46,902
- Non?
- Definitely non. I was with Miss King.

998
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:51,494
And then I went down. There was something
I had to tell my mother.

999
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,119
About Dr. King and yourself?

1000
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:57,497
Exactly. She was pretty upset.

1001
01:09:58,184 --> 01:10:01,625
I forbid you to see her again.
Do you hear me?

1002
01:10:01,938 --> 01:10:04,928
There was no point in arguing...

1003
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:08,513
so I went down below
to look at the artifacts.

1004
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:12,351
At what time did you talk to your stepmother?

1005
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,261
About 5:30.

1006
01:10:14,367 --> 01:10:17,025
5:30, after she was dead. Yes, well...

1007
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:21,022
Dr. King says
that she examined the body at 6 o'clock.

1008
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:23,438
It had been dead for about two hours.

1009
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:25,736
She's wrong.

1010
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:31,697
Don't you think it is possible
that you took Dr. King's syringe...

1011
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:35,290
and injected Mrs Boynton as you had planned?

1012
01:10:35,805 --> 01:10:38,997
After all, this would leave you free
to marry Dr. King...

1013
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:41,043
a rich man.

1014
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:42,877
Is that what you suspect?

1015
01:10:43,104 --> 01:10:44,552
Was your plan any different?

1016
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:47,045
Oh, yes. That's why I don't understand.

1017
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,629
All right. All right. What was your plan?

1018
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:56,975
I don't think I'm going to say any more.

1019
01:10:58,036 --> 01:10:59,306
Not even to me?

1020
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:01,356
No.

1021
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:05,068
Right.

1022
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,864
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1023
01:11:19,933 --> 01:11:21,298
Monsieur Poirot.

1024
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:28,254
Monsieur Poirot, come here.

1025
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:39,387
I must see you.

1026
01:11:40,286 --> 01:11:43,893
Well then, come forward sir or madam...

1027
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:46,775
and let me see you.

1028
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:56,280
Tomorrow at 10 o'clock.
The back door of the hotel at 10 o'clock.

1029
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:09,293
Thank you sir.

1030
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:11,215
Oh, good evening Miss Quinton.

1031
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:15,435
Oh, good evening Mr. Poirot.
Are your investigations nearly over?

1032
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:20,056
Well, I must say that, oh that must be
the largest spider I've ever seen.

1033
01:12:20,535 --> 01:12:22,647
Look, it's going back to its hole...

1034
01:12:22,745 --> 01:12:26,482
and a brown one at that.
Did you see the spider Miss Quinton?

1035
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,406
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me.

1036
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:34,533
I see so many in the course
of my scrapping and digging. Oh. Bye-bye.

1037
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:37,821
We really shouldn't talk to him, my dear.

1038
01:12:39,095 --> 01:12:42,619
My dear fellow, I'm sorry
if we're a little late.

1039
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,085
Mr. Rogers here
has been writing up the notes...

1040
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:48,175
of the talks we had with the Arab boys
at Qumran.

1041
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:49,771
Had any of them seen anything?

1042
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:51,456
They saw everything and nothing.

1043
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,392
We will discuss these notes later,
Mon colonel.

1044
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:57,696
- A creme de cassis, s'il vous plaît.
- Whiskey and soda.

1045
01:12:57,697 --> 01:12:58,718
Certainly sir.

1046
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:01,450
You're on duty now, Rogers.
You'd better get back to the office.

1047
01:13:01,451 --> 01:13:03,017
One moment, Rogers, please.

1048
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:07,687
Would you be kind enough to ask
our American friends if they have, hello.

1049
01:13:08,124 --> 01:13:10,189
They have any knowledge of that person?

1050
01:13:10,293 --> 01:13:13,420
Leave it to me sir. My connections are
tiptop. I was in North America.

1051
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:15,881
- Thank you, Rogers. That'll do. Good night.
- Good night sir.

1052
01:13:15,882 --> 01:13:20,415
Colonel Carbury, may I raise my glass
to criminology, the easiest of all sciences.

1053
01:13:20,887 --> 01:13:23,187
- Hello Mr. Poirot.
- Oh, my dear. How are you?

1054
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:25,361
- Come on.
- Why can't I talk to him?

1055
01:13:25,674 --> 01:13:29,045
One Arab Mahmoud's assistant,
I believe he knew something.

1056
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:31,549
Yes, he's asked to see me in the morning.

1057
01:13:31,648 --> 01:13:35,137
He has? Do you know who did it?

1058
01:13:35,568 --> 01:13:40,220
I'm fairly certain, but I want one final
meeting between them all tomorrow.

1059
01:13:40,323 --> 01:13:44,143
And we must find a really dramatic location
for this encounter.

1060
01:13:44,494 --> 01:13:47,844
I don't want it to be too late.
It's the coronation dance, you know.

1061
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,313
I'll need time to change.

1062
01:13:49,415 --> 01:13:50,650
Good evening.

1063
01:13:53,169 --> 01:13:54,949
You used to be so popular.

1064
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:02,914
This is an outrage.

1065
01:14:03,304 --> 01:14:06,128
He commands me to take tea.

1066
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,457
At the springs of Sataf.

1067
01:14:08,685 --> 01:14:10,251
You mean it's a picnic?

1068
01:14:10,353 --> 01:14:13,046
You may be a Colonel Mr. Carbury...

1069
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:15,627
but I am a fully accredited member...

1070
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:19,174
of His Majesty's government.
You trifle with me at your peril...

1071
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:20,679
with these silly charades.

1072
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:23,510
Murder is not a charade, Your Ladyship.

1073
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,603
If you prefer, I can have Monsieur Poirot
conduct his interview here.

1074
01:14:28,955 --> 01:14:30,984
One more day I will put up with this.

1075
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:33,693
After the coronation ball tonight, I go.

1076
01:14:35,879 --> 01:14:37,149
Dr. King.

1077
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,030
See you at the market.

1078
01:14:39,132 --> 01:14:42,656
I want to apologise for last night.
It was silly ignoring you.

1079
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:46,178
We're all on edge.
You are a formidable inquisitor, you know.

1080
01:14:46,222 --> 01:14:47,788
It will all be over today.

1081
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:49,873
At your theatrical tea party?

1082
01:14:53,396 --> 01:14:55,544
Couldn't you drop it, Hercule?

1083
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:58,759
So many of us stand a chance
of happiness now.

1084
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:00,303
I...

1085
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,260
Isn't that Hassan from the camp at Qumran?

1086
01:15:03,364 --> 01:15:06,355
Yes, indeed.
We have an important meeting arranged.

1087
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:09,975
Hassan, I'm glad you've come. I was...

1088
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,856
Hassan, don't go. I'll fetch him back.

1089
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:18,154
Monsieur Poirot, I'm going to the market now.

1090
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:30,169
Hassan. Come back.

1091
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:16,082
Sorry.

1092
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:30,416
Single round. Fire.

1093
01:17:39,395 --> 01:17:41,460
You better come with us, miss.

1094
01:17:42,398 --> 01:17:45,804
She said she was chasing the boy,
and he ran into this street.

1095
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:50,470
The shot came from the side.
A gun was thrown in to lie beside the boy.

1096
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:52,271
She ran up to him, picked it up.

1097
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,396
Do you really believe all that?

1098
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,609
Dr. King was wearing a thin cotton dress.
She had no handbag.

1099
01:17:58,706 --> 01:18:02,610
There was nowhere to hide
even a small revolver like this one.

1100
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:07,652
Our chaps dusted it for fingerprints.
Only Dr. King's were on it.

1101
01:18:08,842 --> 01:18:10,954
Well, the Boynton family...

1102
01:18:11,052 --> 01:18:15,620
Lady Westholme,
Miss Quinton, Mr. Cope, all in the area...

1103
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:18,999
and all the family vouching for each other
as you'd expect.

1104
01:18:19,102 --> 01:18:20,336
What do we do?

1105
01:18:20,812 --> 01:18:22,509
Release Dr. King.

1106
01:18:27,318 --> 01:18:28,802
You are free to go.

1107
01:18:29,904 --> 01:18:31,305
I didn't kill him.

1108
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:35,559
It is now 2:30. There is just time to have
you driven back to your hotel and then...

1109
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,935
Surely you're not still performing
your picnic interview?

1110
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:43,939
Oh yes, we are
foregathering in Sataf as arranged...

1111
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,991
for afternoon tea.

1112
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:50,577
Colonel Carbury and I
have gone to a great deal of trouble...

1113
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:53,618
to arrange this spree...

1114
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,252
and I am sure
you will find it informative, refreshing...

1115
01:18:58,349 --> 01:19:01,173
and even entertaining.

1116
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,383
It's like a scene from a play.

1117
01:19:03,563 --> 01:19:08,048
Yes, well, if you wish to present a comedy,
you must first set the scene.

1118
01:19:09,235 --> 01:19:12,676
And the same is true
even if it turns out to be a tragedy.

1119
01:19:12,822 --> 01:19:15,350
Ladies and gentlemen.

1120
01:19:16,492 --> 01:19:19,732
A complete waste
of British military resources.

1121
01:19:20,705 --> 01:19:24,561
Colonel Carbury has done me
the honor of consulting me.

1122
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,942
Why? Why the devil should he bring you
into this business?

1123
01:19:28,213 --> 01:19:30,989
I am often brought in
in cases of sudden death.

1124
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:36,200
Mrs Boynton's death gave her family
not only financial independence...

1125
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,711
but also a liberation from a tyranny...

1126
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:42,465
which had become well nigh insupportable.

1127
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:47,218
Raymond Boynton had been overheard...

1128
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,886
discussing the possibility
of taking Mrs Boynton's life.

1129
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,934
He had fallen in love.

1130
01:19:54,781 --> 01:19:59,598
You told me you returned to the camp
at 5:30 and spoke to your stepmother.

1131
01:20:00,245 --> 01:20:04,978
And yet Dr. King informs me
that at that time she was no longer alive.

1132
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:09,110
Now I put it to you that
you returned to the camp...

1133
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:13,738
you saw your stepmother,
and you discovered that she was dead.

1134
01:20:14,008 --> 01:20:17,782
Did you tell anybody about this?
No, you did not.

1135
01:20:18,137 --> 01:20:22,504
You pretended to talk to her,
and then you walked away.

1136
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,582
Now, why on earth should you do that?

1137
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:29,169
You, who could not possibly have been
guilty of her murder...

1138
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,589
because Mrs Boynton was dead
sometime before you returned to the camp.

1139
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:39,684
Your mind went back to that conversation
you had had aboard ship...

1140
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,607
with your sister, Carol.

1141
01:20:42,161 --> 01:20:46,480
Had she perhaps carried out your plan,
done the deed?

1142
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,862
Were you in some way trying to protect her?

1143
01:20:49,961 --> 01:20:51,492
That's a damned lie.

1144
01:20:53,464 --> 01:20:56,905
Let us consider
the case against Carol Boynton.

1145
01:20:57,594 --> 01:21:02,043
Admitting that the murder was committed
by a lethal injection...

1146
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:06,174
we already know that Dr. King's syringe
had been tampered with...

1147
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,958
but there was another syringe.

1148
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,761
That found by Miss Quinton
and claimed by whom?

1149
01:21:13,026 --> 01:21:16,099
By none other than Carol Boynton.

1150
01:21:17,614 --> 01:21:20,177
What have you to say to that, mademoiselle?

1151
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:21,762
It wasn't mine.

1152
01:21:22,452 --> 01:21:24,516
But you claimed it, did you not?

1153
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:31,115
All right. All right, I believe you.

1154
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:35,028
You claimed the hypodermic
because that was the instrument...

1155
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:39,450
which you and your co-conspirator,
your brother Raymond, had selected.

1156
01:21:39,552 --> 01:21:43,159
You were afraid
that he had killed your stepmother.

1157
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:45,544
You, in your turn, were protecting him.

1158
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:48,253
All right Monsieur Poirot, you win.

1159
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:51,919
How did you conceive your plan sir?

1160
01:21:52,982 --> 01:21:56,506
I read it in a detective story.

1161
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:03,017
Sticking an empty hypodermic into someone
injects an air bubble which kills them.

1162
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,223
So you just purchased the syringe yourself?

1163
01:22:06,746 --> 01:22:09,404
No, I took the one Nadine had.

1164
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:13,572
The thing was, I dropped it
before I could use it.

1165
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:17,280
And then, when I found Mother dead...

1166
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:23,618
I thought maybe Carol had.
Of course, it was incredible...

1167
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:29,579
but the shock of
finding her dead like that...

1168
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:34,677
Thank you Mr. Boynton,
you may resume your seat.

1169
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:48,272
Time is pressing on Monsieur Poirot, and
I can't see that this is leading anywhere.

1170
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,229
Can you, Colonel Carbury?

1171
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:53,938
Better let Monsieur Poirot proceed
in his own manner, dear lady.

1172
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:56,817
He usually gets there in the end.

1173
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:00,280
Usually? Always.

1174
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:06,200
Who then was responsible for the killing?

1175
01:23:07,348 --> 01:23:08,499
Dr. King?

1176
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:14,500
Was she eager to free Raymond Boynton
from his stepmother's clutches?

1177
01:23:15,231 --> 01:23:18,388
No, because when
Dr. King left the encampment...

1178
01:23:18,484 --> 01:23:20,217
Mrs Boynton was still alive.

1179
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,476
When Dr. King returned Mrs Boynton was dead.

1180
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:26,480
This has been proved
by an independent medical report.

1181
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:32,192
And what of the youngest of our suspects?

1182
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:37,565
Oh, really Monsieur Poirot. That's not fair.

1183
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:40,739
I will not have Ginny
be accused of such a thing.

1184
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,324
Then what about you?

1185
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,993
It was you
who acted as a nurse to your mother-in-law.

1186
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:51,212
You were the last
member of the family to speak to her...

1187
01:23:51,309 --> 01:23:56,091
which gave you unique opportunity
of plunging the hypodermic into her wrist.

1188
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:58,964
Also, you had a motive.

1189
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:01,466
What motive, for God's sake?

1190
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,932
Her love for you sir.

1191
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:08,939
Yes, she behaved well towards
her mother-in-law simply because of you...

1192
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:12,276
until she found out
that your spirit was broken.

1193
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:18,027
She tried to rouse you, to convince you
to break free, but she could not.

1194
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:24,201
And so, she determined
on one last desperate gesture...

1195
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,584
using the old trick of jealousy.

1196
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:31,205
Oh, she was prepared to go further
than mere flirtation.

1197
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:34,084
She threatened to actually leave you.

1198
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:38,300
And if that failed,
there was only one alternative...

1199
01:24:38,398 --> 01:24:41,887
to eliminate
her mother in law's influence over you...

1200
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:45,590
by eliminating her mother-in-law.

1201
01:24:47,323 --> 01:24:48,558
I killed her.

1202
01:24:50,034 --> 01:24:51,139
Why?

1203
01:24:51,244 --> 01:24:52,514
How can you ask?

1204
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,186
I am asking you sir.

1205
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,339
Because of what she had done to us,
to our marriage.

1206
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,075
Your wife only told
you of her decision to leave you...

1207
01:25:00,076 --> 01:25:04,446
when she joined you down at the
excavations after Mrs Boynton was dead.

1208
01:25:04,591 --> 01:25:06,341
What does it matter? I knew anyway.

1209
01:25:06,342 --> 01:25:07,998
But it matters a great deal sir.

1210
01:25:08,094 --> 01:25:11,452
Look, I strongly
advise you to tell the truth.

1211
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:15,292
By God, I will.

1212
01:25:16,019 --> 01:25:19,673
When we left the tents,
I knew it was all up unless I acted fast.

1213
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:24,466
It dawned on me that if I made one decent
gesture, I could still save everything.

1214
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,968
What gesture Mr. Boynton?

1215
01:25:27,405 --> 01:25:28,853
Same as Raymond's, I guess.

1216
01:25:28,948 --> 01:25:29,969
I've had enough.

1217
01:25:30,074 --> 01:25:31,658
To tell Mother I was getting the hell out.

1218
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:32,727
I'm going down.

1219
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:36,813
My idea was to take Nadine away
that very night if she'd come with me.

1220
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,027
And when you reached the tents?

1221
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:41,648
Wake up Mother. Nadine and I have...

1222
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,780
I started to talk to her
till I realised she was dead.

1223
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:46,412
I didn't know what to do.

1224
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:49,118
You corrected the time on her watch?

1225
01:25:49,969 --> 01:25:55,000
It was lying there in her lap.
I just acted mechanically. It was horrible.

1226
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,582
Then I walked down to the excavations.

1227
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,502
That is the truth, I swear.

1228
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,468
I believe you Mr. Boynton.

1229
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:06,348
Your explanation is consistent
not only with the facts...

1230
01:26:06,444 --> 01:26:09,885
but also with your psychological condition.

1231
01:26:11,157 --> 01:26:13,981
This is all very interesting,
indeed touching...

1232
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:18,522
but I'm expected for cocktails
by Lord Peel in an hour and a half.

1233
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:24,273
You may continue with your exhibition,
Monsieur Poirot. I am going.

1234
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:31,657
Of course, Lady Westholme. Of course.
Better not be late for the loyal toast, what?

1235
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,711
Look, why don't we all go? Everyone welcome.

1236
01:26:36,349 --> 01:26:38,711
Celebrate George Mark VI...

1237
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:42,132
though I suppose I ought to say sorry
about your Mrs Simpson.

1238
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,844
I'm very disappointed.

1239
01:26:43,982 --> 01:26:48,384
I would've expected an American woman
to navigate skilfully onto the throne.

1240
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:54,639
Colonel Carbury, were you asking us all
to the coronation ball tonight?

1241
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,226
I was Miss Boynton.

1242
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:57,896
Thank you.

1243
01:26:58,496 --> 01:26:59,600
Sarah.

1244
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:03,382
I don't imagine
there'll be much in the way of boogieing.

1245
01:27:03,383 --> 01:27:04,534
Come on.

1246
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,904
Do you know who did it?

1247
01:27:07,005 --> 01:27:08,987
I have until midnight, Colonel.

1248
01:27:09,174 --> 01:27:12,574
You didn't even mention that business
this morning with the Arab boy.

1249
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:17,742
Well, that will come later.
It only confirms what I know already.

1250
01:27:20,393 --> 01:27:21,414
Yes?

1251
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:24,177
The information you wanted from America sir.

1252
01:27:30,028 --> 01:27:32,010
Has Colonel Carbury seen this?

1253
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:33,644
Seen what, old chap?

1254
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:40,119
I say, Poirot,
what are you doing with that fellow?

1255
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:42,563
I thought you were supposed to be
working for me.

1256
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:47,465
Help me with my tie, would you please?
After all it's your coronation.

1257
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:14,552
It worked out well.

1258
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,665
The Colonel is the best dancer I've ever met.

1259
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,094
Not that you've met a lot, kid.

1260
01:28:37,095 --> 01:28:38,395
He's better than you, Ray.

1261
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,577
Oh, surely no one is better than Ray.

1262
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:41,932
The Colonel certainly is.

1263
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,566
- That's very sweet of you, my dear.
- That was fun.

1264
01:28:44,567 --> 01:28:49,716
Monsieur Poirot should not dance. Too fat.
Bad for the heart.

1265
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:53,718
I'd kind of like to know who did it,
Monsieur Poirot.

1266
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:54,971
Oh, does it matter?

1267
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:57,729
I think it does. Will you tell us?

1268
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:00,595
What makes you so sure it wasn't one of us?

1269
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:04,277
Well, I want you to consider two facts.

1270
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:08,774
First of all,
Mrs Boynton was taking digitalis...

1271
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:13,112
and secondly,
Dr. King here was missing a syringe.

1272
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:18,197
Now, quite clearly no member of the family
need have taken the risk of injecting it.

1273
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:22,996
All they had to do was to increase the level
of the digitalis to a fatal dose.

1274
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:27,959
At worst this could be attributed
to a mistake by the chemist who mixed it.

1275
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,718
If a syringe was used,
it was for a very good reason.

1276
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:36,053
It was that the murderer was not
sufficiently intimate with Mrs Boynton...

1277
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:39,892
just to enter the tent and to tamper
with the medicine.

1278
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:43,020
Of all the suspects so far...

1279
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:47,853
the most obvious one is Mr. Cope.

1280
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,398
You sir, were guilty of chicanery.

1281
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:57,988
I admit
that she forced me to burn the real will.

1282
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,580
Thank God that little injustice
was prolonged only for a few weeks.

1283
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,081
We forgive you, Jefferson.

1284
01:30:04,182 --> 01:30:05,915
But he tried to cheat us.

1285
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:09,962
Well, goodness,
we were plotting to murder her.

1286
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:12,042
Go on, man.

1287
01:30:12,649 --> 01:30:16,683
Mrs Boynton took a particular pleasure
in preventing her family...

1288
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,973
from associating with other people.

1289
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,807
And yet on the fatal afternoon...

1290
01:30:21,908 --> 01:30:25,978
she actually insisted that they left
and that they enjoy themselves elsewhere.

1291
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:27,183
Why?

1292
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:31,940
Well, you see,
Mrs Boynton had to get rid of the family...

1293
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:34,898
because, to use a vulgarity...

1294
01:30:35,004 --> 01:30:38,196
she had other fish for frying.

1295
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:45,452
What was it you said to her
in Jerusalem, Dr. King?

1296
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,121
I called her pathetic and ludicrous.

1297
01:30:48,893 --> 01:30:52,880
There you have it. There was Mrs Boynton
confronted by herself...

1298
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:56,139
owing to the words
of an intelligent young woman.

1299
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:58,382
She was full of baffled fury.

1300
01:30:58,903 --> 01:31:01,466
And then, suddenly,
while she was in this mood...

1301
01:31:01,573 --> 01:31:05,263
there was a face from the past,
somebody she recognised...

1302
01:31:05,702 --> 01:31:09,143
another victim to fall into her grasp.

1303
01:31:10,874 --> 01:31:13,864
Consider her words to Dr. King.

1304
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,257
I never forget anything...

1305
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:23,196
not an action, not a name, not a face.

1306
01:31:23,636 --> 01:31:27,243
Those words were spoken not to Dr. King...

1307
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:30,713
but to someone else
who was standing behind her.

1308
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:34,592
Let us reconstruct
what occurred on that fateful afternoon.

1309
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,635
The family went off on its jaunt.

1310
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:38,299
Lady Westholme tells us...

1311
01:31:38,401 --> 01:31:43,550
that one of the Arab servants
picked a quarrel with Mrs Boynton.

1312
01:31:43,656 --> 01:31:47,477
You mean that one of those Arab fellows
stuck her with a hypodermic?

1313
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:52,110
Both Miss Quinton and Lady Westholme say...

1314
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:56,407
they saw the Arab boy emerge
from the tent occupied by Ginny...

1315
01:31:56,503 --> 01:31:59,410
but Dr. King's tent was next door.

1316
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:03,872
It might quite easily have been
that tent to which they were referring.

1317
01:32:04,302 --> 01:32:05,916
Lady Westholme said...

1318
01:32:06,304 --> 01:32:10,623
In addition, he was wearing a pair
of torn and patched breeches...

1319
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:14,249
and his puttees were wound most untidily.

1320
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:18,299
But Lady Westholme was sitting at her tent
200 yards away.

1321
01:32:18,483 --> 01:32:20,429
She said she didn't see the face.

1322
01:32:20,527 --> 01:32:24,845
How could she possibly have seen
the detail of clothing at such a distance?

1323
01:32:25,782 --> 01:32:29,472
There was no Arab who had an argument
with Mrs Boynton.

1324
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:34,441
The person who killed Mrs Boynton
was the same as the one that stood...

1325
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:37,898
behind Dr. King in Jerusalem.

1326
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:43,907
Dr. King.

1327
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:48,166
And it was the same one
who was standing behind me...

1328
01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:52,872
when I was waiting for the only witness
of the murder to meet me.

1329
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:55,166
Oh, it was no coincidence.

1330
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:58,594
Lady Westholme's window
gave onto the very alley...

1331
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:01,523
where the boy had asked me to meet him
the night before.

1332
01:33:01,524 --> 01:33:06,471
She overheard, but she had no way
of finding him before our actual meeting.

1333
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:09,142
After that she took
to the streets like a hunter...

1334
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:13,017
and did not rest
until she had killed her quarry.

1335
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:18,488
But just a minute. Miss Quinton said
that Mrs Boynton was still alive...

1336
01:33:18,585 --> 01:33:21,657
when she and Lady Westholme
started out on their walk...

1337
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:25,036
and she was certainly dead
by the time they got back.

1338
01:33:25,341 --> 01:33:27,952
Miss Quinton agreed with Lady Westholme.

1339
01:33:28,928 --> 01:33:30,626
She grunted like a pig.

1340
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:32,628
Most offensive.

1341
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:38,623
But Miss Quinton is easily suggestible.
Only yesterday in the lobby, I said...

1342
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:41,382
That is the largest spider I have ever seen.

1343
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:44,306
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me.

1344
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:46,519
There was, of course, no spider...

1345
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:49,763
and Mrs Boynton at no time
grunted like a pig.

1346
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:53,058
I invented the spider.

1347
01:33:53,953 --> 01:33:57,228
And as for Mrs Boynton, oh, she was dead.

1348
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:02,107
What happened was that Lady Westholme
went back to her tent.

1349
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:05,203
She made herself
a headdress out of a sheet...

1350
01:34:10,136 --> 01:34:12,996
and a duster, in this manner here...

1351
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:21,509
and some kind of a cord.

1352
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:27,131
Like this.

1353
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:34,143
Then she went into Ginny's tent by mistake,
hence the story of the sheik.

1354
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,062
She came out
and went into the tent of Dr. King.

1355
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:45,192
Here she finds the hypodermic
and fills it, then she goes out...

1356
01:34:45,338 --> 01:34:50,202
to where Mrs Boynton is sitting,
grabs her wrist, and injects the poison.

1357
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:57,335
She leaves her sitting there
until Miss Quinton returns...

1358
01:34:57,433 --> 01:35:01,088
when Lady Westholme
invites her to go for a walk.

1359
01:35:03,273 --> 01:35:07,426
But why should Lady Westholme,
of all people, want to murder Mrs Boynton?

1360
01:35:08,194 --> 01:35:10,426
Lady Westholme was born an American...

1361
01:35:11,114 --> 01:35:14,555
but, of course,
she became more English than any native.

1362
01:35:15,827 --> 01:35:19,600
Mrs Boynton said she never forgot a face.

1363
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:23,904
Consider she was a wardress in a prison...

1364
01:35:24,544 --> 01:35:27,985
and your adjutant, Colonel,
has confirmed my suspicion...

1365
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,747
in a telephone call to the American police...

1366
01:35:31,009 --> 01:35:34,995
that Lady Westholme,
prior to her marriage was a criminal...

1367
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:39,166
who served a prison sentence
in that very same prison.

1368
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:42,091
So Stepmother was going to blackmail
Lady Westholme?

1369
01:35:42,187 --> 01:35:45,592
Well, not conventional blackmail.
No, there was no money involved.

1370
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:49,629
It just gave her the opportunity
of torturing her victim for a while.

1371
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,176
Then she'd enjoy revealing the truth.

1372
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,143
In the most spectacular way.

1373
01:35:54,991 --> 01:35:56,059
Precisely.

1374
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,459
Lady Westholme knew that the days
of her influence were numbered...

1375
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,854
if Mrs Boynton could not be silenced.

1376
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,357
Ladies and gentlemen...

1377
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:07,278
if you would care to go out to the terrace,
the fireworks await you.

1378
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:11,620
Fireworks, we've had them already.

1379
01:36:19,098 --> 01:36:20,582
I'll see you later.

1380
01:36:37,575 --> 01:36:40,186
Do you know what it is to come from nothing?

1381
01:36:40,787 --> 01:36:43,979
To climb inch by inch to respectability...

1382
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,943
to hear acclaim, to have position...

1383
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:51,483
to see all that turning to dust?

1384
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:53,955
She's better dead.

1385
01:36:55,051 --> 01:36:56,535
The family rejoice.

1386
01:36:57,637 --> 01:36:59,832
Should I be the only one to suffer?

1387
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:03,914
Will you arrest me Monsieur Poirot?

1388
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:07,130
That is up to Colonel Carbury, madame.

1389
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:09,877
Damn you.

1390
01:37:22,871 --> 01:37:25,813
Oh, I love that visual opulence.

1391
01:37:37,093 --> 01:37:38,197
God bless the King.

1392
01:37:38,303 --> 01:37:40,903
Oh, look. The royal crown,
can you see it over there?

1393
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:45,711
Yes, how nice and royal.
It gives you confidence, I always think.

1394
01:37:54,694 --> 01:37:55,794
Lady Westholme's room.

1395
01:37:55,862 --> 01:37:57,512
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Come on.

1396
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:58,551
What was that?

1397
01:37:58,656 --> 01:37:59,891
What's going on?

1398
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:02,603
She died while cleaning her gun.

1399
01:38:03,369 --> 01:38:04,936
What?

1400
01:38:05,038 --> 01:38:07,186
Suicide would mean another investigation.

1401
01:38:07,749 --> 01:38:12,400
She had trouble enough while alive.
Give her peace in death.

1402
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:19,916
A terrible accident, Lord Peel.

1403
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:23,452
There's nothing more that we could do.

1404
01:38:30,855 --> 01:38:34,296
The tragic death of Lady Westholme
occurred in Jerusalem yesterday.

1405
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,595
While cleaning her gun as I deduced.

1406
01:38:37,195 --> 01:38:39,592
She was ever a woman who knew her duty.

1407
01:38:39,697 --> 01:38:43,518
How British for a woman
to take the gentleman's way out.

1408
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:45,686
She was American.

1409
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:49,601
Oh, hello.

1410
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:52,341
Goodbye Hercule, goodbye Colonel Carbury.

1411
01:38:52,342 --> 01:38:55,000
You're going to America with this young man?

1412
01:38:55,338 --> 01:38:58,862
Oh, Ray is asked me to stay
in America. Only briefly, of course.

1413
01:38:59,384 --> 01:39:00,654
Of course.

1414
01:39:01,344 --> 01:39:04,370
I'm going digging in America,
Monsieur Poirot.

1415
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,701
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

1416
01:39:06,808 --> 01:39:08,541
- Have a good time.
- Bon voyage.

1417
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,216
Goodbye Monsieur Poirot.
Goodbye, Colonel Carbury.

1418
01:39:12,897 --> 01:39:16,338
Well, I hope they realise,
as Andre Gide did...

1419
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:19,008
that to free oneself is nothing.

1420
01:39:19,612 --> 01:39:23,468
The really arduous task is to know
what to do with one's freedom.

1421
01:39:24,492 --> 01:39:26,521
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1422
01:39:27,078 --> 01:39:28,609
- Goodbye.
- Au revoir.

1423
01:39:31,124 --> 01:39:33,521
Well, I think they'll be all right.

1423
01:39:34,305 --> 01:40:34,646
