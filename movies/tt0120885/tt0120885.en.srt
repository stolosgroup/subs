2
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,100
Another great race today, Johnny.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,500
Who are you gonna ride in the Stakes?

4
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,300
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
...and I live by it...

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,500
"Never change horses in midstream."

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,900
Always stick with a winner.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Keep America working.

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,200
Don't change horses in midstream.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,300
On election day, reelect the president.

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,800
Can you step this way, Mr. Brean?

13
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,300
Lift your arms, please.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,800
That's him. That's Mr. Fix-it.

15
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,800
It's right here.

16
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
You can have a seat right here, Connie.

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,300
He doesn't know anything.

18
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,300
John Levy's staff, his assistant...

19
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,900
...and of course Amy Cain, Press.

20
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes. Thank you. That'll be
all. Thank you, gentlemen.

21
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,000
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, black, please.

22
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Gaviston, bring some
coffee, please. Black.

23
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,600
All right. You kids here in this room...

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
...what you hear here, what say
here and what you do here...

25
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,600
...if it gets out, you leaked it.

26
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Tell them what they need to know.

27
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,200
When it broke, the president said
one thing, "Get me Conrad Brean."

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Anyway. What's the thing?

29
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
He had an illegal immigrant nanny
some years back? Didn't declare?

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,300
You people get ahead in the polls,
all of a sudden you get nervous.

31
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,300
He made a pass at some
secretary some years ago?

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,200
There was a group of Firefly Girls
from Sante Fe were here last month.

33
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
One of the girls expressed interest
in the Frederic Remington bust.

34
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
The President took her into the office, you know
the office behind the Oval Office for a period of...

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
Three minutes. It couldn't
have been over three minutes.

36
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,000
The Secret Service will
back me up on that.

37
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,700
So, it's not the illegal
immigrant nanny thing?

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,400
The girl's alleging...

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,700
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,300
Maybe we could say it was a
funny drug reaction to the flu.

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Who's got the story?

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,900
Don't you want to know if it's true?

43
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,300
What difference does it
make, if it is true?

44
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,700
It's a story and it breaks.
They gonna have to run with it.

45
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
How long we've got till it breaks?

46
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,300
Front page, Washington Post, tomorrow.

47
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Well, yeah. That's not good.

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
- Ok. Where is he?
- China.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
When is he due back?

50
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,700
They're set to leave pretty soon.

51
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,800
Yeah, well. All right. He stays on the
ground in China at least another day.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,100
Why?

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,700
- You the Press Office?
- Yes.

54
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,400
Earn your money. He's
ill. Play he's sick.

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
When do we bring him back?

56
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,300
I'm gonna need a day. At least a day.

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,400
He's sick. Get that out right now.

58
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Get them on the phone and tell
the jackals how sick he is.

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,700
We gotta get that out before the story
breaks. We have to correspond to it.

60
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,800
Issue a bulletin. He's
got some rare strain...

61
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,800
- Won't hold.
- I need a day. I need some running time.

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,000
It won't hold a day, Connie.

63
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,900
Yes, it will. You know
why? I'll tell you why.

64
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
Why is the president in China?

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,100
- Trade relations.
- You're goddamn right.

66
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
It's got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.

67
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,800
- There is no B-3 bomber.
- I just said that. There is no B-3 bomber.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't know why these
rumors get started.

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,500
All right. I need $20,000. I need a car.

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
All right. Get me a car and driver.

71
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,600
The southwest gate now, please.

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,300
What is it?

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Campaign commercial.
Should we look at it?

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Yeah, yeah. Put it in.

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
This should be interesting.

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,900
What is it?

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The rough cut. The other
side's new commercial.

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,500
The Neal commercial?

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,300
Yeah. We had somebody steal it.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,100
This'll be on the air
the day after tomorrow.

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,900
In the final days of the campaign...

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
...has the president changed his tune?

84
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,400
/Thank heaven for little girls.

85
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
The presidency is about honor.

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,300
/Thank heaven for little girls.

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
It's about principles.

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
/Without them, what
/would little boys do?

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,800
And it's about integrity.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,900
This tune has got to change.

91
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,000
On election day, vote
Neal for president.

92
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,700
Oh, boy.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
All right. Who's gonna take
the press conference today?

94
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,200
Is there a press conference today?

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,900
What do you think?

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,300
We gonna have to use this
as a base of operations.

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm gonna need one day, two days.

98
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,300
Whoever's leaking that stuff
to the Post lets it slip...

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
"I hope this won't screw
up the B-3 program."

100
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,700
"What B-3 program, and why
should it screw it up?"

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,200
"If the president decides
to deploy the B-3...

102
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,100
"...before it's fully tested..."

103
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
"Deploy the B-3 before
it's fully tested?"

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,800
"Yeah. Why?"

105
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,200
"Why? The crisis."

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,600
- What crisis?
- I'm working on that.

107
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,900
At the same time get General Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
...and put them on a plane
to Seattle right away.

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,800
He's nervous to talk
to the Boeing people.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
- But?
- But? But what?

111
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
But there isn't a B-3 bomber.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,700
- Where'd you go to school? Wellesley?
- Dartmouth.

113
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Show a little spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

114
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,300
General Scott, to the
best of your knowledge...

115
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,000
...is not in Seattle to talk to Boeing.

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
Connie, it won't prove out.

117
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,800
It doesn't have to prove out. We just gotta
distract them. We just gotta distract them.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,700
Got less than two weeks
till the election.

119
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,700
What in the world would do that?
What in the world would do that?

120
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,600
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

121
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Thank you.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
- What's this?
- $20,000.

124
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,900
I gotta go to L.A. and
see a Hollywood producer.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Meet me at National in an hour.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,100
We'll go to Chicago and
connect there to L.A.

127
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,600
See you at National.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,700
Tell me...Tell me... Tell me this again.

129
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,300
We landing?

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Tell me again.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't worry about. It's nothing new.

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
During Reagan's administration,
240 Marines killed in Beirut.

133
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
24 hours later, we invade Grenada.

134
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,800
That was their M.O.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
Change the story, change the lead.

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,800
It's not a new concept.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,700
Wake me when we land. We'll talk more.

138
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Wait. We can't afford a war.

139
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
We're not gonna have a war.

140
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,700
We're having the appearance of a war.

141
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,300
We cannot afford appearance of a war.

142
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,800
- What'll it cost?
- But they would find out.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,700
Who's gonna find out?
The American people?

144
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,700
- Exactly.
- Who's gonna tell them?

145
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,000
What did they find out
about the Gulf War?

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
One video of one bomb falls down
a chimney. Blows up the building.

147
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,700
The building could have
been made out of Legos.

148
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,300
- You really want us to go to war?
- That's the general idea.

149
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
With who?

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm working on it.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
- Albania?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
Why?

153
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Why not? What do you know about them?

154
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,800
- Nothing.
- Precisely.

155
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,700
They seem shifty, they seem standoffish.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I mean, who knows from Albania? What do you
know about Albania? Who trusts Albanians?

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
What did Albania ever do to us?

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,900
What did they do for us?

159
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,700
This is why we have to
mobilize the B-3 bomber.

160
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
You really want to go
to war with Albania?

161
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
We don't have a choice.
This is what you do.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

163
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
It didn't happen.

164
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
"Deny. There is no report
of Albanian activity."

165
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,100
They have to deny it.

166
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
- It didn't happen.
- Deny. Deny. Deny.

167
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
...news from the president
on his visit to China.

168
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,800
Another sort of news, however...

169
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,800
...has emerged from the
presidential quarter.

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Sante Fe...

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,700
...with this breaking news. Melissa.

172
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,400
Thanks, Richard. Today
a local Firefly Girl...

173
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,300
...accused the president
of sexual misconduct.

174
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
This photo of the
president with the girls...

175
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,700
...was taken during their
recent tour of the White House.

176
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
The girl claims that
the sexual misconduct...

177
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,400
...occurred inside the Oval Office.

178
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Her attorney says there
are no plans yet...

179
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,000
...to hold a press conference.

180
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,600
Right now, folks in Sante Fe
and the rest of America...

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,300
...are waiting for a response
from the White House...

182
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
...on these harsh allegations.

183
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,700
With the election only days
away, the big question is...

184
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,900
...how much will this
scandal affect the outcome?

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Top people, Albanian desk.

186
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,300
I don't know, either,
but probably we have one.

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
Listen. I want you to
roust them out of bed.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Albanian desk, CIA, NSA. Roust
them out of bed, sirens blaring.

189
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Honey, I know they're
gonna be up in an hour.

190
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
I want them up now. Now, listen
to me. Tell your staff...

191
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,900
General Scott in Seattle?

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Well. No. I don't think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,300
Excuse me, Miss. I'll have
to ask you to turn that off.

194
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,300
OK, I know. It'll just be a second.

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,100
Miss, there are no
electronics on the plane.

196
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,400
I really have to ask
you to turn that off.

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,100
It'll just take two seconds.

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
We've said flat out
there is no B-3 bomber.

199
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I understand. I understand.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
If it is true, he should,
he must step down...

201
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
...and if it's not true, then he must...

202
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,700
We are informed he has
extended his visit to China.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,100
I say on behalf of the
American people, come home.

204
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
Face the music, whatever that may be.

205
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
The election's in 11 days.

206
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Let the American people decide.

207
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
"Let the American people decide."

208
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Senator Neal, presidential candidate.

209
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,500
Excuse me, Senator.

210
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,400
That's 11 days till the election...

211
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
...and the president ahead
in the polls by... Bob?

212
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,500
Seventeen percent.

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Accusations have surfaced
which could affect the outcome.

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,000
The White House has announced that...

215
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,800
...in response to the media pressure...

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,700
...there will be a press conference.

217
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
My God. This is how a
Hollywood producer lives?

218
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,600
This is bigger than the White House.

219
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
Get me my veggie shake, Rumond...

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
...and remind me to turn
over in 10 minutes...

221
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,700
...to tan the other side.

222
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Do I know you?

223
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
We have some mutual
friends in Washington.

224
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,900
Yes, as you said, and is it true?

225
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
Mr. Motss, I wouldn't...

226
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,000
You wouldn't be here if it
wasn't true. It's true, right?

227
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,700
Really, who could say?

228
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,500
I like the guy. He
signed his book to me...

229
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,500
..."For two generations...
" I mean... What was it?

230
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,500
"For progress to
occur," I think he said.

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

232
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
That's what he inscribed.
How'd you know that?

233
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,600
That's the title of the book.

234
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,300
That's the title?

235
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,200
For Progress to Occur It's
Necessary for Two Generations to...

236
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,100
That's a terrible title.

237
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,700
You're right.

238
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,400
For Two Generations to
Agree. That is the title.

239
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
You know. I never looked at the cover.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
I just looked at what he wrote to me.

241
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
When you get the time,
you can read the cover.

242
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,200
John Levy is expected to respond
to the Firefly allegations...

243
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,400
...of sexual misconduct
by the president.

244
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,900
This guy is fucked.

245
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,300
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a holding action.

246
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,900
Holding action? They're going to
run this man through the shredder.

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
If we can hold the break in the dam
for 11 days till the election...

248
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,600
...I think we got a chance.

249
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
You can't hold the dam.
I mean, how the hell...

250
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,400
I don't get what you want me to do.

251
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,600
...advised him to stay on the ground
in China for one or two days.

252
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
During that time, of
course, we'll remain...

253
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,600
But he's gotta come back sometime.

254
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,800
What is one or two days gonna buy you?

255
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Look at all those hands.

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,100
Brer Rabbit couldn't get out of this.

257
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,500
Would you comment
please on the rumors...

258
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,500
...that the president's fly...
the president's delay...

259
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,300
...is due to the situation in Albania?

260
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,200
There is...

261
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm not aware of the
situation to which you refer.

262
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Sir, we've just learned that
the State Department...

263
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,100
...has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.

264
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Mr. Sklansky, I am... We
have... Mrs. Rose, yes?

265
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,200
Early this morning, General
Scott flew to Seattle.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Is his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?

267
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,400
Mrs. Rose, there... To the best of my
knowledge, there is no B-3 bomber.

268
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related anyway...

269
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,300
...to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?

270
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,000
Now they get it. Now they get it.

271
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,000
There you go. There's a little help.

272
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
...that have some
fundamentalist movements...

273
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
How close are you to this thing?

274
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,900
What do you want the kid to say?

275
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,300
We will keep you apprised
of any new information.

276
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,200
Regarding these groups, at this
time, there is no information about...

277
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
Have him say...

278
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,100
I know we're all concerned
for the president.

279
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

280
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,300
Could you have Levy say...

281
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
"I know we're all concerned
for the president.

282
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,700
"I'm sure our hopes and
prayers are with him."

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,600
I just wanna say that I know that we
are all concerned for the president...

284
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
...and that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

285
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
He didn't phrase it right.

286
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,600
He didn't sell the line.

287
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,900
All right, you bought
yourself one day, maybe two.

288
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,400
For bring them together, all I
need is 11 till the election.

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Are you gonna stretch it? This
isn't gonna hold for 11 days.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,900
- The guy fucked a Girl Scout.
- A Firefly Girl.

291
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,200
He fucked a Firefly Girl.

292
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
What are you gonna do to hold that off?

293
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,600
Excuse me. I'm gonna
get my veggie shake.

294
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,500
What do you think would
hold it off, Mr. Motss?

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

296
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,500
I mean, you, you... You'd
have to have a war.

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,500
You're kidding. You're not kidding.

298
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm in show business,
yes? Why come to me?

299
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,700
I'll tell you why, Mr. Motss.

300
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
"54, 40, or fight." What does that mean?

301
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,400
- It's a slogan. It's from...
- "Remember the Maine."

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah, that's gotta be.

303
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,300
"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."
- No, that's not.

304
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
They're war slogans, Mr. Motss.

305
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,400
We remember the slogans, we can't
even remember the fucking wars.

306
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
- You know why?
- Why?

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,700
- That's show business. That's why we're here.
- I see.

308
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,500
Naked girl, covered in napalm.

309
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,800
"V" for victory.

310
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,100
5 Marines raising the
flag, Mount Surabachi.

311
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
You remember the picture 50
years, but forget the war.

312
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,700
The Gulf War, smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

313
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

314
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,600
One video of one bomb, Mr. Motss.

315
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,100
The American people bought that war.

316
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,000
War is show business.
That's why we're here.

317
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,600
And what do you do for the president?

318
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Why Albania?

319
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Why not?

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They gotta know at some point.

321
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
Who?

322
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,900
You know. The... The public.

323
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,500
- They gotta know?
- Yes.

324
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Stan, get with it. Who killed Kennedy?

325
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,500
I read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

326
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,700
It says he was killed by a drunk driver.

327
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
You watched The Gulf War. What
do you see day after day?

328
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
The one smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

329
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,400
The truth?

330
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,600
I was in the building
when we shot that shot.

331
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,700
We shot it in a studio in
Falls Church, Virginia.

332
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
1/10 scale model of a building.

333
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,200
Is that true?

334
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
How the fuck do we
know? You take my point?

335
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,100
Yes. All right. Ok.

336
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,600
You want me to do what?

337
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
We want you to produce.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,400
You want me to produce your war?

339
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
Not a war. It's a pageant.

340
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
We need a theme, a song, some visuals.

341
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,400
It's a pageant.

342
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
It's like the Oscars.
That's why we came to you.

343
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
I never won an Oscar.

344
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,500
That's a damn shame you didn't,
but you produced the Oscars.

345
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,400
Yes. Indeed, I did.

346
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,900
You know, you're a writer,
that's your script.

347
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,800
You're a director, but if you're
the producer, what do you do...

348
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,800
...nobody knows what you do.

349
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,500
The producer, I mean, all
he's got is the credit.

350
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,000
You see? And some plaques on the wall.

351
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,800
They don't know what we
do. Don't get me started.

352
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,700
If you never won an Oscar...

353
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
...how would you like an ambassadorship?

354
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,300
An ambassadorship? That's my payoff?

355
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Tell me what you want.

356
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,800
Fellow, I'd just do it for fun
of it. For a story to tell.

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
You couldn't tell anybody.

358
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm just kidding.

359
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,100
- I mean, you couldn't tell anybody.
- No, no, no. It's just a figure of speech.

360
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,400
It's a pageant.

361
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
It's a pageant. That's what it is.

362
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
The country's at war.

363
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,100
It's Miss America. You're Bert Parks.

364
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
- Why Albania?
- Because...

365
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,700
They have to have something we want.
What do we have that they want?

366
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,500
- Freedom.
- Why would they want that?

367
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,200
- Oppressed?
- No, no, no. Fuck freedom.

368
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,500
They want to destroy the
godless Satan on the United.

369
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,800
They want to destroy our way of life.

370
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,700
All right? Ok? Ok? Ok?

371
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
The president is in China.

372
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
He is dealing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to Albania.

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,100
Why?

374
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,200
Why? Help me.

375
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,500
All right, all right. Let's
see. Geo-politically if we...

376
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,900
We just found out they have the bomb.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
We just found out they have the bomb.

378
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,000
- That's good.
- And, and... wait a second.

379
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,200
No, no. The bomb's not there...

380
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,600
...because they'd have to
have a rocket and that shit.

381
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,900
They are a bunch of wogs. No,
no. Cross that out. All right.

382
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
It's a suitcase bomb.

383
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
I didn't know I said that.

384
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,100
It's a suitcase bomb.
You don't need missiles.

385
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,000
You can put a bomb in a suitcase. Right?

386
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,300
It's a suitcase bomb.

387
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,900
That's good. A suitcase bomb.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,700
It's a suitcase bomb.

389
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,800
When it's cooking, it's cooking.

390
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,200
We're cooking, and it's
in... it's in...it's in...

391
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,400
Canada. All right?

392
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Albanian terrorists have
placed a suitcase bomb...

393
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,500
...in Canada in an attempt to
infiltrate the bomb into the USA.

394
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,900
That's good.

395
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's terrific. I'll tell
you why. It is cost effective.

396
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,300
It's producing. That's what it is.

397
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
- It's really great.
- I could tell you stories.

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Cecil B. De Mille, all right?
The Greatest Show on Earth...

399
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
...he needs an elephant.

400
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
I got the president on the line.

401
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,800
One minute. Hey, one minute.

402
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,300
De Mille, right?

403
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,100
Needs an elephant for a
reshoot. Know what he does?

404
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Ames here. Yes, sir?

405
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
You listening?

406
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,600
- Nobody's listening.
- I'm listening.
- Ok, ok, ok.

407
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,900
- The suitcase bomb.
- Good title for a movie.

408
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Please, write it down.
Don't editorialize.

409
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,600
The thinking is, terrorism.

410
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,000
Act One: Albania denies everything.

411
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,200
The president comes on
the air, "Be calm."

412
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Know what I need right now?

413
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,400
You better get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

414
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Isn't Johnny Dean in the...

415
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,000
Back in Nashville.

416
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,500
- Ok. Act Two.
- We don't need an Act Two.

417
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Don't forget Fad King. We
don't need an Act Two?

418
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
We just have to hold their interest
for 11 days till the election.

419
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,800
It's a teaser.

420
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,300
It's a teaser. Absolutely right.

421
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
- Grace!
- Yeah.
- Teaser.

422
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,700
They're getting a really good
reaction on the Albanian thing.

423
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,000
Hello, John, you two-bit redneck
shitkicker. How the heck are you?

424
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,500
Get out. Get out.

425
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
He's got a new wife.

426
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Right now, he's riding in a pickup
truck with a shotgun and a dog.

427
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Listen, listen. We needed
you here yesterday.

428
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,900
All right? Yes? Come on.
Get your ass out here.

429
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,800
The president wonders about
the possible Albanian backlash.

430
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
You can't have a war without an enemy.

431
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
We could have one, but it
would be a very dull war.

432
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
How long do we need him here for?

433
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
We're done in 11 days.

434
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,100
Eleven days, John. We need you.

435
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,500
You want to write a song for us?

436
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Is there gonna be a
back end on this thing?

437
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
What?

438
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,300
Is there gonna be a
back end on this thing?

439
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
What? Back end?

440
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Yeah. You know.
Percentage points, money.

441
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, count on it.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Where is the back end coming from?

443
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,500
Lots of cash, John.

444
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,300
- It's like a thing with yellow ribbon.
- Thing with the yellow ribbon?

445
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,900
- Yeah. The hostages.
- Hostages?

446
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,300
They tied the yellow
ribbons around everything.

447
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah. But that was a
naturally occurring...

448
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,700
That was a put-up job?

449
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,100
All right. Grace! Grace!

450
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Yes. What?

451
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
Jezz!

452
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,700
I want you to get Johnny a ticket. OK?

453
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,300
- Fad King on two.
- Ok.

454
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,900
He's riding in a pickup truck
right now with a shotgun and a dog.

455
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,300
Are you shitting me?

456
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,200
King, listen, got a thing
here, product placement.

457
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,700
Of course there's a back end.

458
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
- It can't be a ribbon.
- What's wrong with a ribbon?

459
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,800
Because, AIDS has the
yellow ribbon thing.

460
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Fuck ribbons.

461
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Look. Canada. Ok? Our
neighbor to the north...

462
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,700
...all of a sudden transformed
into that place from whence...

463
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
...like the north wind, terror comes.

464
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
I like that. Keep
talking. That's what...

465
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,200
What guards us against Canada?

466
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,600
I guard the Canadian border.

467
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,300
Mounties guard the border. Mountie hats.

468
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,700
Stupid fucking hats.

469
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,300
What? Davy Crockett had a
hat. We may have a fortune.

470
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
You could crush them and
put them in your pocket.

471
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,400
You can't put a mountie hat in your pocket.
You need a pocket the size of fucking Detroit.

472
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,700
You see this? This is what producing is.

473
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,400
You put me in a room
with talent...electric.

474
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,800
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking
armbands. That's what I'm thinking.

475
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,900
- Armbands is good.
- I'm thinking... I'm thinking green. OK? Not like Kelly green.

476
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,900
Last year, the number one selling
color in new cars in America was green.

477
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,100
- People like green.
- Hunter.

478
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,600
Hunter green. Strong, pride, dignity.

479
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,300
But not Kelly green.
You know what I mean?

480
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,800
I like it with a hat.
What if we had a hat...

481
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,400
- Maybe. That could be.
- You see that?

482
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,400
Sit on my lap if you love me...

483
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,900
...but don't put your hand down there.

484
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,900
I didn't mean...

485
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,700
We'll take a short nap.

486
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
See, I just thought you should see it.

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,300
I don't think it should be a song.

488
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
- I'm glad that your mama's not here.
- He misunderstood.

489
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
No, no, no. I mean if
you do a song about it.

490
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
I just thought it was funny.

491
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,600
Sit on my lap...

492
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
I don't think it's appropriate
for what we're doing.

493
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,300
I just meant for you to see it.

494
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,000
I guard the Canadian border.

495
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
The president spent the
weekend pressing the flesh.

496
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
He wasn't campaigning.
He was dating, actually.

497
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,900
Connie, change this. Thank you.

498
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,900
Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,100
...taking refuge these scant
days away from the election.

500
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,100
Young girl in rubble.

501
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,300
She was driven from her home
by Albanian terrorists. Ok?

502
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,100
- It is her we are mobilizing to defend.
- Yes.

503
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,100
- Or is it she?
- It is her we are mobilizing.

504
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,700
- Can we get her a kitten?
- Yeah.

505
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,900
Young girl in rubble with a kitten.

506
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,200
Good. That's good.

507
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,500
OK. See. This is too static.

508
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,400
Young girl running from the village.

509
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
More energy.

510
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
Time to face these terrible charges...

511
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,200
...to answer all of these questions.

512
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
- What's this, Stanley?
- It's head shots.

513
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,100
Girls to you know, play the victim
you know, in our news footage.

514
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
OK. Write this down.

515
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,800
Young girl running from
village towards camera.

516
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Grainy, hand-held, you
know, news footage.

517
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,000
Send it to everyone.

518
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,900
What do you think of these
people? I like the sorrowful one.

519
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,200
What the hell is this again?

520
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,500
Young Albanian girl
running from her home.

521
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,700
I like this broad right here.

522
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,600
Where? No. Yours is too Texan.

523
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,500
We're locked into Albania. Why?

524
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Albania's hard to rhyme.

525
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,300
What are you looking at me for?

526
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,800
It's the name of the country.

527
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,600
Albanian. Albanian.

528
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
That rhymes.

529
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,400
- John Belushi?
- Jim.

530
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Jim Belushi.

531
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
- Jim Belushi what?
- Albanian.

532
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,000
Jim Belushi's Albanian?

533
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,400
Sure, it's thing you
know. Are you kidding?

534
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,300
Anybody know who's ever eaten
in an Albanian restaurant?

535
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,400
- Is there such a thing an Albanian restaurant?
- Has to be. They have to eat.

536
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,200
- Is there a national dish?
- No. Nobody would know. We can make it up.

537
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Jim Belushi is Albanian.

538
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,500
What time is it?

539
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
3:03.

540
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,500
Great idea.

541
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,100
To the men and women of the
303 detachment with their...

542
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,500
Leopard skin.

543
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,700
With their berets.

544
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,100
How about all black?

545
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,100
That's good.

546
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,500
Half black, half leopard...

547
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
...wear it on your head.

548
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,700
Half black, half leopard...

549
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,600
...wear it to your head.

550
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I guard the American dream.

551
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I guard the American dream.

552
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,000
Everybody's always in
a hurry these days.

553
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
If they're not rushing somewhere...

554
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,700
...there'll be changing something
that doesn't need changing.

555
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,000
That's why I'm glad we're
standing behind the president.

556
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Sure we are. It just makes good sense.

557
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
You don't want to change
horses in midstream.

558
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,500
Why are they sticking with
this age-old horseshit?

559
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,900
Why are they sticking with
the same old garbage?

560
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,800
- Who hires these people?
- I feel insulted just having seen it. You know what I mean?

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,100
- It's offensive.
- Poorly costumed.

562
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,700
New York Times, Washington
Post: War. War. War.

563
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,900
Times got the Firefly Girl
in the Style section.

564
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,700
Post on page 12.

565
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,900
It's good. Hello?

566
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,200
It's very important. Listen up, Connie.

567
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,200
It's all war. You're doing good.

568
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Would you vote for that person
based on that commercial?

569
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,500
- You know, I don't vote.
- Why don't you vote?

570
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,500
Last time I vote when that one time Major
League Baseball started the fans voting...

571
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,900
...I voted for Boog Powell on
first base. He didn't get in it...

572
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,100
...and it just disappointed
me. Stayed with me.

573
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,100
It's futile.

574
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,100
You've never voted for president?

575
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
No. Do you vote?

576
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,100
No. I always vote for
the Academy Awards...

577
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,200
...but I never win.

578
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,600
Liz, do you vote? Do you vote?

579
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,900
No. I don't vote. I
don't like the rooms.

580
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,200
Too claustrophobic. I
can't vote in small places.

581
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,200
- It's about that time.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

582
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,300
We got the Albanian girl with a
cat, with a kitten, and with a dog.

583
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,600
But I don't want a dog.
I asked for a kitten.

584
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,600
I understand that, but the
pet wrangler suggested...

585
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,700
I think I need to speak to the president
before you decide on the animal.

586
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,000
You don't understand. Can't they
find me a kitten? Listen to me.

587
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,600
Albanian terrorists
have a staging area...

588
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
...for their atomic workshop.
That's why she's fleeing.

589
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,500
Listen this. Just follow this. What if it
wasn't Albania? Let's say it was Italy?

590
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,200
I can get a lot of cash if it's Italy.
Listen this concept. "The boot."

591
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,400
"Give them the boot." What
if a shoe was the fad?

592
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,400
OK. The little girl is
coming toward the camera.

593
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
What does she have in
her hands? A kitten.

594
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,700
Better.

595
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,300
Albania doesn't do anything for me.

596
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,700
I think that's the problem.

597
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,600
- We're locked into Albania.
- Why is that?

598
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
The president's gonna go to war
with Albania in about 30 minutes.

599
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
Declaring war on Albania?

600
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,200
No. We're not declaring
war. We're going to war.

601
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,600
We haven't declared
war since World War II.

602
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,700
- We're going to war?
- We're going to war.

603
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.

604
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,500
The president of the United States...

605
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,800
...has said that he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...

606
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
...and he assures that
it is necessary...

607
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,800
...for the safety of the
men and women in combat.

608
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,100
He says that the Republic of Albania...

609
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,700
...long a staging ground for
terrorism around the world.

610
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,700
He has mentioning a state of
war is or is about to happen...

611
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,700
...between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.

612
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,300
How many kittens do we have, Grace?

613
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,800
There ought to be kittens
a-plenty, Stanley. I had a call.

614
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,600
All right, people. Let's get started.

615
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Ok?

616
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,300
Hi.

617
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,600
Hello. My name is Stanley Motss.
I'll be your producer this morning.

618
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,900
What I would like you to do,
Miss... What is your name?

619
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Tracy Lime.

620
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
Tracy, stand against that wall,
and on my signal "action"...

621
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,000
...I want you running
toward me, screaming.

622
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,800
- Can we get you anything?
- I'm fine.

623
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,900
How about a cup of tea?
A little milk, low fat?

624
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,100
You Ok?

625
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,300
OK. Fine. Let's just try
one. I wanna we just try.

626
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,600
Is this a national? Is that the case?

627
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,500
- Well, it's a little bit...
- It's a direct buy-out.

628
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Yeah. Why just have your
agent... What the hell is this?

629
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,100
What is this, a menagerie?
I want kittens.

630
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,900
I can't wait to put this on my resume.

631
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
I just want kittens.

632
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,500
Tracy, can I talk to
you for a minute please?

633
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,100
This is a special kind of situation.
It's a funny kind of situation.

634
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,100
Well, Sir. We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be...

635
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,400
It's a Lhasa apso.

636
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,900
Lhasa apso?

637
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,400
It couldn't have been simpler. Kittens.

638
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,500
What you got here is basically a cross
between a dog and what a substantially...

639
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,400
No. I don't wanna cross.
I just want kittens.

640
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,000
Absolutely, sir. Absolutely.
The president wants a kitten.

641
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,400
No. I want a kitten.

642
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,200
Well. Get a kitten.

643
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,100
Get rid of all the dogs
and keep the kittens.

644
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,500
Miss. Excuse me.

645
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm gonna have to have you sign
this little sheet of paper here.

646
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,100
Well, my agent would be real
real miffed with me if I...

647
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,900
This doesn't have to do with your deal.

648
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,400
This is your security clearance.

649
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,500
Right there.

650
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,900
Nice signature. Thank you, Tracy.

651
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,800
Nice meeting you, Tracy.

652
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
This is a nice one.

653
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,700
No, no. But that's not a kitten.
That's a cat. These are kittens.

654
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,400
They just wanted to
give you some options.

655
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,200
Yes, but it's too confusing. That
guy keeps pushing the Lopso opso.

656
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,500
Lhasa apso.

657
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
- Things in the mix. We'll do it optically.
- We're gonna do it digitally.

658
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,700
OK. Let's try to shoot one.

659
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
- Stacey?
- Tracy.

660
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,900
I want you to stand over right here.

661
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,300
OK? Here you go. Right there.

662
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,400
- These are chips.
- Yeah.

663
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,900
Hold the bag when you run.

664
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,800
We need it for the arm position.
On screen, it'll be a kitten.

665
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Can I hold the kitten?

666
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,000
No. We'll punch it in
later. Right there.

667
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
You're gonna punch the kitten later?

668
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,800
- Yes.
- Why?

669
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
For a wider set of options.

670
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,000
A wider option of what?

671
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,900
Of kittens.

672
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,100
Sir, all kidding aside, when this goes
national, I get to put it on my resume?

673
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,600
Actually, no.

674
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,900
Because... What is it, a guild
thing or something? I mean...

675
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,400
You can never tell anyone you did this.

676
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,800
What could they do me?

677
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,200
They'd come to your house and kill you.

678
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
The president.

679
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,700
Stop the makeup. She's
been raped by terrorists.

680
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,000
- She's not pale enough.
- Jump out, please.

681
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,000
They're starting to shoot now...

682
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,100
...and they're gonna do
the kitten thing optically.

683
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,900
That's right, Mr. President.

684
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,900
I don't know how they do
the kitten optically...

685
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,600
...but they know what they're doing.

686
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,800
Sir, she's not an illegal
immigrant, is she?

687
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,100
Could I see the contract, please?

688
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,900
Why is it so flat?

689
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Because the president cannot
employ an illegal immigrant.

690
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,300
- Let's use more spray.
- Cover up.

691
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,300
Let's keep working people!

692
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,800
Are we getting there?

693
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,100
OK. Good. Put the village behind her.

694
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,100
Gimme some flames.

695
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
How about some screaming?

696
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
Screaming's good.

697
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,500
Some sound of screaming.

698
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,000
- What might be good is ooh-ahh sirens.
- What the hell is ohh-ahh?

699
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,700
You know. Anne Frank.

700
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
OK. That's good.

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,100
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

702
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,700
That's chilling. That's good.

703
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,200
That's giving me goose bumps.

704
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,900
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

705
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
We're gonna be back in Washington when?

706
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,300
We'll be back tonight.

707
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
Tonight is...

708
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,100
It seems that Senator Neal
has discovered something.

709
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,600
It makes no difference
about Senator Neal.

710
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I don't care what Senator
Neal's got. We got a war.

711
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,600
Look at that girl.

712
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,800
Doesn't she look Albanian?

713
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,600
She looks like she was born
and raised in Albania.

714
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
I got an instinct for
casting. Don't ask me why.

715
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,300
OK. We're gonna do it again, sweetie.

716
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,400
- What's her name, Stacey?
- Tracy.

717
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,100
One more time, Tracy. You're
doing fine. You're doing fine.

718
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,700
Could she be running across a bridge?

719
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,700
She's running across a burning bridge.

720
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,800
- That looks good.
- That's beautiful.

721
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,600
Of course, we'll need some water.

722
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,300
Is it a stream?

723
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,700
No, I think...

724
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
- A pond?
- No, I think...

725
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,900
I think it's a calico kitten.

726
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,300
She's running across with a kitten.

727
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,100
Can we have a calico kitten? Please.

728
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,800
Floyd, punch in a calico kitten.

729
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,100
I have 19 screens here.

730
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
I can't see one calico kitten.

731
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,500
The thinking is as of this moment
a small calico kitten, sir.

732
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,100
- Calico kitten.
- OK.

733
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,500
We have a small calico
kitten, sir. Calico.

734
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,500
- What?
- He wants a white one.

735
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,700
He wants a white one?

736
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
Let me talk to him.

737
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,600
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

738
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
Connie, can I please talk to him?

739
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

740
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,700
I hate it when they start to meddle.

741
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,100
Can we have a white one?

742
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,700
He wants a white one.

743
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,500
Thank you.

744
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Are we ready yet?

745
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
How soon you think we will
able to get this cut?

746
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,000
We're gonna be done in 4 or 5 hours.

747
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,900
That's good. We can leak
that to the press...

748
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
...they can downlink it on
Tel star 401, transporter 21.

749
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,700
Makes you glad you've lived this long.

750
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,300
This just in newsbreak a special
report from the Albanian front.

751
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,700
We've just received information that...

752
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,900
...the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...

753
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,700
...is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals in her village.

754
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,300
America has seldom witnessed...

755
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,100
...a more poignant
picture of the human race.

756
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,600
- Fantastic.
- That was good.

757
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,500
They used the same process...

758
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
...with the last Schwarzenegger movie.

759
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,900
- Fantastic.
- Isn't that amazing how they do that?

760
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,500
You know what, Conrad? This
is only the beginning.

761
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,200
Wait till we get the song.

762
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Then you got the song, the image,
the merchandising tie-ins.

763
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,300
You know. This is only the beginning.

764
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,200
- We were right. You're the man.
- You're the man.

765
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,700
- To the beginning.
- To the beginning.
- To the beginning.

766
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,100
Got your car.

767
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,700
I hate it when they
send these long ones.

768
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
- Did you make the turn OK?
- Not a problem.

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm sorry, Conrad. You
think it's too ostentatious?

770
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
Just fine. I'll stretch out.

771
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,500
- OK. Good. Just make due.
- OK.

772
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,300
I'll see you in Nashville.

773
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,500
Go to the two-tone hat.

774
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,000
I don't care. You work it out.

775
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,300
You must have had similar
situations in the past.

776
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,200
There are unconfirmed reports at
this time from a reliable source...

777
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
...that things are in motion.

778
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,500
What I'm hearing and this is a quote...

779
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,400
"The president is looking for a swift...

780
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,800
...painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war."

781
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,800
However, the source
will not go on record.

782
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
All I can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.

783
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,900
New York Times, Washington Post...

784
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,300
...Detroit Register, Sacramento Bee...

785
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,200
...all in remission. No mention
of the Firefly Girl. None.

786
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,100
10 days to go. Big Bird
touches down when?

787
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
We bring him tomorrow at 5 a.m.

788
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,100
Anything at the airport?

789
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,900
The press thought no. What do you think?

790
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,800
Here's what I think. Is it gonna rain?

791
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,500
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning? Andrews, 5 a.m.?

792
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,200
A young Albanian girl...

793
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,500
...dressed in her... whatever.

794
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Is there some festival
some harvest festival...

795
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
...an Albanian harvest
festival, something like that?

796
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,100
Get on this right away. Find me an harvest
festival. Albanian harvest festival.

797
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
There's gotta be something.

798
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,600
Anyway, she gives him the
sacred whatever it is...

799
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,400
...telling him this is a
sacred traditional offering...

800
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
...given to the man who
ties the first sheaf...

801
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,300
...the last sheaf, who
the fuck knows what sheaf?

802
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,100
This is good. Is she
saying this in Albanian?

803
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,100
She's speaking in Albanian...

804
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
...because this is the only
way it can be understood...

805
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,900
...by her sacred,
sainted, and aged mother.

806
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,400
We're picking them up now.

807
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,200
Now the old lady starts to speak.

808
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,100
"You have brought peace
not only to this... "

809
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,500
No, no. The child speaks.

810
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,400
A face of innocence, no cynicism.

811
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,800
The child says...

812
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,300
Are you getting this?

813
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,100
Now, the old broad starts
to break down and cry.

814
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,200
Big Bird shrugs off his secret
service, goes over there...

815
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,500
...covers her with his
own coat, end of story.

816
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,000
Can you find out if there is any chance we could
get some rain at Andrews tomorrow? Thank you.

817
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,100
How is Big Bird holding up by the way?

818
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,300
He's good.

819
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,300
He does want to know... Forget about the
office. What does your fellow Motss want?

820
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,700
I don't know. Ambassador to Togo.

821
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,300
No rain tomorrow at Andrews, but
we do have a rain at Boca Raton.

822
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,300
Then direct the plane to Boca.

823
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,000
OK. Connie says let's
divert the plane to Boca.

824
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,700
What's happening?

825
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,300
Can I help you?

826
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,500
What's the problem?

827
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,200
We're really in a rush here.

828
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
Do you know who we are?

829
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm afraid that's the
trouble, Miss Ames.

830
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,600
CIA.

831
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,000
What am I gonna do?

832
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,500
I have a three-year-old daughter...

833
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,900
...eventually headed for orthodonture.

834
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh, God. Now that the CIA knows,
I'm gonna lose everything...

835
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
...my career, my reputation.
What am I gonna do?

836
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Brazen it through.

837
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
Took you long enough?

838
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
We found them as soon as we could, sir.

839
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,200
All right.

840
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,100
After I'm done with them,
what do they want me to do?

841
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,700
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

842
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
...let the FBI trip over them?

843
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,200
Legal department says you pick.

844
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,300
Depends on what we want to do with them.

845
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,600
This is a newsbreak special
report on the war in Albania.

846
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,300
We've just received more details...

847
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,700
...of the young Albanian girl
seen running for her life.

848
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,000
The young girl was trying to escape
after hearing her family was killed.

849
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Apparently, there was a
family connection in Canada.

850
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Two things I know to be true...

851
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,500
...there's no difference between
good flan and bad flan...

852
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,300
...and there is no war.

853
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,700
Guess who I am.

854
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,400
I would like to point out that
I am under medical care...

855
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,900
...and taking medication, side
effects of which have a little bit...

856
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
Quite touching.

857
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,400
I also take this opportunity...

858
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,100
...to suggest that, equally,
I admit to nothing...

859
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,000
...and I would like my lawyer present.

860
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
We show, and NSA confirms...

861
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,500
...there are no nuclear
devices on the Canadian border.

862
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,800
There are no nuclear devices in Albania.

863
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,000
Albania has no nuclear capacity.

864
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,700
Our spy satellites show no secret
terrorist training camps...

865
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,700
...in the Albanian hinterland.

866
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,700
The border patrol, the
FBI, the RCMP report...

867
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,300
...no... repeat... no
untoward activity...

868
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,700
...along our picturesque
Canadian border.

869
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,600
The Albanian government
is screaming its defense.

870
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
The world is listening.

871
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,900
There is no war.

872
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,400
Of course, there's a war. I'm
watching it on television.

873
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Who might you be? What
you all said and done?

874
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,900
- My name is Conrad Brean.
- Who do you work for?

875
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
Nobody whose name you want me to
say, Mr. Young. I promise you.

876
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
So well and good, but when
the fit hits the shan...

877
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
...somebody has to stay after school.

878
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,600
Who do you suppose that might be?

879
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

880
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,300
The spy satellites show it, Mr. Brean.

881
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,700
They show no war.

882
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,500
Then what good are they
if they show no war?

883
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,800
I mean, why we spend a quarter trillion
dollars a year on defense department?

884
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,100
What good are they if they show nothing?

885
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,700
Are they useless or
just broken? Or what?

886
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
I would like to point out further...

887
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,400
...that these medications
taken in conjunction...

888
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
If there's no threat,
then where are you?

889
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,800
Let me go one more. If there's
no threat, what good are you?

890
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,600
Mr. Brean, you are the threat.

891
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm the threat? I am the threat?

892
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,900
What have I been doing
the last 30 years...

893
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,200
...that you haven't been doing.
You wanna me fool in on that?

894
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,900
The last 30 years, Mr. Brean...

895
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,100
...I have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

896
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,800
I'm sure that speaks well
of you and your parents...

897
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
...but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

898
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,600
...and the security of your
job, which would you pick?

899
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,900
While you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

900
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,600
...that they are one in the
same. Your country and your job.

901
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm doing my job, Mr. Brean.
That's what you see me doing.

902
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm doing my job, too.

903
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,800
Let me ask you something. Let
me ask you a simple question.

904
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,900
Why do people go to war?
Why they go to war?

905
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,900
- I'll play your silly game.
- OK. Why they go to war?

906
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,300
To ensure their way of life.

907
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,200
- Would you fight to do that?
- I have.

908
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,900
If you went to war again,
who would it be against?

909
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Your ability to fight a
two-ocean war against who?

910
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,500
Sweden and Togo?

911
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
That time has passed. It's over.

912
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,300
The war of the future
is nuclear terrorism.

913
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,500
It'll be against a small
group of dissidents...

914
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,400
...who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

915
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,900
To go to that war, you
have to be prepared.

916
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,400
You gotta be alert. The
public has gotta be alert...

917
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
...because that is the
war of the future...

918
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,200
...and if you're not gearing
up to fight that war...

919
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
...then eventually the ax will
fall. You'll be out in the street.

920
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
You can call this a drill,
call this job security...

921
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,100
...call it anything you
like, but I got one for you.

922
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,800
You go to war to preserve
your way of life.

923
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Chuck, this is your way of life.

924
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
And if your spy satellites
don't see nothing...

925
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,700
...if there ain't no war...

926
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,700
...then you can go home and
take up golf my friend...

927
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,800
...'cause there ain't no war but ours.

928
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
Thank you.

929
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,000
- Drive carefully.
- Bye bye.

930
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,400
Nice enough people.

931
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,000
They just hadn't thought it through.

932
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,000
You talked us out of there.

933
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,100
No, no. We just got delayed.
We're going to Nashville.

934
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,400
What?

935
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,400
I said you could talk
a dog off a meat truck.

936
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,100
Thank you.

937
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,600
No, no, no. We just got stuck. It's ok.

938
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,300
All systems five-by-five.
See you in Nashville.

939
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,100
You saved our bacon.

940
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,600
It was just a phenomenal performance.

941
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,900
You turned them around. You
turned them around like a...

942
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,700
They just hadn't thought it through.

943
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,700
He's moving across the tarmac.

944
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,800
But it appears something has
distracted the president...

945
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,400
...and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.

946
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,200
I appears there's a little girl...

947
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,100
...trying to speak to the president.

948
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,300
It seems she's speaking
in... Is it Albanian?

949
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,700
Can we get someone to translate?

950
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,000
Dan, I think what she is saying...

951
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,900
...is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...

952
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,600
...and that it is the first sheaf...

953
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,200
...the first cut of the harvest.

954
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
I'm not proficient in Albanian...

955
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,000
...but the old woman is quite taken...

956
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,300
...as the president is
offering her the coat.

957
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,000
It is quite an emotional moment here.

958
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,100
/There comes a time in the
/course of human events...

959
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,700
/...when a threat must be answered
/with courage and strength.

960
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:21,500
/Our forefathers earned
/the right to be free.

961
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,800
/Now it's time to guard their dream.

962
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,000
/We guard our American borders.

963
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,900
/We guard the American dream.

964
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,100
/We guard our right to
/fight for democracy...

965
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,600
/...and keep our country free.

966
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,900
/We guard our American spirit.

967
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,400
/We guard the American dream.

968
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,200
/Our country's built on
/the rock of liberty.

969
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,200
/And we, as people must keep it free.

970
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,700
/It is for life...

971
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,100
/...liberty...

972
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,200
/...the pursuit of happiness...

973
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,200
/...freedom, 'tis of thee.

974
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,500
/We guard our American borders.

975
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,900
/We guard the American dream.

976
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,500
I loved the fat, wet Albanian broad.

977
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,600
Thank you.

978
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,400
You know why? It was understated.

979
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,300
You got lucky with the rain, too.

980
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,600
We had to divert the
plane to Boca Raton.

981
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,900
You should have come to
me. We have rain machines.

982
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,600
I'm a producer. I make rain.

983
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,900
Next time.

984
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,600
I have just gotten word...

985
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,900
...that the situation in
Albania is resolved...

986
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,200
...that it is resolved.

987
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,900
The CIA confirms...

988
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,900
...that our troops along
the Canadian border...

989
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,900
...and overseas are standing down.

990
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,900
I must take this opportunity to
call upon our president to say...

991
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
What does he mean, the
situation has been resolved?

992
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,100
He just ended the war.

993
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,600
He ended the war?

994
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Why did he have to do that?

995
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,300
I think the CIA has
just cut a better deal.

996
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,500
He ended the war?

997
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,100
He can't end the war.

998
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,000
He's not producing this.

999
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,400
This is in bad taste.

1000
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,800
Can we stop this?

1001
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,300
Stop. It's over.

1002
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,700
Can we stop this? Can we stop this?

1003
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Stop the choir.

1004
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,400
It has been quite a week, Richard.

1005
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,700
I can't remember when any
president of United States...

1006
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,500
...was hit with the flu, a war...

1007
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,200
...and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...

1008
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,600
...all in the same seven-day period.

1009
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,200
This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.

1010
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,900
We've just received information
from sources at the CIA...

1011
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,800
...that confirms the
cessation of hostilities...

1012
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,600
The CIA.

1013
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,400
I thought they let us out too easily.

1014
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,300
The war's over.

1015
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,400
It's over. I saw it on television.

1016
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,800
I have to sell my house.

1017
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
The war is not over.

1018
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,200
No. The war is not over. I saw it on TV.

1019
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,000
That's what you hired me for.

1020
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,500
The war isn't over until
I say it's over. Ok?

1021
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,900
This is my picture. This
is not the CIA's picture.

1022
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,900
You think you're in a tight spot now.

1023
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,800
All right, Conrad. Try making The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

1024
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,800
- Tell it to him, King.
- Three of the horsemen died.

1025
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,600
Hear what he's saying? Three
of the horsemen died...

1026
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,900
...two weeks before the end
of principal photography.

1027
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,200
This is nothing. This is nothing.

1028
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,000
This is just Act One, "The War."

1029
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,400
Now, we really do need
an Act Two, so we work.

1030
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,900
Act Two.

1031
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,200
- You know what it's like?
- What?

1032
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,200
The Japanese. In the caves.

1033
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,000
- Go on.
- Okinawa.

1034
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,000
They didn't believe the war was over.

1035
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,100
That's right. So, now we have
a guy who doesn't believe...

1036
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,300
No, no. We have an American serviceman.

1037
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,400
A brave American
serviceman is left behind.

1038
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,400
A hero.

1039
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,700
Oh, my God. I can't believe
it. What was I thinking?

1040
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,500
We had a war. We forgot the hero.

1041
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,200
You can't have a war
and not have a hero.

1042
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,900
It's like we sent a Christmas card...

1043
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,100
...and left out the...
What do you call it?

1044
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,400
- Fruitcake.
- There you go.

1045
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,600
All right. Let's work. Ok?

1046
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,800
We got a guy who's left behind, so...

1047
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,400
This is terrific. This
is lucky this happened.

1048
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,500
He was left behind,
who just discarded...

1049
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,600
...like an old shoe.

1050
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,100
That's good. That's good.

1051
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
What's good? What did I say?

1052
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,100
- Shoe.
- Old shoe?

1053
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
It's just instinct.

1054
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,300
I want you to give me the Pentagon...

1055
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,000
...a list of people in all
military special programs.

1056
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,200
"Left behind like an
old shoe." That is good.

1057
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,200
I want to talk to Johnny.

1058
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,300
Yeah... What is it?

1059
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,100
The war is over. Ok?

1060
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,500
Now, we're going to need a new song.

1061
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,800
I think, it should be a song
about a shoe, a shiny shoe...

1062
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,800
...a black patent shoe...

1063
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,700
...a good old shoe.

1064
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,400
I was just on my way to get drunk.

1065
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,500
Yes, you get drunk, John. But I need
a new song, ok? A good old shoe song.

1066
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,300
It should be a ballad of loss and...

1067
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,100
- You wanna to help me?
- Redemption.

1068
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,700
Loss and redemption is very very good.

1069
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Shit. What key do you want it in?

1070
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,500
I don't know keys.

1071
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,600
I got a lot of people here are
depressed because the war just ended.

1072
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,600
Please give me a new song.

1073
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,500
All right. I got him on the phone.

1074
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,900
- King? - Yeah.
- Pentagon.

1075
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,200
Take it.

1076
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,900
I need a list of military
special programs.

1077
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,300
Bottom of the ninth. All right?

1078
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,200
They don't know who
they're playing with.

1079
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,700
They don't shut down our picture.

1080
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,400
You people gonna be long?

1081
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Otherwise, I'll put away the equipment.

1082
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

1083
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,600
I think I'm supposed
to be writing a song.

1084
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,900
Writing a song? What kind of song?

1085
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Is there anybody there named Schumann?

1086
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,400
- Schuster?
- Schumacher.

1087
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,800
I got a great idea.

1088
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Johnny, I got an idea.
Old shoe, new shoe. OK?

1089
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,700
Daddy had a hound dog...

1090
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,600
...used to call him Blue.

1091
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,700
Follow me 'round...

1092
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,700
...stick to me like glue.

1093
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,400
His favorite thing to play with...

1094
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,800
...used to be a good ol' shoe.

1095
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,600
Wait a minute. Used to be.

1096
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,500
See, you hit that 16-16.

1097
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,600
Well, I wish I had a woman...

1098
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,200
...who was half as good and true.

1099
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,300
Anybody here know Morse code?

1100
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,600
What you gonna do Morse code?

1101
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,100
Give me the fax.

1102
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,200
Sergeant William Schumann, U.S. Army...

1103
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,300
...serial number 2131284262.

1104
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,900
Good ol' shoe.

1105
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,400
Here's the deal.

1106
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,500
Good Ol' Shoe. Good Ol' Shoe.

1107
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,400
Whatever you walk in...

1108
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,400
...he will get you through.

1109
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,900
He's in a sweater...

1110
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,600
...and he's...

1111
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,700
We drop him behind enemy lines.

1112
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,300
He's trapped.

1113
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,800
The sweater.

1114
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,900
- In the sweater.
- Good.

1115
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,600
Is there a way we can make
it sound old and scratchy...

1116
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,500
...with, like, a hiss?

1117
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,000
With an old label.

1118
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,600
I see where you're going with this.

1119
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,300
Stand up straight and tall...

1120
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,600
...the way he taught you to.

1121
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,700
I'll write a speech.

1122
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
I'll help you with the speech.

1123
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,800
The president reveals
that William Schumann...

1124
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,200
...was trapped behind enemy lines.

1125
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
This is good.

1126
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
Heartfelt.

1127
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,800
- Touching.
- Touching.

1128
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,200
People will weep.

1129
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,100
Soul of a good ol' shoe.

1130
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,800
He might even get to heaven...

1131
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,600
...on the soul of his good ol' shoe.

1132
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,400
All right, here's the
speech. President's speech.

1133
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,400
Put this in the Library
of Congress right away.

1134
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,000
Folk music section, 1930.

1135
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,900
Right away, please.

1136
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,400
Get it in the Library of Congress now.

1137
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,600
Oh, God.

1138
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Who's seeing the guy
from the CBS tonight?

1139
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,300
Tonight, you remember some song
from the folk song days...

1140
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,700
...something about a good old shoe.

1141
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,100
Tonight?

1142
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,800
You're with him watching
the president's speech...

1143
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,200
What if he's busy tonight?

1144
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,900
- Lure him.
- What are you saying?

1145
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
What I am saying is I don't have
to be your confessor, darling.

1146
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,100
Tell him you've got some info on
the president's sex scandal...

1147
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,100
...it's on your conscience.

1148
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,700
Believe me. He'll drop
whatever he's doing.

1149
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Folks, folks, this is a shitty business.

1150
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,900
It needs no ghost comes from
the grave to tell us that...

1151
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
...but, Lord willing,
eight days from now...

1152
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,100
...I'm gonna be taking
you into the second term.

1153
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,600
Wait till you hear the speech tonight.

1154
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,500
The 303 speech. Great.

1155
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,400
Where's that Fad King by the way?

1156
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,400
I'll get him.

1157
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,900
Could we go now please people?

1158
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,300
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

1159
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,000
Conrad, how are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

1160
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,600
They're working on him,
they're finding him.

1161
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,200
Good. It's working.

1162
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,700
It's all happening people.
It's taking place around us.

1163
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,500
People, it is in the works.
It is being addressed.

1164
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,900
We are being proactive.

1165
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
We are going out tonight with
what may be the finest example...

1166
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,800
Get me an update on
the army, the Pentagon.

1167
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,400
Get this guy Schumann. Put him on hold.

1168
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,900
Have him standing by.

1169
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,000
People I gotta tell you, I
see a lot of glum faces now.

1170
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,800
Please don't be disconsolate.

1171
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,000
This is politics at its finest.

1172
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,300
This is where the rubber meets the road.

1173
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,200
Now I'm gonna tell that we've
got a leader going out tonight...

1174
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,000
...to 95 million American homes.

1175
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,800
He's gonna turn this thing around.

1176
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,500
You think this is tough?

1177
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,300
I was 4 months into production
on The Song of Solomon...

1178
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,000
...found out I didn't have the rights.

1179
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,700
Turn it up. It's our spot.

1180
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,000
Tough? This is nothing.

1181
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,100
Will you look at that shit?

1182
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,000
'Cause you don't change
horses in midstream.

1183
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,600
Don't change horses.

1184
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,000
This speech is good.

1185
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,800
I mean, we're kinda locked
into it, Mr. President.

1186
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
For the future of our families...

1187
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,700
The music. Where did they get that?

1188
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,500
- Pain in the ass.
- What? What? What?

1189
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,300
- He won't do it.
- What do you mean he won't do it?
- He won't do the speech.

1190
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,600
- What do you mean he won't do it?
- He won't do the speech.

1191
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,300
What do you mean? What
choice does he have?

1192
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,800
What do you mean he won't do the
speech? He won't do our speech?

1193
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,100
He says it's corny.

1194
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,600
It's what? It's corny? Corny?

1195
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,100
Of course it's corny.

1196
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,300
We wouldn't have him say
it if it wasn't corny.

1197
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,900
It's not a question.

1198
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,700
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

1199
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,300
Don't tell me it's corny.

1200
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,300
We're locked into the speech, right?

1201
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,600
We're locked in.

1202
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,600
We are playing way past this.

1203
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,600
We are past this. OK.

1204
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,700
Corny.

1205
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,400
This is what I need.

1206
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,900
I want you to get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

1207
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,000
Would you do that? You just
tell him I'm coming up.

1208
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,000
I need to see the president
and five minutes of this time.

1209
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,000
Speech is corny. Know
what this reminds me of?

1210
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,000
Years ago, when I first
went out to Hollywood...

1211
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,300
...they said to me,
"It's too theatrical."

1212
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,100
You know I was from the theater. So, everything
was over their heads. It's too theatrical.

1213
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,900
Not theatrical. He
thinks it's too corny.

1214
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,500
Don't tell me the speech is corny.

1215
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,100
Just tell him I'm comin'
up. I'm coming up.

1216
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,000
My fellow Americans, I
thank a merciful God...

1217
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,800
...and I am sure each
and every one of us...

1218
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
...will thank that Supreme Power...

1219
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
...whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1220
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,000
...that peace is at hand.

1221
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,300
The threat of nuclear
terrorism has been quelled.

1222
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Mr. President, I'm using a
little more projection...

1223
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,900
...because I think this speech
needs a little bit a "umph".

1224
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Bear with me.

1225
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,000
Thank you so much.

1226
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,600
That was so moving.

1227
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,100
Thank you so much.

1228
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,900
Thank you.

1229
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,800
You konow, Connie? I felt
very much at home in there.

1230
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,400
Simple quirk of fate.

1231
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,100
I could have gone this way.

1232
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,100
It's all a change in wardrobe.

1233
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,100
So, what do you think? Was it too much?

1234
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,200
I'll tell you, Stanley.

1235
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,400
- You did it.
- Yeah.

1236
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,800
You did it. You jumped in there...

1237
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,700
...and saved the thing when
the thing needed saving.

1238
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,800
You don't think it was too much?

1239
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,700
Personally?

1240
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,900
Maybe it was.

1241
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,100
Of course the president doesn't
have to say it that way, Connie.

1242
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,100
It's like Plato once said.

1243
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,600
It doesn't matter how the fuck you
get there as long as you get there.

1244
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,100
He said that?

1245
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,400
Connie, what is it exactly
you do for the president?

1246
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,500
My fellow Americans, I
thank a merciful God...

1247
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,400
...and I'm sure all of us will
thank that Supreme Power...

1248
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,100
...whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1249
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,000
...that peace is at hand.

1250
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,700
The threat of nuclear
terrorism has been quelled.

1251
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,800
We are in contact with
the Albanian premier...

1252
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,300
...who assures me and...

1253
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,600
...this government
credits his assurances...

1254
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,200
...that his country
does not wish us ill.

1255
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,500
Know any Latin?

1256
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,000
I, Claudius. That's what I know.

1257
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,500
I need a Latin motto for the patch.

1258
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,200
The 303 patch.

1259
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,900
...by a designation number, 303.

1260
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,100
A member of the group was left
behind, what were then, enemy lines.

1261
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,800
And I can only say to those
family members of Group 303...

1262
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,200
...whose members are,
I know as I speak...

1263
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,700
...gathering to comfort you.

1264
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,500
To the parents of the missing man...

1265
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,900
...I can only say no
effort will be spared...

1266
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,500
...to find this brave
man and bring him home.

1267
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,100
We've just received this photograph
of Schumann in captivity...

1268
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,400
...held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.

1269
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,500
Now, I don't know how many of you
are familiar with Morse code...

1270
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,700
...but could you bring the
camera closer and here, please?

1271
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,500
You'll see his sweater is worn.

1272
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,100
It has been unraveled in places.

1273
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,700
And those places form dashes and dots...

1274
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,500
...and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.

1275
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,200
That message is, "Courage, Mom."

1276
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,900
"Courage, Mom."

1277
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,500
He got the message
through. "Courage, Mom."

1278
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,300
Not bad for government work.

1279
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,100
Having a good time?

1280
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,300
Haven't had this much fun since live TV.

1281
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,000
To the men and women of Unit 303...

1282
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,400
...to my fellow citizens,
I say, "Courage, Mom."

1283
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,400
I have informed the Albanian
government that we will not rest...

1284
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,400
...until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.

1285
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm told his unit mates gave
him the nickname "Old Shoe."

1286
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,700
Wasn't there a folk
song called "Old Shoe?"

1287
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,700
Do you remember that? Something like...

1288
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,900
I don't know. I can vaguely remember it.

1289
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,400
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1290
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,400
"Old Shoe."

1291
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,100
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1292
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
Good night and God bless.

1293
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,800
Trump that, Senator Neal, you
Howdy-Doody-looking vontz.

1294
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,500
As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...

1295
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,400
...remains missing behind enemy lines...

1296
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,000
It's all thinking ahead.

1297
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,600
That's what producing is.

1298
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,600
- It's like being a plumber.
- Yes. It's like being a plumber.

1299
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,200
Do your job right, nobody should notice.

1300
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,200
When you fuck up, everything
gets full of shit.

1301
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,200
...symbol of the military team...

1302
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,900
...Sergeant William
Schumann, the "Old Shoe."

1303
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,700
What do you say, we line up the
president for the Peace Prize?

1304
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,600
Our job ends on election day.

1305
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,900
Yes. But, come on.

1306
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,600
Just for the symmetry of the thing?

1307
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,600
That's right.

1308
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,500
If Kissinger can win the Peace Prize...

1309
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,900
...I wouldn't be surprised to wake up
and find out I'd won the Preakness.

1310
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,600
Well, yes, but our guy did bring peace.

1311
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,100
Yeah, but there wasn't a war.

1312
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,500
All the greater accomplishment.

1313
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Where's the money...

1314
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,300
Where's the tie-in with
throwing away the old shoes?

1315
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,900
Who steps up and pays you for that?

1316
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,200
You throw away the shoes.
What are you gonna do?

1317
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,600
Buy new ones.

1318
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,900
We have some powerful new friends...

1319
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,900
...at the International
Association of Shoe Manufacturers.

1320
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,600
See. You guys sure get around.

1321
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
Fad King is my hero. Want to go first?

1322
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,200
Sure.

1323
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,500
History, Connie.

1324
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,700
Those are ratty shoes.

1325
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,700
Yeah, that's why we're
flinging them away.

1326
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,100
You want to try some? Go ahead.

1327
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,200
Here. Do it again.

1328
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,000
Go ahead. Have a ball.

1329
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,700
Ok. Watch this.

1330
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,800
Go on, tell your friends.

1331
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,000
Well. This is interesting.

1332
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,200
I have just been handed this.
Something just discovered.

1333
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,600
A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...

1334
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,300
...of the Library of Congress...

1335
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,500
...and a fitting song, if
I may say so, about Shoe.

1336
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,400
You know Schumann is
the military soldier...

1337
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,600
...who's been left behind enemy lines...

1338
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,800
Jim, can I get a word with you, please?

1339
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,500
Would you like to comment
the situation on Albania?

1340
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,000
Yes, there is one thing I'd like to say.

1341
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,900
This is to the Albanians that
have this man in custody.

1342
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:50,300
I mean this from the bottom of
my heart as one of your race.

1343
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I didn't know Jim Belushi was Albanian.

1344
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,000
The search for Willie
Schumann continues...

1345
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,300
Tell Grace, as soon as we
land, I want a reflexologist.

1346
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,300
Male or female?

1347
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,000
- The Polish...
- The White House wants to know about...

1348
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,300
...the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1349
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,900
- What about it?
- For Schumann.

1350
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,500
Wait a minute, wait.
We got 86% in favor.

1351
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,800
We bring him back tomorrow,
charts go up, they don't go down.

1352
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,600
I don't want to tell them
how to do their business...

1353
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,400
...but why don't they do
it after the election?

1354
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,300
Makes more sense, and
it'll help them more.

1355
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,300
When are you bringing
him back? Schumann?

1356
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,300
King, show him the thing.

1357
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,100
- It's not done yet. I don't wanna show him.
- Show it to him.

1358
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,900
Talk about enlarging the
market. Tell him, Faye.

1359
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,500
Here it is. Artist's
rendering of the memorial.

1360
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,800
The memorial?

1361
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,400
That's the memorial of the fallen.

1362
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,100
Of the Albanian campaign.

1363
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,900
- Lovely.
- It's better than lovely.

1364
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,100
This guy made a deal
with Governor Kneehigh...

1365
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,700
- Senator Leahy.
- Right.

1366
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,200
Connie, you have to see how much
granite you have to put in this thing.

1367
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,100
We got a site picked out and everything.

1368
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
And, the beauty part is...

1369
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,100
...guess who retains the
merchandising rights.

1370
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,900
- Show him the clock?
- Show him.

1371
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,800
Got it as a clock.

1372
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,500
Lovely.

1373
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
- We gotta get going.
- When's Schumann coming back?

1374
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,500
Getting him right now.

1375
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,300
- I need his neck size.
- You gotta get his neck size.

1376
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,600
I think it may be about 171/2.

1377
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,400
You know, 171/2, thinking
is not good enough.

1378
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,500
I'm an artist, not a factory worker.

1379
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,900
What did he eat behind enemy
lines when he's trapped?

1380
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,500
Birds, snakes.

1381
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,300
Bullshit. He ate tiny
cheeseburgers in tin foil.

1382
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,800
Pull a string, they heat themselves, ok?

1383
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,700
We call Burger King, Johnny Rockets.

1384
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,200
We get the Shoe Burger with
cheese and 303 sauce...

1385
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,600
"Behind enemy lines or anytime."

1386
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,000
- Good.
- Good? That's good.

1387
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,800
That's the slogan.

1388
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,500
And I got the copyright on
the Albanian kitten thing.

1389
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,600
I'm gonna call Nike, get Rodman
to dye his hair leopard skin.

1390
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,500
We'll have a sneaker... "Air Leopard."

1391
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,400
...a high school basketball
game last night...

1392
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,800
...between Montgomery
Bell and Blair Park.

1393
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,300
Students, during the game...

1394
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,900
...in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...

1395
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,300
...threw their tennis shoes on
the court by the hundreds...

1396
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,000
...just for the Old Shoe.

1397
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,600
Bring him back. William
Schumann, soldier...

1398
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,500
There's no business like it.

1399
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,200
Demonstrations are springing
up all over the country...

1400
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,300
...as American people continue
to show their patriotism.

1401
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,300
You ought to get them to run
that inaugural speech by me.

1402
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
Inaugural speech? I don't know.

1403
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,300
The White House staff gonna be
jealous by given up that one.

1404
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,900
Come on, Connie. Let me
close out the thing in style.

1405
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,100
I've come to feel it's my thing.

1406
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,900
You take a job, you take a job, and
many times, it's just a job, you know.

1407
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,600
And then... You know what I mean?

1408
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,000
Hell of a ride, Stanley. Hell of a ride.

1409
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,500
Isn't it? Isn't it?

1410
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,300
You know, you take the
bitter with the sweet...

1411
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,900
...or the sweet with the bitter.

1412
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,700
What's that expression?

1413
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,200
...feeling good about the economy.

1414
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,900
That's why we're voting
for the president, Ed.

1415
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,600
What do you think?

1416
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,500
Well, Bob, my mind wasn't
100% made up, but now it is.

1417
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:19,000
I say, don't go changing
horses in midstream.

1418
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,800
Absolutely.

1419
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,400
Who needs surprises these days?

1420
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,400
For an economy you can rely on...

1421
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,400
Fucking amateurs.

1422
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,300
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it all back home.

1423
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,000
Knock wood.

1424
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,300
And who's gonna know?

1425
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,600
Who's gonna know what we did?

1426
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,200
Pride of a job well done, Stan.

1427
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:46,000
It's the pride of a job well
done, but it's more that, Stanley.

1428
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,800
It's the gratitude of your
party and your president, right?

1429
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,500
- Is that the thing?
- Indeed it is. Indeed it is.

1430
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,000
Dean City, Oklahoma.
Army special programs.

1431
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,500
Tell 'em to bring Schumann to the plane.

1432
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,000
We'll bring him back and
stash him in the hospital.

1433
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,100
Call the plane. Tell me
where to pick him up.

1434
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,300
I bet you're good at chess.

1435
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,600
I would be, I could remember
how all the pieces move.

1436
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,100
Ok. So, we'll call you. Ok.

1437
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,900
/I'll do the same in His great name...

1438
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,000
/...if you have courage, Mom.

1439
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,400
/I can always feel your love.

1440
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,500
/Send, and I'll receive.

1441
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,000
Units of 303, the Defense Department...

1442
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,300
...confirmed early this
morning, Albanian time...

1443
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,900
...stormed the mountain
hideaway near the city of...

1444
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,300
...freeing a tired but
happy William Schumann.

1445
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,400
A high White House source confirms...

1446
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,200
...that he's expected in
Washington tomorrow morning.

1447
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,000
How's that?

1448
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,500
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1449
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,800
So, when we touch down tomorrow...

1450
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,700
...Big Bird's gonna meet
Schumann at the airport?

1451
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,400
Big mistake. Big mistake. You
got to bring him in by stages.

1452
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,700
Big mistake to reveal
Schumann before the election.

1453
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,000
How so?

1454
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,800
Sweetheart, Schumann is the shark. Ok?

1455
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,300
Schumann is Jaws.

1456
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,700
You know, you have to tease
'em. You gotta tease 'em.

1457
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,000
You don't put Jaws in the
first reel of the movie.

1458
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,100
It's the contract, sweetheart.

1459
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,900
The contract with the election,
whether they know it or not...

1460
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,900
...is vote for me Tuesday...

1461
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,200
...Wednesday, I will produce Schumann.

1462
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,500
That's what they're paying
their seven bucks for.

1463
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,500
Know what I mean?

1464
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,800
Whatever.

1465
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,300
Everybody's gotta learn.

1466
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,400
Any business.

1467
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,100
You take the fruit of 40 years...

1468
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,400
...hard lessons, mistakes,
and you call it wisdom.

1469
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,800
That's the truth.

1470
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,400
End of the day, just when
you know something...

1471
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,100
...time to go home.

1472
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,200
Stanley, you got decades in you now.

1473
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,200
You got decades left in you.

1474
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,200
Yeah, but...

1475
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,500
What could I do to top this?

1476
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,800
/The 37th Psalm.

1477
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,100
/I'll do the same in His great name...

1478
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,000
/...if you have courage, Mom.

1479
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,800
You see her? That was real tears.

1480
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,300
We were gonna give her those drops.

1481
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,400
- She cried.
- Really?

1482
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,900
- She cried real.
- It looks it.

1483
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,300
/Pray for me...

1484
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,700
/...and the USA.

1485
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,000
/Pray they never use the bomb.

1486
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,000
What are you going to do after this?

1487
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,900
They owe you big,
Stan. They owe you big.

1488
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,200
Ambassador to this or that, whatever.

1489
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Ambassador to what?

1490
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't even like to go to Brentwood.

1491
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,000
That's what I want.

1492
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,400
That's it. That's my reward.

1493
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,600
That's the payoff.

1494
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,300
You want to go to the Inaugural?

1495
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,000
Might if I was asked.

1496
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,500
You know, Connie? This
here, Schumann and us...

1497
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,200
Look at that. King
Kong and the trainers.

1498
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,100
This is it.

1499
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,100
I'm standing here for this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.

1500
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,800
He's become known to Americans simply
as the Old Shoe. He is a war hero...

1501
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,600
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

1502
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,000
Giving them what they want.

1503
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,500
...from his Group 303 and left
behind in enemy territory.

1504
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,700
- Here at Andrews Air Force Base...
- Here it comes.

1505
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:45,600
...they prepare for the
return of Willie Schumann.

1506
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,300
Sergeant Schumann, if I
may, welcome to history.

1507
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,300
Sergeant Schumann, I'm Ames. Welcome.

1508
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,000
Somebody named Brean?

1509
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,500
Yeah. Right here.

1510
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,700
Sign here for me, please, sir.

1511
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,700
Captain, you want to
take her up, please?

1512
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,300
There's heavy weather back east.

1513
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,300
What do you think?

1514
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,700
6 to 5 and pick 'em.
You want to chance it?

1515
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,400
If it'll fly, let's fly.
People are waiting for.

1516
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,000
A child at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

1517
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,800
...runs to Old Shoe, rubs
meat on Schumann's cuff.

1518
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,100
A little dog runs to it.
The dog loves Schumann.

1519
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,600
He is a perfect war hero.

1520
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,100
Perfect.

1521
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,900
You cast him.

1522
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,600
All right. Book it up.

1523
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,300
What's this?

1524
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,900
Keys to the manacles.

1525
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
Oh, my God.

1526
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,900
Wait. Wait. What do you...
Wait. Just wait. Wait. Wait.

1527
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,800
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1528
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,400
What is the trouble?

1529
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,800
No trouble at all, ma'am.

1530
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,700
Then why is he in chains?

1531
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,900
He's in chains because he's a convict.

1532
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,800
A convict?

1533
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,900
How you doing?

1534
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,100
Take a look.

1535
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,900
All right, well. When we
asked for special programs...

1536
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,900
...they gave us special prisons.

1537
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,900
Only a one-word difference.

1538
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,800
- Has he been in jail long?
- 12 years.

1539
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,200
Does he have much longer to serve?

1540
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,700
What did he do?

1541
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,300
- He raped a nun.
- Oh, God. Oh. God. Je... Oh, God.

1542
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,700
- And...
- I don't want to know an "and."

1543
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,000
Why is there an "and"?

1544
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Look, look, look. He's fine as
long as he gets his medications.

1545
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,000
And if he doesn't get his medications?

1546
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,100
He's not fine.

1547
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,500
Yeah, Captain. Yeah, Captain.

1548
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,300
You'd better get us to Washington.

1549
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,100
How are ya?

1550
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,600
Fine.

1551
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,000
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

1552
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,100
'Cause, you know, tomorrow
they're having beans.

1553
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,500
I need a real readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

1554
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,600
Beans!

1555
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,000
William. Yes. We're
trying to do this thing.

1556
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,500
- As long as you get me back for the beans.
- For the beans, yes.

1557
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,500
He's a lot sicker than we thought.

1558
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,100
Rush him under wraps to Walter
Reed for serious tests.

1559
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,500
If you're gonna keep me out, I can
like the chance to go to church.

1560
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,200
You know what I mean?

1561
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,100
Are you very religious?

1562
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,000
What have you done to me?

1563
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,100
What have you done to me?

1564
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,900
All combat takes place
at night in the rain...

1565
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
...at the junction of four map segments.

1566
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,900
What are you going to do?

1567
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,900
He's fine as long as he
gets his medication.

1568
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,800
Well, speaking of that, we're
gonna need lots of this stuffs.

1569
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,900
Why don't you get on
the phone and get it?

1570
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,600
I think, you people are
looking at this all wrong.

1571
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,500
If you look at the back story...

1572
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
...the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

1573
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,700
...of course he's going
to be a little fucked up.

1574
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,600
Of course he's gonna need a little help.

1575
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,800
Anybody want a beer?
'Cause I could party.

1576
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,900
I'm gonna need an ambulance.

1577
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,600
We take him the last
moment from the plane.

1578
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,400
No, no, no. We land, take him from the
plane. We put him in the ambulance.

1579
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,700
Air Force jet lands, we take
somebody else from that jet.

1580
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,900
What the fuck do I care?

1581
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,600
Somebody in a hospital gown.

1582
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,300
You get me back for the beans.

1583
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,700
You know, 'cause tomorrow's the beans.

1584
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,400
'Cause this dog ain't gonna hunt.

1585
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,700
Oh, no. He's gonna be fine.

1586
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,200
Aren't you, William?

1587
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,000
Speaking of which, I have a prescription
and I wanna give you the number.

1588
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,000
I want you standing by
with a lot of this stuff.

1589
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,700
A crate of it. It's...

1590
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,300
Anti-psychotic.

1591
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,900
Anti-psychotic. The number
is V... Hello? Hello?

1592
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,400
This is nothing.

1593
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,300
The old days, I used to
think I was a pharmacist...

1594
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,800
...the stuff I had carrying around.

1595
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:23,600
With the beans, you can tell if
they're puttin' stuff in it.

1596
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,300
So you don't have to fear it.

1597
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,700
What kind of stuff?

1598
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,700
Yeah. Hello? Hello? Are you around?

1599
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,600
What do you mean, what kind of stuff?

1600
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,900
- No. What kind of stuff?
- What do you mean?

1601
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,300
He just wanted to know what
you meant. He didn't mean.

1602
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,900
Did you mean?

1603
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
- I didn't mean. No. Not at all.
- He didn't mean.

1604
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,600
- He didn't mean anything.
- You meant something. What do you mean?

1605
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,900
No, no, no. He didn't mean anything.

1606
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,400
Give him another pill.

1607
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,400
What the fuck do you
mean, what kind of stuff?

1608
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,800
Pill, William.

1609
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,900
This is nothing. Did
you ever shoot in Italy?

1610
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,200
Try three Italian starlets
swacked-out on Benzedrine and grappa.

1611
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,300
This is nothing.

1612
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,500
This is a walk in the park.

1613
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,200
Who are you?

1614
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,600
Who are you sons of bitches?

1615
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,100
- Killers!
- Just calm down.

1616
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,300
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?

1617
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,300
Oh, my God!

1618
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,200
Sergeant Willie Schumann is coming home.

1619
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,500
Schumann's plane should be
somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean...

1620
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,400
...making its final descent
back into this country.

1621
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,700
The White House reported...

1622
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,000
...he was safely rescued and on
his way back to American soil.

1623
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,300
We're still waiting for
his plane to land...

1624
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,100
...at Andrews Air Force Base.

1625
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,000
A plane that is due to
land. Long overdue.

1626
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,300
The president is monitoring
the situation personally...

1627
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,500
...and closely.

1628
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,900
We will keep you updated
as to any developments.

1629
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,700
Thank you very much.

1630
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,800
Oh, God. What do we do now?

1631
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,100
What do we do now, boy producer?

1632
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,800
Mister win-an-Emmy,
social-conscience, whale-shit...

1633
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,300
...save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

1634
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
...fuckin'- hire-a-convict shithead?

1635
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,900
What do we do now, liberal,
affirmative action, shithead...

1636
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,300
...peacenik commie fuck?
What do you wanna do now?

1637
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,200
This is nothing. Piece of cake.

1638
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,000
Producing is being a samurai warrior.

1639
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,800
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

1640
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,400
...so that one day, when called upon...

1641
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,400
...you can respond, your
training at its peak...

1642
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,100
...and save the day!

1643
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,800
Produce this Schumann.

1644
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,400
Produce him, I say...

1645
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,900
...or, and I don't
hesitate to say this...

1646
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,300
...rank him as just another in
a series of broken promises.

1647
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,200
This tardy absence of the
flight must give us pause...

1648
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,700
...and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves...

1649
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,300
Fuck you.

1650
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
Leave it alone. What did
television do to you?

1651
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,200
It destroyed the electoral process.

1652
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,200
Ok. Enough lovemaking.
Let's go. Come on.

1653
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,500
- Where?
- We got work to do, Winifred.

1654
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,000
Come on, pal.

1655
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,800
Is it time for exercise?

1656
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,100
'Cause, you know. It's
my day in the yard.

1657
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,400
Let's get him out to the highway.

1658
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,700
You think this is tough? Come on, pal!

1659
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,000
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

1660
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,800
Albanian dissidents...

1661
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:18,000
...having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missile...

1662
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,200
Connie, you had your fortune right here.

1663
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,200
You were ready to throw it away.

1664
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,500
Listen. If you got a problem,
solve it. That's producing.

1665
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,700
Someday when they tell this story...

1666
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,200
You can't tell this story.

1667
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,900
- Why not?
- Somebody would have you killed.

1668
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,200
Of course, I know.

1669
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,000
Not now. Not now. But I mean,
when they do tell the story...

1670
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,600
Nobody can tell this
story Stanley, ever.

1671
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,600
Listen to me. This is
what I do for a living.

1672
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,000
You can't tell this story.
He's not kidding with you.

1673
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
You can't tell this
story. You knew that.

1674
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,500
The deal was you get an ambassadorship.

1675
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,700
I used to have a Camaro.

1676
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,300
What the fuck kind of story are you going
to tell anyway? The guy's a nut case.

1677
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,500
You would be too if you went
through what he went through.

1678
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,100
He raped a nun.

1679
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,500
What he went through in Albania.

1680
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,700
He's doped to the gills.

1681
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,300
Where's my little pills?

1682
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,300
Show some compassion.

1683
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,800
He spent the last 12 years
in a military prison.

1684
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,000
How are we gonna explain that?

1685
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,100
How we gonna explain it? Am I worried?

1686
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,300
How do we explain that when
the world is watching?

1687
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,700
Fuck the world. Try a 10
a.m. pitch meeting...

1688
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,200
...coked to the gills, no sleeping,
haven't even read the treatment.

1689
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,700
Connie, how we gonna explain
in fact he was in prison?

1690
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,900
How you gonna explain that?
Well, you see, Winifred...

1691
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,600
...this is where you've
never been at a pitch.

1692
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,500
His records say he was in prison...

1693
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,700
...as all the record say for all
the men and women of Group 303...

1694
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,400
...as they must because
of the secrecy involved.

1695
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,800
I'm on top of it.

1696
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,800
Not sure whether enemy action...

1697
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,700
I'm fine. I'm fine. I got it.

1698
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,900
Stanley, I told you, I
do this for a living.

1699
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,100
You do what for a living?

1700
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,900
Exactly what do you
do for the president?

1701
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,200
I lost my wallet. You got any change?

1702
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,000
How we doing, boy?

1703
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,500
Ready to mix it up?

1704
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,400
Is today laundry day?

1705
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,400
- What do you do on laundry day?
- Laundry.

1706
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,000
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a pencil.

1707
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,600
Down safely.

1708
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,700
Produce this Schumann.

1709
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:31,100
Produce him, I say, or, and I
don't hesitate to say this...

1710
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,200
...rank him as just another in
a series of broken promises.

1711
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,900
Sustained minor injuries.

1712
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,200
Flight crew being investigated
for possible pilot error.

1713
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,600
Transshipped to an undisclosed location.

1714
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,400
This deserted runway should
be filled with well-wishers...

1715
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,500
How you doing? A cold drink?

1716
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,000
Schumann was to return to
American soil today...

1717
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,800
...after his safe rescue in Albania.

1718
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,200
He looks like me.

1719
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,000
William Schumann deserves an
explanation from the White House.

1720
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,800
Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.

1721
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,700
I have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...

1722
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,000
...involving Sergeant Schumann.

1723
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,600
He is down safely and he
will be transshipped.

1724
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,400
We are informed he has
sustained minor injuries...

1725
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,200
...which will require his
being medicated for some time...

1726
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,100
Bring in the cavalry. Nick of time.

1727
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,500
You see that? Political
shitbirds. Fuck with us, huh?

1728
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:28,800
They don't know who
they're playing with.

1729
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,800
Purty.

1730
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
I'm a little concerned
about the driver of the rig.

1731
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,900
- What rig?
- The harvester.

1732
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:45,300
- What about him?
- He doesn't have his green card. He doesn't have his green card.

1733
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,800
So what?

1734
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,300
So, you want Schumann to be
rescued by an illegal alien?

1735
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,200
We can't have Schumann saved
by an illegal immigrant.

1736
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Get on the phone. Fly in a judge.

1737
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:01,000
Get on the phone. What's
all this moping about?

1738
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,500
Do you have any change?

1739
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,600
I like the night life, I like to boogie.

1740
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,400
Susie!

1741
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,900
William?

1742
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,500
Susie, are you all right?

1743
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,500
Susie, are you all right?

1744
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,200
Kickball.

1745
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,500
Susan, are you all right?

1746
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,600
Let me talk to him!

1747
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,800
Why did you drop...

1748
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,900
I think we should...

1749
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,600
Willie, where are you going?

1750
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,500
Shoester!

1751
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,400
Let me talk to him. Shoe, you in there?

1752
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,200
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

1753
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,200
I have a relationship.
Shoe, you want to talk?

1754
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,700
Get you anything you
want. You want some beans?

1755
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,300
Will that do it, Shoester?

1756
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,500
Come on, Shoe!

1757
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,700
Oh, God! He's dead.

1758
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1759
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,200
He's not dead. He's alive.

1760
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,300
Strike that.

1761
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,500
Oh, Jesus!

1762
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,700
So close and yet so far.

1763
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,900
What do you mean?

1764
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,400
We were this close.

1765
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,000
This is nothing. What
are you talking about?

1766
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,800
This is nothing. This just got big.

1767
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,900
Got big? Got big? He's dead. He's dead.

1768
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,600
We killed Old Shoe.

1769
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:47,500
And what is better than the
triumphal homecoming of a war hero?

1770
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,100
Ready!

1771
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,000
Lift!

1772
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,500
/We're gathered here...

1773
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,500
/...with a cross to bear.

1774
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,800
/The bravest men...

1775
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,500
/...anywhere.

1776
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,000
/That this great land...

1777
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,700
/...will remain free.

1778
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,500
/God bless the men...

1779
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,700
/...of the 303.

1780
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,500
/Side by side...

1781
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,500
/...we know no fear.

1782
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,500
/Our minds are sharp.

1783
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,500
/Our eyes are clear.

1784
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,500
/In the air, on land...

1785
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,400
/...or on the sea...

1786
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,700
/...we're the fightin' men...

1787
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,900
/...of the 303.

1788
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,500
/Give us this day...

1789
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,500
/...our daily bread...

1790
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,800
/...and leopard skin...

1791
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,500
/...for our head.

1792
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,200
/That we may fight...

1793
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,100
Coffee?

1794
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,400
Yes, please.

1795
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,600
Good. Good. Good. Looking good.

1796
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,900
Bring it all back home.

1797
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,500
Lassie barks twice, and it's
time to take out the garbage.

1798
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,200
Hell of a show, Stan.

1799
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,500
Hell of a job.

1800
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,200
It's just producing. That's what it is.

1801
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,300
You know, there's no
Academy Award for producing.

1802
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,900
- You're kidding.
- There's no Academy Award for producing.

1803
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,500
Where do movies come from if
nobody produces them, Connie?

1804
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,400
They come from people like you.

1805
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,200
Well, you know. You just got to
take the bitter with the better.

1806
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,200
Job's almost done.

1807
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,300
Knock on wood.

1808
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,700
We did a good job.

1809
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,500
That's our reward.

1810
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,300
You know, you can't save the world.

1811
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,200
All you can do is try.

1812
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,800
Ain't that the truth?

1813
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,400
And, as we said, the president...

1814
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,300
...thrust of the Albanian
episode to put him over the top.

1815
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,200
Yes. You could say that, Shirley,
but it's just simply just not true.

1816
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,300
What would be true, then?

1817
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,000
Well, you said it yourself
earlier, if I may rephrase...

1818
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
...that the success of the
president in the polls...

1819
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,900
- As of today, 89% favorable.
- 89% favorable...

1820
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,900
...is based not on the events,
which of course we cannot control...

1821
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,800
...but on the spin
given to those events.

1822
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:25,300
What's the lesson here, Connie?
Never give up. Never give up.

1823
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,800
You're right. You're right.

1824
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,900
The show must go on.

1825
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,100
Proud traditions.

1826
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,600
I am prouder of this than
anything I ever did in my life.

1827
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,000
You should be, Stan.

1828
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,100
I want to thank you, Connie.

1829
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,900
I want to thank you.

1830
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,100
- You gave me a good opportunity.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1831
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,300
And as we said, the president,
a surefire winner...

1832
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,900
...and the campaign, many
said, that put him there.

1833
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,600
Another great race today, Johnny.

1834
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,300
Who are you going to ride in the Stakes?

1835
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,100
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

1836
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,400
The message is irrelevant.

1837
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,400
The main element here
we have to deal with...

1838
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,300
...is the fact that fear is what's
driving a lot of people. Ok?

1839
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,100
Yes. Commercials. Commercials.
Commercials. Commercials.

1840
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,800
The president is a product.

1841
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,300
Yes, the president is a product.

1842
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,600
He's the President of the
United States of America. 89%.

1843
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,000
Which we're dealing with today.

1844
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,800
Commercials. Commercials.
Commercials. Commercials.

1845
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,700
It's time the American people
began to take a look at that.

1846
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,700
And, now we're going to
be taken your calls.

1847
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:30,100
- The number is 1-800-555-0199.
- Oh, shit.

1848
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,600
Stanley, what are you doing?

1849
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,100
What am I doing?

1850
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,100
I wanna call somebody up.

1851
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,700
Stan, that's very funny.

1852
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,300
I'm going to get these people straight.

1853
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,900
You can't do that, Stanley.

1854
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,700
Watch me.

1855
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,600
Stan, you knew the deal
when you signed on.

1856
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,500
Come on. Deals change.

1857
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,600
Sure it is.

1858
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:04,200
Let's rethink that ambassadorship.

1859
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,600
I'm talking London. I'm talking Paris.

1860
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,800
I'm talking a secret account
for your extra expenses...

1861
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,400
...getting laid whenever you want.

1862
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,100
Marine guards will
salute you all the time.

1863
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,700
No. It's tempting, but I got
to answer to a higher calling.

1864
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,400
- Art.
- Money?

1865
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,700
Money? You think I did this for money?

1866
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,500
I did this for credit. For credit.

1867
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,000
You always knew you
couldn't take the credit.

1868
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,500
That's one thing. But I'm
not going to stand here...

1869
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,100
...and let two dickheads
from film school take it.

1870
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,800
Stanley, listen to me.

1871
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,900
Are you nuts?

1872
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,400
- Stanley, no fooling.
- What?

1873
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,000
You're playing with your life now.

1874
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,500
Fuck my life. Fuck my life.

1875
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,500
I want the credit. The credit.

1876
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,000
Do you know what the New York
Times said about my last picture?

1877
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,900
They called it "a thrill
ride for the ages..."

1878
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,400
...but they didn't mention the producer.

1879
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
They talked about the costumes...

1880
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,400
...but never talked about the producer.

1881
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,500
You know what that picture grossed?

1882
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,700
Now I'm going to stand here...

1883
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,800
...and let some limp-dick
film-school pansy...

1884
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,200
...take the credit? What?

1885
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,800
You can't do it.

1886
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,600
Don't you tell me that!

1887
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,000
Don't you ever tell me that!

1888
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,800
I am the producer of this show!

1889
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,900
If I didn't step up, you're nowhere!

1890
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,100
I put this together
out of spit and polish!

1891
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,600
Look at that.

1892
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:09,200
That is a complete fucking fraud...

1893
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:13,200
...and it looks 100% real.

1894
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,600
It's the best work I've
ever done in my life...

1895
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,600
...because it's so honest.

1896
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,800
They told me I couldn't
remake Moby Dick...

1897
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,500
...from the point of view of the whale.

1898
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,200
$450 million domestic.

1899
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,800
I'm not even talking about the video.

1900
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,900
I made this lame turkey fly.

1901
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,100
I did it... Pure Hollywood.

1902
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,700
For once in my life, I
will not be pissed on.

1903
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,000
Do you hear me?

1904
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,500
I want the credit. I want the credit.

1905
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,600
I'm taking it. Good bye.

1906
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,000
Shit.

1907
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,700
He's coming down.

1908
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:19,300
Connie, could I see you
here a minute? Thanks.

1909
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,400
Do you swear to uphold...

1910
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,900
...the duties and responsibilities...

1911
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,500
...of a citizen of the
United States of America...

1912
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,600
...to defend her in time of peril...

1913
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:31,000
...to defend her from all
enemies, foreign and domestic?

1914
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,300
Do you make this pledge
with full resolve?

1915
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,800
/Common ground...

1916
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,100
/...and family.

1917
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:01,700
/Let's give thanks to the 303.

1918
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,900
/Years from now...

1919
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,900
/...when we are gone...

1920
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,900
/...our children's kids...

1921
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,300
/...will hear this song.

1922
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,900
/Think how strong...

1923
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,300
/...and proud they'll be.

1924
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,800
/Grandpa fought...

1925
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,000
/...for the 303.

1926
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,400
/God bless the men of the 303.

1927
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,500
/Ten-hut!

1928
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,400
Present arms!

1929
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,500
And turning to the Hollywood page...

1930
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,500
...famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...

1931
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,800
...died suddenly of a
massive heart attack...

1932
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,200
...while sunbathing poolside.

1933
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:05,700
Mr. Motss was 57 or 62-years-old...

1934
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,100
...depending on the bio.

1935
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,200
His credits include numerous films...

1936
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:16,000
...which America has come
to love as old classics.

1937
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,300
This just in.

1938
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,700
A group calling itself
"Albania Unite"...

1939
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,300
...has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...

1940
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,100
...of the village of Klos, Albania.

1941
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,900
The president was
unavailable for comment...

1942
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,800
...but General William Scott of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

1943
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,100
...says he has no doubt we'll
be sending planes and troops...

1944
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:38,500
...back in to finish the job.

1945
01:33:39,305 --> 01:34:39,386
