00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,834
Cameron Turner, my man.

4
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,628
Let me guess. Latte, oat milk, no sugar.

5
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,213
Spot on, sir.

6
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,841
I'll take an Echo bar
if you've got any.

7
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,552
{\an8}Echo's my middle name. Will that be all?

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,470
{\an8}That's good, thank you.

9
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,974
All right.
Payment taken. Order coming up.

10
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,563
Thank you, bro.

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,858
You're welcome, Cameron.
Okay, good talk. We'll see you tomorrow.

12
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,486
<i>Step down from the train.</i>

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,248
Look, I know my brother, all right?
He's very sensitive.

14
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Hello?

15
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,740
Hey. Yeah.

16
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,205
No. We're pulling into the station now.

17
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,499
<i>This station is Summit Park.</i>

18
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,793
I'll see you in a bit, okay? All right.

19
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,379
Bye.

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,340
It's all yours.

21
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,557
<i>The train is now arriving at Summit Park.</i>

22
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,322
<i>The next station is Stadium Avenue.</i>

23
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, my God.

24
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,293
Oh, fuck.

25
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,421
Oh, no.

26
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,718
Oh, shit.

27
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,846
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

28
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,690
Cameron.

29
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,018
<i>Hi, Cameron. Dr. Scott here.</i>

30
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,980
<i>Look, I don't wanna add
any more strain on you,</i>

31
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:17,317
<i>but with your latest scan
showing an accelerating deterioration,</i>

32
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,486
<i>it's vital that we keep moving forward
with--</i>

33
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,571
Mute.

34
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,270
Pig. You out here?

35
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,898
Good boy, now.

36
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,985
You guys save me some food?

37
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,656
Yeah? You didn't eat all my food today?

38
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,748
<i>Child prodigy or future serial killer?</i>

39
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,625
<i>Can't wait for parent-teacher night.</i>

40
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:11,093
Welcome to Arra House, Cameron.
Good to meet you in person.

41
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,179
Come in.

42
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,147
This is our main living area.

43
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,234
Wow.

44
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,085
I know that
some of these concepts are uncomfortable.

45
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,463
Just remember that
if you decide not to proceed

46
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:53,051
at any point in the evaluation process,
he never leaves this facility.

47
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,848
And there's--
there's no way he gets this thing?

48
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:04,104
As outlined, we modified
the relevant strands of his DNA

49
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,023
to prevent that happening again.

50
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,447
And what happens to him
if I decide not to do this? He just--

51
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,951
He goes to sleep that night unaware.
Doesn't know a thing.

52
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,377
We'll be calling him Jack for now,
if that name's okay with you.

53
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,533
This is the control room.

54
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,285
And this is Dalton.

55
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,746
-Welcome, Cameron.
-Hello.

56
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,708
He's a psychologist
and the head technician.

57
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,461
And that completes our team.

58
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,089
It's just three of you?

59
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,343
Three humans. Our AI systems
do the work of about 50 people.

60
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,558
Before we let you in,

61
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,187
we'll need you to disable the cameras
in your contacts and your watch.

62
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,106
Oh, okay.

63
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,278
Disable cameras.

64
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,114
Thank you.

65
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,618
So, shall we go in?

66
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,738
Molecularly regenerated.

67
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,074
Mapped to your DNA.

68
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,162
Cameron Turner to the molecule.

69
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,988
Is he dreaming?

70
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,491
Not yet.

71
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,965
Go ahead. He can't wake.

72
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,919
I'm sorry, Doctor.

73
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,593
I can't do this.

74
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,961
<i>I know
what a momentous decision this is for you.</i>

75
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,547
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

76
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,049
<i>But just…</i>

77
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,969
<i>the second you tell your wife
that you're dying,</i>

78
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,555
<i>your opportunity to do this is gone.</i>

79
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,183
<i>You can tell her,</i>

80
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,270
<i>or you can do this with us
and let life go on for your family.</i>

81
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,108
<i>But given your worsening condition,
we can't afford to delay, Cameron.</i>

82
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,028
<i>Please call me.</i>

83
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,372
A surf scoter.

84
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,290
Excellent. And this one?

85
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,626
Cory?

86
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,922
Hooded mergant.

87
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,845
No.

88
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,003
Can I have your pencils?

89
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,589
You eyeing my pencils now?

90
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,761
The same set I've had for 22 years.
You're eyeing my pencils?

91
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,054
You ain't using 'em.

92
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,265
"Ain't"? When did we start saying "ain't"?

93
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,351
You don't use 'em since Andre died.

94
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,948
<i>Cam, what's with you lately?</i>

95
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,285
<i>Look, I know you're an artist
and this is painful for you. I get it.</i>

96
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,079
<i>But this is a health-focused organic tea.</i>

97
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>It's not some fucking ayahuasca brew
we're designing.</i>

98
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,045
<i>When you follow along with what
the client wants, you kill it, you know?</i>

99
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,380
<i>So just play ball. Okay?</i>

100
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,382
-All right.
-<i>Love ya. Bye.</i>

101
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,352
You want one of these?

102
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,547
{\an8}-<i>Uncle Andre.</i>
-<i>Cory, can you say "Uncle Andre"?</i>

103
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,762
That is cloning, by the way.

104
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,889
-No!
-Yeah.

105
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,517
No, technically speaking, it's not.
The article said it's not.

106
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,562
It's-- It's regeneration.

107
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:45,148
It doesn't matter what you call it, Andre.
It's still weird.

108
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,943
I don't care
how good they say the tech's gonna be.

109
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,945
You'd know
it wasn't a real person in seconds.

110
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,865
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically speaking,

111
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:56,994
what if it was actually possible?
What if they did actually work it out?

112
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:03,125
They won't, Andre. 'Cause you can't
copy a human being. You can't.

113
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,255
-Cameron?
-No. I-- No, I'm staying way out of this.

114
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,339
Oh, come on.

115
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,886
Nothing like a good death chat
first thing in the morning.

116
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,971
Okay.

117
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,974
-Is that funny?
-Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

118
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,060
Look, if Mom could be sitting here
right now with us,

119
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:27,232
and, like, you know, we couldn't tell,
she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

120
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,069
You know, screw the ethics.
I would take that.

121
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,573
I mean, that being said,

122
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,701
if they happen to delete
her fondness for yacht rock,

123
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,620
-I would not be devastated.
-Yes.

124
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,164
Going crazy.
Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

125
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,874
There it is.

126
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,459
Yes.

127
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:14,112
I know how you're feeling,
but there is no lie.

128
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,740
When the memory of this process
gets wiped,

129
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,495
he wakes up that day at home
as Cameron Turner.

130
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,831
And no one knows. Not even him.

131
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,877
It's the only way this works.
A clean swap.

132
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,632
How many others are out there?
I wanna know.

133
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,178
You'll be our third.

134
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,143
This will be as common
as a heart transplant within a few years.

135
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:51,900
Come back and spend a week with him
before making your decision.

136
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,906
This is not just my decision.
My wife needs to know.

137
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,412
Either you decide that your wife would
want this, which requires secrecy,

138
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,666
or you decide that she wouldn't,
and tell her you're dying.

139
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,463
Either way, you're deciding for her.

140
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:23,348
{\an8}Listen, the woman you're about to meet
has no idea she's a duplicate.

141
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,061
<i>Neither does her daughter,
her mother, or her friends.</i>

142
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,565
{\an8}<i>So, where is the lie?</i>

143
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:51,460
Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

144
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,712
Yeah, uh, Cameron.

145
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,506
Browsing for a three-bed
in the neighborhood?

146
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,840
Oh, yeah.

147
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,721
This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

148
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,973
I'm her daughter.

149
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,017
Daughter.

150
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,101
She runs a tight ship.

151
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,938
Anyway, have a seat.

152
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,524
I had some good ones
come in today, actually.

153
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,070
You said in your message
you had a son, right?

154
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,322
Yeah. Cory.

155
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,157
He runs the show as well?

156
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,868
Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.

157
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,996
-Hey.
-Hey.

158
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,678
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

159
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,224
Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

160
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,060
Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

161
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,230
-You taking a break?
-Yeah.

162
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,173
So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert
for the ultrasound.

163
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,552
I'm just waiting for them to confirm,
but it's looking good.

164
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:06,720
Yeah.

165
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,015
That's good. We like Herbert.

166
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,522
Are you bracing yourself
for sexy bowling ball bod?

167
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,532
I still can't believe it.

168
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,952
We're gonna fall in love
with a new little person again.

169
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,496
Seven months.

170
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,421
What's up, Cam?

171
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,389
I'm good. It's just, um…

172
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,522
It's just, um…

173
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,654
So, we, um…

174
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:08,991
Cameron?

175
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,335
It's just, a new little person. And…

176
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,214
I think that's just sinking in still,
you know.

177
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,218
Oh, bear.

178
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,388
Cam.

179
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,767
Cam.

180
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,729
I know it took me a minute,

181
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,733
and I know we haven't been us for a while,

182
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,111
but this baby is going to be good for us.

183
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,030
Yeah.

184
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,077
We're gonna be okay. All right?

185
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,009
Cory.

186
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,147
<i>Cameron?</i>

187
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,358
I've changed my mind.

188
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:52,928
Mind if I sit?

189
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,731
Hi. I'm Cameron.

190
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:06,900
Kate.

191
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,447
So, you met her?

192
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:14,992
Yesterday.

193
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,453
How's she doing?

194
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,790
Good. I guess.

195
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,500
She try to sell you a house?

196
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,711
Condo.

197
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,839
It's what we do.

198
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,555
<i>A week?</i>

199
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,559
<i>And the clients just spring this on you
today, zero notice?</i>

200
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,978
<i>What's going on, Cam?</i>

201
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,563
Nothing.

202
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,234
The designer they had got sick last minute
and they needed someone here in person.

203
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,862
Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

204
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:55,073
I wish I didn't have to be away right now.
Believe me.

205
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,204
<i>All right. Well, I'd better get back here.</i>

206
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,873
-<i>I'll speak to you later, yeah?</i>
-All right.

207
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,057
Okay, Cameron.

208
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,853
You'll be out for the entire process.
It'll take about six hours.

209
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,314
Okay. He'll have everything?

210
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,191
Every single memory

211
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,194
right up to the moment
you lose consciousness in that chair.

212
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,416
In a few moments, you're gonna go under.

213
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,838
Okay. I think I--

214
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,925
I thi--

215
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,852
Like, you having a moment.
You having a day.

216
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,626
Thank you.

217
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,927
So, he has everything?

218
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,389
Even the memories
you've stored deep in your subconscious.

219
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,856
All those memories,
they're not just mine.

220
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,275
They're my wife's, my son's.

221
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,819
Not part of some experiment.

222
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,155
I just wish I could talk to her.

223
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,283
When they sent "me 2.0" back,

224
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,162
seeing my mom look into her eyes
not knowing it wasn't me,

225
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,623
seeing her talking to my daughter…

226
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,583
I mean…

227
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,338
And then when they wiped her…

228
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:20,469
knowing she was no longer in on the lie,
my guilt faded pretty quick.

229
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,683
We share an oncologist, you know?

230
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,144
Dr. Kerosima?

231
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,979
Yep.

232
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:36,235
The patient before me
was a patient of hers too.

233
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,911
She seemed happy, your daughter.
They both did.

234
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,210
Yeah?

235
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,135
How long has she been out there?

236
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,807
Roughly…

237
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,601
forty-two days, six hours.

238
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,312
Roughly?

239
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,023
Ballpark.

240
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,867
Memory cross-checks
allow us to make sure

241
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,119
that his conscious
and subconscious memories

242
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,538
are perfectly in sync with yours.

243
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,833
It will feel strange at first.

244
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,003
Just try to stay in each memory.

245
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,218
In your own time, Cameron.

246
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:49,933
{\an8}Cameron.

247
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,686
Hi.

248
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,063
Cameron, I like your picture.

249
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,566
Breathe.

250
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,864
It feels real because as far as
your brain is concerned, it is real.

251
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,367
Just, skipped way back.

252
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,785
That's normal.

253
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,623
As it progresses,
the system will test any point in time

254
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,124
all the way back to birth.

255
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,754
It's vital that you do your best
to stay in the memories

256
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,548
and not break the flow, okay?

257
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,010
Okay.

258
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:26,929
When you're good.

259
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:34,102
<i>Hi, remember me
from a few weeks back?</i>

260
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,315
Yeah. You ate my chocolate bar.

261
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,444
See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

262
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,280
And I'm hoping
you worked that out by now. Yeah.

263
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:48,909
Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face
when you realized.

264
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,912
Not a strong moment for me.

265
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:58,293
I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

266
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,381
and I-- I made this thing.

267
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,049
It's in my bag.

268
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,760
Here you go.

269
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,855
Wow! Wow, you're good.

270
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,233
Oh, thank you. I realize now

271
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,236
that even makes me look
more like a psycho.

272
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,864
-Oh, yeah?
-But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

273
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,992
A talented psycho is better
than a talentless one, so…

274
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,827
Yeah. I appreciate that.

275
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,413
I'm Cameron, by the way.

276
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,542
Cameron. Poppy.

277
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,503
Poppy.

278
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,797
Pleasure.

279
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,759
My stop's coming up.

280
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:52,097
Oh, okay. Um, all right.
Well, I'll let you go.

281
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,518
Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

282
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,146
I hope to see you around.

283
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,815
<i>-The next station is Summit Park.</i>
-All right, best wishes.

284
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,861
Best wishes.

285
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,114
Hey, Cameron?

286
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,368
Here.

287
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,204
Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

288
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:16,872
Give it to me again.

289
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,082
Okay.

290
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,562
Poppy.

291
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,002
-Yeah? Are you scared yet?
-I'm a little bit scared.

292
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,879
Like, there's a lot going on there.

293
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,052
You mean that awful thing
I made the other day?

294
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,431
Yes!

295
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,476
Let me out.

296
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,562
You hold on a little bit.
I'm not ready for you.

297
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,649
<i>We've been waiting so long for you.</i>

298
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:33,322
<i>She reminds me so much of Cory.
You're so sweet.</i>

299
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,245
And then there was a third one.

300
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,873
I don't wanna look at you.
It makes me laugh.

301
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,880
Mommy.

302
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,674
-I'm not going back in.
-It's okay.

303
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,429
<i>I saw her upstairs in her room,</i>

304
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,474
<i>and she was crying,
and she looked really sad.</i>

305
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:01,602
Is it because of Andre?

306
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:05,522
Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

307
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:07,983
Hey, Andre.

308
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,820
-I should have stopped him.
-No, no, no, no.

309
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,488
I should have stopped him.

310
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,244
It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

311
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,001
-I--
-You good, Cameron?

312
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,297
-I'm sorry. I need a second.
-All right.

313
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,732
All right. Let's go.

314
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,739
<i>You're booking days off now?</i>

315
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,784
Yeah, I booked time off
so we can hang out when I get back.

316
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,538
<i>I've been trying to peel you away
from your desk for the last six months.</i>

317
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:04,748
<i>Suddenly you're gung-ho
to drop everything.</i>

318
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,835
<i>I know. You're right. It's--</i>

319
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,922
<i>Bear?</i>

320
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,134
-<i>You good?</i>
-Yeah. Yes.

321
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:18,679
<i>Yeah?</i>

322
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,766
<i>Are you sure you're happy about this?</i>

323
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,520
<i>Yeah. The last couple of weeks you just…</i>

324
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:28,730
I don't know. Just--

325
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,652
Hey, P. I'm fine.
It's just work. I'm working.

326
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:37,072
I… I just hate being away from you.
That's all.

327
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,324
<i>And I just miss us.</i>

328
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,161
<i>When I get home, we're gonna hang out
and talk for real, okay?</i>

329
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,247
<i>Okay, Cameron.</i>

330
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,502
Oh, my God.

331
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,756
Okay, you're definitely taking the blame
for this specimen.

332
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,926
No.
I believe Cory picked that out himself.

333
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,180
-What? At three months?
<i>-Yeah. Because I was with him.</i>

334
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:02,973
<i>We were in the store walking around,</i>

335
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,768
and I'm pushing him in the stroller.
And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

336
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,563
You see that yellow mustard onesie
right there?

337
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,315
I need that in my life."

338
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,401
Yeah, he's so charming. I was like,
"Hey, what do you say to that?"

339
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,405
Yeah, he is very charming.
I'll give you that.

340
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,532
<i>But this is criminal.</i>

341
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,715
<i>Together,
me and you will take care of her</i>

342
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,009
<i>till she can take care of herself again.
All right?</i>

343
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,430
Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay?
She's just sick right now.

344
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,516
Go away.

345
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,434
Wake up, man. Come on.

346
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,898
At least six more hours.

347
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,525
Six more hours?

348
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,443
It's still dark outside. Look!

349
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,988
'Cause it's early.
But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

350
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,449
Let this hand go. There, boom.

351
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,202
-And now flick it. Follow through.
-Boom.

352
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,624
I used to do this all day in my room.

353
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,918
-That smells so good.
-You think?

354
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,672
-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint.
-Yes. All right.

355
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,091
Dip 'em in a little--
a little soy sauce.

356
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:42,781
<i>Okay.
I'm standing by up here.</i>

357
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:46,410
How long will it take?

358
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,121
He should wake instantly.

359
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:55,169
Okay. We're ready to go up here.

360
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,511
All right.

361
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,181
Okay.

362
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,767
Keep your eyes closed.

363
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,270
I'm gonna count you down from three.

364
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,731
And on three…

365
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,317
And two…

366
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,695
And one.

367
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,761
You're okay.

368
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,138
Breathe.

369
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,061
-That's it?
-That's it.

370
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,733
Everything go okay?

371
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,817
Everything went great.

372
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,157
When will I see him?

373
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:08,659
In the morning.

374
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,328
Until then, you should get some sleep.

375
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:21,004
<i>For the time
that you are in this facility,</i>

376
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,466
that freckle is the only place
on your entire body

377
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,718
that isn't identical to his.

378
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,013
If you get confused,

379
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:35,185
you find that freckle
and you'll know who you are. Okay?

380
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,982
We know how strange this is.

381
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,696
You got the good deal here.

382
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,991
You'll see.

383
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,704
<i>Boom! Again.</i>

384
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,998
-Little chin music.
-<i>You're going down.</i>

385
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,041
You don't know nothing about this, boy.

386
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,545
You too young.

387
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,380
Chump.

388
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,215
Yeah!

389
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,514
<i>Boom!</i>

390
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,976
-<i>Yeah, baby!</i>
-That's just another cheap left.

391
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:21,982
End call.

392
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:23,859
<i>Dad?</i>

393
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,447
-<i>Hey, Cameron?</i>
-<i>Talk to me, Cameron.</i>

394
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,824
-<i>No.</i>
-<i>Send Poppy a message.</i>

395
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,503
<i>They're saying
any of these seizures could kill me.</i>

396
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:48,425
And I could die out here this week
before getting home to see them.

397
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:56,808
I can't stop picturing her
getting the news, having to tell Cory.

398
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,609
Poppy and I had been
going through some stuff.

399
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,362
The other night I made her laugh.

400
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,865
I can't remember
the last time I did that, you know?

401
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,909
Just made her laugh.

402
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,079
That's because you're not funny.

403
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,876
Yeah, that too.

404
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,977
Those things will kill you, you know.

405
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,272
Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.

406
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,150
Cameron?

407
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,319
We're ready for you.

408
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,910
See you later.

409
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,038
Have fun.

410
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,423
Poppy's the world's best sleeper.

411
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,968
When she's tired,
she'll just drift off in seconds,

412
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,595
like, out like a light.

413
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,514
Poppy speaks French?

414
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,852
Yeah, she'll still say
the occasional French word.

415
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:25,731
Like, she'll say…

416
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,442
Or…

417
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,409
Or if something is great,
like, just perfect,

418
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,077
she might whisper…

419
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:00,516
You wanna go say hi?

420
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,173
You okay?

421
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,218
After last night?

422
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,931
Good.

423
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,522
I don't know how to…

424
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,568
What to say here.

425
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:57,531
I know you don't think I'm…

426
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,331
You.

427
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,632
I'm sitting up in that room,
looking at Rafa.

428
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:20,053
<i>My heart is beating
out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.</i>

429
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,306
I'm really nervous.

430
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,936
Then Dad pops in my head.

431
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,359
That first trip out to see him
after they split.

432
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,779
Getting on that airplane.

433
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,991
Just the nerves, you know?

434
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,160
And I close my eyes.

435
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:47,873
And then I open 'em.

436
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,506
I'm not up there
in that room anymore.

437
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,259
I'm here.

438
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,056
I am here.

439
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:12,523
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

440
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,659
He knows you're nervous, Jack.

441
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,745
Just answer the questions.

442
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,670
-<i>Audio muted.</i>
-Cameron…

443
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,256
you're you.

444
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,552
There are no wrong answers.

445
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,310
<i>Audio unmuted.</i>

446
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:54,731
Okay, Jack.
Poppy works with children.

447
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,277
Yeah, she teaches
kids with learning difficulties

448
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,153
through music therapy.

449
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,866
She's got her own take
on the Orff Schulwerk method.

450
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:11,790
So, um, she makes songs with the kids,
and she puts them in the songs.

451
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:15,210
And… they love it.

452
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:20,257
She's just insanely talented.

453
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:27,222
She cares. You know?
Like, she really cares.

454
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,975
<i>Did you always want children?</i>

455
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,439
I like this, Cameron Turner.

456
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,026
I think after I met Poppy,
I realized I wanted kids.

457
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,694
I like all of this.

458
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,321
Yeah.

459
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,573
<i>I was cynical for a long time.</i>

460
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:47,701
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

461
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,872
We have scarily similar taste in books.

462
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:56,210
{\an8}<i>This idea
of finding true love or a soul mate.</i>

463
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:01,256
<i>Then someone like Poppy comes along
and you realize you're just surviving.</i>

464
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,341
Do you play?

465
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,302
I butcher.

466
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,680
But I'm not playing in front of you.

467
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,767
I could have
just gone on like that forever.

468
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,687
<i>You better stop
And think about what you doing</i>

469
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,237
Oh, I love it. Yes.

470
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,530
I just lucked out, I guess.

471
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:28,075
Good.

472
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:32,287
Talk about
your parents' relationship.

473
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,916
Well, there's not really
much to talk about.

474
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,962
They divorced when I was five,
and my dad moved away for work.

475
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,131
He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

476
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:56,687
He looks like me.
He sounds like me, but I don't know…

477
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,025
In seven months, that child is gonna
come into the world without a dad.

478
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:07,447
Seven months.

479
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:10,367
Hey. At least you're not
feeling sorry for yourself.

480
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,370
Oh, okay. That's fair.

481
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,622
You're gonna be good, man.

482
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:16,707
That's fair.

483
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,045
And what about you? How you doing?

484
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,298
Me?

485
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,550
Never better.

486
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,759
Any other great questions?

487
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,344
No. Okay.

488
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,305
Yep.

489
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,974
Having the time of my life out here.

490
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,977
Nature's awesome. Great food.

491
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,402
Cameron?

492
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:47,863
Make it obscure.

493
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:52,492
Andre. Gift.

494
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,830
Am I actually gonna like this?

495
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,916
-Probably not. It's probably--
-Oh, God. What?

496
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,084
-Lift your feet up high.
-Lift my feet up where?

497
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:04,087
-And step. Step. Step.
-Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

498
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,631
There we go. There you go.

499
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,299
We're safe. We're safe.

500
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,884
What is it?

501
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,265
You got me a piano!

502
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:19,228
Andre!

503
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:21,730
Oh, my God.

504
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,816
-Thank you so much.
-<i>And he was so like Poppy.</i>

505
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,904
<i>Like, just wildly smart and gentle.</i>

506
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,448
What happened to him?

507
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:39,039
Andre… was thrown from his bike
off of a mountain road.

508
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:45,087
His body landed in the branches
of a pine tree, high up.

509
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:50,592
<i>Every couple of weeks, I dream
about him up there in the treetops.</i>

510
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:55,472
<i>Alone. Just laying there.</i>

511
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:04,273
Have you talked to your wife
about that dream?

512
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:05,357
No.

513
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,025
Why not?

514
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:10,279
She didn't leave the house
for the better part of a year.

515
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:16,201
Slept in the guest room
most of that time, so…

516
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,786
I'm just trying to help you.

517
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:21,748
I know, I know.

518
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,877
-I need to be alone. Thank you.
-Please--

519
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,506
It's not really subject matter
we enjoy getting into.

520
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,678
How did Poppy sleeping apart
make you feel?

521
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:37,806
Alone.

522
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,851
Mostly, I worried about her.

523
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,395
I missed her.

524
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,107
Did you resent her for it?

525
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,484
<i>She lost her twin.</i>

526
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:54,740
<i>She never felt good
about him getting that motorcycle.</i>

527
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:59,161
<i>Blamed herself for not protesting more.</i>

528
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,914
<i>But he was gonna get the bike anyway.</i>

529
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,960
You've mentioned how well
Poppy has progressed with her therapist

530
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,462
over the last few months.

531
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,131
But you never went to see anybody?

532
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:13,300
No.

533
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,888
Did you talk to someone
after your parents were divorced?

534
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:19,890
No, I was five.

535
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,810
So you've never been to a therapist?

536
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:24,895
No.

537
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:28,815
And you can't talk to Poppy
about this dream that you keep having?

538
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:32,653
It's been two years.
Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

539
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:33,737
I don't know.

540
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:38,075
Cameron?

541
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,411
I'm sorry, I--

542
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,001
I'm sorry.

543
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,254
It's okay.

544
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,217
Let's take a break.

545
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,493
Saving them for you.

546
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,055
<i>All right.</i>

547
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:45,392
Jack, are you ready?

548
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:46,894
Yeah.

549
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,104
-Cameron?
-Yeah.

550
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,482
All right.

551
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,152
Call Poppy, please.

552
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:06,663
<i>This is weird timing.
I just spoke to the clinic.</i>

553
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:11,084
<i>Doctor Herbert is confirmed
for the ultrasound on the 25th.</i>

554
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:17,633
<i>Cam?</i>

555
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,053
That's real.

556
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:25,557
<i>Yeah. So real. Living human in body.</i>

557
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:28,727
Just feels so different
to how I remember it with Cory, right?

558
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,811
<i>Yeah.</i>

559
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,774
Remember how we found out?

560
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,736
<i>Oh, my God, yeah.
That insane snow.</i>

561
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,113
<i>Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.</i>

562
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:42,449
Zoe knew right away.

563
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,578
<i>"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."</i>

564
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:50,749
Oh, I remember that feeling.

565
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,668
You were barely
out of the doctor's office,

566
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,920
you were already making a playlist,
holding the speaker there.

567
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:59,842
<i>Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.</i>

568
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:03,595
Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

569
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,932
<i>Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.</i>

570
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,310
Yeah, I was thinking the same--

571
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,605
Rafa, send Poppy a message.

572
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:17,776
-What did you do?
-I don't like this.

573
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,575
And you think I like this?
Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

574
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,118
She's not your wife!

575
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,663
Oh, okay. Okay, I see.

576
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:32,583
You can't bear to see this actually work.
That's the real problem.

577
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,251
-Fuck you, man!
-Fuck you!

578
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:37,129
And what about me?
Waking up in this place,

579
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,548
waiting for you to pull the plug,
being told I'm not me.

580
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,049
Because you're not me.

581
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:43,802
You are not me!

582
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,683
You know what? Fuck all this.

583
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,227
-No, bullshit. You stay right here.
-This is bullshit! Fuck that!

584
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,855
-Stay here. Bullshit. This is real.
-Open the fucking door!

585
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,773
And you know it. You know it.

586
00:55:56,857 --> 00:56:00,485
Poppy said if she couldn't tell,
if her mom was indistinguishable…

587
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:02,821
Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

588
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,073
You won't go through with it
because you're too selfish!

589
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:06,658
Get the fuck off me.

590
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:08,869
I'm done with you. Huh?

591
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:12,497
Do something?
Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

592
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,251
Yeah. You won't leave this place.

593
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:19,588
I'm going home, and I'm telling them
everything. Everything!

594
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,341
Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

595
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,426
It's always about you.
It's always about you.

596
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,220
She's been trying to talk
for I don't know how long,

597
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:27,387
and you keep shutting her out,

598
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,806
because deep down inside,
you feel like she abandoned us.

599
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,892
-I never thought that! I never!
-You did!

600
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,268
You did--

601
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,355
Hey, hey. Hey.

602
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,774
It's okay. It's okay. Breathe, breathe.

603
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,235
Cam?

604
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:55,624
What the fuck, man?

605
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,339
<i>He shouldn't go home in that state.</i>

606
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:14,476
I'll talk to him,
but it's in his contract.

607
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,439
I need to see him.

608
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:20,000
I remember when I knew
she was gonna be okay.

609
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,431
<i>I used to cry for Tracy</i>

610
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:37,684
<i>I wanted to see him again</i>

611
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:46,818
<i>But sometimes
Sometimes life ain't always the way</i>

612
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:57,913
<i>Sometimes it snows in April</i>

613
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,505
<i>Sometimes I feel so bad</i>

614
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,216
<i>So bad</i>

615
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:17,558
<i>Sometimes I wish life is never-ending</i>

616
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:25,941
<i>And all good things
They say never last</i>

617
00:59:30,112 --> 00:59:32,155
<i>And love</i>

618
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:39,538
<i>It isn't hard till it's passed</i>

619
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:02,477
Hey, uh… I'm really sorry about earlier.

620
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:04,855
I don't think she abandoned us.

621
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:10,360
No, there's something to it.

622
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,238
There's something to it.

623
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:18,202
She'd been trying to talk to me
for a long time in her own way.

624
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,454
Thought I had more time, I guess.

625
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,958
I just told her about that dizzy spell
three months ago.

626
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,630
If I'd had mentioned
the headache back then--

627
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,050
She'd have marched us in
for a scan that day.

628
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:36,845
And got to it before it spread.

629
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,015
Dealt with it together.

630
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:50,150
I know you got to go back
and see them. I get it.

631
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:52,945
Do the right thing here.

632
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:56,907
In seven months, that baby--

633
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,991
Don't do that.

634
01:00:58,075 --> 01:01:01,245
If you tell her, you're saying it for you.
I'm saying that for them.

635
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:02,329
Enough.

636
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:21,765
Morning.

637
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,562
Hey, Jack.

638
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:29,815
Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay.

639
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:34,069
-Oh, shit.
-You're okay.

640
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:35,153
You're okay.

641
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:38,824
Yeah.

642
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:46,498
<i>Monitoring your lens feed
while you're back at home</i>

643
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:49,877
<i>is an important part
of Jack's psychological evaluation.</i>

644
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:51,670
Nothing's ever recorded?

645
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:53,630
That's the policy.

646
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:57,467
And only Jack has access to this feed?

647
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,720
No one sees or hears a thing.

648
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,519
Access granted.

649
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:14,484
<i>Now, try your best
to forget about all this,</i>

650
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:16,987
<i>and just enjoy your time with them.</i>

651
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:21,617
We'll see you in three days, Cameron.

652
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,954
Try to put everything out of your mind.
Just enjoy your time at home.

653
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,543
Do come back.

654
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,336
Oh, my God.

655
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,006
Call him. Send a car.

656
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:33,559
Oh, my God.

657
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,103
Pick up.

658
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:41,775
<i>Cameron, there will be
a car there in a moment. Try to stand up.</i>

659
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:06,884
<i>Cameron?</i>

660
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:09,011
<i>We're gonna need you to come back.</i>

661
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:10,095
I just got home.

662
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,639
We might just need to
change your medication,

663
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:14,308
but we gotta have a look at you.

664
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,559
<i>I'm not going back.</i>

665
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:19,438
If you stay and you have
another seizure without supervision,

666
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:21,857
<i>you could die in front of your family.</i>

667
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:23,817
Fuck you.

668
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:27,279
Fuck. Fuck.

669
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:30,532
Cameron?

670
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:34,244
<i>Cameron, talk to me.</i>

671
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,065
Jack goes in the morning.

672
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:08,904
I haven't finished evaluating
his psychological state yet.

673
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,324
I'm not comfortable with Jack going home.

674
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:15,160
Poppy's expecting him back.

675
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:19,081
-I have--
-Jack is ready. He goes first thing.

676
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,960
We're covered for this in the contract.

677
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:26,880
It will be noted
that you opposed the decision.

678
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:30,050
Tell Jack to call Poppy now.

679
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:37,307
You slipped in the shower.
Mild concussion. Scan was all good.

680
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:38,392
Home tomorrow.

681
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:39,977
All right.

682
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:51,947
If these two weeks
at home go well, which they will,

683
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:55,075
your memory of this process
will be removed

684
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:56,994
and we will not see you here again.

685
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:03,709
If Cameron wakes up,
he will monitor your lens feed.

686
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:07,004
But unless there are any issues
over the next two weeks,

687
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:09,256
he will not have the option to stop this.

688
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:15,387
I know this isn't as we planned it,
but you're ready, Jack.

689
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:18,265
Don't think of these two weeks as a test.

690
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,392
Just going home.

691
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:57,386
Bear? Let me see you.

692
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:00,307
Are you okay?

693
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,810
-Just-- Just a little bit sore. I'm fine.
-Yeah?

694
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:05,312
The swelling's gone down.

695
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:07,731
What did they say?

696
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:12,528
I'll be a little bit fuzzy
for a few days. But I'm good.

697
01:09:14,863 --> 01:09:15,738
Come here.

698
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,131
<i>You scared me.</i>

699
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,383
<i>I scared me.</i>

700
01:09:48,438 --> 01:09:50,357
He's waiting for you up in his room.

701
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,904
-Who?
-Your son.

702
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:04,413
Shut up.

703
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:08,041
Asshole.

704
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,377
I'm sorry, I had to.

705
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,796
Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

706
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:14,673
Wanker.

707
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:16,717
-Come here.
-No.

708
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,552
Come here.

709
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:21,346
-No way.
-I'm sorry.

710
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:30,397
Easy, tiger.

711
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,568
Pig.

712
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:36,195
What the hell? Ellington?

713
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:38,655
Hey, pal.

714
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,867
Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

715
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,995
for leaving town
and hitting your head.

716
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:48,999
Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

717
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,002
Okay, Pig.

718
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,379
I'll stick him outside.

719
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,216
I'll go check on Doc.

720
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:27,663
Hey.

721
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,792
Ra-- What happened?

722
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:33,669
You passed out.

723
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:39,383
You've been unconscious
for almost 24 hours.

724
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:42,553
What does Poppy think?

725
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:44,972
Everything's fine, Cameron.

726
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:48,642
What does that mean?

727
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:53,689
He's not gone.

728
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:58,318
We've been monitoring it all
while you were out. Everything's good.

729
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:01,780
No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

730
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,699
I'm so sorry that it happened this way…

731
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,200
I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

732
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,160
-…but it was the right decision.
-Bullshit.

733
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,704
I'm not done!

734
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,330
Well, it's not about you now.

735
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:11,915
Excuse me?

736
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:15,419
-You have an opportunity that no one gets.
-No. No, no, no.

737
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,004
Don't be blind, Cameron.

738
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:18,505
-Fuck you.
-You're dying.

739
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,344
You're dying.

740
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,477
-You're dying, Cam--
-Stop!

741
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:34,938
Stop.

742
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,403
Jack was ready.

743
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:44,072
They're in good hands.

744
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:48,702
They're in your hands.

745
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,167
I wanna see the video.

746
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,504
Now.

747
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,341
And you need to stop watching my family.

748
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,598
<i>I learned that from school.
Paper is wood.</i>

749
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,350
<i>Yes.</i>

750
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,519
-<i>It's got some-- Let me see.</i>
-<i>Is it?</i>

751
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,479
<i>Some wood up there.</i>

752
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:18,941
<i>Yeah. Yes, sir.</i>

753
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:22,861
-This the only feed?
-<i>Okay.</i>

754
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:23,946
Yes.

755
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,281
I'd like to be alone.

756
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:28,075
<i>Nope.</i>

757
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,828
<i>So, what's one thing
I've been trying to get you to do more of?</i>

758
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,542
-<i>Read?
-Good.</i>

759
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,628
<i>Here's a little something for you.</i>

760
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,338
<i>Essentially, it's from your grandmother.</i>

761
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,924
<i>It's something she gave to me
when I was about your age.</i>

762
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,218
<i>Open it up, it's a good one.</i>

763
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,220
<i>Okay.</i>

764
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:50,180
<i>She wrote a little something in it.</i>

765
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:59,022
<i>I used to kill Andre
for doing this to our books</i>

766
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:00,607
<i>when we were growing up.</i>

767
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:04,653
<i>Now I'm, like, poring over
every word he underlined.</i>

768
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,081
<i>Somehow I'm--</i>

769
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,337
<i>Somehow I'm finally breathing again.</i>

770
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:27,634
<i>But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.</i>

771
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,433
<i>You keep yourself so busy
in a job you hate.</i>

772
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:36,435
<i>It's like you're not here.</i>

773
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:41,690
<i>And I'm not saying you're fully to blame,
you know?</i> <i>We're both in this.</i>

774
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,987
<i>I know I checked out for a while.</i>

775
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:49,865
<i>And I know that scared you.</i>

776
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:55,078
<i>And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.</i>

777
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:02,836
<i>I mean, hearing you say the words,
"I hit my head," the other day…</i>

778
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:11,845
<i>I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.</i>

779
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:22,648
<i>So this is me telling you
that I'm done with the silence now.</i>

780
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:29,196
<i>We start communicating, and we fix things.</i>

781
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,030
I made you a little something.

782
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,592
It's really insensitive.

783
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:39,016
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

784
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:41,602
Oh, shit. I'm so so--

785
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,732
You little shit.

786
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:50,402
You scared me.

787
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:52,613
Your face. It's-- It's--

788
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,615
You scared me. That was good.

789
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,494
It is… It's good. Funny.

790
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,672
Hey, oh. It's okay.

791
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:14,426
You're okay.

792
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,351
I'm here. You're okay.

793
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,830
<i>He's taking out the contacts
more and more,</i>

794
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,415
<i>not just when he goes to bed.</i>

795
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,960
He doesn't have to wear them all the time.
They make him feel uncomfortable.

796
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:32,045
He feels badly for you.

797
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:36,216
But he also feels uncomfortable
having his family watched.

798
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,635
I don't give a shit about his comfort.
That's my family.

799
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,638
What you're feeling right now,
Cameron, is normal.

800
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:43,223
No, it is not.

801
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,142
Something is wrong.

802
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:47,519
For the last couple of days, I feel it.
Something is off.

803
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:48,812
At this stage,

804
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:53,650
whatever you're going through,
it's normal. He's fine.

805
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:55,986
Yeah.

806
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:39,029
What's up with you?

807
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:54,336
Cory, it's time to eat, buddy.

808
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:03,971
Cory. Pause it.

809
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:06,265
Cory, come on.

810
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:07,850
What do you think?

811
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:13,146
I like it.

812
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,525
-Pecorino instead of Parmesan.
-So good.

813
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:17,651
Yeah.

814
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,490
Come on, man. Now. Pause it.

815
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,493
Less salty, right?
Kind of sweeter?

816
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:27,995
Yeah. It's great.

817
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,418
-You okay, babe?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

818
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:37,546
-What's up?
-No. I'm good. I'm good.

819
01:20:38,589 --> 01:20:39,798
You need to stop!

820
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,607
Oh, no.

821
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,061
<i>Access denied.</i>

822
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:36,438
<i>Access denied.</i>

823
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:22,307
-<i>Yeah. The waddle dance.</i>
-<i>I'm gonna be a big brother!</i>

824
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:24,810
-<i>Good job!</i>
-<i>We got the waddle dance.</i>

825
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:30,232
<i>I love him.</i>

826
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,881
Wow.

827
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:41,595
Do what you need to do.

828
01:28:35,107 --> 01:28:37,693
Hey, hey. Just, um…

829
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:40,654
Just be careful.

830
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:19,860
Hey, Doc.

831
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:23,530
Doc.

832
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:27,618
Wake up.

833
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,961
What's wrong?

834
01:29:39,338 --> 01:29:42,925
I just had a really bad nightmare,
and I just wanted to see you.

835
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:46,762
Hey, I have an idea.

836
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:56,063
We're going to pretend
that this is beer, okay?

837
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:59,107
My first was with my mom.
I was a lot older than you, though.

838
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:02,444
But it's okay. We won't tell anybody.

839
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:03,862
Yeah.

840
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:08,534
And these guys were her favorite thing
to eat with beer.

841
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:13,163
Edamame with loads of salt.

842
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,625
Washed down with a nice, crisp brew.

843
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,086
-Yum.
-How do you eat it?

844
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:22,631
See? Just grab the top one.
Start one at a time with the top one.

845
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,510
Pop it out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

846
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,055
-Tastes good.
-Good, right?

847
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,683
Better than they look.

848
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,269
Yeah, now try it with your beer.

849
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,062
Okay.

850
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:41,942
Apple juice, but--
Hold up, hold on. Cheers.

851
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:45,946
Long life for you.

852
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:49,032
To edamame.

853
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:05,007
I'll just take one more.

854
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:07,217
Come here, man.

855
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,454
You okay, Dad?

856
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:45,547
Let me look at you, man.
Let me look at that face.

857
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:52,471
Yeah, I'm okay.

858
01:31:56,642 --> 01:31:57,643
I'm okay.

859
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:03,315
Cory?

860
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:05,067
Yes?

861
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:07,945
I love you, man.

862
01:32:08,946 --> 01:32:10,364
I love you too, Dad.

863
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:18,914
I know.

864
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:36,390
Be good, Doc.

865
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:28,275
P?

866
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:31,528
P.

867
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:37,826
I love you.

868
01:33:43,874 --> 01:33:45,000
Poppy, wake up.

869
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:53,467
Bear, what's wrong?

870
01:33:55,093 --> 01:33:56,094
What's wrong?

871
01:33:58,388 --> 01:33:59,556
It's nothing. I just--

872
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,852
I just had a really bad dream.

873
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:07,606
I got angry at Cory.
Dreamt I lost everything.

874
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:10,108
Oh, baby.

875
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:11,860
Come here.

876
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:20,494
God, you're shaking, sweetheart.
You're shaking.

877
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:22,913
It felt so real.

878
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,166
Oh, sweetheart.

879
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,463
-We're here. Yeah?
-Yes.

880
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:37,469
We're doing better now. Yeah?

881
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:43,141
Yeah, we're doing great.

882
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,773
If it's a boy…

883
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,360
we should name him Andre.

884
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:55,779
Yeah. I know.

885
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:21,054
Poppy?

886
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:22,931
Yeah?

887
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:31,982
I drifted.

888
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:38,280
Cam, stop it. Come here.

889
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:44,369
I'm so sorry. I just--

890
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:47,247
Listen.

891
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:50,209
We're back, yeah?

892
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:53,629
And it's wonderful.

893
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:56,381
Yeah?

894
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:00,802
Yeah.

895
01:36:06,266 --> 01:36:07,392
Come here.

896
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:28,038
Come on, get to sleep.

897
01:37:46,992 --> 01:37:47,993
Thank you.

898
01:37:57,044 --> 01:37:58,045
Take care of 'em.

899
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:07,429
I will.

900
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:26,758
As of this morning,
he's officially Cameron Turner.

901
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,055
He'll never know about any of this.

902
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:35,767
Good.

903
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:40,189
Good.

904
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:47,738
Thank you, Doc.

905
01:39:50,866 --> 01:39:51,867
Thank you.

906
01:40:06,298 --> 01:40:08,091
It's hard to be left behind.

907
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:16,683
The new client is about to arrive.

908
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:22,272
Come down to us
when you're done speaking with him.

909
01:40:23,357 --> 01:40:24,775
Jack left you something.

910
01:41:23,542 --> 01:41:24,793
<i>Babe?</i>

911
01:41:29,548 --> 01:41:30,841
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

912
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:34,636
<i>I love you.</i>

913
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:41,977
<i>No, no, no.</i>

914
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,520
<i>Cam.</i>

915
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:46,148
<i>What are you doing? I'm chopping stuff.</i>

916
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:47,608
<i>For real, P.</i>

917
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:49,651
<i>What?</i>

918
01:41:50,235 --> 01:41:52,738
<i>Look me in the eyes
and tell me you love me.</i>

919
01:41:53,906 --> 01:41:57,910
-<i>What are you doing?</i>
-<i>Just-- Come on. For real.</i>

920
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:00,454
<i>I need to hear it.</i>

921
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:05,209
<i>Okay.</i>

922
01:42:12,132 --> 01:42:13,717
<i>I love you, Cameron Turner.</i>

923
01:42:15,802 --> 01:42:19,973
<i>Always have. And always will.</i>

924
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:29,149
-<i>How was that?</i>
-<i>That was good.</i>

924
01:42:30,305 --> 01:43:30,516
