What's "a ways"?

330
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,444
About a 30-minute drive.

331
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,488
Okay, well,
she didn't run from home, then.

332
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,413
No one reported her missing?
Her parents...?

333
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,157
Nope.

334
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,034
(wind whistling)

335
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,670
Yeah. That's why we called you.

336
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,669
How experienced is your
medical examiner? (sniffs)

337
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,013
Let's just say he...
he stays busy.

338
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,303
Uh, order a rape kit.

339
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,596
When he's done with the prelim,

340
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,094
I want her body sent
to Loveland.

341
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,970
And make sure
her belongings go with her,

342
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,439
'cause they need
to get tested, too.

343
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,561
I'm listing this as a homicide.

344
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,443
How well do you know this land?

345
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,240
Like it's my job.

346
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,078
'Cause it is.

347
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,494
Well, is there anywhere
she could be running from'?

348
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,958
Is there anything close by?

349
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,827
Nearest house is three
and a half miles from here.

350
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,625
- Southeast.
- Sam Littlefeather's place

351
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,123
is over there.

352
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,796
Yep.

353
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,885
Those boys could use
some serious looking into.

354
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,676
There are no structures closer?

355
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,640
There's a drill rig
five miles from here.

356
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,601
They got trailers
for the workers, but...

357
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,346
- that's closed for the winter.
- JANE: Okay, so why would

358
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,940
a teenage girl be out here?

359
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,810
Well, kids come out here
on their snow machines,

360
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,984
and, uh, have a big party
in the snow.

361
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,823
Not barefoot, they don't.

362
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,203
What do you think?

363
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,493
I only know
what the tracks say.

364
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,332
Okay, well, that's all we got.

365
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,326
Well, come here, I'll show you.

366
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,625
Over here. See this one?
See how the toes turned out,

367
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,548
the front is much deeper
than the back?

368
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,761
That says she was running.

369
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,846
Come here. I'll show you.

370
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,593
She ran until she dropped here.

371
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,438
See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.

372
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,684
Now, it gets 20 below
here at night,

373
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,812
so if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air

374
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,280
when you're running,
you could freeze 'em up.

375
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,742
Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up.

376
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,032
So wherever she came from...

377
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,787
...she ran all the way here.

378
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,626
Her lungs burst here.

379
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,837
And she curled up
in that tree line

380
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,922
and drowned in her own blood.

381
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,632
Well, how far do you think

382
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,502
someone could run barefoot
out here?

383
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,386
Oh, I don't know, I...

384
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,306
How do you gauge
someone's will to live?

385
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,021
Especially in these conditions.

386
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,440
But I knew that girl.

387
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,819
She's a fighter.

388
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,233
So no matter
how far you think she ran,

389
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,735
I can guarantee you
she ran further.

390
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,329
(wind whistling)

391
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,744
I got to get back to my son.

392
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,833
(wind whistling)

393
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,547
Hey, um... would you
be willing to help me?

394
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,757
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

395
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,629
Hey, can he assist
on this investigation?

396
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,221
What?

397
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,760
He doesn't work for me.

398
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,259
And you got a lion to kill,
don't forget.

399
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,806
There's three of 'em...
and I didn't.

400
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,899
Sorry, what is it...
what is it that you do again?

401
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,232
I'm a hunter.

402
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,273
You're a lion hunter?

403
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,522
I hunt predators.

404
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,618
Good. So why don't you
come hunt one for me, then?

405
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,328
Okay.

406
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,699
(engine starts)

407
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,170
(high-pitched whirring)

408
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,664
("Diamonds and Gasoline"
by Turnpike Troubadours playing)

409
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,508
(blows out sharply)

410
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,548
(whirring)

411
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,972
(metallic clink)

412
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,347
(whirring)

413
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,061
(two beeps)

414
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,688
(two beeps)

415
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,205
CASEY:
Dad?

416
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,823
Hey, bud.

417
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,451
What happened?
You can't sleep?

418
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,748
Had a nightmare.

419
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,213
That right? What about?

420
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,419
Who was she?

421
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,840
Come here, buddy.

422
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,689
- Want some milk?
- No.

423
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,559
Well...

424
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,358
she was a girl that just lost
her way in the snow.

425
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,903
That's all. Okay?

426
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,152
What's all this?

427
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,620
That's work, buddy.

428
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,954
Did she die like Emily?

429
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,288
She died from the cold.

430
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,167
So she died like Emily.

431
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,091
Yeah, son.

432
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,590
I'm afraid she did.

433
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,429
(wolves howling)

434
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,735
Hi. Sorry.

435
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,650
(Ben chuckles)

436
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,444
Yeah.

437
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,282
See you found town okay.

438
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,072
Yeah, barely.

439
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,740
Did the family
identify the body?

440
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,829
- Yeah.
- (Jane sighs)

441
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,325
Did they give you a reason
for not reporting her missing?

442
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,703
Well, she stayed
with a boyfriend some.

443
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,545
They didn't think anything
of it.

444
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,040
She was 18,
free to do what she wanted.

445
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,167
Okay, Randy,
you're on the clock.

446
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,296
I got about five minutes
of this in me, so let's go.

447
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,798
RANDY:
I'll be quick. Morning.

448
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,301
Randy Whitehurst.
I'm the medical examiner.

449
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,850
I'm-I'm Jane Banner, FBI.

450
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,688
Uh, as you can see here,

451
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,979
she suffered a deep laceration
along her brow line.

452
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,068
Two separated ribs.

453
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,813
Frostbite in both feet
up through her ankles,

454
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,566
frostbite on her nose
and on her left hand.

455
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,239
Uh, the frostbite
on her feet is stage four.

456
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,782
You can tell
by the bluing here.

457
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,246
You see that?

458
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,740
Yeah.

459
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,492
Uh, vaginal wall is torn
in different depths.

460
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,619
You think there are
multiple assailants?

461
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,371
Can't determine that.

462
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,669
Could be one assailant who
assaulted her multiple times.

463
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,213
Uh, I swabbed her
and sent the sample by courier

464
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,507
to the FBI crime lab
in Loveland, Colorado

465
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,346
per your request.

466
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,091
We should have the DNA results
in six weeks.

467
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,390
Uh, those findings might help
us make that determination.

468
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,639
What are you listing
as the cause of death?

469
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,811
Well, you're not gonna like it.

470
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,185
She died
from a pulmonary hemorrhage.

471
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,655
When... subzero air
is drawn into the lungs,

472
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,115
it can cause the alveoli...

473
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,155
the tiny sacs in the lungs...
to burst.

474
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,371
Fluid builds in the lungs,
and if the air is cold enough,

475
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,364
the liquid in the lungs
will crystallize.

476
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,082
Ultimately,
the victim either...

477
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,201
Sorry, you're not listing this
as a homicide?

478
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,828
Can't.

479
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,376
Uh, s...
You have to take

480
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,215
into consideration
the circumstances.

481
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,178
She was raped repeatedly,
beaten...

482
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,801
Look, uh, circumstances
is your field, not mine.

483
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,551
- Now, let me... let me show you.
- No.

484
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,848
I don't need it explained.

485
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,687
This is very prosecutable
as a murder.

486
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,397
I mean, clearly,
she wouldn't have been

487
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,516
running through the snow
if she hadn't been attacked,

488
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,565
but I can't list the cause
of death as homicide.

489
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,529
And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation

490
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,239
unless it's listed
as a homicide.

491
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,074
Look, I'm not here
to solve this.

492
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,536
I'm-I'm just here
to obtain a cause of death

493
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,825
- and send a team here that can.
- RANDY: Look, present

494
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,199
the rape, present the assault,
and I'm...

495
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,326
Those don't fall
to the jurisdiction of the FBI.

496
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,125
They fall to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.

497
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,595
Huh. Hey, don't look at me.
I'm used to no help.

498
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,090
You have six officers
on your entire force

499
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,138
to cover an area the size
of Rhode Island.

500
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,601
BEN:
Yes, I know that.

501
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,187
No offense,
but this will have to curl up

502
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,557
in your lap
in order for you to solve it.

503
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,683
- (scoffs) I know that, too.
- RANDY: We all know

504
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,105
it's a murder.

505
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,446
All right, have a U.S. Attorney
sign off on it,

506
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,190
I'm happy to corroborate that,
but I just can't put it

507
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,783
on the death certificate.

508
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,744
Okay.

509
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,829
Thank you.

510
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,289
(sighs)

511
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,754
(doors close)

512
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,250
(doors close)

513
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,752
I appreciate your passion.

514
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,095
It's not the Feds'
usual response,

515
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,011
but Randy is on our side.

516
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,010
When my supervisor sees
his report,

517
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,228
he's gonna want me back
in Vegas.

518
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,394
Not that... I'm much help
or anything, <i>but...</i>

519
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,859
(scoffs)
...I'm all you've got.

520
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,147
(Ben sighs)

521
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,323
(phone ringing)

522
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,820
Yeah.

523
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,423
BEN:
So you never met him.

524
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,883
MARTIN:
No.

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,798
BEN:
And she never talked about him?

526
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,841
MARTIN:
Not to me.

527
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,215
JANE: So why would you let
your daughter stay

528
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,183
with a guy you've never met
whose name you don't even know?

529
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,723
She was an adult.

530
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,096
Barely.

531
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,723
- (speaking Arapaho)
- BEN: Oh.

532
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,350
I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

533
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,317
It ain't good.

534
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,484
Ah. Um, look...

535
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,154
I don't mean to offend you.

536
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:23,156
I am just trying to understand
the dynamic here, Mr. Hanson.

537
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,577
I'm trying to help.

538
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,871
Why is it whenever
you people try to help,

539
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,290
it starts with insults?

540
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,164
I don't know why
she didn't tell me,

541
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,964
but she was 18,
and I chose to trust her.

542
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,836
I chose wrong.

543
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,556
Okay, well, um,
how about... your wife?

544
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,141
Did your daughter talk to her?

545
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,555
Do you talk to your mother?

546
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,099
Her name is Annie?
Is she here?

547
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,517
She's in the bedroom.

548
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,231
Good. I'd like
to speak to her.

549
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,726
Be my guest.

550
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,352
Thank you.

551
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,821
- Bedroom's just this way?
- That way.

552
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,034
- Jane?
- Yeah.

553
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,949
You don't mind, right?

554
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,697
Hey, you don't need
my permission.

555
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,199
You're an adult.

556
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,294
Barely.

557
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,251
(sighs)

558
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,303
(crying)

559
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,970
BEN:
Jane?

560
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,689
(crying continues)

561
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,670
I'm-I'm really sorry.

562
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,542
(clears throat)

563
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,967
(knocking at door)

564
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,312
(exhales)

565
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,777
Hey.

566
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,746
(sobbing)

567
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,880
(sighs)

568
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,375
(clears throat)

569
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,469
(sobbing continues outside)

570
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,143
(dog barking)

571
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,645
I'd like to tell you
it gets easier.

572
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,240
It doesn't.

573
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,079
If there's any...

574
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,075
comfort, it's...

575
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,918
getting used to the pain,
I suppose.

576
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,630
(bird singing)

577
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,594
Went to a grief seminar
in Casper.

578
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,511
Did you know that?

579
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,976
I don't know why.

580
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,769
Just wanted the bad
to go away.

581
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,235
Wanted answers... to questions
that couldn't be answered.

582
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,199
The counselor come up to me
after the seminar

583
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:50,116
and sat down next to me.

584
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,786
And he said something
that stuck with me.

585
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,247
I don't know
if it's what he said,

586
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,747
or it's how he said it.

587
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:08,847
He says, "I got some good news,
and I got some bad news."

588
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,888
"Bad news is you're never
gonna be the same.

589
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,854
"You're never gonna be whole,
not ever again.

590
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,770
"Your lost your daughter.

591
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,892
"Nothing's ever going
to replace that.

592
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,894
"Now the good news is,

593
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,899
"as soon as you accept that,
and you let yourself suffer...

594
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,000
"...you allow yourself
to visit her in your mind,

595
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,621
"and you'll remember
all the love she gave,

596
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,715
all the joy she knew."

597
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,181
Point is, Martin,
you can't steer from the pain.

598
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,268
If you do,
you'll rob yourself...

599
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,899
You'll rob yourself
of every memory of her.

600
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,069
Every last one.

601
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,487
From her first step

602
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,032
to her last smile.

603
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,663
Kill 'em all.

604
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,289
Just take the pain, Martin.

605
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,708
You hear me?

606
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,173
You take it.

607
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,680
It's the only way
you'll keep her with you.

608
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,308
I'm just tired, Cory.

609
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,350
You know, I just...

610
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,851
I'm so tired
of fighting this life.

611
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,562
What you do now
is for your boy.

612
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,813
MARTIN:
Hmph.

613
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,992
Drugs is his family now.

614
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,157
He's gone, too.

615
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,283
Lives right down the damn road,
but he's...

616
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,626
he's gone.

617
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,964
I expect they'll find out
he's involved in this somehow.

618
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,920
He's staying
with the Littlefeather boys.

619
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,547
Is that it?

620
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,390
- MARTIN: Yeah.
- (Cory grunts)

621
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,181
You're driving this Fed around
so she don't

622
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,178
get lost?
Is that it?

623
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,056
That's what
they asked me to do.

624
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,192
It's not what I'm doing.

625
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,281
Then what are you doing?

626
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,319
I'm a hunter, Martin.

627
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,539
What do you think I'm doing?

628
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,673
If you find out who did this,

629
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,090
I don't care who it is.

630
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,008
You understand me?

631
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,223
Right where they stand.

632
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,770
Then get off my porch
and go do it.

633
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,233
(door opens)

634
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,570
(door closes)

637
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,980
BEN:
Natalie's brother

638
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,896
lives here with Stan
and Bart Littlefeather

639

and a real piece of work
named Frank Walker.

640
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,737
Hanson kid's bad,
but the others are just...

641
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,781
stone evil,
so watch yourself.

642
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,951
Shouldn't we just maybe wait
for some backup?

643
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,120
Well... this isn't the land
of backup, Jane.

644
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,209
This is a land of
you're on your own.

Who are you?

652
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,622
Who the fuck are you?

653
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,415
I'm the FBI.

654
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,913
Are you Sam?

655
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,755
No.

656
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,419
You high right now, Sam?

657
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,966
How many times
have I arrested you?

658
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,135
Chief. What's up, bro?

659
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,599
Where's your brother?

660
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,556
He's in prison
where you put him.

661
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,146
What? No parole?

662
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,688
Well, look at that...
the justice system at work.

663
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,560
That reminds me.

664
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,983
My P.O. told me
to give you something.

665
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,607
I... I got it... I got it
right here. Let's see...

666
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,075
Wait. Let me see your hands.

(Jane panting)

698
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,464
The other two's outside
with Cory. Let's go.

699
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,050
JANE: He's-he's still alive.
We need to call the EMS.

700
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,717
EMS is an hour away.
Just... just

701
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,135
- leave him.
- JANE: Mm-mm.

702
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,099
He's not dead, Ben.

703
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,810
(labored breathing)

704
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,144

(exhales)

706
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,731
BEN:
Like I said,

707
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,820
let's go.

708
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,742

(coughing, sniffing)

710
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,410
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

711
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,914
BEN: The skinny one's
Natalie's brother.

712
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,383
- JANE: Who's the other one?
- That...

713
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,422
is a Frank Walker.

714
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,420
Won't your daddy be proud?

715
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,094
My dad's in prison, asshole.

716
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,841
I know. I put him there.

717
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,219
Tell me what happened
to your sister, Chip.

718
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,061
What?

719
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,852
BEN:
Don't play dumb.

720
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,100
About what?
What happened to her?

721
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,737
CHIP:
Huh?

722
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,902
What'd that cracker do, huh?

723
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,446
What... what cracker?

724
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,990
Was she seeing a white guy?

725
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,205
Do you know him?
Do you know who he is?

726
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,700
BEN:
Do you know his name, Chip?

727
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,620
You just said "was."

728
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,794
What did you say “was”?

729
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,010
Wh-Why did she say "was"?

730
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,174
She just said "was"!

731
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,090
Because I found her
raped and killed

732
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,389
right over there, son.

733
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,308
That's why.

734
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,273
No.

735
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,861
(sniffles)

736
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,651
(sobbing)

737
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,774
What?!

738
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,571
(continues sobbing)

739
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,328
(echoing shout):
What...?!

740
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,498
(wind whistling)

741
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,747
You go. I'm gonna get Chip
over to Lander

742
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,374
and see if he'll give me
the name of this boyfriend.

743
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,376
I'm telling you,
this is how we find him.

744
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,674
(chuckles): No, we go to where
he works or where he lives.

745
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,388
Yeah?

746
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,052
All right, well,
where does he work?

747
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,050
Where does he live?

748
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,395
You think this asshole's gonna
tell us anything? I don't.

749
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,765
Look, I know
you're looking for clues,

750
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,391
but you're missing
all the signs.

751
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,234
Come here. Let me show you.

752
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,025
See this here?

753
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,946
- This is a sled track, right?
- Okay.

754
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,068
Okay, you see out here
on the ridge?

755
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,695
Here.

756
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,822
Use these.

757
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:21,042
- Okay. -You see at the end
of the ridge here?

758
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,877
Follow my hand.
Can you see my hand?

759
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,715
- Yep. -Okay, when
I take it away, now look.

760
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,004
- Do you see that?
- Uh-huh.

761
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,968
- Can you see the shadow there?
- I think so.

762
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,382
The snow's starting
to cover it.

763
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,096
Now look up at the base
of the mountain there...

764
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,590
you see it go
up the ridge there?

765
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,012
You'll see it
a lot easier there.

766
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,885
You see those tracks go
up that mountain there?

767
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,388
- Yeah, I see it.
- All right.

768
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,686
Natalie's body was found
just past there. Right?

769
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,691
And someone unloaded a sled
right here,

770
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,109
drove all the way out there.

771
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,734
There's no tracks coming back...
why is that?

772
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:58,033
I'm telling you...
the answers are out there.

773
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,579
(sniffles)

774
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,749
Hey, look, um...

775
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,589
I don't know how
to do this, okay?

776
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,129
- I'm not a tracker.
- That's okay.

777
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,218
That's all I do.

778
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,175
(exhales sharply)

779
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,593
Look...

780
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,342
- you asked me to help you, right?
- Yeah.

781
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,515
We should go,
while I still can.

782
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,806
Okay.

783
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,329
(turns off engine)

784
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,828
Why are we stopping?

785
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,081
Well, we're
above the storm now.

786
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,084
The trees are
too thick to drive.

787
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,836
Got to walk from here.

788
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,759
Come on.

789
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,054
(clears throat)

790
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,470
- Put these on.
- Okay.

791
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,068
Now what?

792
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,654
We walk.

793
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,865
Follow these sled tracks
heading south.

794
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,279
- Ready?
- Yeah.

795
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,368
- All right, follow me.
- Mm. Okay.

We were on foot
the last half mile of it,

803
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,842
but we blazed a pretty good
trail in the snow, so...

804
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,561
I could take the boys
back up there if you want.

805
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,101
BEN: Well, I'll talk
to the BIA supervisor.

806
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,941
He just might want you
to do that.

807
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,402

All right.

812
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,071
Did... did the two we have
in custody say anything?

813
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,790
(chuckles softly) They ain't
the talking kind, Jane.

814
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,784
These kids,
they expect to go to prison.

00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,411
It's a rite of passage.

816
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,708
Hell, I think they look forward
to it... you know, uh,

817
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,049
three hots and a cot
and free cable.

818
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,215
Anything's better than being
here, the way they see it.

819
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,680
Let's just test their DNA
against the semen

820
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,595
and see what that tells us.

821
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,592
- Can I talk to them?
- JANE: No, Cory.

822
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,811
Anything they tell you
would be inadmissible in court.

823
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,475
And then anything you'd tell us

824
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,190
would render every net result
inadmissible as well.

825
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,604
What if I didn't tell you?

826
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,318
What if I just knew it?

827
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,857
(phone ringing)

828
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,855

829
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,857
(clears throat)
Yeah. Agent Banner.

830
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,450
Yes, sir. (coughs)

831
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,614
CORY:
Ben.

832
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,952
I've known this kid
since he could walk.

833
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,825
I gotta canvass the house.

834
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,295
The, uh, back door only locks
from the inside.

835
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,508
(engine idling quietly)

836
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,901
- Look at you.
- (laughs)

837
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,481
(scoffs)
Look at you.

838
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,699
I didn't do shit.

839
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,944
- (Cory chuckles)
- (clears throat)

840
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,288
All you've been doing is shit
for the last few years, Chip.

841
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,577
(laughs wryly)

842
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,291
It's this place, man.

843
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,661
Look what it takes from us.

844
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,038
What it took from you.

845
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,292
I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you that life's fair,

846
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,713
'cause it ain't.

847
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,177
To either of us.

848
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,467
But, you know,

849
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,307
- what do we do?
- (coughing quietly)

850
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,097
This land, land,

851
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,766
- this land is all we got left.
- What's this "we" shit?

852
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,730
Only thing native about you
is your ex-wife,

853
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,190
and the daughter
you couldn't protect.

854
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,856
Maybe if you'd
played detective...

855
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,195
(coughing)

856
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,940
That's not something
you get to talk about.

857
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,317
- (continues coughing)
- You hear me?

858
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,740
Go over there.

859
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,283
(sniffs)

860
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,086
You're gonna lecture me
about protecting people

861
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,956
while you deal the shit
that's killing them?

862
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,964
Unlike most people,
you had every chance

863
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,213
to get the hell out of here
if that's what you want.

864
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,555
You had the army,
you had college...

865
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,924
whatever, it was your choice.

866
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,767
Look what you chose.

867
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,561
Look what you chose.

868
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,561
Goddamn you.

869
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,315
I met him.

870
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,073
Yeah?

871
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,284
Yeah, the motherfucker
was almost as old as you.

872
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,323
All right?

873
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,618
I wanted to fight his ass, too.

874
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,583
But Natalie wouldn't let me.

875
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,954
(wry chuckle) Guess love
really is blind, huh?

876
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,253
He works security
on one of them drill sites.

877
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,723
Does the boyfriend have a name?

878
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,059
Matt. Matt something.

879
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,268
I don't know.

880
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,888
Who does?

881
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,855
Sam knew.

882
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,351
Why don't you ask him?

883
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,274
I think you'll be talking
to Sam long before I do.

884
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:08,491
You think this is
who I wanted to be?

885
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,820
Man...

886
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,160
I get so mad,

887
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,625
I want to fight
the whole world.

888
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,206
You got any idea
what that feels like?

889
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,963
I do.

890
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,005
But I decided to fight
the feeling instead.

891
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,350
'Cause I figured
the world would win.

892

JANE:
What did I tell you?

893
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,481
Did-did he say anything?

894
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,821
No, fuck, I don't... I don't...
I don't want to know.

You want to know how,

00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,662
I do, but...

951
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,161
Makes two of us.

952
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,256
I was, uh, working as, uh,
an outfitter in Pinedale,

953
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,126
and there was a big snow.

954
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,972
So I found myself
with a rare night off.

955
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,557
So I go to a motel,
call the wife

956
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,553
and say, "Why don't you come up
and stay for the night?"

957
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,975
And when you got two...
two kids

958
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,815
and you're on the mountain
half the year, it's...

959
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,731
you don't get much time
together.

960
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,072
So we had Emily
look after Casey.

961
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,316
He was five at the time.
She was 16.

962
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,989
I guess word got out

963
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,579
that we were out of town.

964
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,573
So some school friends
came over.

965
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,575
Then some more friends.

966
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,920
Then, uh...

967
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,630
and then some people came over
that weren't friends.

968
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:20,628
So a little gathering turned
into quite the party, I guess.

969
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,801
Then, uh...

970
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,017
I don't know.

971
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,354
You know,
there's a lot I don't know.

972
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,778
Got that phone call
the next morning.

973
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,363
(clears throat)

974
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,447

975
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,944
Saying that Emily was missing.

976
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,405
She was worried, naturally.

977
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,501
They were best friends.

978
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,589
You know, we tried to be
very careful with Emily.

979
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,835
Tried to plan for everything.

980
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,801
She was such a good girl.

981
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,722
But we let our guard down.

982
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,975
Really, I tell you,

983
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:20,400
you know,
you may have kids one day.

984
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,399
You cannot blink.

985
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,156
Not once, not ever.
(sniffles)

986
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:34,368
There was a guy moving sheep
over by the Wind River.

987
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,996
He's the one who found her.

988
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,590
Some 20 miles from our house.

989
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,086
They don't know how she got
there or what happened.

990
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,088
Autopsy couldn't tell us much,

991
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,093
'cause the coyotes got at her
pretty good.

992
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,596
<i>You know, I'm-I'm sor...</i>

993
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,224
I'm sorry, it's not...

994
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,477
I'm sorry.
(shuddering breath)

995
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,105
Could you point me, um...

996
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,607
towards your...

997
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,233
uh, the bathroom?

998
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,076
Straight back there.

999
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,161
Thanks.

1000
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,577
(exhales, clears throat)

1001
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,076
(sniffles)

1002
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,704
(grunts, exhales)

1003
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,126
(exhales)

1004
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:24,047
(shuddering breaths)

1005
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,898
JANE: "There is a meadow
in my perfect world..."

1006
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,189
CORY:
Emily wrote that.

1007
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,195
It's what got her accepted
into the summer writing program

1008
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:51,070
at Colorado State.

1009
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,993
Did she write it to you?

1010
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,622
Mm.

1011
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:01,043
Doesn't matter who it's to.

1012
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,712
Just matters who it's from.

1013
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,137
Look, I'm sorry about, um,

1014
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,804
earlier tonight.

1015
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,643
I guess...

1016
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,890
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

1017
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,894
And I don't really know what
the Hanson boy told you, but...

1018
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,897
I don't want to stumble
into something like today

1019
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,898
if I can help it.

1020
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:31,653
So, you know,
if he said something that...

1021
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:35,327
I should know,
I'd appreciate if you shared.

1022
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,495
Well, all he said was that

1023
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,584
Natalie's boyfriend
was named Matt.

1024
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,955
And you've already figured out
who that is, so...

1025
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,835
You could've called
for that information, no?

1026
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,837
I wanted to know
why you're helping me.

1027
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,510
Now I do, so...

1028
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,929
Tomorrow...

1029
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,554
do you think we could not ride
the snowmobiles

1030
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,554
80 miles an hour?

1031
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,431
Yeah, sure.

1032
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,775
If you want to end up in a
ditch we could've jumped over,

1033
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,610
- but...
- (chuckles)

1034
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,604
Great. (chuckles)

1035
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,606
Okay.

1036
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,530
You win.

1037
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,028
Have a good night.

1038
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,404
All right.

1039
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,658
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1040
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,410
(door opens)

1041
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,173
(engine shuts off)

1042
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,677
You're shaking more
than she is.

1043
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,646
It's cold enough to freeze
a well digger's ass out here.

1044
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,891
- Yeah. Below zero, I bet.
- Yeah, six below.

1045
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,767
It's a lot colder up there.

1046
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,315
Hey, bud.

1047
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,733
Hey. How are you doing?

1048
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,482
What are you doing here?

1049
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,279
Those tracks that lead
from the Littlefeather house

1050
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,653
to the body, I'm gonna follow
'em, see where they go.

1051
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,324
- How about you?
- BEN: Yeah, well,

1052
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,537
Jane's the only one
with jurisdiction out there.

1053
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,033
Just wanted
a few extra badges along.

1054
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,876
You want to walk 'em
through this?

1055
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,791
Uh, sure, yeah. Um...

1056
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,130
the drill station has cameras
all along its perimeter,

1057
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,966
so we're hoping one of
the cameras caught something.

1058
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,758
And, uh, we'll also canvass
Matt Rayburn's trailer,

1059
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,756
and see if there's anything
that links him to the assault.

1060
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,804
Do you have a warrant?

1061
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,267
I'm gonna ask real nice.

1062
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,479
Can't get there
from the Littlefeather house?

1063
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,145
Uh, it's a real tough sled ride
through two canyons,

1064
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,142
and I ain't looking
to dig you out,

1065
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,019
- so I wouldn't recommend it.
- BEN: We'll take

1066
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,487
the refinery road around.

1067
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,026
See, you got to drive 50 miles
to go five.

1068
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,024
- JANE: Yeah.
- Welcome to Wyoming.

1069
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:37,699
Didn't you people get the memo
that it's-it's spring?

1070
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,911
(chuckling)

1071
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,906
- Come on, guys.
- If you find anything,

1072
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,453
you call me on the radio...

1073
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,247
- Sure will.
- ...we'll come up to you.

I was, uh, about to ask you
the same thing.

1093
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,069
No, he got in a fight with his
girlfriend a couple days ago.

1094
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,732
She took off.

1095

He took off after.
We haven't seen him since.

- When was that?
- Three days ago.

Hell, we-we didn't know
what to do.

1098
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,777
We've been waiting on corporate
ever since to tell us

1099
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,779
whether or not to fill out
his termination papers

1100
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,201

- DILLON: Everything okay?

1101

CURTIS:
Yeah, yeah. Here about Matt.

1102
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,460
You find him? Is he okay?

1103
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,453
- What happened to you two?
- DILLON: What's that?

1104
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,876
You look a little torn up.

1105
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,874
Yeah, well, you hit

1106
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,125
one of these pine branches
doing 60,

1107
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,673
see what happens to you.

1108

01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,389
comes with the territory.

1110
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,474
You should try using,
uh, face shields.

1111
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,309
(chuckles)
I requested helmets.

1112

"Snow's soft, ain't it?"

Corporate's in Texas.
What can I tell you?

Does Matt bunk here
on the property?

1115
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,403
Yeah. Yeah, we all do.

1116
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,032
- Can we see his trailer?
- CURTIS: Yeah, sure.

1117
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,526

So, did, uh...

1130
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,033
did something happen to him?

1131
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,701
Do you know where he is?

JANE: That's what we're trying
to find out.

1133
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,793
His girlfriend filed
a Missing Persons Report.

1134
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,753
Well, how can that be?
I thought you guys found her

in a snowdrift
right before the storm.

Excuse me?

1137
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,962
I heard her name
go out over the radio

1138
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,801
- when you guys found her.
- I don't remember

1139
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,340
using her name.

1140
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,849
Well,
maybe you weren't listening.

1141
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,352
What the fuck are you doing?

1142
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,516
What?

1143
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,519
Why are you flanking me?

1144
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,483
- DILLON: What are you talking about?
- EVAN: What the fuck

1145
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,103
you think I'm talking about?
You got us on three sides...

1146
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,946
Get your hand off that weapon.
This is private property.

1147
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,861
- Put the fucking gun down!
- (overlapping shouting)

1148
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:49,858
- Hold it right there!
- Put the fucking gun

1149
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:50,905
- down right now!
- JANE: Hey!

1150
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,368
- Put it down! Do it!
- (overlapping shouting)

1151
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,283
- Drop to your knees right now!
- Do it!

1152
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,327
Turn away from me!
Drop to your knees right now!

1153
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,575
- Evan! -Fuck you! This is
a Department of Energy lease

1154
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,997
on reservation land, asshole!

1155
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,041
- You're breaking the law
by being here! -Hey!

1156
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,413
This is leased land
on a reservation, Deputy!

1157
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,757
- You got no authority!
- You think I don't know what

1158
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,376
- you're doing?! -Fucking do it,
asshole! See what happens!

1159
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,923
Hoka hey, white boy, let's go.

1160
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,091
GUARD:
What are we doing?

1161
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,213
Deputy,
you've got no authority!

1162
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,715
You're in violation
of federal law!

1163
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,842
- Lower your weapon!
- EVAN: Fuck you!

1164
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,220
- You got us in a crossfire!
- Talk to me! What do I do?

1165
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,767
Hold your ground! County
sheriffs have no authority!

1166
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,311
- All right, everybody,
just take it easy! -FBI! Hey!

1167
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:28,109
FBI! This is federal land,
and I am the only authority!

1168
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,606
Okay?!

1169
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:33,736
Right now,
all of you stand down!

1170
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,488
Okay? Everyone.

1171
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,662
We're all working
towards the same goal here,

1172
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,082
and I need you to back down

1173
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,502
and take your hands away
from your weapons.

1174
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,842
Look.

1175
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,132
Dillon, holster your weapon.

1176
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,015
Fucking decaf, man.

1177
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,725
Jesus fucking Christ.

1178
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:01,517
You keep these assholes
in check, lady.

1179
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,810
We're just doing
our fucking job here.

1180
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,056
Yeah, when we show up,

1181
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,025
- your job is over, asshole.
- BEN: Evan!

1182
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,519
Holster your weapon, now!

1183
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,521
All right. Every one of you
step to my left.

1184
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,240
- Let's go. -Nobody behind me.
Do you understand?

1185
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,359
- You got it, asshole. Guys...
- Yeah.

1186
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,986
...step my way!

1187
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,613
Everybody take a big,
deep breath here, please.

1188
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,662
- MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.
- JANE: Deputy,

1189
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,751
- holster your weapon.
- EVAN: You didn't see it?

1190
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,996
Now, or you're under arrest.
Do you understand me?

1191
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,713
(panting)

1192
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,548
You didn't see it.

1193
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,634
(exhales)

1194
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,983
Take us to Matt's trailer.

1195
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,068
Yes, ma'am.

1196
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,774
(bird calls)

1197
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,077
(engine roaring)

1198
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,169
- (radio beeps)
- Ben, you COPY?

1199
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,637
Ben, do you COPY?

1200
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,188
Ben.

1201
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,951
This is it, right here.

1202
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,286
Does he bunk with anybody?

1203
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,373
Yeah. Me and Pete Mickens.

1204
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,866
Is Pete in there now?

1205
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,709
Yeah. He's sleeping.

1206
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,703
He's got the night shift.

1207
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,548
(Jane sighs)

1208
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,640
(knocking at door)

1209
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,149
(knocking resumes)

1210
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,572
Can I help you?

1211
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,577
Uh, yeah, I'm... I'm looking
for my knight in shining armor.

1212
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,045
I think this is his trailer.

1213
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,539
Well, um... (laughs)

1214
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,882
Shit. I'm a little short
on armor, you know?

1215
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,717
Um, I don't mind.

1216
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,336
- You don't mind? Yeah?
- Uh-uh.

1217
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:42,216
Do you have any idea
how good it is to see you?

1218
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,968
- Like, any idea? Man, oh, man.
- (Natalie laughs)

1219
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,515
How did you get here? I didn't
hear your carriage pull up.

1220
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,139
Well, my, uh...

1221
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,561
carriage wanted to catch
the 8:00 show in Lander...

1222
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,776
- (laughing) -...so she dropped
me off at the turnout.

1223
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,362
- What'd you do? You just walked
in the snow, huh? -Mm-hmm.

1224
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,356
- Like Superwoman.
- Well, I think you're worth it.

1225
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,233
- You think I'm worth it? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1226
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:02,110
Would you get your ass in here?

1227
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,658
You're, like, baddest woman
on the planet, you know that?

1228
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,084
(whispers):
Goddamn.

1229
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,876
- How about New York?
- Oh!

1230
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,543
- (Natalie laughs)
- You'd hate New York.

1231
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,713
You'd hate it.
You go a whole month there,

1232
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,929
your... your feet never touch
anything but cement.

1233
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,718
Okay, how about Chicago?

1234
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,342
Hmm, shit. Baby, it's the
same thing as New York.

1235
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,969
- It's just colder, you know?
More crime. -Mmm.

1236
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,971
- If you're into that kind of thing.
- (Natalie laughs)

1237
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:33,350
You think that's funny? Yeah?

1238
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,852
All right,
how about Los Angeles, hmm?

1239
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,274
Hey, listen to me.

1240
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:38,772
Do never, ever say that word
around me again.

1241
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,068
(laughing):
Oh. What? It's warm there.

1242
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,736
Yeah, I'd rather be in Iraq.

1243
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,235
Iraq's warm.

1244
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,906
Mm.

1245
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,950
And I'll tell you what.
l got one.

1246
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,244
- Mm-hmm.
- I got one.

1247
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,869
I was, uh...
I remember I was stationed

1248
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,746
- up at this place called
Point Mugu, right? -Mm-hmm.

1249
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,999
It's about an hour north
of L.A. It was Christmas.

1250
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,466
I woke up, I'm all alone.

1251
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,960
You know, I don't have anybody,

1252
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,631
and what the Navy does
at Christmastime

1253
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,675
is they have these dumb
little skits in the mess hall,

1254
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,343
you know, for the guys
without families.

1255
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,137
And I wasn't gonna stick around
for that bullshit,

1256
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,680
so I just... I got in my truck,

1257
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,428
and I hightailed it
out of there,

1258
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,602
and I wound up in this little
mountain town called Ojai.

1259
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,226
And I get there,
and it's like...

1260
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,648
it's, like, fruit farms
and vineyards,

1261
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,237
and there's this mountain
surrounding it, you know,

1262
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,856
like, protecting the town.

1263
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,483
And the people there are,
like...

1264
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,906
- Everybody smiles at
each other, you know? -Yeah?

1265
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,450
And they say hello,
and it's, like...

1266
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,744
I remember thinking
that they were all, like...

1267
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,243
I don't know. They had
these looks in their eyes.

1268
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,119
Like they were in
on some sort of a secret,

1269
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,292
like they had all
figured it out.

1270
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,040
There's this mission,
this Spanish mission

1271
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,417
right there
in the middle of town.

1272
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,088
They're having Christmas Mass.

1273
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,802
They're celebrating Christmas

1274
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,093
in 70-degree weather,
you know, and I just went,

1275
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,090
and I picked me up an orange
off a tree,

1276
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,183
and sat down on a bench
and listened

1277
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,100
to that choir sing,
eating my orange, you know.

1278
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,939
It was... I don't know.

1279
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,401
It was the best Christmas
I ever had.

1280
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,690
I want to live there.

1281
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,239
Okay.

1282
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,580
- Let's live in Ojai.
- Okay.

1283
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,993
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

1284
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,367
(snowmobile engines
approaching)

1285
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,462
- (man whooping loudly)
- (man shouting)

1286
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,752
What time is it?

1287
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,171
I thought they were staying
in town tonight.

1288

1441
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,000
Hey, Curtis!

1442
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,711
Behind trailer three!

1443
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,206
(grunting)

1444
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,293
(grunts)

1445
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,762
Aah!

1446
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,926
(groaning)

1447
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,813
(grunts)

1448
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,563
- (gun chamber clicks)
- (groans)

1449
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,189
(panting)

1450
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,362
(groaning)

1451
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,827
(panting)

1452
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,747
(footsteps approaching)

1453
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,873
(Jane gasps)

1454
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:03,343
- You okay?
- Mm. Mm.

1455
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,928
Let's get you inside.

1456
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,676
(Jane panting)

1457
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,980
(Jane groans)

1458
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,020
Mind if I have a look?

1459
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:21,112
I... (groans)

1460
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,775
It's...

1461
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,445
I see a couple rounds
went through here.

1462
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,239
It's just pieces.
You should be okay.

1463
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,157
There. Let's see.

1464
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,497
Let's see here.

1465
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,786
(Jane inhales sharply)

1466
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,250
- Okay.
- (Jane groans)

1467
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,798
(wind whistling)

1468
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,302
(Jane groans)

1469
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,592
(Jane shivering)

1470
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,056
- Yeah, hold that. Press it tight.
- (Jane gasps)

1471
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,470
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

1472
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,434
Okay.

1473
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,895
(Cory sighs, Jane groans)

1474
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,060
(Cory sighs)

1475
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,775
Okay.

1476
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,360
(Jane groans loudly)

1477
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,070
(exhales)

1478
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,485
(both panting)

1479
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,358
Give...

1480
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,781
Give me your radio.
(panting)

1481
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,654
My best chance out of here...

1482
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,075
(clears throat)

1483
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,165
...is a helicopter.

1484
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,159
You don't have one of those,
do you?

1485
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:20,788
- Nope.
- Hey.

1486
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,425
Hey, give me your radio.

1487
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,670
Go get him.

1488
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:30,968
I won't bring him back.

1489
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,966
You have to know that.

1490
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,685
I do.

1491
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,351
Go get him.

1492
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,527
PETE:
Whoa.

1493
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,321
(loud panting,
footsteps running)

1494
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,785
(grunting and panting)

1495
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,999
(panting)

1496
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,833
(footsteps running)

1497
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,248
(grunting)

1498
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,463
(snowmobile engine approaching)

1499
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,923
(grunting)

1500
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,807
(whimpering)

1501
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,694
(grunting)

1502
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,163
(bird singing)

1503
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:40,493
(loud rumbling)

1504
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:50,593
(gasps)

1505
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,805
(panting)

1506
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,764
(gasps)

1507
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,350
Come on! Come on!

1508
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,720
- (twig snaps)
- (whimpers)

1509
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,813
(grunting)

1510
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,899
- (panting)
- (branch creaking)

1511
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,397
(panting)

1512
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,445
(grunts)

1513
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:13,909
(wind whistling)

1514
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,199
(yelling)

1515
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,577
(whimpering)

1516
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,995
CORY:
You know where you are?

1517
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,538
(sighs)
No.

1518
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,286
It's Gannett Peak.

1519
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,788
(Pete panting)

1520
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:27,505
Highest mountain in Wyoming.

1521
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,502
And on the hottest day
in August,

1522
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,924
shovel a foot of snow.

1523
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,218
Today...

1524
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,012
too cold to snow.

1525
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,930
(groans)
Look, man, let's just...

1526
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:40,519
let's just talk
for a minute, all right?

1527
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,355
Let's just... talk. Please.

1528
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,815
Sure.

1529
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,899
(Pete sighs, pants)

1530
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:52,064
(groaning, whimpering)

1531
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,039
What the fuck?!
Where are my boots?!

1532
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,250
- Where are my boots?!
- You know, I got all

1533
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,835
the time in the world here.

1534
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,999
- Can't say the same for you.
- (whimpering)

1535
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,044
So we gonna talk,
or you gonna keep whining?

1536
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,917
(panting)

1537
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,589
Look, I'm...

1538
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,133
I have made mistakes, okay?

1539
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,928
So what'd you do?

1540
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:22,269
(panting)
Um...

1541
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,684
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm not the law here.

1542
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,684
I'm just a guy
sitting in front of you.

1543
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,152
So you can tell me the truth.

1544
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,737
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give you a chance.

1545
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,106
Ah, you just listen to me!

1546
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,608
You know what it's like

1547
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,110
out here in this frozen hell?

1548
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,740
There's no nothing to do.
No nothing.

1549
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:46,334
Ain't no women, no fun!

1550
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,579
Just this fucking...
this fucking snow

1551
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,422
and the fucking silence.

1552
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,291
That's all!

1553
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,260
My family's people
were forced here,

1554
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,471
stuck here for a century.

1555
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,806
That snow and silence...

1556
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:02,267
it's the only thing that hasn't
been taken from them.

1557
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,888
- So what'd you take?
- I don't know.

1558
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,811
I don't know.
I don't know what you...

1559
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,400
I don't know what you mean.

1560
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:12,611
You take something, too?

1561
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,696
(crying):
No.

1562
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,567
- Nothing.
- Ah.

1563
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,748
Hey.

1564
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,712
I need you
to be honest with me.

1565
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,706
- (Crying)
Right?

1566
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,377
You get drunk?

1567
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,299
Get lonely?

1568
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,923
Then what'd you get?

1569
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:44,347
If you did it,
just be a man and say it.

1570
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,311
Say, "I raped her."

1571
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,522
I raped her.

1572
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,891
I raped her! Yeah!

1573
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,649
(Pete crying)

1574
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,612
And the boyfriend?

1575
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,410
What, did he get in your way?

1576
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,952
Did you beat him to death?

1577
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:09,917
Look, a nod's
not gonna cut it, okay?

1578
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,662
- Need you to say it.
- We beat him.

1579
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,131
We made him dead.

1580
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,176
Okay.

1581
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,138
(Cory sighs)

1582
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,978
Please don't.
(panting)

1583
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,224
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1584
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,101
(panting, whimpering)

1585
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,944
It's okay.

1586
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,529
(COW grunts)

1587
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:40,024
Free to go.

1588
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,577
Where?! Where am I gonna go?!

1589
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,196
I'm a man of my word.

1590
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,996
You told the truth.

1591
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:52,619
I'm gonna give you a chance.

1592
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,872
I'm gonna give you
the same chance

1593
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,714
that she got.

1594
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,334
What...
what chance did she get?

1595
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,301
What... what chance
did she get?

1596
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,217
If you can make it
to that highway,

1597
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,056
you're a free man.

1598
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,267
Where-Where's...
where-where is the highway?

1599
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,136
You know how far
that drill camp was

1600
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,513
from where
I found Natalie's body?

1601
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:11,889
No.

1602
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,141
Six miles. Barefoot.

1603
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,360
(sighs)

1604
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,854
That's a warrior.

1605
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,490
That's a warrior.

1606
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,736
You? You may make 600 feet,
but...

1607
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,613
- Uh...
- ...you better get going.

1608
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:30,661
But... (groans)

1609
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:34,412
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1610
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,459
What do you want me to do?!

1611
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,208
I want you to run.

1612
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,879
(yells)

1613
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,969
(groaning)

1614
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,770
(groaning)

1615
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,859
(whimpering)

1616
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,616
(grunts)

1617
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,486
(groaning)

1618
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,792
(groaning)

1619
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,208
(grunts)

1620
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,508
(grunting)

1621
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,517
(coughs, groans)

1622
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:35,140
(loud wheezing)

1623
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:42,104
(loud wheezing)

1624
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,198
(wind whistling)

1625
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:58,210
(wind whistling)

1626
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,590
(monitor beeping steadily)

1627
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,767
How you feeling?

1628
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,852
I feel okay.

1629
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,978
I got you something.

1630
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:23,149
Thought maybe it'd give you
a little taste of home.

1631
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,896
(laughs)

1632
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,524
(breaths deeply)

1633
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,572
Little crocodile.

1634
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:32,071
(weakly):
Please don't make me laugh.

1635
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,416
It's an alligator.

1636
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:39,787
He'll protect you, better than
that bulletproof vest, right?

1637
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,254
(chuckles)

1638
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,718
I shouldn't joke about that...
it saved your life.

1639
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,472
You saved my life.

1640
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,268
Well...

1641
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:04,061
Jane, you're a tough woman.

1642
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,404
You saved your own life.

1643
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,195
We should both be honest.

1644
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:10,316
I just...

1645
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:11,659
(exhales)

1646
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,199
I got lucky.

1647
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,075
Well, you know,
luck don't live out here.

1648
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,372
Luck lives in the city.

1649
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,502
Don't live out here.

1650
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,919
You know,
that's whether you get,

1651
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,467
you know, hit by a bus or not.

1652
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,057
Whether your...
bank is robbed or not,

1653
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:36,051
or whether someone's...
on their damn cell phone

1654
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,304
when they come up
to a crosswalk... that's luck.

1655
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:39,896
That's winning or losing.

1656
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:43,062
Out here, you survive
or you surrender. Period.

1657
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:46,983
That's determined by your
strength and by your spirit.

1658
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,945
Wolves don't kill unlucky deer.

1659
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:53,034
They kill the weak ones.

1660
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,870
You fought for your life, Jane.

1661
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:00,997
Now you get to walk away
with it.

1662
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,332
You get to go home.

1663
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,216
(Cory chuckles)

1664
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,510
I know what you're doing.

1665
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:23,056
I'm gonna read to you
from a magazine.

1666
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:25,483
(Cory sniffs)

1667
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,729
"Ten Signs That He's Into You."

1668
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,608
Things that
I really want to know.

1669
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:35,906
"He looks you in the eye
when he speaks."

1670
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,531
Ain't you supposed to do...

1671
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,497
(trembling breath)

1672
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,042
She ran six miles in the snow.

1673
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,294
(Jane crying)

1674
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:50,166
Yes, she did.

1675
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,726

Just made it up.

1700

'Cause there's no one left
to teach me.

1701
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,863
I was ready to quit.

1702

Which is never good.

1704
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:56,504
But today it was.

1705
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:02,711
First time Chip's called me
in over a year.

1706
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,428
Where is he?

1707

The station.

1708
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,265
I was gonna go pick him up

1709
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,234
(laughs): as soon as I washed
this shit off my face.

(sniffs)

1711
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,656
Heard about what happened.

1712
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,078
Heard there's one
still missing.

1713
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:30,663
No.

1714
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,205
No one's missing.

1715
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:41,295
How'd he go out?

1716
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,346
With a whimper.

1717
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:56,769
You better go easy on Chip.

1718
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:59,938
Suffering's hard on young men;
they don't have our practice.

1719
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,403
I should go get him.

1720
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:08,989
Yeah, but I...

1721
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,283
just need to sit here...

1722
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,621
...and miss her for a minute.

1723
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,583
You got time to sit with me?
