1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,231
Yes!

3
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,779
Fuck you!
Somebody get over here.

4
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,348
Back up! Back up!

5
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,491
All right. Spread out. Ready?

6
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,819
Whoo!

7
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,464
Uh, uh, uh.

8
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,133
Excuse me.

9
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,636
Yo, is anybody working or, uh...

10
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,004
You know what you want or what?

11
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,607
Yeah. Can I get three
snoogans prerolls?

12
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,310
$100 even.

13
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,212
Right.

14
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,116
Can you...

15
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,455
Keep it down.

16
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,806
What 'cha looking at, man?

18
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,110
That's how we did it
in the '90s, son!

19
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,661
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.

20
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,198
Your whistling is
affecting your carrying.

21
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,739
Pretty nifty planning.

22
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,244
The fuck?

23
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,080
Oh, uh... well,
'cause, um,

24
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,881
nifty is slang for nft,

25
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,951
which is a non-fungible
token in our world.

26
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,620
"Our world"?

27
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,355
Oh, my god, I knew it.

28
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,033
You belong to one of
these religious death cults

29
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,301
where they all wear
sneakers to bed

30
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:05,993
before they kill themselves.

31
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,961
For the last time, randal,

32
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,097
I'm not in a
religious death cult.

33
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,166
Block chain Coltrane
and I are co-founders

34
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,101
of the Christian crypto club.

35
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,510
<i>This is either a lord
of the rings thing</i>

36
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,679
or a Jesus thing.
Hmm.

37
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,286
Block chain says that
Jesus saves souls,

38
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,055
but we buy souls, it's...

39
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,824
It's pretty clever wordplay

40
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,826
because the phantasma
chain's cryptocurrency unit

41
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,728
is called the soul, so...

42
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,262
It's...

43
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,864
You are killing me
this morning, you nut.

44
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,433
Oh, shit,

45
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,202
I think I get it now.

46
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,571
Get what?
Nfts and crypto?

47
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,872
No, not that
beanie baby bullshit.

48
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,608
Talking about this pair of puds.

49
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,345
Looks like Elias has
got his own silent Bob.

50
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,650
Oh, this is quite a hand job.

51
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,824
What?

52
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,926
Jesus, these gen z
kids are fucked.

53
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,762
Oh, what a surprise.

54
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,131
Randal has taken the lord's
name in vain again, Mr. Dante.

55
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,566
Please stop calling me
Mr. Dante.

56
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,502
You're 36-years-old.

57
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,036
And not for nothing,

58
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,547
but how's it taking
the lord's name in vain

59
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,340
if I don't pray
to your Christian god?

60
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,642
If you don't pray to god,
then who do you pray to?

61
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,945
When I'm at my lowest,
I always pray to crom.

62
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,247
Who's crom?

63
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,848
That's con an
the barbarian's god.

64
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,383
You know what, randal?

65
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,152
I really wish you
didn't worship all your

66
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,454
false comic book idols
and satanic superheroes.

67
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,491
Batman, the avengers,
wonder woman, aoc.

68
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,194
Come on, man,
give crom a chance.

69
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,329
He may not be all woke
and shit like Jesus,

70
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,432
but homeboy's pretty
metal for a deity.

71
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,368
Well, joke's on you, randal,
because there's only one god.

72
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,737
Yeah. What about Thor?
Thor's a god.

73
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,673
Thor is a fictional character
who flies through outer space.

74
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,941
So is your god.

75
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,242
Mr. Dante.

76
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,782
His god is the living
Christ, randal.

77
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,112
His god is the living dead

78
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,780
with all that goth-y shit like,

79
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,550
drink my blood. That's
fucking vampire talk.

80
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,051
Mr. Dante!
Oh, no.

81
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,987
My name is foo-foo and
this is between you two.

82
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,028
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, freeze.

83
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,999
What the fuck are these?

84
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,736
Kites.
No shit.

85
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,371
But what are they doing here?

86
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,240
I thought we could sell them.

87
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,477
Are you serious? Who
the fuck flies kites anymore?

88
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,778
Lots of people.

89
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,514
Kids today love flying
kites. Kites are cool.

90
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,716
What century is
this, Ben Franklin,

91
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,551
and what kind of kid
in this day and age

92
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,153
would be remotely interested

93
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,655
in buying or flying
a fucking kite?

94
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,059
Did you see they have
Jesus on them?

95
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,062
Oh, well, all the
kids love Jesus.

96
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,563
Who in their right
mind is gonna buy

97
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,765
one of your creepy Christ kites?

98
00:09:58,866 --> 00:09:59,968
I would.

99
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,169
You did, like, 30 times.

100
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,671
Maybe we can sell some online.

101
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,073
Online?

102
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,641
The only way anyone
on the Internet

103
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,409
would care about
this old-timey bullshit

104
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,445
is if you shot a
tiktok trying to jam

105
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,615
one of those Jesus kites
up your Christian dick hole.

106
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,452
Asshole.
Thank you.

107
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,263
You know what, randal? I
don't think there's anything

108
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,456
particularly "metal"
about blasphemy.

109
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,026
Shah, blasphemy and
biting off a bat's head

110
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,028
are as metal as it gets.

111
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:32,199
There were two men who
were crucified with Jesus, randal.

112
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,867
Holy fuck.

113
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,203
A good thief and a bad thief.

114
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,538
If they were caught, I'd say

115
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,072
that makes them both
bad thieves.

116
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,841
The bad thief said,

117
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,210
"if you are really
the son of god,

118
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,812
"get us down from here
and save us."

119
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,848
So why is this guy
called "the bad thief"?

120
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:50,584
Call him "the practical thief
with common fucking sense."

121
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,353
Ah. But the good
thief said,

122
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:57,926
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

123
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,193
What the fuck are butt thieves?

124
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,063
Uh, well, then
the good thief said,

125
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,432
"Jesus, remember me
in your kingdom."

126
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,334
And Jesus said
to the good thief,

127
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,103
"today, you shall be
with me in paradise."

128
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,339
And paradise is a strip club.

129
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,541
It's not a strip club, randal.

130
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,644
It's heaven.

131
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,981
So the moral of your
never ending story is,

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,649
even in heaven, it's
all about who you know.

133
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,152
The moral of the story

134
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,287
is if you didn't go to
heaven as a guest of Jesus,

135
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,555
like the good thief,

136
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,457
where did the bad
thief go, randal?

137
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,492
Not that I wanna
prolong your sermon,

138
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,996
but how is it blasphemy
to remind a guy

139
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,463
he's the son of god?

140
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,332
Maybe the bad thief thought

141
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,072
<i>Jesus had a bourne
identity thing going on,</i>

142
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,368
like Jesus fell off a boat,

143
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,236
hit his head and caught amnesia.

144
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,272
He was born in a manger.

145
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,041
Now he's bourne again.

146
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,477
Matt Damon is Jesus bourne in...

147
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,546
The bourne nativity.

148
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,448
Heavenly father, I beseech thee,

149
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,883
please smite
this braying heretic.

150
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,653
Oh.

151
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,024
Are you okay?

152
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,994
No, something's wrong, I...
I can't catch my breath.

153
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,127
Stop teasing me.

154
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,463
I'm not teasing, I...

155
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,298
I can't catch my breath, man.

156
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,934
Really? Should I try
mouth stuff?

157
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:15,069
What is this, a tinder
date? Get off of me.

158
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,570
You said you can't breathe.

159
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,040
I can breathe. I just...

160
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,240
I can't catch my breath.

161
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,451
What are you doing
with your arm?

162
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,143
I'm trying to breathe.

163
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,946
You're really sweating, randal.

164
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,313
It's hot in here, man.

165
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,915
Can we open the door?
I got to...

166
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,918
Mr. Dante!

167
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,487
Oh, shit!

168
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,756
I need an ambulance
at the quick stop.

169
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,995
<i>Dr. Ladenheim,</i>

170
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,696
<i>report to the er.</i>

171
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,331
<i>Dr. Ladenheim...</i>

172
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,067
You had to call an
ambulance, didn't you?

173
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,903
I just ate too much
fuckin' mooby's, that's all.

174
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,171
Well, if you know what's wrong,

175
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,839
then I guess I can go home.

176
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,341
Are you the doctor?

177
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,943
I'm the doctor.

178
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,079
Dr. Ladenheim, I'll be
your savior this evening.

179
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,084
What in the fuck?

180
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,484
I apologize for my wardrobe.

181
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,286
I just came from a costume ball.

182
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,555
Listen, doc,
I'm okay. I just...

183
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,524
I can't catch my breath is all.

184
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,225
On a scale of one to ten,

185
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,469
how bad would you say
your pain level is?

186
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,361
My pain level?

187
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,796
Like a negative three.

188
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,431
Well, you're doing it all wrong.

189
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,808
You're supposed to be
in a lot of pain

190
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,434
when you have a heart attack.

191
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,170
Wait a minute.
I had a heart attack?

192
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,637
No, that's not what I said.

193
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,257
You misunderstood me.
Oh, thank Christ.

194
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,425
You're having a heart attack

195
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,308
right now as we speak,

196
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,844
a massive one, so we
have to act pretty quickly.

197
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:33,014
I just wish I wasn't
so hung over.

198
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,049
I'm kidding.

199
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,817
I'm gonna go get all glammed up

200
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,494
for our big date and
I'll see you in the or.

201
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,886
Look at me.
Uh-huh.

202
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,364
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

203
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,456
Good. All right.

204
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,324
He's not gonna make it.

205
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,560
<i>Jesus, could someone
page the good witch?</i>

206
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,695
What's next, a fucking munchkin?

207
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,033
Shave and a haircut two bits.

208
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,768
Shave and a haircut two bits.

209
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,997
I see
that you met Dr. Ladenheim.

210
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,943
And she wants me to
prep you for surgery.

211
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:05,512
Surgery? No. The doctor
just said I'm going to the or.

212
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,748
Right! Which is short
for operating room

213
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,684
where they do... Ding,
ding, ding, surgery!

214
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,552
She gotta get into your heart.

215
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,588
Uh, is the doctor gonna
crack his chest open?

216
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,590
Fuck.
No, no, no.

217
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,367
She's gonna thread a camera
through his femoral artery

218
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,827
up to his ticker through
a very small incision.

219
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,896
Where does
she make this incision?

220
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:23,997
In the groin.

221
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,766
The groin?
Come on.

222
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,477
So I gotta shave you.

223
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,103
Or I get to shave you,

224
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,939
depending on how much you
love your job and I love mine.

225
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,842
<i>So, as the wife says at
10:00 P.M. after dateline,</i>

226
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,344
every single week,

227
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,846
take off your pants.

228
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:52,459
I gotta shave your groin,
sir, so underwear too.

229
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,661
First, can we
establish geography?

230
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,596
Like, where is the groin to you?

231
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,299
Where's the groin to me?

232
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,968
What is this,
a metaphysical question?

233
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,204
We're running out of
time here to save your life.

234
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,304
So come on, let's go.

235
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,341
Can you avert your
eyes, block your ears

236
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,977
and sing something, please?

237
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,280
Oh, for god sakes. What
do you want me to sing?

238
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,713
Not you, him.
Oh, right.

239
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,482
All right, here's the deal,

240
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,117
<i>nurse Jackie.</i>

241
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,651
Mmm.

242
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,686
I got a really small dick, okay?

243
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,756
I promise you, it's
nothing I've not seen before

244
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,226
because I work in pediatrics.

245
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,793
If I take off my underwear,

246
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,230
everyone in the er is
gonna see my little dick

247
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,932
including my friend here,

248
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,775
who thinks I got a giant cock
'cause I've been lying to him

249
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,701
about it since we were 12.

250
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,636
Is this a long fable, aesop?

251
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,948
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,

252
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,974
give you a little
more privacy...

253
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:42,109
There you go.
Oh, thanks for that.

254
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,947
Unfortunately, this is
as far as you can go

255
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:49,116
but we do have a waiting
room that's right down this hall.

256
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,419
I'll be right here
when you get out, man.

257
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,588
You got this.

258
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,504
We've got a female with multiple

259
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,207
c-spine complications,
internal bleeding

260
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,541
and multiple lacerations.

261
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,911
Blood pressure,
100 over seven...

262
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:24,185
We're
losing her. Starting cpr.

263
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,128
Why has he still

264
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,829
got his underpants on?

265
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,232
How am I supposed to
get to his femoral artery

266
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,733
if he's wearing squeezies?

267
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,335
I told him,

268
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,745
but he's got some
body shame issues.

269
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:43,981
Look, doc,

270
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,373
I got a really small dick.

271
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,974
I'm trying to save your life

272
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,517
and you're worried
about your little dick?

273
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,210
We don't have time for this.

274
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,677
Whoa!

275
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:54,447
This is all my fault.

276
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,516
No, it is not, Elias.

277
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,853
I prayed to god to smite randal

278
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:04,292
so Jesus attacked his
heart at my command.

279
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,428
Randal's mother
had heart trouble, too.

280
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,399
No, I gotta
make Jesus reverse this.

281
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,267
Pray with me,
Mr. Dante.

282
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:19,506
Oh, my sweet savior,
hear your gentle servant.

283
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,609
Spare the heretic
I damned in jest.

284
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,478
Remember the words
of the good thief.

285
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,747
Jesus did no wrong,

286
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,018
whereas we are but thieves.

287
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,854
A-ha.
What's up, doc?

288
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,557
I can tell by your
very subtle tattoo

289
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,825
that you're a superhero fan,

290
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,328
so you might appreciate this.

291
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,628
Uh-huh.
You know,

292
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,230
they have a name for the type

293
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:44,507
of heart attack you're
having right now.

294
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,933
Really? Okay.

295
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,935
They call it the widow-maker.

296
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,104
Now, doesn't that
sound like some bad guy

297
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,505
<i>that ranger danger has to fight?</i>

298
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,674
Why do they call it
the widow-maker?

299
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,476
Because in 80% of the cases

300
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,113
when there's 100% occlusion
like what you have now?

301
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,283
Hands down, patient
always dies, always.

302
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,918
Oh, fuck.

303
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,752
But don't worry, you're
gonna be in the 20%

304
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,289
because keeping you
alive is good for my brand.

305
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,024
Now, if you excuse me,

306
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,259
I'm gonna go fool around
in your little crotch

307
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,928
and I'm gonna make
a little magic,

308
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,997
but I could use all the
help that we can get.

309
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:17,630
So, if you remember any prayers

310
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,532
from when you were a kid,

311
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,810
now would be a terrific
time to dust those off.

312
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,206
Are you there, crom?

313
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:26,974
It's me, randal.

314
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,243
<i>Please don't let me die.</i>

315
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,980
He won't answer me.

316
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,018
After all this time...

317
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:40,653
Devoting my life to god.

318
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,025
Jesus has abandoned
all of us at quick stop.

319
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,328
I think Jesus was always
more of a wawa guy.

320
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:50,897
Yeah, well,
you know what I think?

321
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,635
I think I wasted my
life believing in bullshit.

322
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,138
I've been conned.

323
00:18:57,238 --> 00:19:00,274
Fairy tales, faith
and pledging fealty

324
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:04,145
to a fictional fucking
phantom. And for what?

325
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,313
In my darkest hour
when I need him most,

326
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,983
the lord totally ghosts me.

327
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,554
Well, to hell with all
that made up Jesus jive.

328
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:20,560
Save randal this night,

329
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,130
and I will swear my soul to you,

330
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,167
oh, sweet Satan.

331
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,834
Satan? Oh,
buddy, no.

332
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,604
I mean, isn't he kind of like
the optimus prime of evil?

333
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,573
You don't have to
condescend to me.

334
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,342
You can just say Megatron.

335
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,978
<i>I'm kind of
a transformers virgin.</i>

336
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,381
Well,

337
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,249
I'm an actual virgin,

338
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,617
so I know Satan's
gonna want my soul.

339
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,154
For what?
Evil.

340
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,092
And butt sex probably.

341
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,229
Do you have any lube?
Are you...

342
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:56,663
No!

343
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,765
I don't deserve lube!

344
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,700
Take me, Satan!

345
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,169
Jesus! Pull up
your pants.

346
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,904
Make me your concubine! Jesus...

347
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,406
Pull up your pants.
No, stop it.

348
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:06,941
I have to fuck Satan.

349
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,511
And that's when, I shit you not,

350
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,746
Luke fuckin' Skywalker shows up.

351
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,425
Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about

352
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:18,385
<i>the young, fuckable Luke
from return of the jedi,</i>

353
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,122
<i>not the gran Torino,
"get off my lawn"</i>

354
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,790
<i>- Luke from the last jedi.
- Okay.</i>

355
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,658
Quick heart update,
Mr. Graves.

356
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,727
Uh-huh.
During your thorough

357
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,497
<i>retelling of
the star wars show...</i>

358
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:31,198
<i>The Mandalorian, season two.</i>

359
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,134
I was able to get
the stent in place.

360
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:34,935
So this is where
I need your help now.

361
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,779
I'm gonna open this stent
and all you have to do

362
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,105
is tell me when you feel

363
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,907
the pressure lets up.
All right?

364
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,808
Let's do this, mcdreamy.

365
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,444
"This is the way."

366
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,979
The way to what?

367
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,615
<i>Oh, that's a saying
from the Mandalorian.</i>

368
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,117
<i>Huh?
The star wars show.</i>

369
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,919
Okay, listen,
we need to hit pause

370
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,796
on all your pop culture
references for a minute

371
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,490
just until we open
the stent on three.

372
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,226
One, two, three!

373
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,961
Oh!

374
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:05,132
Holy shit, I can
fucking breathe again.

375
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,967
Does this mean
I'm gonna live now?

376
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,103
Yes, because
I'm an amazing doctor.

377
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:12,006
You're a better doctor
than doctor strange

378
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:15,109
and doctor zaius
combined. Doctor who?

379
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,077
Oh, no, I don't watch that show,

380
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:21,115
but I might start now
because I'm fucking alive.

381
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,585
<i>"Mazel tov!"
As the Chinese say.</i>

382
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,920
Thank you, doctor.

383
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,389
Thank you for saving my life.

384
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,358
You're like the Batman of
heart surgery.

385
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,792
Yeah?

386
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,137
With great power

387
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,462
comes great responsibility.

388
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,164
What the fuck was that?

389
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,336
- You're alive!
- You're alive!

390
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,737
Are you okay? If that
was a heart attack,

391
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,942
I'll take another one. That
shit was easy.

392
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,843
Okay, you must be on
a lot of drugs right now.

393
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,879
No, they didn't give
me nothing in there.

394
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,548
I had to do the
whole thing sober.

395
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,451
He's high as a kite on fentanyl.

396
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,087
Kite imagery, very cool.

397
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,755
See, randal,
kites are in the air.

398
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,325
Stop with the fucking kites.

399
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:06,002
One
more thing, Mr. Graves,

400
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,895
since you were really
preoccupied about it,

401
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:13,167
so much so that you
wasted time and nearly died,

402
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,102
your penis is not that small.

403
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,304
It's not that big,
but it's not that small.

404
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,341
That's the
best news I heard all day.

405
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,447
Is he gonna be okay?

406
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:27,715
How do I help?

407
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,149
Well, if you care about him,

408
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,218
you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

409
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:33,721
The guy's got more cholesterol
in his arteries than blood.

410
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,257
Got it. From now on, I'm
only gonna order him food

411
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,857
off the vegan menu at mooby's.

412
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,693
Him and you.
Me?

413
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:40,995
If you're around his age

414
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,795
and eat the same diet
as your friend,

415
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,864
you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

416
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,667
Will do.

417
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,144
But here's something
I want you to keep

418
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,137
an eye out for
as regards to randal.

419
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:51,405
Okay.

420
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,741
Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

421
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,442
after they've had
a heart attack.

422
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,554
Now your friend might sound
or act differently now because

423
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:00,047
he's come face to face
with his own mortality.

424
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,616
So, for the next few months,

425
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,718
do whatever you can do

426
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,787
to help randal
keep his spirits up.

427
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,089
All right?

428
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,392
Now, my bill is in the mail.

429
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:17,797
Judgy.

430
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,582
I brought you a hat.

431
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,151
Yeah. Thanks.

432
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:39,996
I can't believe
you're still awake

433
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,388
after the day
you've been through.

434
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,325
Yeah, I can't sleep.

435
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,294
There was only a 20% chance

436
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:50,597
I was gonna make it out
of that or alive tonight.

437
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,533
Hmm. Is that right?

438
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,369
I mean, I figure I got
a 50-50 chance of dying

439
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,438
any time I leave my apartment.

440
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:00,240
But today,

441
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:04,044
there was an 80% chance
everything for me

442
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,013
was just gonna stop.

443
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:09,116
There was an 80% chance

444
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,296
<i>you and I were never gonna
talk about star wars again.</i>

445
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,154
There was an 80% chance

446
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,855
I would never know
for a medical fact,

447
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,258
I got a normal-sized dick.

448
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,060
You always said it was huge.

449
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,528
I was gonna miss a lot of shit

450
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,931
if you didn't call
that ambulance today.

451
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,634
You saved my life, man.

452
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,236
Oh.

453
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,972
I wish I had a life
worth fucking saving.

454
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,073
Come on, man.

455
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,509
What are you talking about?

456
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,777
When I was lying there,

457
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,480
wondering if I was gonna die,

458
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,350
I saw the whole movie of
my life flash before my eyes.

459
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,320
You know what?

460
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,089
It sucked.

461
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:53,994
I always thought, hoped...

462
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:58,065
That my life was building
towards something.

463
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,300
Turns out it was
just the hospital.

464
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,602
What are you talking about?

465
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,704
We built our own business.

466
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,373
So I co-own a
convenience store. Big deal.

467
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:09,176
I never went anywhere
outside of Jersey.

468
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:11,378
I never fell in love like you.

469
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:13,180
If I'd have
dropped dead tonight,

470
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,316
only you and Elias would
remember I even existed.

471
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:20,354
I mean, look at me,
man, I'm almost 50.

472
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:22,156
I sit around and watch the same

473
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:24,291
stupid movies over and over.

474
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:28,262
The fuck is wrong with me?

475
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,931
I don't know.

476
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,599
You know so much
about all that stuff.

477
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,002
I always thought you could
have made a cool movie.

478
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,211
Holy shit.

479
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:46,346
You're right.

480
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:52,186
I could make
a pretty cool movie.

481
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:54,755
I've been watching
movies all my life,

482
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,657
I've seen all these
people tell their stories

483
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,526
and never once thought
about trying to tell mine.

484
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:00,961
Well, fuck that, man.

485
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,563
Since I almost died tonight,

486
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,132
now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

487
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,167
So, no more watching movies

488
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,136
because when
I get out of here...

489
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,140
I'm gonna make a movie!

490
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,781
A movie?

491
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,625
Don't you have to go to
film school or something?

492
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:26,286
It's like 75 g's a year
to go to nyu film school.

493
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,923
And you know what those
kids pay all that money for?

494
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,258
I don't know.
To watch movies.

495
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,261
I worked in a video
store for 20 years

496
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,563
where I sat around and
watched movies all day, too.

497
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:40,234
So basically, I went
to my own film school.

498
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:43,303
Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

499
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:45,506
doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

500
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,508
Tell that to Quentin Tarantino.

501
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,610
Oh, now you're
Quentin Tarantino?

502
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,380
I'm not saying I'm gonna
make a movie as good as him,

503
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,182
but I'm not good at sex either,

504
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,961
and that doesn't stop me
from trying to get laid.

505
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,661
You wanna shoot a movie here,

506
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,396
at the quick stop?

507
00:27:09,496 --> 00:27:11,441
Yeah, I've seen convenience
stores in flicks before,

508
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,400
but I've never seen
an entire flick

509
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,135
set in a convenience store.

510
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,803
Because who would
wanna watch that?

511
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:19,139
I mean, it's my life and
I barely wanna live it.

512
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,808
This movie's meant
to memorialize my life.

513
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,210
And since I spent the last

514
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,654
30 years of my life
working here...

515
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,246
Oh. Working?

516
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,382
I got plenty of
convenience stories

517
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,183
to put into a screenplay.

518
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:32,152
<i>Convenience stories.
Good title.</i>

519
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:33,955
Well, what kind of
convenience stories

520
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,422
are we talking about here?

521
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,457
Remember the time we went to

522
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:40,193
Julie dwyer's funeral and
you knocked the casket over?

523
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,229
You knocked the casket over.

524
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,097
I did?

525
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:45,866
Well, that's a scene now.

526
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,610
Or how about the time
the old guy was jerking off

527
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,336
in the bathroom
and dropped dead?

528
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,204
That's totally a scene, man.

529
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:53,007
I mean, all the shit
you and I have said

530
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,308
sitting at this counter,

531
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:55,842
these are all scenes now, man.

532
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,554
How about the time you
burned the store down?

533
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,179
Is that gonna be a scene?

534
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,456
I'm still pretty sure
terrorists did that.

535
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,682
Uh-huh.

536
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,116
Hey, hey!

537
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,752
Motley crew neck.

538
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,323
Anyone in your
Christian crypto club

539
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:12,259
got a non-crypto camera
we can borrow?

540
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,028
It's called the crimson
crypto club now.

541
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:16,597
Our first drops gonna
be all crypto kites.

542
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,465
Oh, put that shit
away, elon muskrat.

543
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,233
What do you guys
need a camera for?

544
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,536
Mmm. Randal
wants to make a movie.

545
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,204
Ooh, like a pornography movie?

546
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,106
No, like a movie-movie,

547
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,308
one with actors and a screenplay

548
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:30,110
and crafty.

549
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,511
What's crafty?

550
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:33,146
That's where the,
uh, crew hangs out

551
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:34,414
and practices witchcraft,

552
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:36,316
you little devil worship per.

553
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,251
Cool.

554
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,989
Crafty is where you
find all the food on set.

555
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,298
But if you're shooting in here,

556
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,092
I guess the whole
store's crafty.

557
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,759
What's the movie gonna be about?

558
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,403
Mmm, it's gonna be
about an hour and a half.

559
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:48,930
I hate long movies.

560
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,398
It's about him working here.
- Wow.

561
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,467
Meta. Never seen
a whole movie

562
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,135
set in a convenience
store before.

563
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,971
Right? Thank you.

564
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,007
I'm gonna fill the script
with all the weird shit

565
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,187
me and Dante have ever said

566
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:01,308
or seen around here

567
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,776
over the years.
Oh.

568
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,354
You should put in that
stuff you used to say

569
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:05,779
about the death star
contractors.

570
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,548
Get sued
by Disney? Fuck that.

571
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,617
Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

572
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,719
other movies. I want
it to be about me.

573
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,488
It's my flick,
so I wanna write about

574
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,124
the things that I do.

575
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:18,558
Like, um, like how we
play hockey on the rooftop.

576
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,228
I've never seen that done
in a movie or a TV show,

577
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:23,597
even though it's
just fucking practical.

578
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:25,265
Remember that fight

579
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:26,476
where I hit you in the
face with the bread?

580
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,002
Ooh, that could be a scene.

581
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,904
Or the time I spit
water on that old guy?

582
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:32,339
That's, like, the
fucking opening scene.

583
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,008
Ooh, I got an idea.

584
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,828
Maybe Jay and silent
Bob could be characters.

585
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,345
That is the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

586
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,756
Well, you're still gonna have

587
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,248
to get them involved
if you wanna set

588
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,859
any of the scenes
in your old video store.

589
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,685
All right. Watch
the register, dawg.

590
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,454
We got to go talk to
the Warner brothers.

591
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,191
What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

592
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,061
Almost.
What happened

593
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:55,063
is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

594
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,263
when a rattlesnake came up

595
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,198
and bit me right on the asshole.

596
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,300
But like the good friend he is,

597
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,602
Dante sucked the poison out.

598
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:05,505
See? It happened
to them, too, man.

599
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,483
Well, listen, when we
thought you were dead, man,

600
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:09,543
I felt really, really bad

601
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,254
'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

602
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,612
in front of this
store and stuff,

603
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:14,848
I forgot to give you something.

604
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,692
<i>Dental school?</i>

605
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,296
Me and veggie dick
rented that shit in 1994,

606
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,797
but we never watched it

607
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,300
'cause we didn't have a VCR.

608
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,502
But now, you can
put it on the shelf

609
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,871
in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

610
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:40,942
Uh, the video store
closed ten years ago.

611
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,112
It did?

612
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:46,413
This was the video store.

613
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,187
Oh, yeah, I'm getting senile

614
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,846
and shit right there, you know?

615
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:57,858
So listen, how much
we owe you for late fees?

616
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:03,164
Uh, well, let's
see, a dollar a day for what,

617
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,466
26, 28 years?

618
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:12,572
That's, like,
approximately... $10,220.

619
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:15,776
Oh, didn't rewind.

620
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,413
$10,220 and 50 cents.

621
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,018
You take crypto?

622
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,585
You guys got crypto?

623
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,388
No.

624
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:29,756
If you never watched it,

625
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:31,591
why was it not rewound? Yeah.

626
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,928
Hey, asshole, I said
we didn't have a VCR.

627
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,797
We watched it. We
held it up to the light.

628
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:38,933
Fucking luddite.

629
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:41,035
Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

630
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:44,205
<i>on the 28-year-old copy
of dental school</i>

631
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:45,704
if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

632
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,075
Ooh, a pornography movie?

633
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:50,510
No, it's not a porno movie.

634
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,780
Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

635
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,385
'cause I am the clit commander!

636
00:31:58,485 --> 00:31:59,820
Snootchie bootchies.

637
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:31,418
Goodnight.

638
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,520
Thirty-seven?

639
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,792
That's not a scene, randal.

640
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,294
Stop writing it right now.

641
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,895
Thirty-seven cannot go
in your movie.

642
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:44,664
Shut the
fuck up. It's nighttime!

643
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,404
<i>"In convenience"?</i>

644
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:53,174
It's the story of my life.

645
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:55,276
Hundred and sixty-eight
pages full of dick jokes,

646
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,543
set in a convenience store,

647
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,378
written in one night.

648
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,248
Maybe don't tell
people that last part.

649
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,883
<i>I thought, you were gonna
call it "convenience stories."</i>

650
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:05,286
Yeah, that shit
sounded too precious.

651
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:06,620
What am I, Wes Anderson?

652
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,189
Not based on this script.

653
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:09,656
"There is only one return

654
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,993
"and it ain't of the
king, it's of the jedi."

655
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:13,627
- Hmm.
- Hey.

656
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:15,129
You said that same
thing about return

657
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:16,897
the day that guy
threw up in mooby's

658
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:18,632
and you made me clean it.
- Yeah.

659
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,043
Everything in the
script is something

660
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,369
either me or someone
I know said,

661
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:22,669
I just made up new names.

662
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,071
What am I, some kind of writer?

663
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,572
Ah, yes.

664
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,341
Block chain would
like to understand

665
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,643
why the two girls are
into this "Dan-t" character

666
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:31,946
when the Randy
character is much funnier.

667
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,546
Randy has been asking himself

668
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,116
the same question
his whole life.

669
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:36,816
What's wrong with Dan-t?

670
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:39,153
Read his first scene on page 37.

671
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,687
Are you kidding me?

672
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,199
I'm in this convenience
store way more than you,

673
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,423
but I don't come into your

674
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,259
convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

675
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,295
I had a lot of exposition to do.

676
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:48,828
"Enter Dan-t.

677
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,399
"A hideous fuckin' chud
of a man." What the fuck?

678
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:53,566
Well, maybe Dan-t's not you.

679
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:54,969
Do you ever think of that?

680
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:57,271
"Dan-t's hideous
fuckin' chud of a beard

681
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,473
"doesn't suggest Tony stark
so much as a male crack whore

682
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,209
"who is cosplaying
as Tony stark."

683
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,345
That's just in the
screen direction.

684
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:05,980
Nobody actually calls Dan-t

685
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,581
"a hideous fuckin'
chud." To his face.

686
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:09,783
I can't believe you made me

687
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,551
sign a non-disclosure agreement,

688
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,187
only to read that I'm not even

689
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,998
one of the main characters
in the story of your life.

690
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:16,523
I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,

691
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,023
but I thought I was
at least the han.

692
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,659
Oh, come on, I'm the han

693
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:20,839
and the Luke, right?

694
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,463
Then who am I, the Chewie?

695
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,166
I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

696
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:27,201
Unless this is empire
then I'm the lando

697
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,668
and he's the lobot.

698
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,071
I'm not even the lobot?

699
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:31,571
Which one's lobot?

700
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:32,815
He's the one with the
headphones who looks like

701
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,039
a dad who's trying to be a dj.

702
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,709
The bald fucker from be spin

703
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,220
who never says
nothing the whole movie.

704
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,180
Wouldn't that make
silent Bob the lobot?

705
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,849
No. Jay and silent Bob are
clearly the C-3PO and r2-d2.

706
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,790
I mean, they've been
here since the first movie,

707
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:46,753
which was the last
time they were cool,

708
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,688
but they've been with
the franchise so long

709
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:49,957
they still give them cameos

710
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,524
and put them on the lunchboxes.

711
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:55,262
So if I'm not Luke,
han, Chewie, lando,

712
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:56,863
the droids or the lobot,

713
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,665
<i>then who the fuck
am I in your star wars,</i>

714
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,667
Princess fucking Leia? No.

715
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,136
You're the dak.

716
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:04,537
Who the fuck is dak?

717
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:06,073
He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

718
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:07,841
in the battle of hoth.

719
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,410
You know, the guy who's ready

720
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,911
to take on the whole
empire himself

721
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,621
until the empire kills
the shit out of him?

722
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:15,782
Did dak even
get an action figure?

723
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,019
Not in the classic
kenner line, no.

724
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,719
Because?

725
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,465
Because he was deemed
unimportant to the story.

726
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,923
But that's just bullshit, man.

727
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:26,260
Without dak, Luke
could have never...

728
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,164
Like, dak was the only
guy that's, like, uh...

729
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:33,867
I mean, dak was plucky
as shit, man, just like you.

730
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,936
Uh, I have a question
about the script.

731
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,304
Great, more fuckin' notes.

732
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:39,073
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

733
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,875
Uh, I have a problem
with the friar fuck character,

734
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,610
who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

735
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,380
Friar fuck, uh, loves Jesus,

736
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,783
uh, to what appears to
be an unhealthy degree.

737
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,385
And?

738
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:54,088
And Elias is a born
again satanist.

739
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:56,023
Because it was Satan
who saved you

740
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,591
when my prayers fell
on the deaf ears of Jesus,

741
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:00,660
the giant jerk off.

742
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,363
All right, listen
up, friar fuck.

743
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:03,763
I get that you just broke up

744
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,732
with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

745
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,734
and clearly you're going
through some couture

746
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,437
and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

747
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,372
But for the first 36
years of your life,

748
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,341
you were into Jesus
to an unhealthy degree,

749
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:17,610
and that's the Elias
that I based friar fuck on.

750
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,413
Then this script
is based on lies.

751
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:20,880
Welcome to the movie biz.

752
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:23,583
There's no truth in this art!

753
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,851
Jesus.

754
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,555
Everyone's a critic.

755
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:28,888
So, what do we do next?

756
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,723
What are you asking dak for?

757
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,527
Well, I can't do this alone.
I need a producer.

758
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,563
That's your job.
Me?

759
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,364
What do I know about producing?

760
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,145
Come on. I'm already
writing and directing.

761
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,700
I can't do everything, man.

762
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,769
All right. What does
a producer do?

763
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,506
Just build us a schedule,
keep us under budget,

764
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:48,175
secure a dp,
and most importantly,

765
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:49,809
find us financing.

766
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,879
What, I gotta get money, too?

767
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,348
How much are we
talking about here?

768
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:56,517
Mmm, 25 grand.

769
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,420
$25,000?

770
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,123
Well, technically, it's $27,575

771
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,023
but it would be way more
if we were in Canada.

772
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,559
Where the fuck
am I supposed to find

773
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:06,893
that kind of money from?

774
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,695
We can find that kind of cash.

775
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,830
What? How?

776
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,509
We launch our crypto
kite nfts next month.

777
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:13,867
<i>So the crimson crypto club</i>

778
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,145
<i>could have a lot
of money to invest</i>

779
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,703
if the crypto kites fly.

780
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,439
Again with the fucking kites.

781
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,975
Guys, we need real loot
to make a real movie,

782
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,110
<i>not your make pretend
matrix money,</i>

783
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,246
you fuckin' kite fucker.

784
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,656
I'm sick and tired of the kite
killing attitude around here.

785
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,354
Anyway, back to the budget.

786
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:34,830
What if we took out a
loan against the store?

787
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,190
A loan?

788
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,058
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we just

789
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,702
slow down a minute
and think about this first?

790
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:41,728
Slow down?
I almost died, man.

791
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,364
It doesn't get
any slower than that.

792
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,066
I'm not getting all
"Dante" about this.

793
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,800
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

794
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:49,262
You're the guy
who can never decide

795
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,005
whether to shit
or get off the pot.

796
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,140
Well, I don't have
time for that anymore.

797
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,142
From now on,
I'm gonna shit bricks

798
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:57,178
or what's the point
of being here?

799
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:58,379
So, come on, man,

800
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,680
get behind me
when I shit for once.

801
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,284
So I can what, wipe your ass?

802
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:06,496
You know, I don't wanna get
all "Dante" about this,

803
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,089
but find someone else
to take your shit.

804
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:31,579
Well, well, well, here he is.

805
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,380
The escape artist.

806
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:38,052
<i>I sit on your grave.</i>

807
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,955
Didn't we have
that movie at the video store?

808
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,957
<i>I spit on your grave.</i>

809
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,857
Hicks, you spit on
my grave in a dream,

810
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,493
you better wake up
and apologize.

811
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:47,794
Ah...

812
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:50,030
So this is a dream.
Uh, if it is,

813
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,832
then you need to learn
to dream bigger.

814
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:54,168
I mean, really,

815
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:55,835
this is the best
that you can do?

816
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,172
A cemetery?

817
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:01,675
You can't dream us into sex...

818
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,244
On the beach...

819
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,146
In Hawaii?

820
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:08,649
Like you'd wanna
have sex with me now.

821
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:10,718
I'm an old man.

822
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,087
I'll have you know
that being dead only

823
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,589
increases your sex drive.

824
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,627
The dead live to fuck.

825
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:21,562
So you have sex
in the afterlife?

826
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,097
Hell's yeah.

827
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,165
There's nothing to do
in heaven except fuck.

828
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,534
That's what makes it heaven.

829
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:29,937
I can't believe my wife's
having sex with dead people.

830
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,272
Famous dead people.

831
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,107
I'm on the celebrity
circuit now.

832
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,051
Bullshit. Name one famous
person you fucked in heaven.

833
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:37,077
One. Okay.

834
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:41,115
I have knocked boots with
the ghost of Cleopatra, sir.

835
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,350
Oh.
And miles Davis

836
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,086
and Frederick
douglass, together.

837
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,323
George Washington...
What?

838
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:51,158
Carver.
Oh.

839
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:52,778
You know how much
I love peanut butter.

840
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,728
True.
Who else?

841
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,163
Um, Carl sagan.

842
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,465
Oh!
A real thinker.

843
00:39:58,565 --> 00:39:59,799
Um...

844
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,670
Malcolm X.

845
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,339
Malcolm triple x.
Oh, settle down.

846
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,108
And I'm sure you're letting
them all go ass to mouth.

847
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,544
Uh, yeah, they're famous.

848
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,086
You think I want
this, don't you?

849
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,090
You carrying the torch for me?

850
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,826
I told you how I feel
about romantic love, Hicks.

851
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,495
Oh, I remember.

852
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,131
You were very convincing. Mmm.

853
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,233
Right up until the day
I proposed.

854
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,471
We only knew each other
for, like, 15 minutes.

855
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,541
You've been mourning me
for, like, 15 years.

856
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,841
So what do you want me to do?

857
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,876
You want me to just
forget about you?

858
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:46,413
You were all
I ever dreamed about.

859
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:48,282
Both of you.

860
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,884
Now...

861
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:56,223
God, I'm so alone.

862
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:00,294
I know.

863
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,597
I know losing me and grace...

864
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:05,999
Broke you.

865
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,937
But you don't know
how lucky you have it.

866
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,538
What?

867
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,908
The book of life is
closed for the two of us.

868
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,578
But you... can still
turn a page.

869
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:20,581
You get to keep writing
the story of your life.

870
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,584
Why bother without you?

871
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:27,054
Because there are
more tales to tell, Hicks.

872
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,491
As long as you're alive,

873
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:33,293
you can always
start another chapter.

874
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:39,266
So live while you can,
love while you can.

875
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,903
God damn it.

876
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,540
Dream bigger.

877
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:52,146
That all sounds pretty romantic

878
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:55,082
coming from a girl who
doesn't believe in romantic love.

879
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,050
I don't believe
in romantic love.

880
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:59,119
That's my girl.

881
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:02,689
But I do believe in you.

882
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:33,530
Hey, I wanna thank you
guys for having me here today.

883
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:36,290
I've always wanted
to be an actor.

884
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,691
Nice.

885
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:42,396
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

886
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,198
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

887
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,966
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

888
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:48,836
I'm not even supposed to
be here today.

889
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:53,383
I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

890
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,975
I'm not even supposed

891
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,479
to fucking be here
to fucking day, fucks.

892
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,448
Oh, shit! I thought
that was the police.

893
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:03,183
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

894
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:05,385
By the power of grayskull,

895
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:11,058
I am not supposed
to be here today!

896
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,526
Hey, I'm Joe.

897
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,261
Uh, I'm 45-years-old,
recently divorced,

898
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,430
and I figured I'd give
this shit a go. Uh...

899
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,532
I am not even supposed
to be here today.

900
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,568
Damn right.

901
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:23,871
Uh...

902
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:25,907
Lion face.

903
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,575
Lemon face.

904
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:32,479
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

905
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,414
Um...
A little about me.

906
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:36,918
I'm known professionally
as Boston John.

907
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,652
<i>That's a nom de plume.</i>

908
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:42,456
Uh, Robert De Niro is
my fuckin'... Lone star.

909
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:44,691
You know what I'm saying?
Close your eyes. Just...

910
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,694
Close your eyes. Just
listen. Ready? All right?

911
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,964
I have nipples, Greg.

912
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:51,966
Could you milk me?

913
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:54,735
Fuck, that is one,
bitch. All day.

914
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,905
Can you give me one
like Schwarzenegger?

915
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,339
I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

916
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:01,875
But can you, uh,
Pacino that shit?

917
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:02,977
Ooh-ah!

918
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:04,645
When, lord?

919
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:08,148
When will I see
the god damn sailboat?

920
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:13,053
That came from a real
deep personal place.

921
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,454
I have a bfa.

922
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:16,123
Uh, I'm a theater
background actor.

923
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:18,125
As an actor with
a theater background,

924
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:20,028
I was classically
trained in New York.

925
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,828
Have you actually thought

926
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,172
about going musical with
this? 'Cause it could be...

927
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:26,700
Supposed to be here.

928
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:33,407
Hah, hoo, hah.
Yeah-cha!

929
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,243
Kick ball change and
snap, snap, jazz hands.

930
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,478
That is beautiful, man.

931
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,448
Freddie prinze Jr.

932
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,986
"I'll fuck anything
that moves."

933
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,021
Wait, wait a minute, man,
is this a porno?

934
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,990
I'll fuck anything that moves.

935
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,357
I'll fuck anything that moves.

936
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:51,993
I'll fuck anything that moves.

937
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,372
That's a little bit
in your face.

938
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,128
Let me try it
like this, hold on.

939
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:57,106
Can I borrow your underpants
for about ten minutes?

940
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,699
I'll fuck anything that moves.

941
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,901
And, fool,

942
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,436
I always carry a machete.

943
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,772
I'll fuck anything that moves!

944
00:45:05,872 --> 00:45:07,608
Sounds like the guy
I buy weed from.

945
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,977
You know what this movie needs?

946
00:45:09,077 --> 00:45:11,478
Deez. Deez nuts!

947
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:13,513
Can I just offer you
a piece of advice?

948
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:15,315
You know what this
script needs right here?

949
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:18,019
Like an old lady
that says curse words.

950
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,853
Holy shit.

951
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,689
Who wrote this garbage? His
mother should be ashamed.

952
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,996
The fuck?

953
00:45:28,096 --> 00:45:30,230
He's auditioning
for silent bill.

954
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,635
<i>I don't know if you know
sound of music,</i>

955
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,412
the marionettes were
the best part of that.

956
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,941
I think that's why
they won oscars.

957
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,775
It's worth thinking about

958
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:45,178
maybe doing the whole
movie with marionettes.

959
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,089
Take your heart pills, tin man.

960
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:56,757
Hey.

961
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,592
So, how's it going
with the financing?

962
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:00,227
You raise my money, yet?

963
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,595
If it's your money,

964
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:03,064
then how come
I have to raise it?

965
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:04,698
That's Hollywood.

966
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,134
Did you finish
reading the script?

967
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,300
Last night.

968
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:09,137
And? It's funny,
right?

969
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,972
It's funny,

970
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:13,607
but it was like my entire
life flashed before my eyes.

971
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:16,144
My life flashed
before your eyes.

972
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:18,612
I was glad you left
some stuff out.

973
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:21,748
So, uh...

974
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:24,052
Which one of these guys
gets to play me?

975
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:25,352
Well, the guys are too young

976
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,254
and hot to play you.
What the fuck?

977
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,091
And nobody's nearly
funny enough to play me.

978
00:46:30,223 --> 00:46:31,463
So then, what are you gonna do?

979
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:34,194
I'm gonna play my part myself.

980
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,342
All right, already,
we're closing. Gee whiz!

981
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:52,412
Why? You're highly
offending me!

982
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:55,049
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Jesus.

983
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:57,250
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closed.

984
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,852
It's me, randal.

985
00:46:58,953 --> 00:47:01,555
<i>Huh. Cool. Blade
runner, I like that.</i>

986
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,790
<i>Thanks. What's
a blade runner?</i>

987
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,927
Can we get back to you
acting in a movie

988
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:08,495
that you're directing even
though you've never acted in

989
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:10,064
or directed a movie before?

990
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,565
It worked for Orson welles.

991
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,266
You're not an actor.

992
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:14,668
Neither was Howard stern,

993
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:16,636
but he acted in the
movie about his life.

994
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:18,017
If you call that acting.

995
00:47:18,106 --> 00:47:19,539
You think you can do better?

996
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,775
<i>Better than Howard stern
did in private parts?</i>

997
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,477
It's not a high bar.

998
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:25,947
Great, because
you're playing Dan-t.

999
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:28,682
What? No, no, no.
I'm not. I can't act.

1000
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:30,218
You're as good
as any of the jokers

1001
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,785
we saw at 1the audition.

1002
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:34,354
Besides, if I'm gonna
play me, you gotta play you.

1003
00:47:34,454 --> 00:47:36,323
You have to do this, Mr. Dan-t.

1004
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:37,624
Oh, for god's sakes,

1005
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,659
please stop calling me
Mr. Dan-t.

1006
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,695
That's another thing.
Fuck all the fake names.

1007
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:44,165
<i>What is this shit, mad magazine?</i>

1008
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,466
Randal is playing randal.

1009
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:50,570
Dante is playing Dante,
aka Mr. Dante,

1010
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,740
and Elias is playing Elias.

1011
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,308
I'm in the movie, too?

1012
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:57,410
Yup. And as a satanist
playing a Christian,

1013
00:47:57,511 --> 00:47:59,446
you've gotta act the most.

1014
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,782
It's my very own chance...

1015
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,350
To transform.

1016
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,819
And transform you
shall, Bumblebee.

1017
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,990
Soon as Mr. Dante
secures our fuckin' financing.

1018
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,625
Yo, it's too bad you didn't
marry that Emma chick,

1019
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,493
the one with the big clit.

1020
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:15,896
Wasn't she like some kinda
car wash heiress or something?

1021
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:17,198
Can you focus?

1022
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:18,765
Even if we do play ourselves,

1023
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,625
you still got to cast
all the customer parts.

1024
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:24,138
Why am I casting customers
to say all this stupid shit

1025
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,806
when I still see
the real customers

1026
00:48:25,907 --> 00:48:27,707
who said all the stupid
shit in the first place

1027
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:30,278
come in here every day?
They can do it.

1028
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:32,213
Oh, my god, you can't just turn

1029
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:34,015
regular people into movie stars.

1030
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:37,251
No inch, no inch, no inch!
Smokin' weed.

1031
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,685
Smokin' weed!

1032
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,121
Pack of wraps, my good man.

1033
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:41,581
Time to kick back,
drink some beers

1034
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:42,990
and smoke some weed.

1035
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,293
You own a whole weed store.

1036
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:46,793
Hey, randal, I've got an idea.

1037
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:49,663
What if Jay and Bob
play Jay and Bob?

1038
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,934
Well, we can
ask 'em. Yo.

1039
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:55,368
Yo use guys want to
be in my movie?

1040
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,271
Ooh, a pornography movie?

1041
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,906
It's not a porno movie.

1042
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:00,686
It's the movie we're
shooting in your store.

1043
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,177
That movie?
You still ain't done?

1044
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,012
We haven't even started yet.

1045
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:08,615
I don't know. Who would
we be playing in this movie?

1046
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:10,393
Well, it's these two
characters I kind of based

1047
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,419
on you and Maggie Simpson here.

1048
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:14,821
Check out your first scene.

1049
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:16,857
These guys aren't real actors.

1050
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:19,193
But they are real fucked
up and I could work with that.

1051
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,229
This doesn't sound
like me at all.

1052
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,662
What are you talking about?

1053
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:24,598
All the shit in there
is all the stuff

1054
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,101
I've personally heard
you say around here.

1055
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,702
I do not talk like this, man.

1056
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,604
Why do you have me
saying stupid shit like

1057
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,340
"snootchie bootchies"
all the time?

1058
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:33,975
I'll tell you what.

1059
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,110
If you guys play
yourselves in the movie,

1060
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,612
I'll let you guys be in
charge of crafty, too.

1061
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:40,747
So what's crafty about?

1062
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:43,683
Well, in addition to being
the comic relief in the movie,

1063
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:46,153
you'd also be in charge
of all the food on set.

1064
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:48,256
Ooh, we learned about food prep

1065
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:51,192
back when we ran
the fucking cock smoker.

1066
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,692
Wasn't that place
just a drug front?

1067
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:55,363
No, we had drugs in the front

1068
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,564
and drugs in the back.

1069
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:58,976
So if Elias is playing Elias

1070
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,767
and these dopes
are playing themselves,

1071
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,387
who are you gonna get
to play Veronica?

1072
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,803
Well, funny you should ask,

1073
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:05,839
'cause earlier today
I sent the script

1074
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,841
to someone who
will be absolutely...

1075
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:10,111
Perfect to play Veronica.

1076
00:50:11,811 --> 00:50:14,648
Who the fuck do you
people think you are?

1077
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,750
Veronica?
What is this filth?

1078
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,220
What is this gamey, tawdry trash

1079
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,223
that makes me out to be
some slutty sex maniac?

1080
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:23,823
It's just a movie I'm making

1081
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:25,393
about my life, and I thought

1082
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,104
it'd be fun for you
to play yourself in it.

1083
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:28,329
Oh, you did?

1084
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:29,763
Yeah.

1085
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:31,731
Then you are fucking sick! Hey!

1086
00:50:31,831 --> 00:50:34,135
Watch it with
my artistic expression.

1087
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:36,971
"Artistic expression"?
That's my life.

1088
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:38,372
It's my life.

1089
00:50:38,471 --> 00:50:40,674
Okay, everybody,
calm down. Jeez.

1090
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:42,119
Oh, come on,
you would have killed

1091
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:43,576
to have been
in a film in college.

1092
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:44,744
You majored in drama.

1093
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:46,914
I minored in drama.

1094
00:50:47,014 --> 00:50:49,250
I majored in oral surgery.

1095
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,152
All hail the queen of oral.

1096
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:52,719
Fuck you.
Surgery.

1097
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:54,288
You didn't let me finish.

1098
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:56,333
And I'm not gonna let you
finish this film either,

1099
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:58,025
not with me as a character.

1100
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,894
I'm not some fucking
joke you get to tell

1101
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:02,729
in your dirty little b movie,

1102
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,899
you two-bit
strip mall soderbergh.

1103
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,702
I see myself more like
retail's Richard link later.

1104
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,071
You want to do this?

1105
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:12,739
Fine, but leave me out of it.

1106
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:15,076
Unlike either of you,
I've got a grown-up job.

1107
00:51:15,176 --> 00:51:18,012
And unlike either of you,
I've got a family.

1108
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,117
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

1109
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:27,321
I... sorry.

1110
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,935
Please don't cry.

1111
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:44,871
It's just been a shit day.

1112
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,875
I had two cancelations.

1113
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:50,710
My ex calls to tell me that

1114
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,047
he's not putting
our daughter's car

1115
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:54,482
on his insurance,

1116
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:57,751
and so now somehow
she's pissed at me.

1117
00:51:59,753 --> 00:52:04,025
And then I see you
and say that shit.

1118
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,826
It's okay. Really.

1119
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:10,364
I kinda feel like... I feel
like such an asshole.

1120
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,200
Hey, Ronnie.

1121
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,469
If randal told me he was
gonna send you the script,

1122
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:16,971
I would've said no way.

1123
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:19,839
But now, I'm glad he did.

1124
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:22,809
Because it's...

1125
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,213
It's really nice to see you.
Even under the circumstances.

1126
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:31,152
And you look great.

1127
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:33,120
You look way younger than I do.

1128
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,622
Yeah?
Yeah.

1129
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:38,591
How young you think I look?

1130
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,327
You don't look a day over...

1131
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:43,230
37.

1132
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:46,100
So, um...

1133
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:48,945
<i>You want to fuck?</i>

1134
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:02,116
You think this
means Veronica is in?

1135
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:04,717
I think it means Dante sure is.

1136
00:53:09,622 --> 00:53:10,857
"Silent Bob,

1137
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,860
"you are a rude motherfucker.

1138
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:16,564
"But you are cute
as hell."

1139
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,168
Silent Bob!

1140
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:24,637
You are a rrr-rude motherfucker!

1141
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:26,606
But you're cute as hell!

1142
00:53:29,143 --> 00:53:30,844
I brought the cat, randal.

1143
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,745
Perfect. We don't want
him going anywhere

1144
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,424
near a litter box until
we're ready to shoot.

1145
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,825
So you're gonna have
to hold him all day.

1146
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,784
But I'm allergic to cats.

1147
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:39,987
You got to suffer
for your art, man.

1148
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,688
But it's not my art,
it's your art.

1149
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:43,467
Shouldn't you be the
one doing the suffering?

1150
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:44,824
I didn't suffer enough

1151
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:46,269
when I almost died
from a heart attack,

1152
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,028
which I might add was after

1153
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:49,863
a heated exchange about kites?

1154
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:51,731
My allergies have made me immune

1155
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:53,666
to your emotional blackmail.

1156
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,606
Check out this acting.

1157
00:53:58,705 --> 00:54:00,441
Silent Bob,

1158
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,977
you are a rrr-rude motherfucker!

1159
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,179
But you're cute as hell.

1160
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:08,115
Very natural,
and subtle. I like it.

1161
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:12,652
So, how are you feeling today?

1162
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:14,687
Oh, you know,
I feel like that kid

1163
00:54:14,787 --> 00:54:16,223
that worked in the video store,

1164
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:18,526
fully fluent in
the language of cinema.

1165
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:20,327
It's like I was born to direct.

1166
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,387
No, bro. I mean, you had
a heart attack last month.

1167
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,365
Oh, that.
No, I feel fine.

1168
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,765
How do you feel today

1169
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:27,800
after your range rover
sleepover last night?

1170
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:30,337
Stop it. When I said
to be a producer,

1171
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,872
I didn't mean produce
a late-in-life child.

1172
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:34,542
Unwilling producer.

1173
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:37,578
I didn't ask for this
job, but I am doing it.

1174
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:39,914
So I have a meeting
today about money.

1175
00:54:40,014 --> 00:54:42,016
Fucking a,
that's producing, j.J.

1176
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,984
And I found you
a cinematographer.

1177
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:46,086
What?
May I present to you...

1178
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,956
Shooter Bob.

1179
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:52,126
Silent Bob is gonna be our dp?

1180
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:55,596
Shit, yeah, we all
gonna be doing dps!

1181
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:57,464
Uh, dp is the name of the job.

1182
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:58,774
You said it was cinematographer.

1183
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,068
The cinematographer is the dp.

1184
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,869
Man, don't be
acting like you know

1185
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,250
all the industry slang and shit.

1186
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:05,973
Me and silent Bob
are the only ones here

1187
00:55:06,073 --> 00:55:09,276
who've actually been
on a movie set. Twice.

1188
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:12,379
Come on.

1189
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,381
Yes, he's an
unconventional choice,

1190
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:16,917
but you are an unconventional
filmmaker making

1191
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:18,851
an unconventional film.
Yeah.

1192
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:22,156
<i>You want me to entrust the
story of my life to the quiet place.</i>

1193
00:55:22,256 --> 00:55:23,890
He has some really nice shots

1194
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,192
on his Instagram.

1195
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,194
Come on, give him a chance, man.

1196
00:55:27,294 --> 00:55:28,972
Maybe he speaks the
language of cinema like you do.

1197
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,998
The guy never speaks at all.

1198
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:33,866
Okay, so we just
scouted in here,

1199
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:35,802
and the colors are fucking ugly.

1200
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:38,339
So silent Bob wants to
shoot the whole movie

1201
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:40,107
in black and white.

1202
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:42,943
<i>Schindler's list black and
white? What, is he nuts?</i>

1203
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:45,145
Uh, no, I'm a fucking filmmaker.

1204
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:47,147
And any filmmaker
worth their salt

1205
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,716
would know that the colors

1206
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:50,251
in this place
are fucking ghastly.

1207
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,186
The only way you
could deal with them

1208
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:54,097
is to neutralize them by
going in black and white,

1209
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,956
which will also kind
of act as a commentary

1210
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:58,392
on the soulless
nature of commerce

1211
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:01,595
while subliminally giving
the audience the impression

1212
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,731
that they're watching our heroes

1213
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,132
from the perspective

1214
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:07,767
of an imaginary
store security cam.

1215
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,337
That's what I was
thinking. Mmm-hmm.

1216
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,838
That's what an
artist thinks. Yup.

1217
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:13,507
But, you know, it's up to you.

1218
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:16,210
However, I'm shooting
it in black and white,

1219
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,512
or I ain't shooting it
at all, motherfucker.

1220
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,014
That's right.

1221
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,692
<i>Jesus, he looks fat.</i>

1222
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:33,594
You're not on mute, Emma.

1223
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:36,896
<i>I know. So? Hello.</i>

1224
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:38,666
Hi, you.

1225
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,567
How's Florida?

1226
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:42,178
<i>Full of assholes, but
at least it's not Jersey.</i>

1227
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,704
<i>What do you want, Dante?</i>

1228
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:47,041
Okay, uh, this is gonna
come out of left field,

1229
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:52,279
but, um, I was hoping
I could borrow some money.

1230
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,414
<i>Fuck no.</i>

1231
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:55,582
It's not for me.
It's for randal.

1232
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:58,252
<i>Oh, then double fuck no.</i>

1233
00:56:58,352 --> 00:56:59,987
He had a heart attack, Emma.

1234
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,989
<i>Good. I hope
he dropped dead.</i>

1235
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:03,856
He didn't.

1236
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:05,892
So he needs the money for, uh...

1237
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,261
For the hospital bills.

1238
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,895
Randal doesn't have
any insurance.

1239
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:10,564
<i>So the fuck what?</i>

1240
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:12,766
<i>Even if I wanted to help,
which I don't,</i>

1241
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:15,669
<i>I'm not giving randal
graves any free money.</i>

1242
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,438
Emma, please.

1243
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:19,516
You and I once promised
that if we ever needed help,

1244
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,909
we'd always be there for
each other, no matter what.

1245
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:24,478
<i>That was before
you cheated on me</i>

1246
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:27,081
<i>at a fucking donkey show.</i>

1247
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:28,515
<i>Goodbye, Dante!</i>

1248
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:31,485
No, no. Wait,
wait, wait.

1249
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:33,287
Please, Emma.

1250
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,889
I'm desperate here.

1251
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,692
<i>Do you even have any collateral?</i>

1252
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:41,295
If I have to...

1253
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:44,498
I can sign over my half of
the quick stop as collateral.

1254
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:46,333
<i>That shithole? Ugh.</i>

1255
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,943
What's all this about?
We're making a movie.

1256
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:58,645
No shit.
A pornography movie?

1257
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:01,415
How long does that
take? Twenty-one nights.

1258
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:04,017
It's gonna take my auteur
friend here 21 nights

1259
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:06,553
for him to cinematically
suck his own dick.

1260
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:07,887
In a row?

1261
00:58:09,223 --> 00:58:12,192
<i>"In convenience."
I don't get it.</i>

1262
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:14,762
Scene ten, take one!

1263
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,365
<i>Cat wrangler!</i>

1264
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,580
All right, let's go.

1265
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,083
<i>And...</i>

1266
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,985
<i>Action.</i>

1267
00:58:40,387 --> 00:58:41,889
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1268
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,390
We got poop.

1269
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:47,327
<i>And action.</i>

1270
00:58:47,428 --> 00:58:48,228
Fuck.

1271
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:05,446
What are you waitin' for? Dance!

1272
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:08,882
I ain't doing this with all
these fuckin' people watching.

1273
00:59:08,982 --> 00:59:10,517
Oh, my god.

1274
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:12,085
<i>Cut!</i>

1275
00:59:12,186 --> 00:59:13,596
The talent's
being a little bitch.

1276
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,556
Can you guys wait
in the video store?

1277
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:17,224
I'll run the camera.

1278
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,726
Unbelievable.
Really?

1279
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:29,603
There, ya happy?
I cleared the set.

1280
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:32,473
So fucking dance, man.

1281
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,308
You fucking dance.

1282
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:36,376
<i>- Bitch.
- And...</i>

1283
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:38,078
<i>Action.</i>

1284
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:53,827
What the fuck, jojo siwa?

1285
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:56,330
Look at this fucking
guy looking at us!

1286
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,934
He's not even paying
attention. Gee whiz.

1287
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:02,536
You have to go
inside, too, cuck.

1288
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:05,138
Who the fuck's
gonna run the camera?

1289
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,773
Push the button and walk away.

1290
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:08,943
Oh, my god.

1291
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,778
All right.

1292
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:24,124
<i>Action.</i>

1293
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:25,626
I guess.

1294
01:01:10,972 --> 01:01:12,606
All right, now, hold
on to the counter.

1295
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:14,741
I'm going to pull,
okay? Here we go.

1296
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,343
Ah...

1297
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:24,818
<i>Action.</i>

1298
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:38,632
We need some tits and ass, yeah!

1299
01:01:41,134 --> 01:01:42,803
<i>And cut.</i>

1300
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:44,805
Ha-ha.

1301
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:48,875
Nice job, nice work.

1302
01:01:48,977 --> 01:01:50,410
Um...

1303
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,654
All right, we're
doing the same shot

1304
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:53,480
just over to this door.

1305
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,817
Sound here. Let's get
the sticks over there.

1306
01:01:56,918 --> 01:01:58,185
Elias, you with us?

1307
01:01:58,285 --> 01:01:59,620
Okay, we're doing
the same thing.

1308
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,197
We're just, kind of,
coming over here.

1309
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:02,461
We're gonna stay on the same...

1310
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:08,562
And... action.

1311
01:02:08,662 --> 01:02:13,034
You know, there are a
million fines in the world, dude.

1312
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:15,335
"Millions of
fines"? What the hell, man?

1313
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:16,938
That's not the line.

1314
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:19,339
"There's a million
fine-looking women

1315
01:02:19,439 --> 01:02:21,274
"in the world,
dude."

1316
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:25,479
There are a billion
behinds in this world, dude!

1317
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,649
Whoo! Not "billions of behinds."

1318
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,585
"A million fine-looking women."

1319
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:35,622
You know, they're killing
swines in the world, dude.

1320
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:38,291
Jesus fucking Christ,
you non-acting fuck!

1321
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:40,494
I will do it myself.

1322
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:43,263
Ahem!

1323
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:45,133
You know, there's a
million fine-looking women

1324
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:46,833
in the world, dude,

1325
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:49,202
but they don't all bring
you lasagne at work.

1326
01:02:49,302 --> 01:02:51,139
Most of them just cheat on you.

1327
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:54,008
<i>You all about Eve
-ining fuck. Well?</i>

1328
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:56,810
Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

1329
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:59,147
So that's it. He
doesn't love you anymore.

1330
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:00,681
He loves Caitlin.

1331
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,350
And he told you all
this? Pretty much.

1332
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,485
All except the latent
homosexuality but...

1333
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:06,988
What the fuck, man?

1334
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:09,256
We're making
a movie here. Ew!

1335
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:12,292
It's nothing compared
to how my cousin Walter died.

1336
01:03:12,392 --> 01:03:14,929
- How'd he die?
- He broke his neck.

1337
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:16,630
That's embarrassing?

1338
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,865
He broke his neck trying
to suck his own dick.

1339
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:20,267
Holy shit, man.

1340
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,636
- Is that shit true?
- Are you nuts?

1341
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:23,570
Shut the fuck up.

1342
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,205
We're shooting a scene here.

1343
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:06,713
Uh, what the hell is this?

1344
01:04:06,813 --> 01:04:08,482
The story needs a little action

1345
01:04:08,582 --> 01:04:09,917
so I added a scene where cohee

1346
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,220
comes in to Rob
the place at the end.

1347
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,921
And in the process,
you get shot.

1348
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,991
No way. I'm not letting you
kill me off in the third act.

1349
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,358
What if there's a sequel?

1350
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,894
A sequel?
What am I? A hack?

1351
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:25,332
Cohee, producer says I
gotta cut your scene, man.

1352
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:27,434
Yo, I'm still pay
or play, right?

1353
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:30,004
Publicity? Isn't it
a little early for that?

1354
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:31,838
I've been reading the
paper my whole life

1355
01:04:31,939 --> 01:04:33,540
and the only time
I've seen my name in it

1356
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,009
was under the headline,

1357
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:37,644
"local grocer has
massive heart attack."

1358
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:41,314
So I thought in your
official capacity as producer,

1359
01:04:41,414 --> 01:04:43,316
maybe you can get a
cub reporter over here

1360
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:46,154
to do a story about
your director in action.

1361
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:51,225
"I assure you
we're open."

1362
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:52,960
I don't get it.

1363
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,029
Some savages are always
sticking gum in the locks,

1364
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:57,430
so I wrote it into the
script to be the reason

1365
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:58,966
the shutters are closed all day.

1366
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:00,433
That way, we can shoot at night

1367
01:05:00,534 --> 01:05:01,969
and pretend it's day out.

1368
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,972
I fucking hate how
fake Hollywood is.

1369
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:08,042
I don't appreciate
your ruse, ma'am.

1370
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:09,676
I beg your pardon.
Your ruse.

1371
01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:12,213
Your cunning attempt
to trick me.

1372
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:14,314
This is the last
time I rent here!

1373
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:16,316
You will be missed.

1374
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:17,851
Screw you!

1375
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:22,856
You're not allowed
to rent here anymore!

1376
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:24,058
Yeah!

1377
01:05:24,158 --> 01:05:25,492
And cut.

1378
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,199
Nice work.

1379
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,566
Nice work.

1380
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,568
Okay, now just give
me ten minutes

1381
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:36,670
and then I'll be
ready to do mine.

1382
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:37,838
Your what?

1383
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:40,874
Wah, Ricky!

1384
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:44,078
This is the
last time I rent here!

1385
01:05:48,216 --> 01:05:50,218
I don't get it.

1386
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,420
She wanted to do one as Lucy.

1387
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,223
<i>Empire had the better ending.</i>

1388
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:56,683
I mean, Luke gets
his hand cut off,

1389
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:58,259
finds out vader's his father.

1390
01:05:58,391 --> 01:05:59,802
Han gets frozen,
taken away by Boba Fett.

1391
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:01,561
It ends on such a down note.

1392
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:04,131
Cut.
What? What happened?

1393
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:05,432
"Han gets frozen

1394
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:07,734
"and taken away
by Boba Fett."

1395
01:06:07,834 --> 01:06:08,869
I said that.

1396
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,570
No, you said, "han gets frozen,

1397
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,173
"taken away
by Boba Fett."

1398
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:13,273
You left out
the "and."

1399
01:06:13,341 --> 01:06:14,574
Do I come in now, randal?

1400
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:17,078
Not yet, Thomas.
Go back out.

1401
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:19,412
You can blame Dante for
ad-libbing all over my movie

1402
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:20,780
like he's Seth fucking rogan.

1403
01:06:20,881 --> 01:06:22,782
Oh, my god, I left out one word.

1404
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:24,751
Every word is sacred
to the writer.

1405
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:26,586
This isn't writing.

1406
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:28,065
It's a bunch of shit that
happened for real in my life.

1407
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:29,323
My life.

1408
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:30,724
Do I come in now, randal?

1409
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,692
Not yet, Thomas.
Back.

1410
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:35,462
Oh, man, Thomas fucked up again?

1411
01:06:35,562 --> 01:06:37,231
Stop fucking shit up, Thomas.

1412
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:40,667
Hey, fuck-o. What'd
you say to my father?

1413
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,969
How about I fuck your shit up,

1414
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,146
you fucking fuck
hole motherfucker!

1415
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,804
Shooter Bob!

1416
01:06:45,805 --> 01:06:47,507
That is the Jersey-iest thing

1417
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:50,543
I've ever heard or
seen in my life.

1418
01:06:50,644 --> 01:06:52,846
And action.

1419
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:55,515
That's your lung.

1420
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,152
By this time, your
lung looks like this.

1421
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:01,389
So why don't you put
the cigarettes back

1422
01:07:01,488 --> 01:07:03,224
and try some gum instead?

1423
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:05,892
Here, chewlies gum, try this.

1424
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:08,095
Oh, my god, that reeks!

1425
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,863
God!
What is that?

1426
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:12,266
What happened to the
model of the lung I gave ya?

1427
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:13,667
I'm a method actor.

1428
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:15,002
I ditched the model lung

1429
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:16,736
for this tripe
I got at food town.

1430
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:19,706
Jesus. I used my
power of stagecraft

1431
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:22,575
to see that stomach
as a lung. It's method!

1432
01:07:22,676 --> 01:07:24,577
And you're Dante Hicks.

1433
01:07:24,678 --> 01:07:27,315
We went to the same
school. You played hockey.

1434
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:28,715
Yeah. How'd you
know that?

1435
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:30,384
You still going out with her?

1436
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:31,685
No, she's getting married.

1437
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:33,421
To you?
No.

1438
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,323
To an Asian design major.

1439
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:36,991
What is...
You know what?

1440
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:40,428
Cut, cut, cut! I can't
abide by this racist shit.

1441
01:07:40,527 --> 01:07:42,796
Racist? How the
hell is it racist?

1442
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:44,864
Just look at all this
fucking lack of diversity.

1443
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:49,303
And calling some guy
an Asian design major

1444
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,038
just feels racist.

1445
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:55,276
That's not racist. The guy
literally majored in Asian design.

1446
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:57,178
Are you sure?

1447
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:59,813
Wasn't he a, uh, Asian student
who was also a design major?

1448
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:03,951
He was a passionate
student of Asian design.

1449
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:07,754
It just so happens he himself
was coincidentally Asian.

1450
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,293
Take it easy, man.

1451
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:16,529
So, uh, where are we gonna
shoot the donkey show scene?

1452
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:18,498
Where it happened.
Mooby's.

1453
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:19,967
Our mooby's?
Yeah.

1454
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:21,835
How are we supposed to get in?

1455
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:24,671
I got the locations
department working on it.

1456
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,640
It's stuck in my hair.

1457
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:30,244
Shit. Can you
get it?

1458
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:33,847
Ugh. I hate wearing
the mooby suit, man.

1459
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:14,654
Come on, boys.
Let's go!

1460
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,211
No.

1461
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:41,982
No what? No, I...
I can't go inside.

1462
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,583
Of course, you can.

1463
01:09:43,683 --> 01:09:45,419
Becks, I can't.

1464
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:48,956
We had the best times
of our lives in that place.

1465
01:09:49,056 --> 01:09:51,724
Until one of our lives ended.

1466
01:09:51,825 --> 01:09:53,693
It's just a building, Hicks.

1467
01:09:53,793 --> 01:09:57,131
It's just a building I
haven't been inside since...

1468
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,633
Since you...

1469
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:03,070
I know. I'm sorry.

1470
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:06,307
Just turn the page.

1471
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:08,875
You can do this, babes.

1472
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:11,946
No.

1473
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:13,713
Don't go.

1474
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,532
Uh, randal.
This is Lisa

1475
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:34,535
and her daughter...
Lisa.

1476
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:36,103
Uh, Lisa goes to high school

1477
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,205
at Henry Hudson regional. Oh.

1478
01:10:38,305 --> 01:10:41,475
And this is my husband,
lando, who can go straight to hell.

1479
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:42,910
I'm so mad at you.

1480
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,878
Don't say a damn word
the whole night.

1481
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:47,515
Don't even think words!
- Uh...

1482
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:48,992
We're gonna shoot
a movie in a minute

1483
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,317
so I gotta chase you guys

1484
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,817
- out of here.
- Oh, okay, my bad.

1485
01:10:51,885 --> 01:10:53,187
I guess you don't want press

1486
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:54,431
for your little
YouTube video, then.

1487
01:10:54,455 --> 01:10:55,589
Did you say press?

1488
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:57,024
Mr. Dante
asked them

1489
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:58,459
to come here to cover the shoot.

1490
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,594
So you're saying
little Lisa is...

1491
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:03,164
Ah! High school Lisa.

1492
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:04,764
Don't call her little Lisa

1493
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:06,400
and you better not
call me big Lisa.

1494
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,104
High school Lisa writes for
the high school newspaper?

1495
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:12,306
And her parents
are the chaperones.

1496
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:13,941
Fucking great.

1497
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:15,352
Even though one
parent just came out

1498
01:11:15,376 --> 01:11:16,944
of the strip club tonight

1499
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:20,047
spending all my $5 bills
that I got at bingo. Bitch.

1500
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:24,717
Hey! The producer's
on set.

1501
01:11:24,817 --> 01:11:28,189
So lights! Camera!

1502
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:29,822
Action!

1503
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,592
He looks drunk.

1504
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:33,893
He looks like he needs a
piece of butter and bread.

1505
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:38,632
Ooh, it's cold in here.

1506
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:40,700
Cough cold... hey!

1507
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,203
All right, look,

1508
01:11:42,303 --> 01:11:44,704
I realize going to mooby's
might have hit you hard

1509
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:46,140
but you just take off?

1510
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,509
We couldn't even shoot
the donkey show!

1511
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:49,776
Oh, big deal.

1512
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:51,579
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

1513
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,449
Try thinking of somebody
other than yourself for once.

1514
01:11:55,549 --> 01:11:57,051
Myself?
Okay.

1515
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,818
We're gonna shoot this scene

1516
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:00,719
because the kid from
the high school newspaper

1517
01:12:00,753 --> 01:12:02,323
and her mom are waiting.

1518
01:12:02,423 --> 01:12:04,791
Thanks for understanding
the assignment on that one.

1519
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:06,627
But since you showed
up here shit-faced

1520
01:12:06,726 --> 01:12:09,363
and ruined tonight before
we even had a chance to roll,

1521
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:11,864
we're gonna
re-shoot this tomorrow.

1522
01:12:11,966 --> 01:12:14,734
So get your selfish ass
out there on that cooler

1523
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:16,136
and let's pretend for a minute

1524
01:12:16,237 --> 01:12:18,672
you've actually been
helpful on my movie,

1525
01:12:18,771 --> 01:12:20,040
which is, like, the only thing

1526
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,976
I ever asked you to do for me

1527
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:24,011
and only after I almost
dropped dead

1528
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:26,714
from a fucking heart attack.

1529
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:29,149
You're fucking
unbelievable, man.

1530
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,517
Come on!

1531
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:40,160
What...

1532
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,863
<i>In convenience.</i>

1533
01:12:43,964 --> 01:12:45,432
Stupid title.

1534
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:48,335
Scene 137. Take one.

1535
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:50,337
Are they shooting this
in black and white?

1536
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:53,040
I see a lot of white.
I don't see the black.

1537
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,342
And action.

1538
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:04,652
<i>Salsa shark!</i>

1539
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:06,253
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

1540
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:11,225
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa.

1541
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:14,128
Shark's in the salsa.
Our shark.

1542
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:17,564
Oh, what?
What's with you, man?

1543
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:19,600
You haven't said anything
in, like, 20 minutes.

1544
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,268
What the hell's your problem?

1545
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:22,569
This life.

1546
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,837
This life?

1547
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:27,574
I'm stuck in this pit
on my day off,

1548
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:31,645
dealing with every backward
ass fuck on the planet.

1549
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,681
I smell like shoe Polish,

1550
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:36,183
and my girlfriend
sucked 36 dicks.

1551
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:37,618
- Thirty-seven.
- Oh!

1552
01:13:37,718 --> 01:13:39,186
Cover your ears, baby girl.

1553
01:13:39,286 --> 01:13:40,954
Why the fuck are
they cursing like that?

1554
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:43,223
You need to shit
or get off the pot.

1555
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:44,992
What the hell
are you talking about?

1556
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,572
I'm talking about
this thing you have,

1557
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:49,129
this inability to improve
your station in life.

1558
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:50,297
Fuck you.

1559
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:51,799
It's true, man.

1560
01:13:51,898 --> 01:13:54,201
You sit there and blame life
for dealin' ya a cruddy hand,

1561
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:56,136
never once accepting
responsibility

1562
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,072
for the way your situation is.

1563
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:00,274
You better leave me
the fuck alone, man.

1564
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:02,042
It's because you're
comfortable, right?

1565
01:14:02,142 --> 01:14:03,553
This is the life of
convenience for you

1566
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:05,512
and any attempt to
change it would shatter

1567
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,880
the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

1568
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:09,316
What?

1569
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,016
Man, if you weren't
such a fucking coward.

1570
01:14:11,085 --> 01:14:13,420
Oh, would you shut the fuck up?

1571
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:17,091
That's not the line, man.

1572
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,926
What are you doing?
My whole life

1573
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:21,362
you've been running your
mouth a million miles an hour

1574
01:14:21,462 --> 01:14:23,464
and saying absolutely nothing!

1575
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:26,400
I gotta listen to you talk shit

1576
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,602
about everybody and
everything you think

1577
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:31,672
as if the world's waiting
for you to weigh in!

1578
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:34,007
Nobody fuckin' cares.

1579
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:35,509
Oh, real nice, pal.

1580
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:37,220
Get me all worked up
because it's not like

1581
01:14:37,244 --> 01:14:38,612
I had a heart attack
and almost...

1582
01:14:38,712 --> 01:14:42,316
Died! "I almost died
from a heart attack!

1583
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:45,085
"Did I not mention that a
couple of thousand times yet?"

1584
01:14:45,185 --> 01:14:48,088
Fuck you. "Hey,
everybody, look at me.

1585
01:14:48,188 --> 01:14:49,623
"I'm the boy who lived."

1586
01:14:50,924 --> 01:14:52,559
"So I gotta make a movie

1587
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,695
"all about what a relentless
fucking asshole I am

1588
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:56,130
"to everybody I ever met,

1589
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,599
"especially my so-called
fucking friends."

1590
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,401
Oh, we're not friends
anymore, man.

1591
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:02,035
You can fucking
believe that shit.

1592
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:03,337
Oh, good!
Yeah.

1593
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:05,372
Because if we're not friends,

1594
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:08,175
I don't have to worry anymore
what the cold, hard truth

1595
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:10,244
might do to your poor,
wittle heart!

1596
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:12,980
Oh, don't worry about
me, pal, I'll be just fine.

1597
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,248
So since I can be completely

1598
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,749
honest with you?
Oh, please,

1599
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,518
be completely honest.

1600
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,222
You think you deserve a movie?

1601
01:15:22,322 --> 01:15:23,624
Yeah.

1602
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:27,161
What did you ever
do in life but watch it

1603
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:28,896
and mock it?

1604
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:31,398
What have you ever fucking done?

1605
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:33,066
I had a life.

1606
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:37,037
I was this close
to happily ever after

1607
01:15:37,137 --> 01:15:40,707
and then, one drunk
driver later...

1608
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,410
My movie's over.

1609
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:45,379
Forever.

1610
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:48,615
No happy ending,

1611
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,517
no sequel.

1612
01:15:50,617 --> 01:15:52,653
Not even a third fucking act,

1613
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:56,023
just, "fuck you!
And, oh, by the way,

1614
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:59,326
"fuck you!" Credits.

1615
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:02,396
But, hey...

1616
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:05,799
What's that compared
to a heart attack?

1617
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:08,068
I mean, shit!

1618
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:10,604
You could have
almost died, right?

1619
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:12,072
Yeah.

1620
01:16:12,172 --> 01:16:14,141
Well, some of us did die.

1621
01:16:16,677 --> 01:16:19,713
Some of us have been
dead inside ever since.

1622
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:23,350
But then, just when I'm
able to walk into this place

1623
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,588
without wanting to kill myself
every day, you have an idea.

1624
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:30,691
You wanna make a movie
about your life.

1625
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,727
Oh, and you... You've
been very clear about that.

1626
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:36,096
It's your life!

1627
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:40,868
Well, get this,
you self-centered,

1628
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,302
gaping wound of a human being

1629
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:44,738
with your insatiable
fucking ego!

1630
01:16:44,838 --> 01:16:46,607
The fuck?

1631
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:48,041
Your life...

1632
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:50,577
Is my life!

1633
01:16:51,913 --> 01:16:55,349
I've been there with
you the whole time!

1634
01:16:57,618 --> 01:17:01,088
And since you know how
hard that life's been on me,

1635
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,458
did it ever occur to you

1636
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:08,195
that maybe I didn't wanna
relive that fucking life?

1637
01:17:10,864 --> 01:17:12,099
So, I quit...

1638
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:14,401
As your producer.

1639
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,671
And I quit...

1640
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,208
As your fucking friend.

1641
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:27,147
'Cause I'm not
even supposed to...

1642
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:34,054
Now that's what I call acting!

1643
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,025
Come on, everybody,
clap it up for that.

1644
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:39,793
Okay, drinkie-mc-stinky, get up.

1645
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,297
Dante?

1646
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:45,432
Hey.

1647
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:49,770
Hey. Hey! Dante!

1648
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,104
Wake up, man. Hey!

1649
01:17:51,204 --> 01:17:52,506
Call an ambulance!

1650
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:55,309
<i>Wake up, man.
Dante. Dante!</i>

1651
01:17:58,947 --> 01:18:00,949
Dante? Um...

1652
01:18:01,049 --> 01:18:02,482
Excuse me. We're...
What the...

1653
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,060
No, you can't be back
here. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1654
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:06,286
All right,
already. God.

1655
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:07,597
They just brought our friend in.

1656
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:09,489
His name is Dante Hicks.

1657
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,267
He's the drunk guy that
collapsed at the quick stop.

1658
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,771
Uh-huh. The
first responder said

1659
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:14,306
he's having a heart
attack. Okay, okay.

1660
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:15,572
You need to wait out there, sir.

1661
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:16,956
Someone will be by
to tell you more

1662
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:18,165
as soon as we know more.

1663
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:21,234
Thank you.

1664
01:18:23,637 --> 01:18:26,273
This is where
I first rejected Jesus.

1665
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:29,376
Yeah, and now look
what's happened.

1666
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:31,012
So weird to be back here.

1667
01:18:31,111 --> 01:18:33,313
Yeah, tell me about it.

1668
01:18:33,413 --> 01:18:35,682
All right, look. I'm
gonna get out of here.

1669
01:18:35,782 --> 01:18:38,151
Call me as soon as they
say something, all right?

1670
01:18:38,251 --> 01:18:39,653
Wait, what?
Where are you going?

1671
01:18:39,753 --> 01:18:42,623
I'm gonna go work
on my movie, man.

1672
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:43,624
Your movie?

1673
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,525
Yeah, I mean, it's almost done.

1674
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:47,503
It's not like I'm doing Dante
any good sitting around here.

1675
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:49,496
I might as well
go work on my movie.

1676
01:18:49,596 --> 01:18:51,933
Are you kidding me?
Even now?

1677
01:18:52,033 --> 01:18:54,002
"Even now" what?

1678
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:55,402
"Oh, my movie.

1679
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:57,537
"My movie! Everybody
make my movie

1680
01:18:57,638 --> 01:18:59,406
"because it's
so important."

1681
01:18:59,506 --> 01:19:01,541
This is neither
the time nor the place

1682
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:03,410
to do an impression
of Chris Nolan.

1683
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,412
I'm doing an impression
of you, randal.

1684
01:19:05,512 --> 01:19:06,847
We're in the hospital.

1685
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:08,916
That's stating the obvious. No.

1686
01:19:09,017 --> 01:19:11,184
The obvious statement
right now would be,

1687
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:12,586
"never mind the movie,

1688
01:19:12,686 --> 01:19:14,321
"my best friend's
in the hospital."

1689
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:18,191
It's just a heart attack.
I had one. He'll be fine.

1690
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,494
Fuck you, randal.

1691
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:21,828
Fuck you.

1692
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:23,497
Come on.
God, man.

1693
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:25,599
I used to look up to you so much

1694
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:28,102
but you're the worst,
you know that?

1695
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:29,469
The worst in the world.

1696
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:32,839
Mr. Dante made
your movie happen.

1697
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,076
I made my movie happen.

1698
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:37,644
I had the idea
to make the movie.

1699
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:38,946
I wrote the script

1700
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:40,814
and I'm the goddamn director.

1701
01:19:40,915 --> 01:19:42,716
I made this movie happen.

1702
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:44,317
It was all me.

1703
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:47,155
Oh, it was all you, huh? Yeah.

1704
01:19:47,254 --> 01:19:48,588
Okay.

1705
01:19:49,656 --> 01:19:51,825
Take off your stupid
mask, randal.

1706
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:54,294
Yeah.

1707
01:19:54,394 --> 01:19:56,596
Because I remember
Mr. Dante doing everything.

1708
01:19:56,697 --> 01:20:00,333
He even called his
ex-fiancee who hates his guts.

1709
01:20:00,434 --> 01:20:03,004
He put up his half of quick stop

1710
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:06,074
just to get you the money
to make your stupid movie.

1711
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:07,541
Wait a minute.

1712
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:09,710
Dante got the money
for my movie from Emma?

1713
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,378
<i>Code blue. Er 7.</i>

1714
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,413
Dante, I didn't know about Emma.

1715
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:14,824
I just found out. You
again? What did I say?

1716
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,208
I didn't know.
What did I say, huh?

1717
01:20:16,249 --> 01:20:17,451
Security!
Is he okay?

1718
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,711
Get out of here,
man. Get out!

1719
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:21,288
Is he okay?
Get out! Security!

1720
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:23,523
All right.
Get off of me!

1721
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,526
Randal, where are you going?

1722
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:55,288
Fuck!

1723
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:06,827
I think it needs more weed. Hmm.

1724
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:08,162
God. Hey...

1725
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:09,863
I need your help with Dante.

1726
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,168
Who's Dante?

1727
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:17,305
The fuck do
you mean? Dante.

1728
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:20,640
The other guy, the guy in
the quick stop who's not me?

1729
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,509
Wait, I thought
his name was Sergio.

1730
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:25,445
Ain't his name Sergio?
It's fucking Dante.

1731
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:27,547
Are you gonna help me or not?

1732
01:22:27,647 --> 01:22:30,051
Anything for our boy Sergio.

1733
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:33,386
I need to sneak into the
hospital to get to Sergio,

1734
01:22:33,486 --> 01:22:37,724
so I want you guys to create
a very subtle distraction.

1735
01:22:37,824 --> 01:22:41,461
I took a poo in the icu!

1736
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:43,064
I took a...
Oh, shit!

1737
01:22:43,164 --> 01:22:44,932
Hey! Hey!

1738
01:23:04,218 --> 01:23:05,652
Dante?

1739
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:16,330
Hey, man.

1740
01:23:16,429 --> 01:23:19,766
I figure, since you're
just laying around here...

1741
01:23:19,866 --> 01:23:22,036
You little heart attack copycat.

1742
01:23:23,703 --> 01:23:26,640
You got time to watch
our first movie.

1743
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:29,977
Huh?

1744
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,458
You're gonna see I was way off

1745
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:48,262
with that stupid shit
I said at the store.

1746
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:53,433
I never... never would have
made this movie without you.

1747
01:23:55,802 --> 01:23:58,039
I never could do
anything without you.

1748
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:06,380
I'm here, man.
I'm here.

1749
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:08,448
Let's watch the movie.

1750
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:44,251
This is the way I see you.

1751
01:24:44,352 --> 01:24:47,787
<i>You're the main character
in my star wars.</i>

1752
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:50,191
You're not the dak.

1753
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:53,060
You've always been the Luke.

1754
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,762
You're
the hero of my movie, too.

1755
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,866
You've always been
my hero, Dante.

1756
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:36,397
Let's go.

1757
01:26:37,764 --> 01:26:39,699
Yeah?
Yeah.

1758
01:26:45,805 --> 01:26:47,674
That was the best
movie I ever saw.

1759
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,010
But it's not over.

1760
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,745
Don't you wanna see how it ends?

1761
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:54,982
I trust the director.

1762
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:58,685
He wasn't just
my favorite filmmaker...

1763
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:05,625
he was my best friend.

1764
01:27:35,022 --> 01:27:37,258
What's goin' on?

1765
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:39,593
You okay? Hey.

1766
01:27:39,692 --> 01:27:41,828
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

1767
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:44,298
Don't fucking leave me, man.

1768
01:27:44,398 --> 01:27:46,367
Don't leave me!

1769
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:48,502
Oh, shit. Help!

1770
01:28:01,182 --> 01:28:03,150
And that's when
the good thief said,

1771
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:07,321
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

1772
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:10,324
What the fuck are butt thieves?

1773
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:11,858
I don't know if any
of you know this

1774
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:15,596
but I'm a satanist now.

1775
01:28:15,695 --> 01:28:18,199
And while I may be
the devil's concubine,

1776
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:20,867
I still believe in heaven.

1777
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,970
And because
Mr. Dante

1778
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,506
was the best person
that I ever knew,

1779
01:28:25,606 --> 01:28:27,740
I believe he's in
heaven right now,

1780
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:30,311
just like the good thief.

1781
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:34,048
<i>Dante's inferno.</i>

1782
01:28:35,316 --> 01:28:36,317
No.

1783
01:28:37,318 --> 01:28:38,919
<i>Dante's paradiso!</i>

1784
01:28:40,221 --> 01:28:41,222
<i>Si.</i>

1785
01:29:00,074 --> 01:29:02,009
<i>Grazie, Elias.</i>

1786
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,583
I, uh...

1787
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:13,120
I thought a lot about
what to say here today.

1788
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,854
I was gonna pull from the eulogy

1789
01:29:14,955 --> 01:29:18,192
<i>that kirk gave Spock
in the wrath of Khan,</i>

1790
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,194
<i>but I've always been
more of a star wars fan</i>

1791
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:22,563
so I should say something like,

1792
01:29:22,663 --> 01:29:26,899
"may the force be with you"
or "this is the way."

1793
01:29:28,068 --> 01:29:29,737
But I think instead
of quoting a movie,

1794
01:29:29,836 --> 01:29:32,506
I'd like to paraphrase
the departed.

1795
01:29:32,606 --> 01:29:34,942
And by the departed,
I mean Dante Hicks,

1796
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:37,511
not the scorsese picture
that was pretty perfect

1797
01:29:37,611 --> 01:29:40,481
right up until that stupid
shot of the rat at the end.

1798
01:29:42,916 --> 01:29:45,486
So in the words...

1799
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,988
Of the best guy I ever knew...

1800
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:54,028
"You're not even
supposed to be here today."

1801
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,826
Come on in here,
you little butt thief,

1802
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:20,853
and assume your new position.

1803
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:22,822
But this was
Mr. Dante's spot.

1804
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:24,458
Yeah, well, after all this time

1805
01:30:24,558 --> 01:30:27,227
of being my biggest
and only fanboy,

1806
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:29,296
I'd say you earned it.

1807
01:30:29,396 --> 01:30:30,974
Besides, I told you way back
when we worked at mooby's

1808
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:32,299
when Dante is gone,

1809
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:33,866
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

1810
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:36,570
No, I'm not.

1811
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,248
Who the fuck else am
I gonna hang out with?

1812
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:39,573
It's you and me, buddy.

1813
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:43,843
Oh, fuck.

1814
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,947
Well, look who it is,
Mr. Big shit.

1815
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:50,084
Well, look who it is,
Mrs. Big clit.

1816
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:52,586
Classy. How am
I not surprised?

1817
01:30:52,686 --> 01:30:54,955
I was surprised to see
you at the cemetery.

1818
01:30:55,055 --> 01:30:56,757
You flew up for Dante?

1819
01:30:56,856 --> 01:31:00,527
Well, I did almost marry
the man, and if I had... p.S.

1820
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,529
He wouldn't have died
of a heart attack

1821
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:04,064
before he was 50.

1822
01:31:04,164 --> 01:31:06,233
Yeah, because
after a year with you,

1823
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:07,901
he'd have killed himself.

1824
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:10,671
I think I heard
you had a heart attack.

1825
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:12,106
Am I right?

1826
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:15,642
That must really fuck with you.

1827
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:19,513
Dante's dead but
you're still here.

1828
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:21,715
I guess it's true
what they say, randal.

1829
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:25,085
Only the good die young.

1830
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:26,820
To what do I owe the pleasure

1831
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:29,757
of your entirely
unwelcome visit?

1832
01:31:29,857 --> 01:31:33,460
I loaned Dante 30 grand

1833
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,998
and he put his half of
the store up as collateral.

1834
01:31:38,098 --> 01:31:39,833
Now he's gone.

1835
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:43,904
And if you can't pay me
back, I own half this shithole.

1836
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,009
How big's my clit
now, motherfucker?

1837
01:31:49,109 --> 01:31:51,678
Oh, my sweet Satan,

1838
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,883
lend your might to the
meek and deliver us

1839
01:31:55,983 --> 01:31:58,285
from this succubus.

1840
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:01,188
What the...

1841
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:03,157
The kites are flying!
Ah!

1842
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:05,459
I repeat!
The kites are...

1843
01:32:05,559 --> 01:32:06,593
Flying!
He talks?

1844
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,562
Yes.
Oh, my god.

1845
01:32:08,662 --> 01:32:09,930
Oh, my god!

1846
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,832
Oh, my god!
What?

1847
01:32:11,932 --> 01:32:13,233
The kites are sold out.

1848
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:15,836
The fucking kites,
god, the kites.

1849
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:17,538
The crimson kite nft's,

1850
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:19,478
<i>the ones we minted for
the crimson crypto club.</i>

1851
01:32:19,573 --> 01:32:21,053
Block chain put them
on sale last night

1852
01:32:21,141 --> 01:32:22,309
and they all sold out.

1853
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:23,912
So?

1854
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:25,245
The two of us just made...

1855
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:26,780
One million!
One million!

1856
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,282
One million dollars!
Ah!

1857
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:31,285
Hail Satan! I'm
crypto rich, bitch!

1858
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:35,122
I just cashed out $100,000
just to flex and buy sex.

1859
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:36,790
Here, take that.
Shit.

1860
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,625
What're you gonna do
with your money, big e?

1861
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:41,428
I'll never be able to earn
my place behind this counter

1862
01:32:41,528 --> 01:32:44,731
but now I can buy it.
Here's your sucking

1863
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:45,999
blood money.
Oh!

1864
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:48,635
Now, get the hell
out of our store!

1865
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,538
Well played, clerks.

1866
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:53,942
Sorry about the mess.

1867
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:56,743
<i>That was from star wars.</i>

1868
01:32:56,844 --> 01:32:58,712
I only said it 'cause
you and Mr. Dante

1869
01:32:58,812 --> 01:33:00,747
<i>used to talk about
star wars. I know.</i>

1870
01:33:00,848 --> 01:33:02,382
Long time ago.

1871
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:06,720
In a galaxy far, far away...

1872
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:09,389
Holy fuck, that's
a lot of money.

1873
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,891
You wanna buy some weed?

1874
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:12,759
Yes! I wanna buy
all the weed!

1875
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,094
Here's ten grand.

1876
01:33:14,194 --> 01:33:15,496
Whoo! That's gonna
get you higher

1877
01:33:15,596 --> 01:33:17,932
than Godzilla's asshole.

1878
01:33:18,031 --> 01:33:20,367
Yo, where those kites at?

1879
01:33:20,467 --> 01:33:23,003
Right this way, valued customer.

1880
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:27,508
Aye-yi-yi.

1881
01:33:41,488 --> 01:33:43,490
I wish you were here, man.

1882
01:36:51,378 --> 01:36:53,114
<i>Hey, kids!
It's me, Kevin Smith,</i>

1883
01:36:53,213 --> 01:36:56,416
<i>and I can't thank you enough
for making this third trip</i>

1884
01:36:56,516 --> 01:36:59,553
<i>to the convenience store
with me. Thank you.</i>

1885
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:01,722
<i>Um... this time's
exciting for me</i>

1886
01:37:01,822 --> 01:37:04,357
<i>because this time everyone
finally gets to see clerks</i>

1887
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:06,194
<i>the way I've always seen clerks.</i>

1888
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,538
<i>Most people think that clerks
is a black and white movie</i>

1889
01:37:08,562 --> 01:37:10,697
<i>and they're right. It was
shot on black and white film.</i>

1890
01:37:10,797 --> 01:37:13,767
<i>But, to me,
whenever I watch clerks,</i>

1891
01:37:13,867 --> 01:37:15,179
<i>even though
it's in black and white,</i>

1892
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:16,938
<i>the movie appears in color.</i>

1893
01:37:17,038 --> 01:37:18,206
<i>Because I lived that life.</i>

1894
01:37:18,305 --> 01:37:19,974
<i>And so now, thanks to Lee Ron,</i>

1895
01:37:20,074 --> 01:37:24,178
<i>you're all seein' quick stop
and the surrounding area,</i>

1896
01:37:24,277 --> 01:37:26,013
<i>uh, Dante, randal,
Jay and silent Bob</i>

1897
01:37:26,114 --> 01:37:29,382
<i>as I've always seen them
from day one.</i>

1898
01:37:29,483 --> 01:37:31,685
<i>Um, in vivid, living color.</i>

1899
01:37:31,785 --> 01:37:37,024
<i>Uh, you know, quick stop
is the unsung, uh, star</i>

1900
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:39,359
<i>of all the clerks movies,
