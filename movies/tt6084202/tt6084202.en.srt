3
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,599
Go, go, go!

4
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,066
Get up! Forwards!

5
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:12,874
Forwards!

6
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,515
Somewhere up there.

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,908
Friendlies!

8
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,875
Regiment four?

9
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,377
Number three. Come along.

10
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,753
Get up!

11
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:07,889
On your feet!

12
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,357
You're Latvians!

13
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:24,572
Get up!

14
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,028
Go back to sleep.

15
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:35,576
Say hi to Mom. I'll find Father.

16
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,899
Hide under the bed.

17
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,675
Elbow.

18
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,148
Hush, Barons!

19
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:19,352
May I come in?

20
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,853
Milk?

21
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,000
Good.

22
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,643
Thank you.

23
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,416
What is happening?

24
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,692
Hush, Barons! Hush!

25
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,465
Don't shoot!

26
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,401
Worked here
before the war.

27
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,403
Spies!

28
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,139
Don't shoot!

29
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,941
Silence!

30
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:53,547
Move, Russian!

31
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,149
Down, boy!

32
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,923
They
were hiding in a barn!

33
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,658
We are not soldiers.

34
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:04,926
I don't know.

35
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,928
Restrain the dog!

36
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,730
Barons, hush! Barons, hush!

37
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,666
Restrain the dog!

38
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,467
Hush, Barons!

39
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,042
What are you doing?

40
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,543
Arrest them!

41
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,582
Arrest them!

42
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,068
It's not your fault.

43
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,818
Come on, hurry up!

44
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,254
The Germans are close
to Jelgava already.

45
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,922
Burn everything!

46
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,025
Don't leave the cattle
for the Germans.

47
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,907
May I take my mother's ring?

48
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,041
Yes.

49
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,161
Will we burn the house?

50
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,631
Let them
burn it, if they want.

51
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,734
The cattle will
not make till Riga.

52
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,126
Next!

53
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:14,101
Next!

54
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,069
Go, next!

55
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,011
Too young. Next!

56
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,479
He's got my permission.

57
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,415
Are you his father?

58
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,050
Yes.

59
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,885
In two months, I'll be 17.

60
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,489
Mother's permission?

61
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,393
She was shot by the Germans.

62
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,502
Next!

63
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,246
Too old.

64
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,519
Give my documents
to the commander.

65
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:30,177
The Sargent major
of Kexholm Regiment.

66
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,045
Exactly.

67
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,051
17 distinctions for
outstanding shooting skills.

68
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:39,820
Correct.

69
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,424
Served for 15 years.

70
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,427
Sign him up.

71
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,399
♪ God bless Latvia ♪

72
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,367
♪ God bless Latvia- ♪

73
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,369
- Stop it. It's forbidden.

74
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,038
Fuck you, there are
only Latvians here.

75
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:36,076

dearest Fatherland ♪

76

78
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,038
Prepare the grenades!

79
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,346
Forward in a chain.

80
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:15,349
Pew! Chu-chu, pew!

81
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,136
Arturs, watch out!

82
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,004
Poof!

83
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,548
Arturs!

84
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:56,591
Vanags, Spilva, half an
hour in slope arms position.

85
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,025
Why?

86
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:58,693
An hour.

87
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,996
In marching position!

88
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,106
Present arms! Take!

89
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,408
Attack! Go!

90
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,813
A soldier must not think.

91
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,248
Reload, aim and
shoot. Understood?

92
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,023
Did your father drill
you like that at home too?

93
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,826
No.

94
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,063
At home he was just dad,
not a sergeant major.

95
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,365
Load, aim, shoot!

96
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,169
Forwards! Faster!

97
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:50,043
What are you doing?! A
soldier mustn't think.

98
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,078
Forwards!

99
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,214
Impressive, Konrads.

100
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,453
A real acrobat.

101
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:02,022
But how hard is it really?

102
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,730
Run, Mikelsons!

103
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,135
Come on, you Riga moron!

104
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,438
Let's see how hard you are.

105
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,049
Is that ours?

106
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,120
You can tell by the
sound that it's ours.

107
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,357
I think.

108
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,292
Run for cover!

109
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,160
All of you! Hide!

110
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,333
Everyone run for cover! A plane!

111
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,371
Faster, faster! Hide!

112
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,886
These are too small for me.

113
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,557
Report that
you can't go to war.

114
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,726
Yeah, right. They
will fit without socks.

115
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:48,830
Mikelsons.

116
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:51,899
Spilva.

117
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,471
Vanags.

118
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:01,943
Vanags.

119
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,567
Soldiers!

120
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:33,440
Today you made an oath to
the tsar and the Fatherland!

121
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,477
Be faithful to it and
don't spare your lives!

122
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:41,916
Listen to the command!
Lieutenant Apsitis-

123
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,719
- A real hero.

124
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:49,757
Riflemen. It's 40
kilometers till the frontline.

125
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:54,762
In seven hours, we'll
be there. Oorah!

126
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,866
Oorah,
oorah, oorah!

127
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:05,338
With a song, quick march!

128
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,513
"They will fit
without socks." What a jerk.

129
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,650
Can
you keep it down?

130
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,919
Did you come here to sleep?

131
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,890
The little boy has a blister?

132
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:57,959
Shut up.

133
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:13,941
Are you nuts?

134
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,883
Miss Frau.

135
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,052
A rat race!

136
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:30,390
Hush!

137
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:33,928
Guys, do you hear it?

138
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,004
Spilva!

139
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,772
Go gas the Germans!

140
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,984
A medic! A medic!

141
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,459
Attach the bayonets!

142
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:51,172
I said, attach the bayonets!

143
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,573
Everyone to the parapet!

144
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:01,015
If we don't respond, they
will start firing even more.

145
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,681
Are you blind?

146
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:34,949
As if you can see anything.

147
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:35,883
Hold your fire!

148
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:40,521
Get ready for the attack.

149
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,990
Form a single line.

150
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:49,230
Back!

151
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,000
We wait.

152
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,705
Load your weapons.

153
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:23,758
Vanags, we must go that way.

154
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:30,965
Arturs!
Had you gone home?

155
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,291
Leave him. We can't help him.

156
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:01,695
The fog is clearing. They
will wipe us all out.

157
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:02,730
Move forwards.

158
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,023
Grenades!

159
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:31,926
Go!

160
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,779
Perhaps Mirdza?

161
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,481
Show it
to me too, Mikelsons.

162
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,386
Just
bless yourself.

163
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:11,125
Finally, some tits.

164
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:18,899
You should go
to the infirmary.

165
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:19,733
I'll stay.

166
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,786
Stop stealing.

167
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,989
I'm not. Just
airing the pockets.

168
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,861
And where did you
get the boots, huh?

169
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,366
With these boots the
fighting will be much easier.

170
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:38,479
216?

171
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,083
9281.

172
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:43,951
Vanags.

173
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,526
Spilva, killed in Sloka.

174
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:56,957
Mom!

175
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,688
Clean them properly.

176
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:02,956
Make them look like new.

177
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,495
Is that my blood?

178
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:11,699
Germans have blue. It's yours.

179
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,370
And Estonians?

180
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:17,204
Fiery.

181
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:24,945
Attention!

182
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:29,717
The unit stays
in reserve tonight.

183
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,218
Copy that!

184
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,387
Arturs Vanags will be at
the sergeant's disposal.

185
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,624
Rifleman Vanags!

186
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:37,491
Here!

187
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,395
Happy Birthday!

188
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,299
Thank you.

189
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,737
At ease.

190
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:51,606
The boy has turned 17.

191
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,081
Yes, yes.

192
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:04,284
Crowds are everywhere.

193
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:06,654
Let's leave.

194
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:07,522
Come.

195
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,567
Go away!

196
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,603
Come on, Lolya.

197
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:38,485
♪ Lolya, sweetie, my sunshine ♪

198
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,659
Can two soldiers rest here?

199
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:45,860
Edgars.

200
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:49,797
And Arturs and a
bottle of Tokay wine.

201
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,836
And a present
from the trenches.

202
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,104
I hate white wine.

203
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,138
We hate it too.

204
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:02,844
Arturs saw a plane.

205
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,081
Olya.

206
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,183
Arturs.

207
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,051
Well.

208
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:30,672
So, here you go. Here you go.

209
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,807
Do you want to get us drunk?

210
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,074
Yes, I do.

211
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,544
So be it! Let's get drunk!

212
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,278
There's war, after all.

213
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:40,414
And war. So be it!

214
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,348
Bottoms up.

215
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,326
That is my sword.

216
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,193
Really?

217
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,564
Where have you been
with your sword?

218
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:58,365
Why is your
brother so serious?

219
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:02,135
Ask him. Go on.

220
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,372
And why don't you laugh?

221
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:07,809
Ha, ha, ha.

222
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,511
I like you in uniform.

223
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,347
Can I try on your hat?

224
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:25,593
How should I salute an officer?

225
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:28,128
Sir, Private reporting!

226
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:30,832
Sir, Private reporting!

227
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,937
If I give you an
order, will you do it?

228
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:37,739
Yes.

229
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:41,208
Kiss me.

230
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:03,497
Should have dug the boxes
of seeds deeper at home.

231
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:06,266
Everything grows spoiled.

232
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,503
There will be nothing to sow.

233
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,505
But here we are,
thousands of us,

234
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,939
sitting here and doing nothing.

235
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:15,877
We could plough a
square verst per day.

236
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,713
Wait for
the orders, soldier.

237
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,213
We'll have a chance to fight.

238
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,556
To the cellar.

239
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,566
Put the cap on the
bayonet and lift it up.

240
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:40,668
Give it to me.

241
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,876
Lower, not so high.

242
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,347
Lift it up and down,
as if he was walking.

243
00:36:56,383 --> 00:37:00,287
Not jumping. It's not a dance.

244
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,323
Slower.

245
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,762
You are as dumb as a rock.

246
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:08,930
Stop teaching me.

247
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:12,734
How can I, stupid?

248
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,869
Acting like a professor.

249
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:20,908
A sniper. Any volunteers?

250
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,381
Very well.

251
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:32,452
A sniper. Post to the right.

252
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,993
Two go forwards. Lay low.

253
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,032
Arturs, go, go!

254
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:25,566
For being so weak,
you deserve a tribunal.

255
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:51,959
My boy.

256
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,197
My boy.

257
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:02,036
What are you doing?

258
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:06,674
He's got a bullet in his
neck, but you give him milk.

259
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,867
Don't talk.

260
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,970
A bullet was removed from
your neck, do you understand?

261
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:38,239
It had gone through the shoulder

262
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,974
two millimeters from the artery.

263
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:41,976
You were lucky.

264
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:47,882
Hush. Dear boy.

265
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,017
Still a boy.

266
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,453
War is not for boys.

267
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:59,627
Should have stayed home
with your mom, studying.

268
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,570
Dear son,

269
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:10,972
my feet are hurting.

270
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,574
I heard that you had
fallen in the battle.

271
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,610
But I know, that you are alive.

272
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,581
There is no news.
The front is quiet.

273
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:23,818
Konrads strangled another one,

274
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:26,921
and I managed to shoot
two more bastards.

275
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,656
That makes 30 altogether.

276
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,695
It is cold as hell here,
my bones are aching,

277
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:39,900
but when I think about
you and Edgars, and home,

278
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,602
I forget about the pain.

279
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,840
Mother talked about
you in my dream.

280
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,112
Edgars had already come
home, but freezing.

281
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:00,021
You are strictly
forbidden to smoke.

282
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:15,736
True. I'm sorry.

283
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,106
You should't talk either.

284
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:30,785
Visiting hours
are over in an hour.

285
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,807
Get plump and
healthy as a horse.

286
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,342
Greetings from Olya.

287
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,345
Well, how are they?

288
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:01,682
Drinking.

289
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,819
How is father doing?

290
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:10,057
Crawling closer
to the Germans.

291
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,159
Shooting every day.

292
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,997
He got a message that you
were killed in battle.

293
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:19,900
But I'm alive.

294
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:25,139
Well, it's a good sign.

295
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,741
What do you think
about this, officer?

296
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:30,010
While kaiser is having
children for breakfast,

297
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:31,645
behind the front,

298
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,115
German spies have recruited
murderers of Bolsheviks,

299
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:37,118
promising land and money
that does not belong to them.

300
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,153
The tsar is ready
to die for you.

301
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:42,591
Let's not give in to propaganda.

302
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,096
Check if these are yours.

303
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:57,371
It's mine.

304
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:01,375
I guess you'll be going
to the Island of Death.

305
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:08,349
Play one.

306
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:11,919
Let's play. See this?

307
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:34,041
I'm sorry for smoking.

308
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,143
Once healed, you'll
be able to smoke again.

309
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:39,380
My name is Arturs.

310
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:40,247
I know.

311
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:44,018
Why are you here
at the hospital?

312
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,022
My father and brother
are in the front.

313
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:50,257
And I cannot look after
our farmstead alone.

314
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,761
My father and I decided, it
is best for me to come here.

315
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:56,096
What about your mother?

316
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,064
My mother died.

317
00:44:58,499 --> 00:44:59,501
I'm sorry.

318
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:14,949
Shall we dance?

319
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,000
My name is Marta.

320
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:55,557
The Kraut soldier was
put there for punishment.

321
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,393
The Germans have no guts.

322
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:06,066
They want us to waste
bullets on their jerks.

323
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,002
It's a piece of cake.

324
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:08,869
Stop.

325
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:11,438
Why do you pity him?

326
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,840
Perhaps, he shot Spilva.

327
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,343
Perhaps, he put a bullet in
the heart of Arturs' mother.

328
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:17,978
We're not executioners.

329
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,080
He'll get shot
tomorrow in the battle.

330
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:27,221
German asses! Bang bang!

331
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,088
Come here!

332
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:46,608
Yes, yes! Shit!

333
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:50,044
I am not shit! You are shit!

334
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:56,150
Yes, yes! I don't understand!

335
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,218
I am Latvian!

336
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,622
You are a farmer!

337
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:03,223
You are an ass!

338
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,130
Stop shouting.

339
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:32,587
Father.

340
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:15,095
Kill him.

341
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,307
Shoot!

342
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,017
It's wrong.

343
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:39,587
Shoot.

344
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:50,197
Bravo, Latvians! Bravo.

345
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,501
If your mother was here...

346
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:03,645
I hope she can forgive me
for taking you to the war.

347
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,051
How many?

348
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:12,052
What?

349
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,954
How many?

350
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,225
It should be 60 by
the end of summer.

351
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,402
Gas attack!

352
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,772
Put wet cloths on your face!

353
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,509
Faster, faster! Come on!

354
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:39,112
Help the 6th battalion!

355
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,087
Friendly
troops! Friendly troops!

356
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,062
Edgars!

357
00:49:56,296 --> 00:50:01,301
Arturs!

358
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,705
Where is father?

359
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:04,739
What?

360
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:07,040
Where is father?

361
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:52,720
They
are real devils.

362
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:55,557
Sons of bitches.

363
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:58,458
They keep on censoring letters.

364
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:00,895
It's so you don't
spoil your eyesight,

365
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,597
reading so many letters.

366
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,165
But I can't see shit of
what my sweetheart writes.

367
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,403
Dick heads.

368
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,240
Attention!

369
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:20,748
Vanags didn't come
for replacement.

370
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:22,482
Do you know where he is?

371
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,298
Lieutenant Vanags!

372
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,667
Here.

373
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:22,904
Who put the gun in the grave?

374
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:23,905
Commander...

375
00:53:23,938 --> 00:53:25,540
Dismissed!

376
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:26,507
It was me. I did.

377
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,444
Losing a gun means tribunal!

378
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,716
Commander,
sergeant major Vanags

379
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:37,852
killed 56 Germans with this gun.

380
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,688
He deserves to be
buried with it.

381
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:03,911
You did right.

382
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:07,447
Fire.

383
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:35,843
Latvian riflemen.

384
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:41,048
You will succeed in
attacking the Germans.

385
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:43,985
You are lucky to fight together

386
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:48,355
with the best Siberian
units of the 12th regiment.

387
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,357
With your bayonets

388
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,425
we will liberate Jelgava
and.

389
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:55,930
Mothers and fathers
are waiting for you.

390
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,100
You will embrace them
after the victory.

391
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,469
God be with us.

392
00:55:04,906 --> 00:55:06,473
Volunteers step forward!

393
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,450
You'll report the
route to the others.

394
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:29,697
The tsar promised
that we'll get home.

395
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:32,567
Godspeed, boys!

396
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:36,037
At ease!

397
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:41,008
You'll get fed. This
is for special occasions.

398
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,109
Could I have
some bacon, please?

399
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:43,945
Perhaps, you
want boar's balls?

400
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,915
Hey, this is for three days.

401
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,550
What's in my stomach is mine.

402
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:51,853
If I get shot, at least
Germans won't get it.

403
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,890
Are you stupid?
What are you doing?

404
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:57,091
Volunteers?

405
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:58,860
I'll take you off the front
line to join the signallers.

406
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:00,928
Maybe also
give me a candlestick?

407
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:09,537
Alright. I'll go with you.

408
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:11,038
Come.

409
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:35,850
Alarm! Alarm!

410
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,720
Fire!

411
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:40,588
Petersons.

412
00:58:43,657 --> 00:58:44,325
Petersons!

413
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:17,792
Go, go, go!

414
01:00:36,437 --> 01:00:38,105
Give me your hand.

415
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,785
You
wanted to shoot me?!

416
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:33,761
Arturs, grenade!

417
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:56,116
Kill me, please, kill me.

418
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:46,900
How are they?

419
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:49,103
Good.

420
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:09,524
It should be done.

421
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:10,958
It's been cooking
for three hours!

422
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:13,060
Add some wood.

423
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:16,430
Then it will boil faster.

424
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,300
Number three? Yes?

425
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,803
Distribute
it to your folks.

426
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,974
It's lice powder.

427
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:27,841
Shut up!

428
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:31,812
It's salt!

429
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:33,581
Lice powder!

430
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:34,982
It's salt!

431
01:03:35,015 --> 01:03:37,151
It is lice powder he says.

432
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:37,985
Why are you laughing?

433
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,053
Let's take it off.

434
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,122
What's happening here?

435
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:46,060
Permission to report, captain,

436
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,462
the Estonian can't cook a goose.

437
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:51,398
What?

438
01:03:51,432 --> 01:03:53,100
Yes, Your Highness.

439
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,368
On behalf of our company,

440
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:58,172
we invite you to share
this goose with us.

441
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:03,043
Well, if you treat me.

442
01:04:04,044 --> 01:04:05,045
Right.

443
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:06,313
Here you go.

444
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,430
Slowly, slowly. Who
said, the Estonian can't cook?

445
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:49,624
A parcel.

446
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:51,024
For whom?

447
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:52,393
For Petersons.

448
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:53,894
Check if there is food.

449
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,096
It's from his mom.

450
01:04:57,766 --> 01:04:58,600
Read it.

451
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:10,010
"My dearest boy!

452
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,414
I received the money and
even your previous letter

453
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:14,582
that seemed to have been lost.

454
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:16,984
Now, I have some wool.

455
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,955
I will knit mittens
for your friends too.

456
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:28,028
When my heart gets
sad and full of fear,

457
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:30,130
especially in the dark evenings,

458
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:34,001
I light a lamp by the bedside

459
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:37,171
and look at my dearest,

460
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,576
dearest boy's face.

461
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:49,016
And then I feel at ease and
remember the good times,

462
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:55,088
when we were all
together and happy."

463
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,762
Smoke got in my eyes.

464
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:07,535
"Every evening, I pray for my
boy to return safe and sound.

465
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,240
Kisses to my little boy.

466
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:15,743
Your mommy."

467
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,011
Gather your things!

468
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:24,117
We are returning to
the previous positions.

469
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:27,321
Why? The Siberians should
be in Jelgava already.

470
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:32,527
It's an order to me
and so it is to you.

471
01:06:34,094 --> 01:06:37,097
The orders are not
to be questioned.

472
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:18,673
Where are the reinforcements?
Where are the Siberians?

473
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:24,512
Movement is impossible.

474
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:26,714
I repeat,

475
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:28,683
movement is impossible.

476
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:34,756
We are under attack.

477
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,226
Understood!

478
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:46,501
At night, we pull back.

479
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,672
The Siberians refused to attack.

480
01:07:50,705 --> 01:07:52,540
But we are so close.

481
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:55,242
It'll be fine. We'll get home.

482
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,221
Lower! Lower!

483
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,382
Brother. Brother!

484
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:11,853
Wait.

485
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:14,421
Wait!

486
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:27,502
Fire!

487
01:09:46,054 --> 01:09:47,622
Everyone retreat!

488
01:09:48,623 --> 01:09:49,456
Retreat!

489
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:58,492
Jekabs? Jekabs?

490
01:10:58,526 --> 01:10:59,493
Killed.

491
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:00,995
Alberts?

492
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,337
Have you seen Pukis?

493
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,706
No, I haven't.

494
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,909
Has anyone seen Rudzitis?

495
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:17,912
Has
anyone seen Mukins?

496
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,111
Out of my way.

497
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:59,587
Why didn't
you come help us?

498
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,657
Read it yourself.

499
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:11,732
The war will bring the
end to the tsar and kaiser.

500
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,605
Point your weapons towards
ministers and generals.

501
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:23,010
Lenin has promised
to liberate Russia,

502
01:12:24,946 --> 01:12:28,481
let us liberate Russia
and return home.

503
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:29,884
Land - to the peasants!

504
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:32,854
Put an end to the war!

505
01:12:33,921 --> 01:12:35,857
And do you believe them?

506
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,692
What else can we do?

507
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,994
I will not fight for
this damn tsar anymore.

508
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:42,997
Do
you think that Lenin

509
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,464
will really grant us freedom?

510
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:47,702
We'll see.

511
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:07,822
Marta?

512
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:18,966
My father. He
didn't come back.

513
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,201
What is his name?

514
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:24,205
Peteris Feldzers.

515
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:25,973
Brother?

516
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:27,942
He was killed on
the Island of Death.

517
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:33,748
If I find out something,
I will write to you.

518
01:13:54,802 --> 01:13:55,903
Does it hurt?

519
01:13:58,005 --> 01:13:58,973
What?

520
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:03,577
A little.

521
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:22,563
Marta, the revolution is over.

522
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:24,665
The tsar and kaiser
have been punished.

523
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,634
For two months, we
were guarding Lenin.

524
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:29,837
Then, we were sent to the South.

525
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:32,106
I was wounded in the
leg not far from Rostov.

526
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:35,609
Mikelsons and Konrads
carried me to hospital

527
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:37,278
for 20 kilometers.

528
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,814
At first, the doctor
wanted to cut the leg off,

529
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:41,048
but then decided not to.

530
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:45,019
I don't want to return
home as a disabled person.

531
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:47,321
My comrades are being
sent back to Latvia.

532
01:14:47,355 --> 01:14:49,156
When I get better,
I will join them.

533
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:53,794
We are stronger and
more united than ever.

534
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:56,931
We'll beat the
Germans and go home.

535
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,203
I would like to show it to
you. It's very beautiful.

536
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:05,673
Arturs.

537
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:08,776
Get back here!

538
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:10,644
It's not funny.

539
01:15:14,115 --> 01:15:16,083
You'd better
tell me what you saw.

540
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,253
They wear red stars.

541
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:22,056
But they run as soon
as the Germans come.

542
01:15:22,089 --> 01:15:24,625
They will have
marched into Latvia.

543
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:27,028
They need to build
communism in Moscow.

544
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:28,996
Who is going to protect us?

545
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,065
We should have fought
for own government.

546
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:32,566
Stop talking rubbish.

547
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,036
Every night, people
are killed in Riga.

548
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:37,138
Some are killed in the brewery.

549
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:38,272
That's the main place.

550
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:42,910
Some are killed by the Central
prison near the water towers.

551
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:45,279
Others are killed
next to the forests.

552
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:49,050
They arrest them at noon and
by the evening, they are dead.

553
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:51,619
Who is to blame for that?

554
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:53,687
For that Antichrist
servants' rage?

555
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,590
Those bastard riflemen.

556
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:57,658
Let's get off.

557
01:15:57,691 --> 01:15:58,893
Me, I'm going further.

558
01:16:13,707 --> 01:16:14,975
Son of a bitch.

559
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,015
Is he crazy?

560
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:23,084
It's good that you came.

561
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:27,655
We wouldn't have
managed without you.

562
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:36,997
No.

563
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:37,865
Yeah?

564
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:40,935
I'll go now.

565
01:16:57,818 --> 01:16:58,652
Comrade commander,
allow me report.

566
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,455
Transportation has run smoothly.

567
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:03,424
The arrested people have
been taken to wagons.

568
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:04,291
At ease.

569
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,961
Solder Vanags!

570
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:09,096
Here.

571
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,764
How's your leg?

572
01:17:10,798 --> 01:17:13,634
A bit shorter. But
ready for the revolution.

573
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,783
Third unit! To
the headquarters.

574
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:39,059
Go on.

575
01:17:43,532 --> 01:17:44,365
Halt!

576
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:46,367
Turn right!

577
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:52,706
Get in line!

578
01:18:13,794 --> 01:18:14,461
Line up!

579
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:16,864
Attention!

580
01:18:21,503 --> 01:18:23,437
Isn't that Mikelsons?

581
01:18:36,016 --> 01:18:40,087
For counter-revolutionary
activities, desertion,

582
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:46,994
assisting in desertion and
assisting in an escape attempt,

583
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:51,498
for betrayal, the
punishment is death.

584
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,134
Execute the order.

585
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:07,248
You can take my
underwear, too.

586
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:16,558
What are you doing here?

587
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:21,362
Guess. You can die in Russia.

588
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:22,396
I'll die here.

589
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:27,134
Shoot me!

590
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:30,004
♪ March on, Latvians ♪

591
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:33,007
♪ Let's join regiments ♪

592
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,243
♪ Let there be
blood, we'll fight ♪

593
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:39,213
♪ Let the slaves' chains break ♪

594
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:46,186
Aim!

595
01:19:56,363 --> 01:19:57,632
Fire!

596
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:21,955
Shoot or you'll be shot.

597
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:26,327
Understood?

598
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,380
Aim!

599
01:20:56,056 --> 01:21:01,028
Fire!

600
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:05,499
Arrest the traitor.

601
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:14,308
Mikelsons! Mikelsons!

602
01:21:15,543 --> 01:21:16,377
Bitches!

603
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:19,446
No, I'll kill you.

604
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,648
Mikelsons, no!

605
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,151
Konrads, help! Mikelsons, no!

606
01:21:27,655 --> 01:21:28,590
Mikelsons!

607
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,627
Whores! I will kill you all!

608
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:34,562
Mikelsons!

609
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:54,348
Don't stare!

610
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:15,969
Hey, lend me that
bucket, friend.

611
01:22:16,003 --> 01:22:17,505
Why do you need it?

612
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:18,372
You'll see.

613
01:22:25,814 --> 01:22:27,247
Your station. Quickly.

614
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:30,117
Quickly. Quickly.

615
01:22:31,586 --> 01:22:32,419
Not you.

616
01:22:36,156 --> 01:22:36,990
Good night.

617
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:41,763
What are you staring
at? You've got 10 minutes.

618
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:42,764
Commander?

619
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:53,775
Are you sorry for Mikelsons?

620
01:22:53,808 --> 01:22:55,743
He'd be shot anyway.

621
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:58,813
And you'd all be shot,
if I hadn't done it.

622
01:22:58,847 --> 01:23:00,214
And I'd have been shot.

623
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:03,518
You will be shot.

624
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,695
Goodbye.

625
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,271
Let's go to Marta.

626
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:28,041
She works as a farm hand.

627
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:31,144
She'll suggest a hiding place.

628
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,082
No, when the reds are gone,

629
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:37,117
I'll go back, before
the Germans get there.

630
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,153
Who is expecting you there?

631
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:44,124
Latvians are finally forming
National forces in Cesis.

632
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:48,395
While I'm not at home,
the war is not over.

633
01:23:53,902 --> 01:23:54,736
Devils!

634
01:23:59,774 --> 01:24:01,074
To the forest!

635
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:03,443
Stop, we will shoot!

636
01:24:09,182 --> 01:24:09,851
Betrayer!

637
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:13,855
Son of a bitch.

638
01:24:15,155 --> 01:24:16,290
Where are they?

639
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:21,228
Konrads!
Konrads, let's go.

640
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:22,462
Get him.

641
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:23,765
Konrads!

642
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:25,867
Get him.

643
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,635
I'll shoot!

644
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,108
Don't make me get off my horse!

645
01:24:38,145 --> 01:24:39,179
Check the other side.

646
01:25:29,864 --> 01:25:31,298
Have you
seen a solder here?

647
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:31,966
No.

648
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,967
Don't lie!

649
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:33,801
No.

650
01:25:33,835 --> 01:25:35,335
Let's go.

651
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:37,304
If you see anyone, report it.

652
01:25:37,337 --> 01:25:38,438
Of course, comrades.

653
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:47,147
Why do you hide from
your own people?

654
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:50,852
They are not mine anymore.

655
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:13,988
I have to go.

656
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:19,927
Please promise
to take me home.

657
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:32,540
Wrong finger.

658
01:29:49,523 --> 01:29:52,827
We must defend Cesis.
And liberate Riga!

659
01:29:53,828 --> 01:29:54,996
We fought under the reds',

660
01:29:55,029 --> 01:29:56,964
the tsar's and even
the German flag.

661
01:30:01,936 --> 01:30:05,039
And we have always been cheated.

662
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:09,010
It's time to fight under our
own red, white and red flag.

663
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:12,914
We won't be servants any more.

664
01:30:13,915 --> 01:30:17,484
Time to defend our land,
our home, our family.

665
01:30:20,154 --> 01:30:23,456
The guns
will be useful.

666
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,424
Whose gun was it?

667
01:30:25,726 --> 01:30:27,494
The fallen rifleman Konrads'.

668
01:30:28,296 --> 01:30:29,096
May I?

669
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:49,517
Gatis!

670
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:51,919
Next.

671
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,491
Great army you have there.

672
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,963
Kids, deserters and refugees.

673
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:09,003
Listen. An Estonian armored
train is on its way.

674
01:31:09,036 --> 01:31:11,739
Defend the railway bridge
until their forces arrive.

675
01:31:16,177 --> 01:31:18,879
Listen
to my command!

676
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:22,516
Down!

677
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:33,194
Milksops! On your feet!

678
01:31:34,895 --> 01:31:37,031
On your feet, everybody!

679
01:31:37,064 --> 01:31:37,898
Go!

680
01:31:40,735 --> 01:31:43,004
Don't sit there! Get up!
