Just come here!

[Keith] Well, better get us
some firewood before sundown.

Keep those damn dogs away.

[Virgil] What dogs?

232
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,831
They got their eye on us now,
but with a good fire burning…

..they won't bother us.

you to the compound no more?

You gonna head back west now?

242
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:28,475
I guess not.

243
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:33,195
[Keith] Yeah. Never much worth
in what we leave behind.

Goddammit!

Yee-hah!

We just found
a fucking pile of gold!

We just found a fucking pile
of gold! Come on, man!

Get up! When does this ever
fuckin' happen?

Yee-hahahaha!

[flames crackle]

256
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:37,439
Well, one of us will have to get
the excavator to get it out.

257
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,639
Why one of us?

258
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,679
One of us will have to stay here
with the gold, obviously.

259
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,740
Protect it.

260
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Of course, yeah.

261
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,620
I know a place
a couple of days drive east

262
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
that'll have what we need.

263
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,680
Two days there, two days back,
one sorting an excavator.

264
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,380
Five days?

265
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,941
Well, maybe four,
but you'll have to keep stopping

266
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,041
to cool down the engine.

267
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,001
You'll have to be careful
asking around.

268
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,781
People get wind of you
needing an excavator,

269
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:24,881
they're likely to want to know
why.

270
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,882
I'll give you the name
of someone I trust

271
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,682
and I'll stay here
with the gold.

272
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,083
Why don't I stay here
with the gold?

273
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:53,003
You know where to get
the excavator.

274
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,923
[dog howls]

275
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,064
I'm gonna say something here,

276
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,964
and uh, I don't want you to take
it the wrong way or nothing,

277
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:20,084
but I don't trust you to keep
your head while I'm gone.

278
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:26,245
I don't mean to talk down to you
or nothing, but,

279
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:29,005
you gotta watch your water.

280
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,405
How much you drink,
how much you got left.

281
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,665
You gotta stay out of the sun.

282
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,825
Watch your food. If you run out,
you gotta catch more.

283
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,925
It ain't no fucking joke
out here.

284
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,605
You're a bit loose with it all,
not being from here, you know?

285
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,326
I think I can handle it.

286
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,426
Well, like I said, I don't mean
to condescend you or nothing,

287
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,526
but,

288
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,646
you may feel pretty safe with me
here right now, but,

289
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:56,746
once I'm gone with the truck

290
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,846
and you're here
all by your lonesome,

291
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,047
be a very different feeling
indeed.

292
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,887
You're likely to panic.

293
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,187
Do something stupid.

294
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:12,287
And then what?

295
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,067
There's fuck all people
coming through here,

296
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,167
but if someone does,

297
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:21,508
they're not likely to want us
to keep the gold for ourselves,

298
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,608
if you know what I mean?

299
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:27,728
And I just don't think
you have it in you

300
00:30:28,088 --> 00:30:30,088
to stop that from happening.

301
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:34,368
And I do not want to risk
what we got here.

302
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:40,889
No offence.

303
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,729
I think I'll stay with the gold.

304
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,890
You sure?

305
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,890
I'm sure.

[pensive music]

307
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,151
I got more water

308

'cause I've gotta put it in the
truck to keep the engine cool.

309
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:33,852
It is what it is.

00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:37,572
It is what it is.

311
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:41,752
You got a few cans
of food there,

312
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:44,972
but if run out,
you might want this.

313
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:50,013
You see something,
don't be afraid, you use it.

Now, keep this sat phone on you.

Spare batteries.

317
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:08,834
And I'll try and call you from
a payphone on the way there.

318
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:12,874
But I'm going to try and buy one
when I get to the excavator.

319
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,334
Then I can call you on the way
back without stopping.

320
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:20,174
- [Car door slams]
- OK.

321
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,895
It'll be OK.

322
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:32,255
You just do what I said and…
keep your head on.

323
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:44,235
Just think, by the time I get
back, we'll be rich as all hell.

No.

Stay with the gold.

I'll be there as soon as I can.

Why here?

It's as good as place as any.

00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,040
Well, that's a load of bollocks,

I see you got another camp

[Virgil] Stop. Stop.

Listen. I'm burning waste,
that's all.

You…you shouldn't shit
in your own backyard.

smart.

Nothin' worse than

Wait.

467
00:59:45,825 --> 00:59:50,005
[stranger] Tell me, will you
mind

468
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:53,465
if I commandeer your little
shite fire over there?

469
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:58,705
Just take the plane.

470
00:59:59,385 --> 01:00:01,005
It's the best shelter.

471
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:03,106
You can build a fire.

472
01:00:05,346 --> 01:00:07,346
I'll leave you to it.

473

something?

No.

01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:31,947
You hiding from the law?

01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:35,487
No.

477
01:00:35,587 --> 01:00:37,868
Well, I bet you're
from the north.

478
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,188
How'd you say you got here?

479
01:00:43,468 --> 01:00:45,468
I didn't.

480
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,908
Where are you going?

481
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:50,668
To the compound.

482
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:53,388
And how are you getting there?

483
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:57,509
- A friend.
- Friend?

484
01:00:58,109 --> 01:01:00,109
So where is this friend?

485
01:01:01,029 --> 01:01:04,269
Passing through
and picking me up on the way.

486
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:08,109
But how did you get here, then?
Hm?

487
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:12,269
I'm a little deaf in this ear,
you'll have to speak up.

488
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,050
Listen, lady.

489
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,730
My friend is coming through,

490
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:18,570
and he's picking me up on the
way, that's it.

491
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,210
There's nothing more to it.

492
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,890
OK? Fuck off.

493
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:26,470
I offered you shelter. Take it.

494
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,951
I think you're lying.

495
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:43,591
Got a headache, huh? Have you?

496
01:01:44,551 --> 01:01:47,831
The brain gets dehydrated
out here.

497
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:51,532
Sooner or later, it'll be
nothing but a dried up sponge

498
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:54,432
bouncing around in your skull.

499
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,592
Things start to get real
strange then.

500
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:03,472
Hallucinations, even.

501
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:07,992
You should rest, you should take
your shoes off.

502
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:10,473
Take it easy, breathe.

[maniacal chuckle]

513
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:55,715

Did you walk?

01:03:17,356 --> 01:03:19,356
Camel?

520
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:21,717
Magic carpet, maybe?

521
01:03:23,277 --> 01:03:25,277
You need to leave.

01:03:27,157 --> 01:03:29,317
Well, I think
you're hidin' somethin'.

and hatched a wee plan.

526

A bunch of greedy little pigs.

527
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:48,498
You think you can come out here

528
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:50,898
'cause your fucked-up city

530
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:58,459
No, you people are a virus
and you want me to leave.

Where are you?

01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:50,698
Nearly here?

559
01:09:51,058 --> 01:09:52,958
I got the excavator now

OK, listen.

01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:15,619
but it still may take longer
than I planned.

What hose?

578
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:01,642
The hose.

579
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,742
I fixed it before I left.

How's your water?
