00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,806
<i>It began as a holiday.</i>

4
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:19,437
<i>Arthur Howitzer Junior,
college freshman...</i>

5
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:22,274
<i>eager to escape a bright future
on the Great Plains...</i>

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,986
<i>convinced his father, proprietor
of the</i> Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun...

7
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,739
<i>to fund his transatlantic passage
as an educational opportunity...</i>

8
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,366
<i>to learn the family business...</i>

9
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,119
<i>through the production of a series of
travelogue columns...</i>

10
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:38,498
<i>to be published for local readers
in the Sunday</i> Picnic <i>magazine.</i>

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,263
<i>Over the next ten years,
he assembled a team...</i>

12
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,807
<i>of the best expatriate journalists
of his time...</i>

13
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:59,227
<i>and transformed
</i>Picnic <i>into</i> The French Dispatch...

14
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,399
<i>a factual weekly report
on the subjects of world politics...</i>

15
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:08,777
<i>the arts, high and low, fashion,
fancy cuisine, fine drink...</i>

16
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:13,366
<i>and diverse stories of
human interests set in faraway quartiers.</i>

17
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,621
<i>He brought the world to Kansas.</i>

18
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:26,171
<i>His writers line the spines
of every good American library.</i>

19
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,965
{\an8}<i>Berensen...</i>

20
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:31,509
<i>Sazerac...</i>

21
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:33,970
<i>Krementz...</i>

22
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,182
<i>Roebuck Wright.</i>

23
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,226
<i>One reporter known
as the best living writer...</i>

24
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,687
<i>in quality of sentences per minute.</i>

25
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,440
<i>One who never completed
a single article...</i>

26
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,735
<i>but haunted the halls
cheerily for three decades.</i>

27
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:53,657
<i>One privately blind writer who wrote
keenly through the eyes of others.</i>

28
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,453
<i>The uncontested crackerjack
of grammatical expertise.</i>

29
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:03,375
<i>Cover illustrations by Hermès Jones.</i>

30
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,752
<i>Famously gracious with his writers...</i>

31
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,506
<i>Arthur Junior was less courteous
with the rest of the magazine's staff.</i>

32
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,424
Oh, no, what's that?

33
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,009
I need a turkey.

34
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,137
Stuffed and roasted on a table
with all the trimmings and pilgrims!

35
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,474
<i>His fiscal management system
was convoluted but functional.</i>

36
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,394
Give her 150 francs a week
for the next 15 years...

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,355
against five American cents per word,
minus expenses.

38
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:29,442
<i>His most repeated literary advice,
perhaps apocryphal, was simply this...</i>

39
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,071
Just try to make it sound
like you wrote it that way on purpose.

40
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:37,450
<i>His return to Liberty comes precisely
50 years after his departure,</i>

41
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,703
{\an8}<i>on the occasion of his funeral...</i>

42
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,830
{\an8}<i>by which time the magazine's
circulation exceeds...</i>

43
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,833
{\an8}<i>half a million subscribers
in 50 countries.</i>

44
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,379
{\an8}<i>A willow hamper containing umpteen pins,
plaques, and official citations...</i>

45
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,881
<i>of the highest order
is buried at his side,</i>

46
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,592
<i>along with an Andretti Ribbon-mate...</i>

47
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:57,387
<i>and a ream of triple bond,
Egyptian cotton typing stock.</i>

48
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,269
<i>He received an Editor's burial.</i>

49
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,690
<i>In his will, he stipulated that...</i>

50
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,192
<i>immediately upon his death, quote...</i>

51
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,195
<i>The presses
will be dismantled and liquefied.</i>

52
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,948
<i>The editorial offices will be vacated
and sold.</i>

53
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:20,285
<i>The staff will be paid ample bonuses
and released from their contracts...</i>

54
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:23,455
<i>and the publication of the magazine
will permanently cease.</i>

55
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,248
<i>Thus...</i>

56
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:29,586
<i>the publisher's obituary will also serve
as that of this publication.</i>

57
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,174
<i>All home delivery readers will, of course,
be refunded, pro rata...</i>

58
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,218
<i>for the unfulfilled portion of
their subscriptions.</i>

59
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,807
<i>His epitaph will be taken verbatim
from the stenciled shingle...</i>

60
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,226
<i>fixed above the door of his inner office.</i>

61
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:47,103
Berensen's article.
<i>The Concrete Masterpiece.</i>

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,939
Three dangling participles,
two split infinitives...

63
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,982
and nine spelling errors
in the first sentence alone.

64
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,984
Some of those are intentional.

65
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,946
The Krementz story,
<i>Revisions to a Manifesto.</i>

66
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:58,740
We asked for 2,500 words,
and she came in at 14,000...

67
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,117
plus footnotes, endnotes,
a glossary, and two epilogues.

68
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,953
It's one of her best.

69
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,122
-Sazerac?
-Impossible to fact-check.

70
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,251
He changes all the names and only writes
about hobos, pimps, and junkies.

71
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,961
These are his people.

72
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,296
How about Roebuck Wright?

73
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,382
His door's locked,
but I could hear the keys clacking.

74
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,549
Don't rush him.

75
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,885
The question is, who gets killed?

76
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,221
There's one piece too many
even if we print another double-issue...

77
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,390
which we can't afford
under any circumstances.

78
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,812
A message from the foreman.
One hour to press.

79
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,772
You're fired.

80
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:32,857
Really?

81
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,569
Don't cry in my office.

82
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,329
Shrink the masthead, cut some ads,
and tell the foreman to buy more paper.

83
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,623
I'm not killing anybody.

84
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,502
<i>Good writers. He coddled them.</i>

85
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,422
<i>He coaxed them.
He ferociously protected them.</i>

86
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,382
What do you think?

87
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,633
For myself?

88
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,761
I would start with Mr. Sazerac.

89
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:04,180
<i>These were his people.</i>

90
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,784
<i>Ennui rises suddenly on a Monday.</i>

91
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,772
Through the time machine
of poetic license...

92
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,690
let us take a sight-seeing tour.

93
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:59,819
A day in Ennui over
the course of 250 years.

94
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:03,573
<i>The great city began as a cluster
of tradesman's villages.</i>

95
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,368
<i>Only the names remain unchanged.</i>

96
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,870
{\an8}<i>The Bootblack District.</i>

97
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:13,833
{\an8}<i>The Bricklayer's Quarter.</i>

98
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,421
{\an8}<i>The Butcher's Arcade.</i>

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,135
{\an8}<i>Pick-pocket Cul-de-Sac.</i>

100
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,057
{\an8}On this site, a fabled market...

101
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,935
{\an8}vending all forms of
victuals and comestibles...

102
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:36,022
{\an8}under a single vast,
glass-and-cast-iron canopy...

103
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,275
{\an8}later demolished, as you can see...

104
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:42,571
in favor of a multi-level shopping center
and parking structure.

105
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,031
Like every living city...

106
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,952
Ennui supports a menagerie
of vermin and scavengers.

107
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,040
<i>The rats which colonized
its subterranean railroad.</i>

108
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,670
<i>The cats
which colonized its slanty rooftops.</i>

109
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:03,300
<i>The</i> anguillettes <i>which colonized
its shallow drainage canals.</i>

110
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,179
<i>After receiving the Host,
marauding choirboys...</i>

111
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:11,725
<i>half-drunk on the Blood of Christ,
stalk unwary pensioners...</i>

112
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,560
<i>and seek havoc.</i>

113
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:18,064
<i>In the Flop Quarter, students.</i>

114
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,942
<i>Hungry, restless, reckless.</i>

115
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,944
<i>In the Hovel District...</i>

116
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,404
<i>old people.</i>

117
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,036
<i>Old people who have failed.</i>

118
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,540
<i>The automobile.</i>

119
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,918
A mixed blessing. On the one hand...

120
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,087
the honking, skidding, speeding,
sputtering, and backfiring.

121
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,591
The emission of toxic fumes
and filthy exhaust-pollution...

122
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,219
the dangerous accidents,
the constant traffic, the high...

123
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,930
Fuck!

124
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,515
<i>Department of Local Statistics.</i>

125
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,894
<i>Average rainfall, 750 millimeters.</i>

126
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,773
<i>Average snowfall, 190,000 flakes.</i>

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,360
<i>Eight-point-two-five bodies
are pulled from the Blasé river each week.</i>

128
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:06,404
<i>A figure which remains consistent despite
population growth...</i>

129
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,615
<i>and advances in health and hygiene.</i>

130
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,786
<i>As the sun sets,
a medley of unregistered streetwalkers...</i>

131
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,915
<i>and gigolos replaces the day's
delivery boys and shopkeepers...</i>

132
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:20,669
<i>and an air of promiscuous calm
saturates the hour.</i>

133
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,547
<i>What sounds will punctuate the night?</i>

134
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,717
<i>And what mysteries will they foretell?</i>

135
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,429
<i>Perhaps the doubtful
old maxim speaks true.</i>

136
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,434
<i>All grand beauties...</i>

137
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,604
<i>withhold their deepest secrets.</i>

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,404
"Rats, vermin, gigolos, streetwalkers."

139
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:50,198
You don't think it's almost
too seedy this time?

140
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,033
-No, I don't.
-For decent people.

141
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,743
It's supposed to be charming.

142
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,746
"Pick-pockets, dead bodies,
prisons, urinals..."

143
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,832
You don't want to add a flower shop...

144
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,166
-or an art museum?
-No, I don't.

145
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,793
A pretty place of some kind?

146
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,628
I hate flowers.

147
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,428
You could cut the second half
of the second paragraph, by the way.

148
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,847
You already repeat it later.

149
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,182
Okay.

150
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:43,830
<i>We take as the subject
of tonight's lecture...</i>

151
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,374
the great painter at the vanguard...

152
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,002
and heart of
the French Splatter-school Action-group...

153
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,463
Mr. Moses Rosenthaler.

154
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,590
Widely celebrated, as you know...

155
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:57,886
for the bold dramatic style,
and colossal scale of his middle-period...

156
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:01,681
in particular, of course,
the polyptych-tableaux known as...

157
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,435
<i>Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals.</i>

158
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:08,396
He remains, in my opinion,
the most eloquent...

159
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:14,194
and certainly, the loudest artistic voice
of his rowdy generation.

160
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,781
How does this pivotal piece
come to find its way...

161
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:21,243
into its unique position
as a permanent installation here...

162
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,078
at the Clampette Collection?

163
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,581
The story begins in a mess hall.

164
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:33,630
<i>The exhibition,
</i>Ashtrays, Pots, and Macramé...

165
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,466
{\an8}<i>a group show of handicrafts
by amateur artisans...</i>

166
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,719
<i>incarcerated in the lunatic section
of the Ennui Prison-Asylum...</i>

167
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,139
<i>might, perhaps, have been omitted
from the annals of art history...</i>

168
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:46,935
<i>had it not been for the inclusion
in its number of a small painting...</i>

169
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,688
<i>by Mr. Rosenthaler,
who was, at that time...</i>

170
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:52,732
{\an8}<i>serving a 50-year sentence
for the crime of double homicide...</i>

171
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,860
{\an8}<i>and the observation of that work
by a fellow inmate...</i>

172
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,863
{\an8}<i>the Levantine art dealer
Mr. Julian Cadazio...</i>

173
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,074
{\an8}<i>who, by fateful coincidence,
happened to be imprisoned...</i>

174
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,744
<i>in the adjoining annex on a charge of
second-degree sales tax evasion.</i>

175
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,871
Guard.

176
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,295
Who painted this picture?

177
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,844
Citizen 7524.

178
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:26,308
I believe that unit designates maximum
security for the demented and deranged.

179
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,311
Are you able to provide me an escort
and a Friendly Visit Stamp...

180
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,104
for immediate use?

181
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,171
<i>Simone, Naked, Cell Block J, Hobby Room.</i>

182
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,797
I wanna buy it.

183
00:14:58,715 --> 00:14:59,716
Why?

184
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,426
Because I like it.

185
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:03,803
It's not for sale.

186
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,138
Yes, it is.

187
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,016
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

188
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,434
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

189
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,102
-No, it isn't.
-It is, yes. It is.

190
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,272
All artists sell all their work.
It's what makes you an artist.

191
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,442
Selling it.If you don't wish
to sell it, don't paint it.

192
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,195
Question is, what's your price?

193
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,783
50 cigarettes.

194
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,660
Actually, make it 75.

195
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,038
Why do you keep looking at that guard?

196
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,295
She's Simone.

197
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:48,807
I don't want to buy this
important piece for 50 cigarettes.

198
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,101
-75.
-Or 75 of prison currency.

199
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:54,354
I want to pay you 250,000 francs
in legal French tender.

200
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,939
Do we agree on the sale?

201
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,198
I can only offer a deposit of...

202
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,994
83 <i>centimes,</i> one candied chestnut,
and four cigarettes.

203
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,204
Everything I have at this
present moment in time.

204
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,623
However, if you'll accept my
signatory voucher, I assure you...

205
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,125
a check for the outstanding balance

206
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,751
will be remitted to your account
within 90 days.

207
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,295
Where do you bank?

208
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:20,672
Never mind.

209
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,322
How'd you learn to do it, by the way?

210
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,907
Paint this kind of picture.

211
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,535
Also, who'd you murder,
and how crazy are you, really?

212
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:53,288
I need background information
so that we can do a book about you.

213
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,206
It makes you more important.

214
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,500
Who are you...

215
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,755
Moses Rosenthaler?

216
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,344
Born rich, the son
of a Jewish-Mexican horse rancher...

217
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:12,641
Miguel Sebastian Maria
Moisés de Rosenthaler...

218
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:16,769
trained at the <i>École des Antiquités
</i>at significant family expense.

219
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,522
But, by the end of his youth...

220
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,399
he had shed all the luxuries...

221
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,777
of his comfortable background
and replaced them with...

222
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:26,863
<i>Squalor.</i>

223
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:30,867
<i>Hunger.</i>

224
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:34,996
<i>Loneliness.</i>

225
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,751
<i>Physical danger.</i>

226
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,132
<i>Mental illness.</i>

227
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:50,262
<i>And, of course...</i>

228
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,390
{\an8}<i>Criminal violence.</i>

229
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,037
<i>He did not pick up a brush
during the first decade...</i>

230
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,206
<i>of his long prison sentence.</i>

231
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,182
Permission to sign up for
activity privileges, <i>gardienne.</i>

232
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:19,851
This thing?

233
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,486
What do you mean?

234
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,820
Tell the group about yourself.

235
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,781
-I don't wanna do that.
-It's mandatory.

236
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:34,491
-They know me already.
-That's not the point.

237
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,952
-I haven't even prepared a speech.
-Say something.

238
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,965
Well, I've been here
3,647 days and nights.

239
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:55,679
Another 14,603 to go.

240
00:19:56,304 --> 00:20:00,308
I drink 14 pints of mouthwash rations
per week.

241
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,852
At that rate...

242
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,313
I think I'm going to
poison myself to death...

243
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,149
before I ever get to see the world again,

244
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,861
which makes me feel...

245
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:14,281
very sad.

246
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,200
I gotta change my program.

247
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,911
I gotta go in a new direction.

248
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:24,332
Anything I can do to keep my hands busy,
I'm gonna do.

249
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,253
Otherwise...

250
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,048
I think maybe it's gonna be a suicide.

251
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,934
And that's why I signed up
for clay pottery and basket weaving.

252
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,855
My name is Moses.

253
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,357
Take a pew.

254
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,956
What's your name, <i>gardienne?</i>

255
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,249
Simone.

256
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:16,384
<i>Certain women do gravitate
toward incarcerated men.</i>

257
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,303
<i>It's a recognized condition.</i>

258
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,765
Something about the captivity of others...

259
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:25,101
enhances the experience
of their own freedom.

260
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,395
I assure you, it's erotic.

261
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,439
Look at her, by the way.

262
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,358
Born into quasi-serfdom...

263
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,068
16 brothers and sisters.

264
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,111
Illiterate until she was 20.

265
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:37,530
Now, a woman of considerable property.

266
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:38,865
Radiant.

267
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,033
Good God.

268
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,284
Wrong slide. That's me.

269
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:47,457
Simone, of course, refused all
Rosenthaler's entreaties of marriage...

270
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:49,751
which, we are told, were frequent...

271
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,170
and marvelously enthusiastic.

272
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,632
I wanna say it as simple as I can.

273
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,301
To try to shape it into words.

274
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,679
The feelings in my heart.

275
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,014
-I don't love you.
-I love you.

276
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:04,432
What?

277
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,976
I don't love you.

278
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,560
Already?

279
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,728
Already what?

280
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,313
Already how do you know that?

281
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,065
How can you be sure? It's so quick.

282
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:13,566
I'm sure.

283
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:15,569
Ouch.

284
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,529
That hurts me.

285
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:21,032
The cruelty of it. The cold-bloodedness.

286
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,910
You said what you wanted to say.
I tried to stop you. That's it.

287
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,371
I said part of what I wanted to say.

288
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:28,748
I was in the middle of it. There's more.

289
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:30,208
No.

290
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,295
-No what? Will you...
-No.

291
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,462
-Will you marry me?
-No.

292
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:03,116
I'm gonna need art supplies.

293
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:07,412
Canvas, stretchers, brushes, turpentine.

294
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,122
What do you want to paint?

295
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,957
The future.

296
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,796
Which is you.

297
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,426
Widely not considered
a great connoisseur...

298
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:24,512
Julian Cadazio, nevertheless,
had an eye for something,

299
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,432
and he did us all a very good turn...

300
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,393
when the hour he was released
from prison...

301
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,443
We're done with flowers and fruit bowls.

302
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:41,071
We're finished with beaches and seascapes.

303
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:44,157
We're getting out of armor, rugs,
and tapestries, too.

304
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,117
I found something new.

305
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,088
Modern art?

306
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:00,548
Modern art. Our specialty, starting now.

307
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,217
-I don't get it.
-Of course you don't.

308
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:03,468
-Am I too old?
-Of course you are.

309
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:05,679
-Why is this good?
-It isn't good. Wrong idea.

310
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:06,930
That's no answer.

311
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,932
My point. You see the girl in it?

312
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,183
No.

313
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,352
Trust me, she's there.

314
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:17,065
One way to tell if a modern artist
actually knows what he's doing...

315
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:20,569
is to get him to paint you a horse
or a flower or a sinking battleship...

316
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:22,404
or something that's
actually supposed to look like...

317
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,614
the thing that it's actually
supposed to look like.

318
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,117
Can he do it? Look at this.

319
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:30,245
Drawn in 45 seconds right in front of me
with a burnt matchstick.

320
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,581
A perfect sparrow. That's excellent.

321
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:33,748
May I keep it?

322
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:35,208
Don't be stupid. Of course not.

323
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,420
The point is, he could paint
this beautifully if he wanted...

324
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,672
but he thinks this is better.

325
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,799
And I think I sort of agree with him.

326
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,886
<i>Simone, Naked, Cell Block J, Hobby Room
</i>is probably a masterpiece...

327
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:50,056
worth a significant, even exorbitant,
sum of money.

328
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,142
But not yet.

329
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,186
The desire must be created.

330
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,107
How long is he in for?

331
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,370
Mr. Rosenthaler...

332
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,498
why should we put you back on the street?

333
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,002
Because it was an accident, Your Honor.

334
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:22,380
I didn't intend to kill anybody.

335
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:26,176
You decapitated two bartenders
with a meat saw.

336
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,016
The first bartender was an accident.

337
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,311
The second one was self-defense.

338
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:39,356
Well, be that as it may...

339
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:42,567
what demonstration of genuine remorse,
or, at the very least...

340
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:45,320
regret can you offer
for beheading these men?

341
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:51,159
They had it coming.

342
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:53,620
-I beg your pardon?
-Forgive me.

343
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:57,666
Is there a part of this ritual
where you ask...

344
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,418
if anybody has something
to say before it's too late?

345
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,836
Like, at a wedding.

346
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:04,047
-No.
-I'll be brief.

347
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:10,929
We all know this man is a murderer.

348
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,683
Totally guilty of first-degree homicide,
any way you slice it.

349
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:15,892
That's a given.

350
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:19,396
However, he's also that rare
once-in-a-generation guy...

351
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:23,066
that you hear about, but never get
the chance to discover for yourself.

352
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:26,152
An artistic genius.

353
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:28,363
Surely, there ought to be
a double standard

354
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:29,823
for this sort of predicament.

355
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:34,035
Supposedly, he's a psychotic, by the way.
That's not his fault.

356
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:36,663
Respectfully, I submit...

357
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:41,209
maybe we could think up
some other way to punish him?

358
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:45,088
<i>Rosenthaler's right to petition
for parole was permanently revoked...</i>

359
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,840
<i>for the duration of his sentence.</i>

360
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,759
No further questions.

361
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,097
Nevertheless, Cadazio and his uncles were
unanimous in their decision...

362
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:57,100
to promote the artist
as his exclusive brokers...

363
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,060
throughout the free world.

364
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:04,357
Simone<i> travelled far and wide.</i>

365
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:07,819
<i>The Ennui Salon.</i>

366
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,115
<i>The Royal Exposition.</i>

367
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:16,328
<i>The International Pavilion
at the Liberty, Kansas State Fair...</i>

368
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,622
<i>which was very nearly
burned to the ground.</i>

369
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,458
<i>In short, the picture was a sensation.</i>

370
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:26,504
<i>Even the artist's all but forgotten
earlier work...</i>

371
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:30,425
<i>inspired wildly robust sales
on the secondary market.</i>

372
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,722
Meanwhile, Rosenthaler
continued to work in confinement.

373
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:39,684
Strikingly, the artist favored
raw materials sourced...

374
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,646
exclusively from within
the prison-asylum domain.

375
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,065
<i>Powdered eggs.</i>

376
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:46,942
<i>Pigeon blood.</i>

377
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:48,818
<i>Shackle grease.</i>

378
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,862
<i>Coal, cork, and dung.</i>

379
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,489
<i>Fire, of course.</i>

380
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:54,783
<i>Bright yellow scullery soap.</i>

381
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,827
{\an8}<i>And fresh cream of millet
as a binding agent.</i>

382
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:01,456
<i>Simone liked to stand still.</i>

383
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:04,501
<i>Indeed, she was Olympian in her ability...</i>

384
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:07,754
<i>to hold extremely challenging positions
for extended periods of time.</i>

385
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,758
<i>She exhibited very little vulnerability
to extremes of heat or cold.</i>

386
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,678
<i>After even the most adverse
forms of exposure...</i>

387
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:18,848
<i>her skin remained unburned,
unblemished, un-goose-pimpled.</i>

388
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,058
<i>Another tidbit.</i>

389
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:23,061
<i>She genuinely enjoyed
the smell of turpentine...</i>

390
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:27,399
<i>and in later years actually wore it
in the application of her toilet.</i>

391
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,860
<i>She was more than a muse.</i>

392
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,409
Throw the switch.

393
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,962
Throw the switch, you cocksucker.

394
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,303
What's wrong with you? Go back to work.

395
00:28:57,262 --> 00:28:58,972
I can't.

396
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:01,349
I won't. It's too hard.

397
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,060
It's torture.

398
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,814
I'm literally a tortured artist.

399
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:12,235
Poor baby.

400
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:14,029
Get out.

401
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,255
Is that what you want?

402
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,962
What's your problem?

403
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:14,965
I don't know what to paint.

404
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,342
The French Splatter-school Action group.

405
00:30:59,843 --> 00:31:03,513
A dynamic, talented, lusty, slovenly,
alcoholic...

406
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,433
violent pack of creative savages.

407
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,520
They inspired and very often...

408
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,982
personally attacked each other
for two decades and more.

409
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:15,901
I'll have my drink now.

410
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:23,575
Remember, in those days, as you know...

411
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:27,746
it was much more socially acceptable
for a painter or a sculptor...

412
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:31,750
to hit another fellow
with a chair or even a brick...

413
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,837
or walk around with a black eye
or a broken tooth and so on.

414
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,216
Indeed, I'm jumping ahead,
but in my own experience...

415
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:43,929
Rosenthaler could be quite
unpredictably impulsive.

416
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:47,641
Meaning, I refer to the pigment locker
beneath his studio...

417
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,809
in the <i>Boulevard des Plombiers,
</i>on one occasion...

418
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,145
he grabbed me and put me in there,

419
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:55,649
and inappropriately, sort of,
tried to fuck me...

420
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:57,984
against the wall in the corner
of that pigment locker.

421
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:01,404
He was crazy. Officially certified.

422
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:14,292
The Cadazios, of course,
represented them all.

423
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,346
It's three years later.

424
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:28,306
We've made you
the most famous painter alive...

425
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:31,351
based on one small,
scribbly, overrated picture.

426
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:32,894
You're an art school course.

427
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:34,562
You're an encyclopedia entry.

428
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:37,524
Even your disciples have won
and squandered multiple fortunes...

429
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,402
yet you refuse to show us
so much as a sketch or a study...

430
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:43,697
for a single new piece
during this entire, protracted period.

431
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:45,365
How long are we meant to wait?

432
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,617
Well, don't answer,
because we're not asking.

433
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,495
We already printed the invitations.

434
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:51,955
We're coming in.

435
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,416
All of us. The collectors. The critics.

436
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,085
Even your second-rate imitators
we represent who suck up to you...

437
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:59,838
and smuggle you goodies and probably
turn out to be better than you are.

438
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,090
The bribes alone
are going to be outrageous,

439
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:03,383
as these guards can assure you.

440
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:04,968
But we're gonna pay 'em.

441
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:06,803
So, finish it, whatever it is.

442
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,180
The show is in two weeks.

443
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,065
She thinks it's ready, by the way.

444
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:20,650
It's ready.

445
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,196
I could use another year.

446
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:32,120
My employer, at that time,
received the intriguing summons...

447
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:34,164
by rapid-priority wire.

448
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:37,959
I refer, of course,
to Upshur "Maw" Clampette.

449
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,254
Astute collector of antiquities.

450
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,048
Great friend to the <i>avant-garde.</i>

451
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:46,509
Her collection, even in its infancy,
was well-known and important...

452
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:50,347
as was her residence,
Ingo Steen's first American commission...

453
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:53,642
informally known as the Doorstop House.

454
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:58,480
It was my duty, and I may say,
my privilege to catalogue...

455
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:01,983
archive, and advise, although she did
whatever the hell she wanted...

456
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,194
no matter what you told her, anyway.

457
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:09,241
<i>Thus, we began the long journey
from Liberty to Ennui.</i>

458
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:13,203
<i>My dear Mrs. Clampette, Maw, if I may,</i>

459
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,414
<i>please join us for the first display of
Mr. Moses Rosenthaler's...</i>

460
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:18,124
<i>extremely exciting new work,</i>

461
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,251
<i>which I, myself,
have not yet been permitted to see.</i>

462
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:23,213
<i>In order to facilitate the viewing
in a timely fashion...</i>

463
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,713
<i>it may prove necessary for us</i>

464
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:26,967
<i>to surreptitiously gain access
to the facility...</i>

465
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,135
<i>where the artist currently resides.</i>

466
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:32,055
<i>Please rely on my operatives to organize
any and all details...</i>

467
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:33,847
<i>and preparations for your visit.</i>

468
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:37,978
<i>Caution, do not bring matches, lighters,
or sharp objects of any kind.</i>

469
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,356
<i>We await your confirmation
with cheerful anticipation.</i>

470
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:45,610
<i>Yours most truly, Cadazio Uncles
and Nephew Galerie concern.</i>

471
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:52,325
<i>The paddy wagon collected us directly
after the night's final round...</i>

472
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,535
<i>of working girls and revelers</i>

473
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:56,371
<i>were delivered to the drunk tank
at 3:00 a.m.</i>

474
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,920
Moses, are you here?

475
00:35:48,173 --> 00:35:49,841
Any words of introduction?

476
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:53,428
Or perhaps, a welcome to our
wonderful guests, some of whom...

477
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:56,014
have traveled a great distance
to come see your work, I hope?

478
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:58,934
Or, alternatively, just, I don't know.

479
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,602
Hello?

480
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,857
Quiet, please!

481
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:08,109
Quiet, please!

482
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,241
I did it. It's good! This is historic.

483
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,117
Open the champagne! I did it.

484
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:17,285
Music!

485
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,043
Why are you sitting in a wheelchair
like an invalid?

486
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,087
You should be dancing on the tables!
It's a triumph!

487
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,843
Do you like it?

488
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,638
Do I like it?

489
00:36:37,013 --> 00:36:38,265
Yes.

490
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:46,690
Look at Maw, she's mesmerized.

491
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,735
This here's a fresco, t'weren't it?

492
00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:53,655
Precisely. He's a Renaissance master
of the highest order.

493
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:55,699
He mines the same vein
as Piperno Pierluigi

494
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,783
when he illuminated...

495
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,036
<i>The Christ Before God's Heavenly Altar
</i>in 1565.

496
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:02,872
Maw, nobody has an eye
for things nobody has ever seen...

497
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,041
like Maw Clampette of Liberty, Kansas.

498
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,544
We should be ashamed to even gather
in her presence.

499
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:09,337
Why the fuck did she say fresco?

500
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,174
Are they painted into the walls?

501
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,094
Oh, no. What has he done?

502
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,555
You fucking asshole.

503
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:19,889
Are you seeing this? Look at this!

504
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,058
-Well, I think it's utterly wonderful.
-It's crucial!

505
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:24,769
It's probably a turning point in
the evolution of human pictography.

506
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:28,106
Scratched and plastered into a reinforced
cement aggregate gymnasium.

507
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:29,733
He even painted onto the radiators!

508
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:33,570
Maybe one of them restoration fellers out
at the <i>Fondazione dell'Arte Classico...</i>

509
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:35,697
could figure a way to rustle
them pictures loose.

510
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:37,657
We're in a maximum-security prison, Maw.

511
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:38,825
It's federal property.

512
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:41,411
Even to begin the bureaucratic nightmare
would require years...

513
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,831
of negotiation with a team of highly-paid,
arrogant, obnoxious advocates.

514
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:47,125
I don't even know how you'd peel them off.
It's a fresco.

515
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,629
Hey! It's a fresco!

516
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:52,589
So what?

517
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:55,175
Can you even begin to fathom
the shit-ton of money...

518
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:58,219
my uncles and I have squandered
to get to this point of no return?

519
00:37:58,637 --> 00:37:59,763
Look at them!

520
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,349
You've ruined us!

521
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:03,892
Does it mean nothing to you?

522
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:05,310
I thought you liked it.

523
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:08,480
I think it stinks!

524
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:10,774
Get out of that wheelchair!

525
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:13,485
I'm going to kick your ass
up and down this hobby room!

526
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,573
Don't growl at me,
you convicted murderer.

527
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:23,495
You homicidal, suicidal,
psychopathic, no-talent drunk!

528
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:50,063
Why didn't you tell me, <i>gardienne?</i>

529
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:53,233
Because you would've stopped him.

530
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:01,575
We have to accept it.

531
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:03,660
His need to fail is more powerful...

532
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,454
than our strongest desires
to help him succeed.

533
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:08,665
I give up. He's defeated us.

534
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:11,126
-He's defeated us.
-Sad, but there it is.

535
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:16,548
Anyway, at least,
he finished the motherfucker.

536
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:20,885
It is, perhaps, the most interesting
contemplation of peripheral vision...

537
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:22,596
I've ever seen.

538
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:32,147
Well done, Moses.

539
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:45,243
Well done, Moses.
This has a greatness to it.

540
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,497
If you plastered it deep enough,
it may last.

541
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:52,834
We'll come and see it again one day.

542
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:54,461
God willing.

543
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:57,172
You'll already still be here, of course.

544
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,301
It's all Simone.

545
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:19,903
<i>At that moment, they were both aware of
Simone's intention...</i>

546
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:21,238
<i>to leave her position</i>

547
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:23,448
<i>at the Ennui Prison-Asylum
the following day...</i>

548
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,159
<i>endowed with funds
provided by the Cadazios...</i>

549
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:30,330
<i>as compensation for her work
as Rosenthaler's model and muse.</i>

550
00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:34,042
<i>She was reunited with the estranged child
to whom...</i>

551
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,835
<i>she had given birth in her youth,</i>

552
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:38,588
<i>and the two never again lived apart.</i>

553
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:42,300
<i>She and Rosenthaler
maintained a regular correspondence...</i>

554
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,261
<i>for the rest of the artist's life.</i>

555
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:52,227
Mrs. Clampette would like
to put the piece on hold.

556
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:54,646
The half-sticker?

557
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:55,981
Yes, please.

558
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:57,649
Should she choose to finalize the sale...

559
00:40:57,816 --> 00:41:00,527
will this amount be acceptable to you
and your uncles?

560
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:05,490
Can we get a deposit?

561
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:09,327
Maw? An advance against the total sum?

562
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:14,291
Tell them stingy Frenchmen
I ain't making no promises.

563
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:17,168
Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals...

564
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:19,838
<i>was to remain on hold under the name
Upshur Clampette...</i>

565
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:21,965
<i>for the subsequent 20 years.</i>

566
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,721
{\an8}Which prisoners?

567
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,145
{\an8}Tell them we don't bribe
rapists and pickpockets. It's unethical.

568
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:38,273
Besides, I didn't bring an additional
6,000,000 francs in small bills.

569
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:46,323
How'd you get out there?

570
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,283
What do we do?

571
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:49,784
Lock the door.

572
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:01,588
<i>In the aftermath, 72 prisoners...</i>

573
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,548
<i>and six members
of the French Splatter-school</i>

574
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:06,217
<i>lay dead or mortally wounded.</i>

575
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:09,471
<i>Moses Rosenthaler,
for acts of extreme valor...</i>

576
00:42:09,638 --> 00:42:13,767
<i>which saved the lives of nine guards,
22 distinguished visitors...</i>

577
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,977
<i>and the Ministers
of Culture and Urbanity...</i>

578
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:19,439
<i>received his freedom
with probation for life.</i>

579
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:24,402
<i>And was decorated
in the Order of the Caged Lion.</i>

580
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:34,871
<i>One score later, as per
Maw Clampette's detailed instructions...</i>

581
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:38,792
<i>Cadazio and his own nephews arranged for
the entirety of the hobby room...</i>

<i>to be relocated onboard a Goliath aviation
12-engine artillery transport...</i>

583
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,925
<i>directly from Ennui to Liberty.</i>

584
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:54,683
<i>In this form, the</i> avant-garde
<i>assumed its place...</i>

585
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:57,310
<i>upon the plains of Central Kansas.</i>

{\an8}"pushpins, typewriter repairman."

588

{\an8}Why am I paying for a hotel room

589
00:43:17,038 --> 00:43:19,249
{\an8}at a beach club
on the North Atlantic coast?

590
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,293
{\an8}Because I had to go there to write it.

591

{\an8}"Breakfast, lunch, dinner, laundry,
nightcap, midnight snack."

{\an8}Don't ask me to be indiscreet about
what happened between me and Moses...

595
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:36,057
{\an8}at a seaside inn 20 years ago.
We were lovers.

596
00:43:36,224 --> 00:43:37,892
{\an8}I went back to remember.

597
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:39,603
{\an8}On my dime.

598
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:40,895
{\an8}Yes, please.

599
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,065
{\an8}Add it up.

600
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:07,422
{\an8}<i>March 1st.</i>

<i>break down abruptly
in early morning hours...</i>

603
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,890
<i>after clamorous debate,
angry name-calling...</i>

604
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:19,643
<i>and, finally, outright gambling over...</i>

605

<i>the right of free access to the girl's
dormitory for all male students.</i>

606
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,025
<i>The protest which ended in a stalemate...</i>

607
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,781
{\an8}<i>...gave the superficial appearance
of a vanity exercise...</i>

608
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:35,200
{\an8}<i>for the pimple-cream
and wet-dream contingent.</i>

<i>But, in fact,
the sexes were equally represented.</i>

shoes!

00:44:46,962 --> 00:44:50,215
<i>And all participants emphasized
the basis of their frustration...</i>

<i>a desire, more, a biological need...</i>

<i>for freedom. Full stop.</i>

615
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,557
<i>It has exploded into symbolism...</i>

00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:10,777
<i>Eldest boy, 19, not home
since yesterday morning.</i>

620
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:15,740
{\an8}<i>Father chanced upon him midday,
marching alongside his comrades.</i>

621
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:16,908
<i>Their slogan...</i>

622
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:19,578
<i>"The children are grumpy."</i>

623
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,037
Thank you.

624
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,665
<i>An additional dinner guest,
thus far, fails to appear.</i>

625
00:45:23,832 --> 00:45:25,125
<i>For this, I am grateful.</i>

626
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,502
<i>Had not been informed of his invitation
in first place.</i>

627
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:30,630
We didn't mean to offend you. We're sorry.

628
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:33,967
We thought you might decline
the invitation if we warned you.

629
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,260
-You were right.
-Yeah.

630
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:37,929
<i>Local news reports aggressive
crowd-control methods</i>

631
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:40,140
<i>in use on street today. Quote...</i>

632
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,684
Just give him a chance.
He's very intelligent.

633
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:45,145
So, how long has it been
since what's-his-name?

634
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:46,396
I know you mean well.

635
00:45:46,563 --> 00:45:49,858
<i>"It begins with a prickly tingling
of the exposed skin."</i>

636
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:56,072
I'm not an old maid.

637
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,699
We don't think that.

638
00:45:58,575 --> 00:45:59,576
Of course you're not.

639
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:02,913
<i>"Then, a reddening and swelling
of the orbital muscles."</i>

640
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:04,497
Take me at my word.

641
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:06,708
I live by myself on purpose.

642
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,960
I prefer relationships that end.

643
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,088
I deliberately choose to have
neither husband nor children.

644
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:16,384
The two greatest deterrents to any woman's
attempt to live by and for writing.

645
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:18,678
-Why are we crying?
-Because it's sad.

646
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:20,347
We don't want you to be alone.

647
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:21,932
Loneliness is a kind of poverty.

648
00:46:22,098 --> 00:46:23,475
I'm not sad. My eyes hurt.

649
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:25,352
There's something wrong
with your apartment.

650
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:29,022
<i>"Finally, a barrage of searing pain
as snot pours from the nostrils...</i>

651
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:30,815
<i>"and the throat spasms and constricts."</i>

652
00:46:30,982 --> 00:46:31,983
Don't breathe.

653
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,456
I'm naked, Mrs. Krementz.

654
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,500
I can see that.

655
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,502
-Why are you crying?
-Tear gas.

656
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,753
Also...

657
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,756
I suppose I'm sad.

658
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:59,552
Please turn away.
I feel shy about my new muscles.

659
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:06,559
Go tell your parents you're home.
They're worried.

660
00:47:06,726 --> 00:47:08,687
I'm expected back on the barricades.

661
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:10,272
I didn't see any barricades.

662
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:12,857
Well, we're still constructing them.

663
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,943
What are you writing?

664
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,361
A manifesto.

665
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,446
I told them not to invite Paul,
by the way.

666
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:21,074
Maybe you're sad,
but you don't seem lonely to me.

667
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:22,242
Exactly!

668
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,869
I saw you at the protest
on top of a bookcase taking notes.

669
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:27,956
Is there a story in us?
For the people of Kansas.

670
00:47:28,331 --> 00:47:29,332
Maybe.

671
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:30,500
Then you should study our resolutions.

672
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:33,753
Or, anyway, will you proofread it?
My parents think you're a good writer.

673
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:36,464
Give it to me.

674
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,267
It's a little damp.

675
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:49,686
Physically or metaphorically?

676
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,480
Both. Based on the cover
and the first four sentences.

677
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:54,316
Don't criticize my manifesto.

678
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:55,692
Oh, you don't want remarks?

679
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,277
I don't need remarks, do I?

680
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:58,570
I only asked you to proofread it...

681
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:00,906
'cause I thought you'd be even more
impressed by how good it already is.

682
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,074
Let's start with the typos.

683
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:06,536
Can the faculty succeed
if the students fail?

684
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:08,788
It remains to be seen.

685
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:11,249
-Paul Duval.
-Lucinda Krementz.

686
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:12,417
How do you do?

687
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:15,170
Your beard is scratching me.

688
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:19,883
<i>Unexpected guest finally arrives.
Looks like hell.</i>

689
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,760
<i>Describes odyssey across city.</i>

690
00:48:22,093 --> 00:48:23,595
<i>Stalled trains, stalled buses...</i>

691
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:26,973
<i>broken windows, paving stones
flying in all directions.</i>

692
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,143
Anyway, we're here.

693
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,687
The famous Lucinda. Hello.

694
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,523
I did not know you were coming.
They did not tell me.

695
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,692
This is not an official meeting.

696
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,741
<i>Good evening.</i>

697
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,335
<i>Start without me.</i>

698
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:13,144
<i>March 10th. City services at a halt,
one week and counting.</i>

699
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:15,522
<i>Public transportation, suspended.</i>

700
00:49:15,689 --> 00:49:18,775
<i>Piles of garbage, uncollected.
Schools on strike.</i>

701
00:49:18,942 --> 00:49:20,569
<i>No mail, no milk.</i>

702
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:21,736
It's me again.

703
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:23,321
<i>What will normal reality be?</i>

704
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:27,158
<i>Next week, next month, whenever, if ever,
we get the chance to experience it again.</i>

705
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:28,743
<i>Anyone's guess.</i>

706
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:30,078
What's this part?

707
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:31,663
I added an appendix.

708
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:33,123
-You're joking.
-No, I'm not.

709
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:35,041
You finished my manifesto without me.

710
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,960
I made it sound like you, I think.

711
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,545
Just more clear, more concise...

712
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:40,046
a bit less poetic.

713
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:43,842
Put it this way, this isn't
the first manifesto I've proofread.

714
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,056
<i>Impossible to imagine these students,</i>

715
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:52,851
<i>exhilarated, naive,
brave in the extreme...</i>

716
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:56,813
<i>returning to their obedient classrooms.</i>

717
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:06,615
Who was that?

718
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:08,241
-Your mother.
-My mother.

719
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:10,035
My mother?

720
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:11,703
What did she want?
Did you tell her I was here?

721
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,330
-Yes.
-Why?

722
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:15,332
Because she asked. I don't lie.

723
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:17,000
Was she upset?

724
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,209
I don't think so.

725
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:20,128
-What did she say?
-She nodded.

726
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:21,379
What did you say?

727
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:24,132
I told her I was working on an article
about you and your friends.

728
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:26,009
So, you are.

729
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:28,261
I've already written 1,000 words.

730
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:29,804
I asked to interview her.

731
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:30,972
Did she agree?

732
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:32,307
Yes, of course.

733
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:35,685
Well, I am upset!

734
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:37,520
I don't know how to feel.

735
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:40,398
Am I in trouble?
Why would my mother be so calm?

736
00:50:40,565 --> 00:50:42,025
Is this proper?

737
00:50:42,442 --> 00:50:45,403
This is all off-the-record. Everything.
My whole life.

738
00:50:47,656 --> 00:50:49,241
What am I supposed to do now?

739
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:53,078
I should maintain journalistic neutrality.

740
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:04,589
I like how ruthless you are.

741
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:07,217
It's part of your beauty, I think.

742
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:11,513
So, you've got 1,000 words already?

743
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:15,392
<i>The kids did this.</i>

744
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:19,437
<i>Obliterated 1,000 years of Republican
authority in less than a fortnight.</i>

745
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:21,523
<i>How and why?</i>

746
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,192
<i>Before it began,
where did it begin?</i>

747
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:33,493
{\an8}<i>It was another time. It was another Ennui.</i>

748
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:37,289
{\an8}<i>Must be nearly six months ago, I guess.
My sisters were still 12, anyway.</i>

749
00:51:43,628 --> 00:51:46,131
<i>You danced to the Craze
and the</i> Lait Chaud.

750
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:52,220
<i>You wore your hairdo in the Pompidou,
the Crouton, or the</i> Fruits-de-Mer.

751
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:54,931
<i>Your slang mixed bits of Latin</i>

752
00:51:55,015 --> 00:51:57,684
<i>with philosophy jargon
and manual signaling.</i>

753
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:02,147
<i>Devil's advocates bickered
and debated perpetually, ad nauseam,</i>

754
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:03,898
<i>only for the sake of argument.</i>

755
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,570
<i>Every clique had a rival.</i>

756
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,826
<i>The Nuts had the Bolts.
The Sticks had the Stones.</i>

757
00:52:14,993 --> 00:52:16,870
<i>The Jocks had us, the Bookworms,</i>

758
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,663
<i>until Mitch-Mitch failed
the baccalaureate...</i>

759
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,207
<i>and got sent down
to National Duty-obligation.</i>

760
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,501
<i>Three months in the Mustard Region.</i>

761
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,790
He was sent to the Mustard Region
for National Duty-obligation.

762
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:06,169
I'm sorry?

763
00:53:07,796 --> 00:53:10,590
How dare you? Who gave you permission
to besmirch our friend?

764
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:11,758
Does it occur to you...

765
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:14,094
he's very probably somewhere marching
in the middle of the night right now...

766
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,846
carrying a 50-pound sack of gunpowder
and peeling stale potatoes...

767
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:19,599
while he digs a latrine trench
in the rain with a tin cup?

768
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,351
He doesn't want to be in the military.

769
00:53:28,984 --> 00:53:32,487
Easy for you to say
from the comfort of the <i>Sans Blague.</i>

770
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:41,997
Mitch-Mitch, what are you doing here?

771
00:53:42,163 --> 00:53:44,457
You're supposed to be in the Mustard
Region for another two months.

772
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:46,835
<i>Five years later, I, myself, translated...</i>

773
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:51,548
<i>Mitch-Mitch Simca's poetic interpretation
of his National Duty-obligation service.</i>

774
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:58,179
<i>The flashback scene
in Act Two of</i> Goodbye, Zeffirelli.

775
00:53:58,346 --> 00:54:00,932
In North Africa,
I caught a bullet in the tail.

776
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:03,768
In South America, I caught a chunk
of high-explosive shrapnel

777
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:05,061
in the left wing.

778
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:08,815
In East Asia, I picked up a rare,
microbial, infectious gut-parasite...

779
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:12,652
in the lower abdominal cavity,
and I've got them all with me right now...

780
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:14,154
still in my body...

781
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,116
but I don't regret my choice
to wear this uniform.

782
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:21,578
And in 16 years, I'll get my pension.

783
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:25,206
Well, that's your bedtime story, ladies.
Lights out!

784
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:28,084
Hup! Ho! Hut! Lights out!
Covers tucked! Blankets on!

785
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:29,544
-Pray your prayers!
-Sir!

786
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:37,302
Amen. Amen. Amen.

787
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,895
Psst, Mitch-Mitch. Psst.

788
00:54:47,312 --> 00:54:49,898
Psst, Mitch-Mitch. What do you wanna be?

789
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:51,316
What?

790
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:53,109
What do you want to be, Mitch-Mitch?

791
00:54:53,735 --> 00:54:56,529
With my grades,
I'll be an assistant pharmacist.

792
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:58,323
Will that make you be satisfied?

793
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:01,534
It won't depress me.
I should have studied harder.

794
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:03,036
And you, Robouchon?

795
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:06,373
I have no choice.
I'll work for my father's glass factory.

796
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:08,124
Someone has to take over.

797
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,292
It's normal.

798
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,086
Vaugirard. What's your plan?

799
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:13,463
I suppose I'll continue
to be an attractive wastrel...

800
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,298
like my cousins on both sides
of the family.

801
00:55:15,465 --> 00:55:17,133
-Your cousins are the best.
-I love your cousins.

802
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,386
-Yeah.
-What about you, Morisot?

803
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,181
Morisot, what do you want to be?

804
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:26,977
A protestor.

805
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:29,312
What'd he say?

806
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:30,939
He said, "A protestor."

807
00:55:31,106 --> 00:55:32,107
What does he mean?

808
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,191
I don't know.

809
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:36,528
I thought Morisot was supposed to be
a professor of geological chemistry.

810
00:55:36,695 --> 00:55:37,821
Morisot's crying.

811
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:39,823
Who said "shh"?

812
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:41,491
I won't do it.

813
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:46,246
It's only eight more weeks, Morisot,
before we complete the program.

814
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,290
I don't mean the program.

815
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:53,295
I mean from when we go home
until retirement age.

816
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:57,799
That 48-year period of my life, I mean.
That's what I won't do.

817
00:55:58,842 --> 00:56:03,179
I can no longer envision myself
as a grown-up man in our parents' world.

818
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:14,441
Morisot!
He went out the window!

819
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:17,819
-Is he dead?
-I don't know.

820
00:56:17,986 --> 00:56:19,154
How far did he fall?

821
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:20,322
Five floors with high ceilings.

822
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:23,158
It rained last night.
Maybe the mud's still soft.

823
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:24,451
He's not moving.

824
00:56:26,077 --> 00:56:27,454
He's still not moving.

825
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,415
He's still not moving.

826
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,043
He's still not moving.

827
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:35,503
He's still not moving.

828
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:37,547
He's still not moving.

829
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:39,841
He's still not moving.

830
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:13,124

{\an8}Polished it. Certain passages.

871
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:34,636

You're a very bright girl, Juliette.

876
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:56,866
If you put away your powder puff
for one minute, forgive me...

877
01:01:57,033 --> 01:01:59,077
and think for yourself for one minute,
forgive me...

878
01:01:59,286 --> 01:02:01,413
you might realize
you're all in this together.

{\an8}Our move.

881
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,431
{\an8}That was impolite. Of me.

882
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:21,558
I withdraw the remark.

883
01:02:24,394 --> 01:02:25,562
{\an8}I beg your pardon.

884

{\an8}Thank you.

886
01:02:33,194 --> 01:02:34,362
{\an8}You're sure?

887
01:02:39,868 --> 01:02:41,411
{\an8}Sure you're not a child?

888
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:46,875
{\an8}Then learn to accept an apology.
That's important.

Grown-ups.

890
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,637
Our move. The mayor's waiting.

891
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:21,910
Kindly leave me my dignity.

892
01:03:23,328 --> 01:03:25,789
She's not an old maid.
She's not in love with me.

893
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:27,582
She's our friend. I'm her friend.

894
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:29,584
She's confused.
She wants to help us.

895
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,629
She's angry.
She's a very good writer.

896
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,675
It's a lonely life, isn't it?

897
01:03:38,176 --> 01:03:39,469
Sometimes.

898
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:43,765

900
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:49,938

901
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:17,591
It's just fireworks.

902
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:19,718
She's the best of them.

903
01:04:20,302 --> 01:04:22,929
Stop bickering. Go make love.

904
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:30,103
Me, too. Except for Mrs. Krementz.

905
01:04:31,354 --> 01:04:32,564

a photographic memory.

01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,791
-Is that true?
-That is false.

960
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,168
I have a typographic memory.

considerable accuracy and detail.

In other spheres, my powers of retention
are distinctly impressionistic.

I'm known to my intimates
as a most forgetful man.

Yet you remember
every word you ever wrote.

The novels, the essays, the poems,
the plays...

The unrequited valentines. Sadly, I do.

This is my oldest friend, Chou-fleur.

When I met him,
he was a girlish little schoolboy...

1028
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:03,570
with ringlets and a full set of teeth.

1029
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:06,281
Now, he looks like a corpse.

1030
01:15:07,032 --> 01:15:09,200
In the corner, Patrolman Maupassant.

1031

He'll be serving.

Cocktails.

1033
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:20,128
And this is my son, Gigi,
in the crime-lab smock.

What are you stealing

<i>cemented together by their shared grief.</i>

1043

<i>Gigi was six.</i>

1044
01:15:47,197 --> 01:15:50,200
<i>His schoolrooms were the station house
and the squad car.</i>

1045
01:15:51,534 --> 01:15:55,247
<i>He was educated by forensic tutors
in the traditions of law enforcement.</i>

1046
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:00,418
<i>His first drawings were facial composites
based on eyewitness testimony.</i>

1047

<i>His first words were in Morse code.</i>

1048
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:09,552
{\an8}<i>It was, I suppose, wonderfully obvious.</i>

1049
01:16:09,636 --> 01:16:12,681
<i>He was brought up to succeed
the Commissaire himself.</i>

Yes, I've read you. In the magazine.

To your satisfaction?

1052
01:16:20,438 --> 01:16:22,274
Of course. Of course.

1053
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,692
Good writer.

1054
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:29,197
I trust you are already familiar

01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:06,795
<i>Release or execute the Abacus...</i>

1082
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:09,297
<i>and the little boy will be safely
returned to your custody.</i>

1083
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:13,260
<i>Failure to do so by sun-up will result
in your son's violent death.</i>

1084
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,643
<i>Three.</i>

1085
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:23,561
<i>The skylight window
of the makeshift nursery...</i>

1086
01:18:23,728 --> 01:18:26,856
<i>which occupies the attic quarters
jimmied ajar.</i>

1087
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:04,102
<i>The getaway and eventual motor pursuit
was rendered vividly...</i>

1088
01:19:04,269 --> 01:19:06,229
<i>if, perhaps, a bit fancifully,
in a comic strip...</i>

1089
01:19:06,396 --> 01:19:08,064
<i>published the following week.</i>

1090
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:44,893
<i>Though the infamous Ennui gang war...</i>

1091
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,647
<i>"Winter Crimewave" had eradicated
a healthy number of thugs and hooligans...</i>

1092
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:50,482
<i>it had also claimed the lives...</i>

1093
01:19:50,649 --> 01:19:53,401
<i>of a disgraceful proportion
of innocent citizens.</i>

1094
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:57,822
<i>Due to the surprise capture
of the racketeering accountant...</i>

1095
01:19:57,989 --> 01:20:01,493
<i>Albert "the Abacus", in possession
of a valise containing payroll stubs...</i>

1096
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,204
<i>for all three of the city's
major syndicates...</i>

1097
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:07,123
<i>the law-abiding community's hopes
for an accelerated resolution...</i>

1098
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:09,417
<i>to the crisis had been renewed.</i>

1099
01:20:14,547 --> 01:20:17,592
<i>However, this turn of events had
forcefully rattled the cages...</i>

1100
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:20,095
<i>of the denizens
of the criminal underworld.</i>

1101
01:20:26,309 --> 01:20:29,312
For myself, I had failed to recognize
the Abacus...

1102
01:20:29,562 --> 01:20:32,232
but as it happened,
I knew the chicken coop.

1103
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,067
This is not in the article, by the way.

1104
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:36,403
If I refer to Mr. Howitzer,
do you know who I mean?

1105
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,154
Of course. Arthur Howitzer, Jr.

1106
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:40,240
Founder and editor of <i>The French Dispatch.</i>

1107
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,743
It was my first week in Ennui
when I suffered the misfortune...

1108
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,538
of being arrested
in a drinking establishment...

1109
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:48,707
on the fringes of the Flop Quarter...

1110
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:52,294
along with a number of
newly-found companions.

1111
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,045
What was the charge?

1112
01:20:54,462 --> 01:20:55,880
Love.

1113
01:20:56,715 --> 01:20:59,050
You see, people may or may not
be mildly threatened...

1114
01:20:59,259 --> 01:21:01,720
by your anger, your hatred,
your pride...

1115
01:21:01,886 --> 01:21:04,180
but love the wrong way...

1116
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:06,558
and you will find yourself
in great jeopardy.

1117
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:10,437
In this case, a chicken coop jail cell
for six days straight.

1118
01:21:10,895 --> 01:21:14,065
I had no one who cared to rescue me,
and no one who cared to scold me.

1119
01:21:14,566 --> 01:21:18,403
And the only local number
committed to my typographic memory was...

1120
01:21:19,029 --> 01:21:21,114
<i>Printer's District 9-2211.</i>

1121
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,951
<i>While I regret we are unable to publish
either of these specific pieces...</i>

1122
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,204
<i>I would be very pleased to consider
other submissions in the future.</i>

1123
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:30,498
<i>Or if you find yourself in Ennui...</i>

1124
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:37,756
<i>I'd never met the man.</i>

1125
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:41,635
<i>I knew how to reach him
only because I wanted a job.</i>

1126
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:01,780
Let's see here.

1127
01:22:02,948 --> 01:22:05,909
High school newspaper,
poetry club, drama society.

1128
01:22:06,117 --> 01:22:08,954
Wrote the school song.
Words and music.

1129
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,332
Junior researcher,
cub reporter, assistant editor.

1130
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,625
Fires and murders.

1131
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,001
That's how I started.

1132
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,045
My father owned the paper, of course.

1133
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:19,965
Bit of sports, bit of crime,
bit of politics.

1134
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,342
Shortlisted twice, Best Essays.

1135
01:22:22,509 --> 01:22:24,970
Deep South, Midwest, East Coast.

1136
01:22:25,136 --> 01:22:26,429
Vast country.

1137
01:22:27,222 --> 01:22:29,015
Haven't been there in 20 years.

1138
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:33,228
Not now.
I'm conducting a job interview.

1139
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:36,564
Your writing samples are good.
I re-read them in the taxi.

1140
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:38,233
Have you ever done any book reviews?

1141
01:22:39,526 --> 01:22:40,610
Never.

1142
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:43,738
You're gonna be in there another few hours
before they process you out.

1143
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:47,742
Read this. Give me 300 words.

1144
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:52,622
I'll pay you 500 francs
minus the 250 I advanced for your bail...

1145
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:55,959
but I'll re-advance that
against cost of living.

1146
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,628
Bring me a first draft tomorrow morning...

1147
01:22:58,795 --> 01:23:01,089
and however you go about it, Mr. Wright...

1148
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:04,259
try to make it sound like you
wrote it that way on purpose.

1149
01:23:12,559 --> 01:23:13,810
Thank you.

1150
01:23:16,354 --> 01:23:17,814
No crying.

1151
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:28,241
It came to be known
as the "Night of a Thousand Slugs."

1152
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:29,618
I'm reciting again.

1153
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,121
<i>How the Commissaire and his elite team of
experts and analysts...</i>

1154
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:36,875
<i>succeeded so swiftly in determining
the location of the kidnappers' lair...</i>

1155
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:41,880
<i>Well...</i>

1156
01:23:46,217 --> 01:23:47,886
<i>I just don't know.</i>

1157
01:23:51,264 --> 01:23:53,475
<i>The tools of the trade, I suppose.</i>

1158
01:24:00,273 --> 01:24:02,359
<i>But succeed they did.</i>

1159
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,186
<i>Who were they?</i>

1160
01:24:40,021 --> 01:24:41,439
<i>It was later revealed.</i>

1161
01:24:42,565 --> 01:24:45,819
<i>A hired crew of bandits and gunmen
imported by the ranking bosses...</i>

1162
01:24:45,986 --> 01:24:49,573
<i>of the Ennui rackets
and their network of underworld middlemen.</i>

1163
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:55,161
<i>Chauffeur Joe Lefèvre,
a once almost promising instrumentalist.</i>

1164
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:58,873
<i>Stetson, Spinster,
and Hieronymus Von Altman,</i>

1165
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,542
<i>Dutch masterminds.</i>

1166
01:25:01,126 --> 01:25:04,588
<i>Marconi Brutelli,
the Mediterranean anarchist.</i>

1167
01:25:05,755 --> 01:25:08,508
<i>A pair of hooligans, estranged cousins.</i>

1168
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:13,013
<i>A trio of showgirls, all junkies.</i>

1169
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:17,058
<i>Plus one small, resourceful prisoner...</i>

1170
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:20,604
<i>determined to free himself and
reduce taxpayer expense.</i>

1171
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:32,991
What's that noise?

1172
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:37,412
Air bubbles in the radiator pipes.
It's pressurized.

1173
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:39,205
Sounds like Morse code.

1174
01:25:40,624 --> 01:25:42,417
Vaguely, maybe.

1175
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:46,713
I'm Gigi, by the way.
What's your name?

1176
01:25:46,922 --> 01:25:49,507
I'm not gonna tell you that.
This is a felony.

1177
01:25:50,634 --> 01:25:53,845
You're not a criminal.
You're just a mixed-up showgirl.

1178
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:56,514
-Ha.
-Ha, yourself.

1179
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,391
Shut up.

1180
01:25:59,267 --> 01:26:00,560
What color eyes do you have?

1181
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:02,062
Blue?

1182
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:12,656
Hello.

1183
01:26:14,324 --> 01:26:15,533
Hello.

1184
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:21,581
Sing me a lullaby.

1185
01:26:21,748 --> 01:26:23,166
I'm scared.

1186
01:26:52,445 --> 01:26:54,364
Are you asleep?

1187
01:27:00,412 --> 01:27:03,665
<i>The Commissaire adored Gigi
with all his voluminous heart.</i>

1188
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:07,168
<i>However, his mind, that exceptional
machine for the detection...</i>

1189
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:09,379
<i>and investigation of criminal activity,</i>

1190
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:12,674
<i>had been whirring since dinnertime.</i>

1191
01:27:16,386 --> 01:27:19,389
<i>And he was in a condition
of dire calorific depletion.</i>

1192
01:27:21,975 --> 01:27:25,812
<i>Nescaffier, back in the field
for the first time in six years...</i>

1193
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:28,106
<i>came prepared to dazzle.</i>

1194
01:27:32,402 --> 01:27:35,155
<i>The change was instantaneous.</i>

1195
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:44,080
Nescaffier.

1196
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:47,584
<i>Even as the faintest hints of the aromas
of the great chef's kitchen...</i>

1197
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:49,794
<i>ribboned into
the Commissaire's nostrils...</i>

1198
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:54,049
<i>he began to envision and
formulate a multi-pronged battle-plan.</i>

1199
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:55,300
<i>To start...</i>

1200
01:27:55,467 --> 01:27:57,177
<i>Deviled eggs of the precinct canary...</i>

1201
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:59,429
<i>served in shells of its own meringue.</i>

1202
01:28:01,598 --> 01:28:02,599
{\an8}<i>Next...</i>

1203
01:28:04,017 --> 01:28:05,268
{\an8}<i>Kidneys.</i>

1204
01:28:05,435 --> 01:28:08,063
{\an8}<i>Poached with plums
from the mayor's rooftop arbor.</i>

1205
01:28:10,899 --> 01:28:11,900
{\an8}<i>Then...</i>

1206
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:15,528
{\an8}<i>minced lamb bon-bons in pastry wrappers.</i>

1207
01:28:17,822 --> 01:28:18,865
<i>Blasé oyster soup.</i>

1208
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:22,410
<i>A magnificent city-park pigeon hash.</i>

1209
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:23,578
<i>Finally...</i>

1210
01:28:24,913 --> 01:28:26,957
{\an8}<i>...tabac pudding with quadruple cream.</i>

1211
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:31,628
{\an8}May I interrupt with a question?

1212
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:33,338
-Please.
-Forgive me.

1213
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:34,881
Just permit me to dog-ear
the page. Mentally.

1214
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:36,049
I beg your pardon.

1215
01:28:36,508 --> 01:28:39,511
You've written about the American negro,
the French intellectual...

1216
01:28:39,678 --> 01:28:41,513
-the Southern romantic...
-And the anti-negro.

1217
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,681
The anti-negro.

1218
01:28:43,556 --> 01:28:48,019
Scripture, mythology, folklore,
true crime, false crime...

1219
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,855
the ghost story, the picaresque,
the bildungsroman.

1220
01:28:51,022 --> 01:28:52,983
But more than anything,
over all these years...

1221
01:28:53,149 --> 01:28:54,776
you've written about food.

1222
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:56,486
Why?

1223
01:28:57,696 --> 01:29:00,448
Who? What? Where? When? How?
Valid questions...

1224
01:29:00,615 --> 01:29:05,078
but I learned as a cub stringer,
never, under any circumstance...

1225
01:29:05,245 --> 01:29:08,540
if it is remotely within your power
to resist the impulse...

1226
01:29:08,748 --> 01:29:10,625
never ask a man why.

1227
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:12,794
It tightens a fellow up.

1228
01:29:13,503 --> 01:29:14,504
I apologize,

1229
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:15,797
-but I'm gonna hold you to it...
-Torture.

1230
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:17,132
...if you'll agree.

1231
01:29:17,215 --> 01:29:20,927
Self-reflection is a vice
best conducted in private or not at all.

1232
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:23,513
Well...

1233
01:29:24,264 --> 01:29:27,058
I'll answer your question out of
sheer weariness...

1234
01:29:28,977 --> 01:29:31,605
but I truly don't know
what I'm about to say.

1235
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:38,486
There is a particular sad beauty...

1236
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:43,325
well-known to the companionless foreigner
as he walks the streets of his adopted...

1237
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:47,120
preferably moonlit, city.
In my case, Ennui, France.

1238
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,623
I have so often...

1239
01:29:50,624 --> 01:29:54,169
I have so often shared
the day's glittering discoveries with...

1240
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,048
no one at all.

1241
01:29:58,965 --> 01:30:02,010
But always, somewhere along
the avenue or the boulevard...

1242
01:30:02,177 --> 01:30:04,846
there was a table set for me.

1243
01:30:06,056 --> 01:30:10,101
A cook, a waiter, a bottle,
a glass, a fire.

1244
01:30:12,228 --> 01:30:14,356
I chose this life.

1245
01:30:16,316 --> 01:30:20,028
It is the solitary feast that has been
very much like a comrade...

1246
01:30:20,195 --> 01:30:22,948
my great comfort and fortification.

1247
01:30:24,866 --> 01:30:27,494
<i>Do you remember
where you placed the bookmark?</i>

1248
01:30:28,328 --> 01:30:30,455
Of course, silly goose. "Meanwhile."

1249
01:30:30,956 --> 01:30:33,333
"Meanwhile, across the street..."

1250
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:29,598
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1251
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:40,984
<i>During a lull in the skirmish,
an ancient concierge...</i>

1252
01:31:41,151 --> 01:31:43,361
<i>veteran of two wars,
limped across the street...</i>

1253
01:31:43,528 --> 01:31:45,488
<i>to deliver an enigmatic message.</i>

1254
01:31:58,335 --> 01:32:02,297
I'm speaking to the leader of the gang
of kidnappers on the top floor.

1255
01:32:02,672 --> 01:32:05,175
Do you have a working kitchen
in your lair?

1256
01:32:05,342 --> 01:32:07,010
My son needs a snack.

1257
01:32:07,177 --> 01:32:09,596
Allow us to send in our precinct cook...

1258
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:12,015
along with some supplies and provisions.

1259
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:14,684
He will prepare a supper
of sufficient proportions...

1260
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:17,437
to feed you and all your accomplices.

1261
01:32:18,355 --> 01:32:19,940
We already ate.

1262
01:32:26,529 --> 01:32:28,114
Is it an underling...

1263
01:32:28,615 --> 01:32:30,659
or Nescaffier himself?

1264
01:32:58,645 --> 01:33:00,397
Blackbird pie.

1265
01:33:12,784 --> 01:33:15,120
<i>Required, of course,
to sample each item...</i>

1266
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:18,456
<i>the chef ate the deathly poison.</i>

1267
01:33:24,045 --> 01:33:25,797
For the little boy.

1268
01:33:27,632 --> 01:33:28,842
Stop.

1269
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,387
Write down the recipe.

1270
01:33:44,107 --> 01:33:45,233
Help...

1271
01:33:48,403 --> 01:33:49,988
<i>But Nescaffier survived...</i>

1272
01:33:50,155 --> 01:33:52,115
<i>thanks to the extreme fortitude...</i>

1273
01:33:52,282 --> 01:33:56,411
<i>bolstered and braced, season upon season,
by the richest, most potent plates...</i>

1274
01:33:56,578 --> 01:33:58,204
<i>pans, and sauce pots...</i>

1275
01:33:58,371 --> 01:34:01,416
<i>of his almost superhuman stomach.</i>

1276
01:34:02,584 --> 01:34:04,002
<i>He knew well, of course...</i>

1277
01:34:04,169 --> 01:34:07,213
<i>Gigi loathed and despised
the radish in all its forms...</i>

1278
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,299
<i>with a deep, unbridled passion,</i>

1279
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:11,176
<i>and had never so much as touched one...</i>

1280
01:34:11,343 --> 01:34:14,888
<i>or even spoken the word,
during his entire young lifetime.</i>

1281
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,223
<i>However, as it happened...</i>

1282
01:34:18,516 --> 01:34:20,936
<i>the chauffeur hated radishes, too.</i>

1283
01:36:25,644 --> 01:36:27,020
Take the wheel!

1284
01:36:51,002 --> 01:36:53,546
<i>Perhaps the most stirring and startling
phenomenon witnessed...</i>

1285
01:36:53,713 --> 01:36:57,008
<i>over the trajectory of that
protracted dinner date was this...</i>

1286
01:37:09,646 --> 01:37:13,108
<i>A delicious irony.</i> Monsieur <i>Albert...</i>

1287
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:14,484
<i>accountant to the</i> demi-monde

1288
01:37:14,568 --> 01:37:17,112
<i>and remote cause
of the entire spectacular contretemps...</i>

1289
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:18,738
<i>had been forgotten in the chicken coop</i>

1290
01:37:18,822 --> 01:37:20,574
<i>from Thursday dinner
to Monday breakfast...</i>

1291
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:23,076
<i>and had very nearly starved in his cell.</i>

1292
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:25,745
It was only the convalescent
<i>Monsieur</i> Nescaffier himself...

1293
01:37:25,912 --> 01:37:28,206
who retained the presence
of mind to prepare the prisoner...

1294
01:37:28,373 --> 01:37:30,917
an <i>omelette à la policier,
</i>which he delivered warm...

1295
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:33,336
wrapped in a day-old search warrant.

1296
01:37:35,171 --> 01:37:37,299
The Abacus ate well that morning.

1297
01:37:40,302 --> 01:37:42,470
A word from Gemini tooth powder.

1298
01:37:45,432 --> 01:37:47,434
It was supposed to be
an article about a great chef.

1299
01:37:47,517 --> 01:37:48,518
It is in part.

1300
01:37:48,685 --> 01:37:50,103
For the Tastes and Smells section...

1301
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,939
I understand.
The assignment was perfectly clear.

1302
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,568
Perhaps, you fail to grasp...

1303
01:37:56,735 --> 01:38:00,155
that I was shot at
and hand-grenaded against my will.

1304
01:38:00,822 --> 01:38:02,824
I only asked to be fed,
and was, marvelously,

1305
01:38:02,908 --> 01:38:04,743
as I described in some detail.

1306
01:38:05,493 --> 01:38:08,163
Nescaffier only gets one line of dialogue.

1307
01:38:10,624 --> 01:38:14,502
Well, I did cut something he told me.
It made me too sad.

1308
01:38:15,462 --> 01:38:17,172
I could stick it back in, if you like.

1309
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,342
What did he say?

1310
01:38:41,571 --> 01:38:42,864
Martin... Martin...

1311
01:38:43,031 --> 01:38:44,282
Guillaume Martin.

1312
01:38:54,417 --> 01:38:56,127
They had a flavor.

1313
01:38:58,088 --> 01:38:59,589
I beg your pardon?

1314
01:39:01,007 --> 01:39:05,136
The toxic salts in the radishes...

1315
01:39:05,303 --> 01:39:06,888
they had a flavor.

1316
01:39:07,973 --> 01:39:10,600
Totally unfamiliar to me.

1317
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:15,563
Like a bitter, moldy, peppery...

1318
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:19,317
spicy, oily kind of...

1319
01:39:20,485 --> 01:39:21,820
earth.

1320
01:39:22,696 --> 01:39:25,490
I never tasted that taste in my life.

1321
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:28,326
Not entirely pleasant...

1322
01:39:28,952 --> 01:39:30,912
extremely poisonous...

1323
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:33,915
but still, a new flavor.

1324
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,294
That's a rare thing at my age.

1325
01:39:39,462 --> 01:39:41,965
I admire your bravery, Lieutenant.

1326
01:39:42,591 --> 01:39:44,509
I'm not brave.

1327
01:39:45,176 --> 01:39:46,761
I just wasn't...

1328
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:48,555
in the mood to be...

1329
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,974
a disappointment to everybody.

1330
01:39:52,809 --> 01:39:54,436
I'm a foreigner, you know.

1331
01:39:55,854 --> 01:39:58,106
This city is full of us, isn't it?

1332
01:39:59,107 --> 01:40:00,942
I'm one myself.

1333
01:40:03,069 --> 01:40:05,155
Seeking something missing.

1334
01:40:07,073 --> 01:40:09,409
Missing something left behind.

1335
01:40:12,621 --> 01:40:14,664
Maybe with good luck...

1336
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:17,083
we'll find what eluded us...

1337
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:20,337
in the places we once called home.

1338
01:40:29,304 --> 01:40:31,681
That's the best part of the whole thing.

1339
01:40:32,557 --> 01:40:34,893
That's the reason for it to be written.

1340
01:40:37,103 --> 01:40:38,980
I couldn't agree less.

1341
01:40:41,024 --> 01:40:44,236
Well, anyway, don't cut it.

1342
01:41:14,015 --> 01:41:15,308
Are we all here?

1343
01:41:16,101 --> 01:41:18,520
I guess you know.
It was a heart attack.

1344
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:35,245
No crying.

1345
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:44,504
Is somebody coming to take him away?

1346
01:41:44,671 --> 01:41:46,715
There's a strike at the morgue.

1347
01:41:50,343 --> 01:41:51,428
Who was with him?

1348
01:41:51,595 --> 01:41:52,929
He was alone.

1349
01:41:53,096 --> 01:41:54,764
Reading birthday telegrams.

1350
01:41:57,434 --> 01:42:00,228
Don't light the candles.
He's dead.

1351
01:42:01,313 --> 01:42:02,897
I'll have a slice.

1352
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:04,733
Me, too.

1353
01:42:05,775 --> 01:42:08,320
We need to draft something. Who wants it?

1354
01:42:08,486 --> 01:42:09,487
We've got a file.

1355
01:42:09,613 --> 01:42:10,947
I'm working on the art.

1356
01:42:13,867 --> 01:42:15,493
That's him.

1357
01:42:19,623 --> 01:42:21,374
Let's write it together.

1358
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,542
Write what?

1359
01:42:22,626 --> 01:42:24,294
The obituary.

1360
01:42:25,879 --> 01:42:28,673
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.
Born in North Kansas...

1361
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:32,052
10 miles from the geographical center
of the United States.

1362
01:42:32,218 --> 01:42:33,470
Mother died when he was five.

1363
01:42:33,637 --> 01:42:36,139
Son of a newspaper publisher,
founder of this magazine.

1364
01:42:36,306 --> 01:42:38,475
<i>The French Dispatch,
</i>previously known as <i>Picnic.</i>

1365
01:42:38,642 --> 01:42:42,520
A largely unread Sunday supplement
to the <i>Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun.</i>

1366
01:42:42,687 --> 01:42:44,147
It began as a holiday.

1367
01:42:44,314 --> 01:42:45,357
Is that true?

1368
01:42:45,523 --> 01:42:46,608
Sort of.

1369
01:42:49,027 --> 01:42:50,654
What happens next?

1369
01:42:51,305 --> 01:43:51,876
