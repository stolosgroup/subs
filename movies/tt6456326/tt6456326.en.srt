3
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,357
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

4
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:47,865
Oh, fuck.

5
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,343
Hurry it up.

6
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:32,003
Yes?

7
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:32,670
Sir, we've landed.

8
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,604
Are you we still an all go?

9
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,639
We are a go.

10
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,475
Okay, I was thinking we could.

11
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:42,445
- Are we on?
- Looks like it.

12
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,015
Is it gonna be this hot the
whole time?

13
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,049
What do you think?

14
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:47,551
This humidity's gonna
be hell on the computers.

15
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,552
Anybody plan for that?

16
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,087
You don't think this
country has computers?

17
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,388
The guy knows.

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,991
The guy, the guy, where is the
guy?

19
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,795
Oh!

20
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,830
Foster team?

21
00:02:58,863 --> 00:02:59,864
Yep.

22
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,835
I'm Jantz.

23
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,670
Okay.

24
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,972
This is Fielding and Kroger.

25
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,540
Your guy?

26
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,976
Not my guy.

27
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,077
- Your name?
- Boller.

28
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:15,378
Did the gear arrive?

29
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,814
Already at the house.

30
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,849
Fine.

31
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,160
Hand that up.

32
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,627
Would you relax?

33
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:32,663
Are you kidding me?

34
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,100
Hey, does the AC work, man?

35
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,671
Can you at least open a freaking
window?

36
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:43,007
Hey, it's great.

37
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:45,810
Fine.

38
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,710
We get out here.

39
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:26,616
How much is that?

40
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:29,887
Smooth.

41
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,922
Keep the change.

42
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,874
Are you shitting me?

43
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:53,543
We're above a sweatshop,
no AC, not even fans?

44
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,046
- Seriously, the fuck?
- It is was it is.

45
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,080
We got this.

46
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,084
Thank you, Jesus.

47
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,690
Which one of you two is
coming to set up that link?

48
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,624
'Cause I know it isn't him.

49
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:08,558
It's me.

50
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,694
Grab your gear and let's move.

51
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,461
We've got a two hour drive.

52
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,200
Get set up, we'll
communicate once we're synced.

53
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,718
Go.

54
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,220
OPS team secured.

55
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,022
Tech Jantz on route to Alpha.

56
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:40,623
Confirmed.

57
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,531
Who are you talking to?

58
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,269
You do know why we're here,
right?

59
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:53,603
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,273
Sure.

61
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:20,064
Hey, Leap, toss me up that
hammer.

62
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:31,842
Leap, Leap, Leap!

63
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,177
Leap!

64
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,182
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:39,216
It's fine.

66
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,194
That alarm goes off every day.

67
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:59,602
Look, I don't wanna be rude,
okay?

68
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:00,838
It's only a watch.

69
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,316
You can eat with us, if you
like.

70
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,734
Pull up here.

71
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,900
Hello.

72
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:04,768
Thanks.

73
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:08,873
Can't believe they've got us
working

74
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,407
on those multi-million dollar
toys,

75
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,109
and they shack us up in this
dump.

76
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,410
Freaking tightwads.

77
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,012
Have connection.

78
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,017
My names?

79
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,286
I'm coding the new combat
program.

80
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,320
Wait, combat?

81
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,122
Not for this exercise.

82
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,824
It's just a nav test.

83
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,092
Right?

84
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,394
You do realize that we work
for a weapons company, right?

85
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,252
The drug runners probably set
this up.

86
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,721
You can tell by the amount of
tracks,

87
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,223
people stepping over it.

88
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:00,824
The locals know it's here.

89
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,196
Jordan,
stop, stop, stop, Jordan!

90
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,232
- Sorry.
- What the hell?

91
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:43,434
Watch out.

92
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,271
Oh, goddamn it.

93
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,109
Engine's toast.

94
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,278
This is bullshit, who does this?

95
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,346
Someone that obviously doesn't
want

96
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,114
us to go any further.

97
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:57,982
Why don't we just grab our
packs

98
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,483
and start walking back the way
we came?

99
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,151
We've been on this
road for like five hours.

100
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:01,852
We haven't seen any...

101
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,354
No, if this map is correct,

102
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,222
there's a tiny village
around here somewhere.

103
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,157
You guys are sure you have
the map the right way up?

104
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,025
- Jordan!
- What?

105
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:08,859
Shut up!

106
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,394
Why are you always such a smart
ass?

107
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:11,328
I'm just trying to bring a
little...

108
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,030
Guys, come on, all right?

109
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,498
I say we just stick to the
map, for what it's worth.

110
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,333
It's already getting
dark, and Jordan's right,

111
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,935
we haven't seen anything for
miles.

112
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:18,969
- Go.
- Just grab our packs

113
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,805
- and start walking.
- You guys, everyone says

114
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,173
the Golden Triangle is full of
opium,

115
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,175
heroin, pot runners, and
landmines.

116
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,178
Us all being doctors,
they might leave us alone.

117
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,047
You know, I don't think the
landmines

118
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,315
can tell if we're doctors or
not, Dez.

119
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,384
Jordan, shut up!

120
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,918
Hey, I mean, no one
goes into the theater

121
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:38,055
expecting to get killed or raped
or skint

122
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,291
or blown up or any of
these sort of things!

123
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,292
Hey, if I've got the map,

124
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:42,192
can you show me if we're
in the Golden Triangle?

125
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,295
You're really starting to
scare me.

126
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:46,297
You need to relax, okay?

127
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,499
Which way, Angie, Tien?

128
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:49,199
- This way.
- Over there.

129
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,201
- Oh, fuck.
- Wait a minute.

130
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,336
This is not gonna end well.

131
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,405
- Jordan, just...
- Just chill, okay?

132
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,540
- All right?
- Calm, girlfriend.

133
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,342
All right, if we stick
to these well-worn tracks,

134
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,543
we should be fine.

135
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,812
We should be fine or we will
be fine?

136
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:03,881
Stick with me, Dez.

137
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,496
Set up here.

138
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:36,980
Kroger, are you there?

139
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:37,648
Are you there?

140
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,049
Yo.

141
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,884
Hey, the link is at 75%.

142
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,953
Just pan it left or right a tad.

143
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,623
Perfect, done, lock it off.

144
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:49,626
Is Fielding set up?

145
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:50,662
Okay, we're live.

146
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:51,528
Okay, good.

147
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,130
The drop is in 4.5 hours.

148
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,331
We're gonna head back.

149
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,366
Copy that.

150
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,103
What's that?

151
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,337
It's a backup plan.

152
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,505
Backup plan for what?

153
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,174
Is it up?

154
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,342
- Yeah.
- Good.

155
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,112
Cover it up.

156
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,214
Let's get the hell outta here.

157
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,984
Go.

158
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,953
Connectives are 2-4-3-2-6-7

159
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,055
into our team's cameras and
comms.

160
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:19,623
Who's this, sir?

161
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,658
CIA.

162
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:21,693
Oh, shit!

163
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:26,930
Okay.

164
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,068
Okay, he's in.

165
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:33,170
I thought this was for
an internal test, sir.

166
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,204
Enough questions.

167
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,573
They're watching closely,
so make it perfect.

168
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,475
Objectives may change, stay
flexible.

169
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,344
Changes?

170
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,080
What the fuck he's talking
about?

171
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,182
Code change?

172
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,689
Jantz.

173
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:54,591
Do you know anything
about an objective change?

174
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,559
No, who said it?

175
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:01,666
Keep your fucking
mouth shut,

176
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,700
keep your mouth shut!

177
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,536
Shh, shh, shh.

178
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,480
Fuck!

179
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,552
Who was that, motherfucking drug
runners?

180
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,425
One last time, stay quiet!

181
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,299
Angie, are you
sure this is the right way?

182
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,201
Girl, I told you, I
got this.

183
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,268
Who gave Angie the map?

184
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:40,170
Yeah, who gave Angie the
map in the first place?

185
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,206
Oh, time out, y'all.

186
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,373
I need a drink.

187
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,408
Yeah, me, too.

188
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:48,780
Hey, Tien, are your parents
happy

189
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,281
that you're going to a
medical school in Chicago?

190
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,584
I hope so, they're
helping me pay for it.

191
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,653
Well, I don't know how
much you'll learn in Chicago.

192
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:57,554
Jordan, why are you so mean to
me?

193
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,122
Look, in Tien's defense,

194
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:01,225
it's actually a pretty good
college.

195
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,125
We did our research and...

196
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,293
Shh, shh!

197
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:05,730
- Y'all hear that?
- What?

198
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:21,044
What was that?

199
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:22,312
I almost fainted with that.

200
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,614
Me, too.

201
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,282
Man up, guys, it was a bunch
of kids.

202
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,351
Yeah, with guns, Jordan.

203
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,386
Hey, actually, I don't feel so
lost now.

204
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,755
Ha, ha, you're so funny.

205
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,132
Cutting it close, guys.

206
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,467
- We set?
- Good to go.

207
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,635
Is my team logged in?

208
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,503
Team?

209
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:47,337
What team?

210
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:49,106
CIA, apparently, Foster's
orders.

211
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,542
CIA, this is fucking getting
serious!

212
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:53,745
Well, we're dropping
a secret team of robots

213
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,713
into a country that we're
not supposed to be in.

214
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,581
It got serious the moment we
start up.

215
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,584
- Fuck.
- Bad habit of knocking.

216
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,419
- Are we connected?
- Yes, cowboy.

217
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:07,591
Alpha, Quebec, 9-0-0-9 Alpha,
confirmed.

218
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,494
Confirmed, line is secure.

219
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,596
Drop is in 15 minutes.

220
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,164
Establishing links now.

221
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,466
Comms one through four
confirmed.

222
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,169
We should have solid comms
when they're all on the ground.

223
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:34,752
Got on the wrong one.

224
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,253
Look, a plane!

225
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,220
Help!

226
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:38,322
Did you say plane?

227
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,257
Angie, there's no way they can
see us.

228
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,235
Four's picking up speed.

229
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,841
Chutes aren't opening all the
way.

230
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,442
- Want me to blow it?
- No!

231
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:00,344
And let everyone in the
area know that we're here?

232
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,378
We let it go.

233
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,582
Well, it's landed.

234
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:06,617
Signal's lost.

235
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:08,585
Major.

236
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,754
Continue with the operation.

237
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,889
No noise until we complete the
objective.

238
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,927
You gotta be shitting me.

239
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,227
We'll let the other
three robots detonate

240
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,296
number four after the operation.

241
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,467
Sending go codes now.

242
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:58,703
We have solid comms with
One, Two, and Three.

243
00:16:58,736 --> 00:16:59,937
Four is dead.

244
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,304
- Shit!
- What?

245
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,740
Damn engineers!

246
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,910
We told them that the comm
modules weren't sitting tightly.

247
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,310
And if we lose connection
with the modules,

248
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,412
they become free agents.

249
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,981
Meaning you have no control.

250
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:10,682
Sort of.

251
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:11,716
No module means that they're...

252
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:12,850
Dumb terminators.

253
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,719
No module, no objective.

254
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,988
Kroger's terminology is
slightly exaggerated, okay?

255
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:21,258
Look it, in layman's terms,
they have two brains, okay?

256
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,261
One is the module that caps
their artificial intelligence,

257
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,530
that allows us to communicate
with them.

258
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:28,632
The module also allows
them to make the best

259
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,001
decisions in the field possible,

260
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,770
whether that be jumping
off a cliff or not,

261
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:36,007
or when would be the appropriate
time to pull out a gun.

262
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,241
We can set objectives,
we can dictate orders,

263
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,443
we can pretty much get them to
do

264
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,713
whatever it is that we want them
to do,

265
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,548
but, ultimately, they will
decide

266
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,316
the best and most efficient way

267
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,618
of doing what it is
that we want them to do.

268
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:50,454
So they make their own
decisions?

269
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,656
Yeah, pretty much.

270
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:55,525
I mean, look it, these robots
have full-blown AI, okay?

271
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,029
So they are way smarter than any
of us.

272
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,797
Without that module connected,

273
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,565
it's not a complete package,
okay?

274
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:03,968
It's like a person with acute
autism.

275
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,872
Clever as hell but useless
in the real world, okay?

276
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,007
They can walk around aimlessly,

277
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,943
trying to figure out
what the hell they are,

278
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,978
but they're not gonna learn
much in the middle of a jungle.

279
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,713
That's why we've never
let them self-learn,

280
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:18,049
for obvious reasons, and it's
why

281
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,851
we've kept them off the grid

282
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:22,352
or connected via satellite, but,
again,

283
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,821
without that module connected,

284
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,489
it's not a complete package.

285
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,323
It's kinda like a...

286
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,357
Zombie terminator.

287
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,359
A zombie terminator.

288
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:30,494
Can we fix it?

289
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,666
Well, with a highly
technical and acutely autistic

290
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,569
delicate adjustment, I'll do my
best.

291
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,572
And

292
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:46,677
done.

293
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,045
You think this is a fucking
joke?

294
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,482
You do understand that,
if this mission fails,

295
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,483
and you get caught, you could
end up

296
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,485
in a very nasty jail for
the rest of your lives?

297
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,486
Can you chill out?

298
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,522
All right, I'll put on
my game face for you.

299
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,757
Is that better?

300
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,324
Let's give them a small
navigation test

301
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,627
to see if they're still
calibrated without BR4.

302
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,330
Tell them to rendezvous
at the nav-comm link.

303
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:08,331
Okay.

304
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,717
Excuse me, do you speak
English?

305
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,985
English?

306
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,020
- No?
- Guys.

307
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:34,457
Wait.

308
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:45,036
Hi, do you have a car?

309
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,942
Van broke down.

310
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:54,611
Needing a boat.

311
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,915
Yeah, can you help us?

312
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,817
We're medical students.

313
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,419
Volunteers?

314
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,087
Oh, immunization.

315
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,055
We help the sick.

316
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:04,956
Okay, we have money.

317
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,123
- We can...
- Jordan.

318
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:07,124
Okay, but, listen, just tell
her

319
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,426
that we're willing to
hire a guide or a car

320
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,594
- to get us out of...
- Maybe you should stick

321
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,428
to English.

322
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,664
Yes, you're American, thank
God.

323
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:15,166
Listen, man, sorry.

324
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,334
We're so lost, okay?

325
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:19,704
Our van just got spiked by
this crazy booby-trap thing.

326
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,538
Do you have a car or a truck,
maybe?

327
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,075
We'll pay you if you
can get us to the river.

328
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,109
Ah, shit.

329
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,912
Don't talk, do not say a word.

330
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,579
No sudden movements.

331
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:31,615
Come inside now, now.

332
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,416
You speak English.

333
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,197
Okay, okay, boys, let's take
it easy.

334
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,198
You shut up!

335
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,565
You're not one of us!

336
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:52,636
Where you guys from?

337
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,138
Why?

338
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,572
Hey!

339
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,176
We came from that direction.

340
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,778
About five hours walk.

341
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,013
Angie, Angie, show him.

342
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,517
You leave now!

343
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:12,589
Shut up!

344
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:13,623
You're all gone

345
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:16,928
or I'll kill you!

346
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:26,804
Are you okay?

347
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,618
Navigation is completed.

348
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:44,055
Collate the data, send it
back stateside for review.

349
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,723
Shh.

350
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,024
- Major.
- Load the objective,

351
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:49,961
and don't let that fat
fuck get under your skin.

352
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,066
New objective, load it.

353
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

354
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:56,834
I write the code objectives
here.

355
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,070
This isn't mine, where did this
come from?

356
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,537
Your boss, so load it.

357
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,707
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold the
fuck on!

358
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,574
All right, I wanna read it
first.

359
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:05,710
I'm the lead code writer here.

360
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:07,778
There could be bugs in it
that could drop them all.

361
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:09,512
I just wanna check it out first.

362
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:11,916
30 seconds.

363
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,051
It's not my code.

364
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,820
You're not listening, dude.

365
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,689
All right, it could take weeks
to write code objectives.

366
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,860
Major, the techs wanna check
the code.

367
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,529
Foster, is the code solid?

368
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:28,733
Let Kroger check it.

369
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,633
Should take him about 15
minutes.

370
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:32,903
Fielding, please route me
through

371
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:35,973
- the sandbox emulator, please.
- Got it.

372
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,008
That a boy.

373
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,811
Hey, Four's coming online.

374
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,646
Damage report?

375
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:44,949
Looks okay, just the comm
module

376
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,951
isn't responding properly.

377
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:48,686
Okay, so there's eight code
breaks

378
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,021
in this objective.

379
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,555
Probably won't when I start
digging.

380
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:53,891
How long?

381
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,292
10, 12 hours.

382
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:56,894
Faster.

383
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,729
I need to crash a minute, man.

384
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:00,597
I'm still lagging after that
flight.

385
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:05,136
You fix it now, you sleep
later.

386
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:06,569
You copy that?

387
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:18,816
Thank you so much for
letting us into your home.

388
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,650
We promise to be out of your
hair

389
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,253
first thing in the morning.

390
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:25,222
It's okay, I have some food to
share.

391
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:26,257
Oh.

392
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,744
Wanna see something cool?

393
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:49,646
So what special forces were
you with?

394
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,681
The tattoo.

395
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,752
This guy's a Navy SEAL.

396
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:58,355
Maybe the tattoo's fake.

397
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:02,093
I think this guy's full of shit.

398
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,628
Maybe if you would've
kept your mouth shut,

399
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,332
like I told you, that
would've gone just fine.

400
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,368
Yeah, well, I think a real
Navy SEAL,

401
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:14,271
a real SEAl, could've
handled that situation.

402
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:15,372
- Okay.
- Stop!

403
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,242
I've had enough for one day.

404
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,945
We all have.

405
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:26,283
Sit down.

406
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:27,151
Sorry.

407
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,185
Come on, dude.

408
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,822
Sorry.

409
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,066
Objective's solid.

410
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,404
More importantly, where
are my energy sticks?

411
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,207
Are we live?

412
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:03,687
What is this?

413
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:05,356
New testing parameters.

414
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:08,058
Definitely didn't
look like a simulation.

415
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:10,728
There's some questionable code
in there.

416
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:15,866
Whoa!

417
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,736
Team will recon first.

418
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,037
The orders to secure and take
over

419
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,672
the site will come from above.

420
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:31,015
Leap, Leap.

421
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:40,424
You're up early.

422
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,926
How'd you sleep?

423
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:42,893
I didn't sleep at all.

424
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:44,428
You guys ready?

425
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,863
Grab your gear, let's go.

426
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:48,232
Where's Leap, is he gone?

427
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,135
He should be back soon, I
hope.

428
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,239
All right, guys, we stay.

429
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:57,274
Leap knows these trails
better than anybody, okay?

430
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,909
It'll save us from
getting a leg blown off.

431
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:00,377
You're kidding, right?

432
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,113
I'm actually surprised you
guys made it in here alive.

433
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,924
Bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang!

434
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,893
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

435
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:49,012
You leave now!

436
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,617
We're supposed to meet a boat
here

437
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,018
to take us down the Song-Ma.

438
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,019
Think you can get us there?

439
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,589
No, I'm gonna take you
guys back to your van.

440
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,457
Why, landmines?

441
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:02,559
Well, the boys outside,
they have plantations

442
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:03,560
in between here and your boat.

443
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:05,429
You leave now or you die here!

444
00:29:07,097 --> 00:29:08,966
We need Leap to help
guide us outta here.

445
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,034
He knows this area better than
me.

446
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,236
Leap!

447
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:13,337
What about an airport?

448
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,939
I saw a plane dropping gear
or something yesterday.

449
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:46,637
You leave now!

450
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:48,505
The boy will take you to the
track.

451
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,145
The bots have scanned 12
males, armed,

452
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:57,682
five unarmed males, 14 unarmed
females,

453
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,650
eight children, all locals.

454
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:00,517
Activate the team.

455
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,352
I think we need to reconsider
this.

456
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:07,458
We can't do this.

457
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:11,462
Seriously, dude?

458
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:45,329
We gotta get outta here.

459
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:46,196
Where?

460
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,030
Yeah, where?

461
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:48,332
They're shooting all around
us!

462
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:49,366
We go outside, we're dead.

463
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:50,501
Shh.

464
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:57,742
How many?

465
00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,376
Three.

466
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:01,178
Who are they?

467
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:02,412
I don't know.

468
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,096
What are they?

469
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:21,498
Shit.

470
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,446
Who are they?

471
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:38,750
I don't know.

472
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:50,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Fielding, never touch.

473
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,196
No, come back inside!

474
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,002
- What are you doing?
- That's not a heroin runner,

475
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:00,203
that's a grieving wife
and probably a mother.

476
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:01,005
She's a witness!

477
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,873
Protecting her home and
family!

478
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,340
You choosing not to follow
orders?

479
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:07,578
Fuck this, Boller!

480
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:09,146
Get back online.

481
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:15,519
It's done.

482
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,797
Do you have a problem
following orders, Fielding?

483
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:27,799
No.

484
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,669
Just wasn't ready for this.

485
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:53,658
Okay, got to get inside.

486
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:21,819
Let's get you guys the hell
outta here.

487
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,741
You okay?

488
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:44,709
Okay?

489
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:57,587
Gotta help her.

490
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,725
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.

491
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:04,762
Hey, what are you doing?

492
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:06,463
If you go out there, you're
dead.

493
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,999
Please, don't go.

494
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,633
Be quiet, be quiet.

495
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,653
Oh, shit!

496
00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:31,254
Stay low, stay low, follow me!

497
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:32,156
Come on!

498
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,715
Dez, get up, get up,
get up!

499
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:12,063
What do we do?

500
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:13,296
Stay here.

501
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:15,867
Where's he going?

502
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:31,716
Hey!

503
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:32,750
Over here!

504
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,620
Who the hell is that?

505
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:37,955
- Abort.
- Stop the team.

506
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:40,858
We're recording this?

507
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:41,926
- Yes.
- Rewind.

508
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:44,929
There!

509
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:45,963
Zoom up.

510
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:48,331
Major, are you seeing this?

511
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:49,566
Hold tight, hold tight.

512
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,570
Who the fuck is this guy?

513
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:05,415
Fuck!

514
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:20,597
Hey.

515
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:22,599
Hey!

516
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:35,980
It's Mason.

517
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:38,883
He wants us to run to
him.

518
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,417
Come on, no, stay here.

519
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,518
Stay low, stay low.

520
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:43,353
Stay, stay.

521
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,758
There's more of them.

522
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,459
Major, we have six more.

523
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,772
You said it was a clean site.

524
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:04,775
Obviously not.

525
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,643
These people have seen
everything.

526
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,146
Boller, take them all down.

527
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,513
No witnesses.

528
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:11,615
Confirmed.

529
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,516
Turn the team back on, no
witnesses.

530
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,218
These aren't drug runners!

531
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:16,519
Those are tourists or something!

532
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,923
Or dug traffickers,
I said turn it back on!

533
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,559
It's either us or them.

534
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:24,461
I vote us.

535
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:29,432
Keala, come on, Keala!

536
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:34,071
Get that guy, turn them
around, eliminate the witnesses!

537
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:35,273
Can't!

538
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,307
The team's priority is to
eliminate the highest threat.

539
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,441
And that dude shooting
is the highest threat.

540
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:39,710
Can we change the objectives?

541
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:41,846
No, we only have face scans
of the big guy, no one else's.

542
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,646
And?

543
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,015
We need face scans of
everyone!

544
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:46,549
Otherwise, we code to allow them

545
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,185
to shoot anything and anyone.

546
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,053
We do that.

547
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:49,921
We can't do this!

548
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:51,689
- She's right...
- Do it!

549
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:34,799
Fuck!

550
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:35,632
Mason.

551
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:36,499
Fuck!

552
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,368
Mason.

553
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,270
Fuck, I couldn't fucking save
them!

554
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:40,171
Fuck!

555
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:41,571
Goddamn it, come on.

556
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,240
This guy isn't a tourist,
Major.

557
00:38:43,274 --> 00:38:44,809
Do we have an ID on him yet?

558
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,011
Sending you a packet.

559
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:49,780
A SEAL.

560
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:52,083
Is he a deserter or one of us?

561
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,117
I'll make a call.

562
00:38:58,856 --> 00:38:59,991
Special forces, huh?

563
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:01,926
If this guy is a deserter,

564
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,995
it could be the ultimate field
test.

565
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,896
Yeah, I was thinking the same
thing.

566
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:12,269
Mason is priority number one.

567
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:14,705
Terminate all witnesses.

568
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,874
Mason is top priority target
number one.

569
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:20,011
And terminate the group that's
with him.

570
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:21,045
Make it happen.

571
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:25,983
30 seconds.

572
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:36,994
Fuck!

573
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:41,531
Come on.

574
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:55,846
Where are the others?

575
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,881
We're here.

576
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,319
We lost Bao and the girls.

577
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:03,187
Have you seen them?

578
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,055
No.

579
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:05,189
Did you see my son?

580
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,190
He went too fast.

581
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:08,893
He took off into the trees.

582
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:13,330
Hey, Keala, Keala, Leap
is fine, I promise, okay?

583
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:14,732
He's fine.

584
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:15,433
We'll find him, okay?

585
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:17,168
You need to lead us outta here.

586
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,202
You know the way, okay?

587
00:40:18,235 --> 00:40:20,104
Let's go, we gotta go now.

588
00:40:20,137 --> 00:40:21,205
Let's go, I'll stay behind

589
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:22,973
and keep an eye out, okay?

590
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:23,974
Go, go, go.

591
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,999
Someone's gonna live
to tell what happened.

592
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:30,434
And what'd they see?

593
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,169
Four men wearing armor?

594
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:35,172
We were here for surveillance
field testing, not killing!

595
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,144
You highly paid geniuses are
building

596
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:43,214
weapons of war, no?

597
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:46,250
And yet when those
weapons are actually used,

598
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:48,819
you throw your fucking
hands up all righteous,

599
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:51,255
like you have no idea what's
going on.

600
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:52,289
But you do.

601
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,391
You knew exactly what you were
building

602
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:55,993
the second you took this job.

603
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,430
So, before you fucking judge me,

604
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:03,400
remember, everyone
involved with these things,

605
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:04,335
everyone all the way down to the
guy

606
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:07,871
who drops off the donuts, is
accountable.

607
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:16,981
And you three are at the top of
that line.

608
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:22,886
Yes, Major?

609
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,091
Oh, shit!

610
00:43:27,124 --> 00:43:28,859
BR2 just shot one.

611
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:30,227
- Oh my God.
- No.

612
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:33,163
Shit, shit, shit.

613
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,971
Oh, fuck.

614
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,215
She's still alive.

615
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:56,954
Hurry it up.

616
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,361
Stop, please.

617
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:07,298
What the fuck's it doing?

618
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:09,600
Please, please.

619
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,135
Please, please.

620
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:22,446
Here she is, she's a doctor.

621
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:23,280
They're all doctors.

622
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:26,016
They're here on a good cause
mission.

623
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,017
She's not a drug runner,

624
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:28,152
she's a.

625
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:33,590
Fuck.

626
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:36,860
Oh my God!

627
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:37,861
Ah, shit.

628
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,264
Calm down, calm down.

629
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:43,233
If this mission goes fucking
south, we're all dead.

630
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,535
- Seriously?
- We're all dead.

631
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:45,436
Come on, man, okay?

632
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:48,105
You're scaring her, you're
scaring me.

633
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:49,406
I'm scared.

634
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,542
Hey, hey, we are the
brains trust behind this.

635
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:52,609
They need us.

636
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,213
Everyone's expendable, big
boy,

637
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:58,148
even you three geniuses.

638
00:45:15,366 --> 00:45:16,367
Hey.

639
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:30,914
Wendy and Angie and Bao are
still out there somewhere.

640
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:33,484
We gotta find them.

641
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:34,651
No, man, they're dead.

642
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:36,053
Don't say that!

643
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:37,221
We haven't heard gunshots in a
while.

644
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:39,189
Maybe they're just right behind
us.

645
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:41,392
- Angie, Wendy!
- Hey, shh!

646
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:43,127
Shh, hey!

647
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,063
We can make it out of here,
okay, if you keep quiet.

648
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:50,067
The greater distance we put
between us and these things,

649
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,202
the better chances we have.

650
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:53,237
Mason, your hand.

651
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,174
We gotta fix this.

652
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,552
BR2's got a lock on something.

653
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:40,117
That's Bao!

654
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:43,387
Hey, hey, hold on!

655
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,622
You go out there, we're all
dead.

656
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:47,357
I gotta go, let me go.

657
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:48,459
Stop.

658
00:48:25,222 --> 00:48:25,857
It's Four.

659
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:26,791
Is he connected?

660
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,158
Bluetooth auto-login.

661
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:29,359
How's he doing that?

662
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:31,528
Welcome to the future,
man, it's automatic.

663
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,564
These things can connect
to almost anything.

664
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:34,666
Four's comm module isn't
pinging us.

665
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:39,136
It's either screwed or
fallen out during the crash.

666
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:43,140
What the hell?

667
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,342
Stopping all the commands.

668
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,778
Here, I'll send it a bug.

669
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:50,581
This will knock it on its ass.

670
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:52,316
What the?

671
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,584
Do you think it's talking to us?

672
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:55,452
Is the link being hacked?

673
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:56,620
No.

674
00:48:56,654 --> 00:48:58,790
What if the cap on the AI
was fried during the fall?

675
00:48:58,823 --> 00:48:59,824
And?

676
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,360
Run Four's system's files.

677
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,265
- Oh, shit.
- Someone needs to start

678
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:09,667
talking to me.

679
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:10,802
He's downloading our files.

680
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:11,769
Well, stop it!

681
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:12,636
Denied!

682
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,671
It's trying to figure out what
it is.

683
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:15,272
Is this a problem?

684
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:16,506
It should already have this
detail.

685
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,843
I think it's just trying to
reboot itself.

686
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:19,844
Download complete.

687
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:22,747
Terminate BR4 before
we lose the advantage.

688
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,781
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:24,882
We're working on it right now.

690
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,516
The data that I'm getting
from it makes no sense.

691
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,518
Who can send that
self-destruct code?

692
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,224
He stopped it.

693
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:34,892
How?

694
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:36,226
He's becoming self-aware.

695
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:37,095
That's not good.

696
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,096
What's with the 30 second
countdown?

697
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:40,497
It's a fusion device,
a three chemical mix.

698
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,165
It takes 20 to 30 seconds to
combine

699
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:43,200
before it can detonate.

700
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,468
Burns at 100,000 degrees,

701
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,937
and a blast radius of over 200
yards.

702
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,771
I'm not sure blowing it up

703
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:48,171
where it's locate dis a good
idea.

704
00:49:48,205 --> 00:49:49,841
Look what it's standing next to.

705
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:50,708
The link.

706
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:51,843
You blow Four, you lose the
others.

707
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:53,543
Shit!

708
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:55,512
Okay, is Four dangerous?

709
00:49:55,545 --> 00:49:58,315
No, not in its current state.

710
00:49:58,348 --> 00:49:59,182
Oh my God.

711
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:00,584
- What now?
- Okay.

712
00:50:00,617 --> 00:50:01,853
It's loading itself to our
servers.

713
00:50:01,886 --> 00:50:02,887
Now it's dangerous.

714
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,721
Cutting the connection.

715
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:04,922
I want that link terminated
now!

716
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:05,857
We'll lose the others.

717
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:06,958
He's loading fast.

718
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:08,425
I said terminate!

719
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:09,459
Fuck it.

720
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:11,729
Just hit, what the?

721
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:21,338
Nice work, cowboy.

722
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:22,707
How much of it loaded up?

723
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,409
About 90% before you got all
excited.

724
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,845
How long before you get
it back up and running?

725
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,747
Depends on how much damage you
did.

726
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:32,684
Fix it.

727
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,655
Fuck, shit!

728
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:38,690
Fuck!

729
00:50:57,675 --> 00:50:59,911
I got Foster on the
line, put us on speaker.

730
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:06,616
We cannot let BR4 find a
way to connect, gentlemen.

731
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,485
Now, where did it upload its
data to?

732
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:09,687
All the cables were just
pulled out.

733
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,354
We have no idea just yet.

734
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:12,857
Make it a priority, find out.

735
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,492
He's learning really fast,
sir.

736
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:18,428
I think his AI is uncapped.

737
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,002
Keep an eye on it.

738
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:27,004
We can monitor Four
through the BFA feeds

739
00:51:27,038 --> 00:51:28,906
if the others are close enough.

740
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,408
Okay, so how are you gonna
bring it under control?

741
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:32,844
We have to take it down
somehow.

742
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,812
It shut down its self-destruct
sequence.

743
00:51:34,846 --> 00:51:35,880
What about the other BR units?

744
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:37,514
Can any of them shut down BR4?

745
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,283
The others can take him out.

746
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:41,651
I can write a new objective.

747
00:51:42,652 --> 00:51:43,688
BR1 can still hunt the others

748
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:46,791
while Two and Three are
tasked with capturing BR4.

749
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:49,060
Do it.

750
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:50,260
On it.

751
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:41,504
It was a mine.

752
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,674
- What if that was Angie?
- Or Mason?

753
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,161
- Oh, fuck!
- Let's go.

754
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:05,763
Let's go now, hurry,
come on, let's go, now.

755
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,564
Come on, Keala, come on.

756
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:08,632
Let's go, hurry, hurry.

757
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,433
Everybody follow Keala, okay?

758
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:11,468
Let's go.

759
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,448
What is that smell?

760
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:28,152
It's ammonia.

761
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,688
They mix it with the opium
as they boil it down.

762
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:38,495
Get down, get down!

763
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:43,000
Leap, Leap!

764
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:44,201
Wendy, Wendy!

765
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:46,971
- Wendy!
- Oh, God!

766
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:48,806
Leap, Leap!

767
00:54:50,107 --> 00:54:53,510
I thought you were all dead.

768
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:03,921
Where's Angie?

769
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:05,890
We haven't seen her.

770
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:06,924
And Bao?

771
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:14,065
Run!

772
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:43,060
Dez!

773
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:00,543
Can you hear me?

774
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,891
The kid has the module!

775
00:56:13,924 --> 00:56:15,026
I'm guessing that's Number
Four's.

776
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,060
Shit!

777
00:56:23,768 --> 00:56:24,769
No!

778
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,809
Come on!

779
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:34,011
Yeah, you're welcome!

780
00:56:34,045 --> 00:56:35,346
Come on!

781
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:44,215
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

782
00:57:44,248 --> 00:57:45,983
Start priming the
self-destruct.

783
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:49,220
Blow it, blow it, come on!

784
00:57:49,253 --> 00:57:50,754
- 30 seconds.
- Fuck!

785
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:51,889
Seriously?

786
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:13,210
And?

787
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:14,011
Detonation confirmed.

788
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,112
How do we know we got
everyone?

789
00:58:15,146 --> 00:58:17,448
It should've wiped out
everything within 200 yards.

790
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:20,451
Until I see bodies, no one is
dead.

791
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,134
Leap.

792
00:59:11,402 --> 00:59:12,403
Leap.

793
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,811
Keala, Keala.

794
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,482
Hey, hey, let me see,
let me see, let me see.

795
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:31,488
Help!

796
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:34,058
Keala needs help!

797
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:35,960
I got it, got it, got it.

798
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,528
Hey, hey, stay with me.

799
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,071
What happened?

800
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:49,473
Move your hand, move your hand.

801
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:50,507
Oh my God.

802
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:53,143
Oh, shit.

803
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,378
We need to move her on her
side.

804
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:56,146
Come on, Mason, help me.

805
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,481
Move her on her side.

806
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:00,351
Need to position her here.

807
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:01,952
Okay, put pressure on the back.

808
01:00:01,986 --> 01:00:04,021
Okay, come on, put your hand
here, okay.

809
01:00:04,054 --> 01:00:05,556
The bullet's gone through.

810
01:00:05,589 --> 01:00:09,026
We don't have a lot of
equipment for a wound like this.

811
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:11,428
We're gonna try and stop
the bleeding, but, uh.

812
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:13,430
But what?

813
01:00:15,065 --> 01:00:16,233
It's not looking good.

814
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:22,806
Keala, we're gonna try to
get you outta here, okay?

815
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,441
Put your hand here.

816
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:27,011
Dez, Dez.

817
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:28,045
Can you hear me?

818
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:30,147
Dez!

819
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:39,089
Leap!

820
01:00:47,998 --> 01:00:49,466
Your father was a brave man.

821
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,485
I respect any man

822
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:09,920
who would die protecting his
family.

823
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:12,056
He was fighting for
you and your mom, okay?

824
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,326
It's my fault.

825
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,063
I made the metal man angry.

826
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,230
I stole this.

827
01:01:26,036 --> 01:01:28,105
Leap, Leap, look at me.

828
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:31,175
This is not because of you,
okay?

829
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:34,978
Some men sent these metal men
here to attack our village.

830
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:35,979
It's not because of anything

831
01:01:36,013 --> 01:01:37,648
that you did or because of this.

832
01:01:46,924 --> 01:01:48,892
Let's go on one, two, three.

833
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:02,239
Keala, can you walk?

834
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,342
Yes, slowly.

835
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:06,510
- I can help her.
- Leap, Leap.

836
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:09,980
Leap.

837
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:23,293
Leap!

838
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:31,235
Leap!

839
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,981
Leap.

840
01:02:44,615 --> 01:02:45,683
Leap, listen.

841
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:49,386
We gotta get your mother
outta here now, okay?

842
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,724
We need you, you're the
only one who knows the way.

843
01:02:52,757 --> 01:02:54,391
I need your help, okay?

844
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:09,573
Leap, Leap.

845
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:36,300
Go.

846
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,201
Major, this has gone south.

847
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:38,670
We have to start making some
decisions.

848
01:03:38,703 --> 01:03:40,337
We have a robot wondering the
jungle

849
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,606
looking for the fucking
Internet.

850
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:43,974
Just stay calm.

851
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:47,712
American citizens,
who can still be alive,

852
01:03:47,745 --> 01:03:51,181
who quite possibly have both
physical and video evidence.

853
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:52,416
I don't have enough assets in
the field

854
01:03:52,449 --> 01:03:54,084
to solve both problems.

855
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:57,421
I recommend you call in drone
support,

856
01:03:57,454 --> 01:03:59,657
we wipe this area clean.

857
01:03:59,691 --> 01:04:02,159
Listen, this op is off the
grid.

858
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:04,194
If I start making calls for
drone support,

859
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:06,396
we're gonna have a lot
bigger problems to deal with.

860
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,031
We have their
positions.

861
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:09,801
I'll call you right back.

862
01:04:09,834 --> 01:04:11,502
We tracked the BR1 to the
site.

863
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:12,369
BR2 is en route.

864
01:04:12,402 --> 01:04:15,439
That kid had a module in his
hand.

865
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:16,573
Does it have a GPS beacon?

866
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:17,508
It does.

867
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,109
Then why haven't we been
tracking that?

868
01:04:19,142 --> 01:04:20,344
Well, we didn't know the kid
had it!

869
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:21,512
We've been using the GPS tracker

870
01:04:21,545 --> 01:04:23,280
built into the BR4 unit.

871
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:25,048
We thought that the module
was still attached to the BR4

872
01:04:25,082 --> 01:04:26,617
so we just never thought
of that as an option.

873
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,252
So it just never came to mind.

874
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:30,521
Fucking amateurs.

875
01:04:35,158 --> 01:04:36,527
Look, the whole point of this
exercise

876
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,696
was to see how reliable your
assets are

877
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,564
in a real life situation.

878
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:42,165
Now I've got people on
both sides of the fence

879
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:43,400
looking in on this, and, so far,

880
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:46,370
all we have is an unarmed Navy
SEAL

881
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:48,472
beating the shit out of one
of them with a sledgehammer!

882
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:50,842
That sledgehammer didn't stop
our asset.

883
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,777
A very large explosive booby
trap did,

884
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,344
set up by a highly trained Navy
SEAL

885
01:04:54,378 --> 01:04:56,246
who shouldn't have been there.

886
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,581
Your man killed it when he
detonated

887
01:04:57,614 --> 01:04:59,249
that asset without authority.

888
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:02,854
Not to mention, your intel
on the site was incorrect.

889
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:04,856
Having seven US civilians in the
zone

890
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:07,224
was not part of our test
parameters.

891
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:09,661
All right, I'll figure
out how to clean this up.

892
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:11,361
But your people have to
figure out how to control it

893
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:12,396
or take down BR4.

894
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:17,367
Cocksucker.

895
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,372
How far is BR2 from reaching
the camp.

896
01:05:22,406 --> 01:05:23,407
20 to 30 minutes.

897
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,275
Does BR3 have a lock on Four?

898
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:27,377
There's an intermittent
signal, but getting close.

899
01:05:27,411 --> 01:05:28,046
How close?

900
01:05:28,078 --> 01:05:29,814
BR2 is in the blast zone,

901
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,716
BR3 has a lock on BR4.

902
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:33,383
They're close.

903
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:35,820
Get ready to blow Three in
case this doesn't go right.

904
01:05:59,744 --> 01:06:01,545
Oh, that's a new move.

905
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:02,479
What do you mean?

906
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:03,580
Well, they're designed to take
a beating

907
01:06:03,614 --> 01:06:06,416
and keep fighting, not
dodge and hide like a ninja.

908
01:06:08,953 --> 01:06:10,688
Four's got a bunch of new
skills.

909
01:06:32,944 --> 01:06:35,612
Major, I say we detonate
BR3 to take out Four.

910
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:36,480
Confirmed.

911
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:37,314
Hold up!

912
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:38,750
This robot's brain could be the
key

913
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:40,350
to a whole new level of tech.

914
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:42,787
Jantz, Kroger, see if you can
hook

915
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,454
into Four with Three's BFA

916
01:06:44,488 --> 01:06:45,723
and download whatever you can.

917
01:06:45,757 --> 01:06:47,190
Okay, we're linked.

918
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:50,895
We got a message from BR4.

919
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:53,463
What?

920
01:06:53,497 --> 01:06:54,631
Well, what does it say?

921
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:56,400
Thank you?

922
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:57,702
He's uploading himself again.

923
01:06:57,735 --> 01:06:59,403
Cut the connection between the
pair.

924
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:00,504
- Done.
- Four has reconnected

925
01:07:00,537 --> 01:07:01,638
to Three again.
_ Shit!

926
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:02,840
Blow it up!

927
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:05,475
Major, your man does not
have the authority to detonate.

928
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:06,711
Yes, he does.

929
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:07,577
Do it.

930
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:08,612
Do it.

931
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:13,517
BR4 is stopping BR3's
detonation code.

932
01:07:16,486 --> 01:07:18,690
Okay, we're good, I blocked
him with a password.

933
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:19,724
10 seconds.

934
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,461
Fuck!

935
01:07:26,698 --> 01:07:28,800
Tell me that didn't just
happen.

936
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,434
It's not supposed to happen.

937
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,541
It's getting smarter, isn't
it?

938
01:07:38,442 --> 01:07:39,844
Uh huh.

939
01:07:46,616 --> 01:07:47,985
There's Four again, he's
uploading.

940
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:49,286
Goddamn it!

941
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:49,987
Shut him down!

942
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:50,855
Fuck!

943
01:07:50,888 --> 01:07:52,322
Cut the link, kill it!

944
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:03,768
Dead or alive, we need BR4's
AI data.

945
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:05,737
It'll put the program ahead 10
years.

946
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,337
Yeah, well, I prefer it dead.

947
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,006
Priority is to not let it
connect again.

948
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,042
Boller, how do we fix this?

949
01:08:11,075 --> 01:08:13,044
I'm gonna have to go in, try
to find it.

950
01:08:13,077 --> 01:08:16,313
I'll tag it with a marker,
and a drone can hit it.

951
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:17,882
I've got an idea.

952
01:08:17,915 --> 01:08:18,950
Hey, hear me out.

953
01:08:18,983 --> 01:08:22,787
BR3 is still operational,
just missing the module.

954
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,857
We've got spare ones right here.

955
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,724
If we can get Three...

956
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:28,525
Didn't we just see Four kick
its ass?

957
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:30,393
This is new combat
programming.

958
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:32,395
I've been working on it
for the new BR upgrades.

959
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:34,699
It's not tested, but I know
it'll work.

960
01:08:34,732 --> 01:08:37,802
BR3 will be 10 times faster and
stronger.

961
01:08:37,835 --> 01:08:38,970
The only problem that I see

962
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:42,006
is that it could run through
its battery in five hours.

963
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,074
We have spare batteries?

964
01:08:43,107 --> 01:08:46,409
No, but this is all the
time that BR3 may need.

965
01:08:46,443 --> 01:08:49,513
If we can get BR3 to take out
Four

966
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,314
or at least keep it occupied
long enough

967
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:53,718
for us to laser target or use an
EMP.

968
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:54,752
Okay.

969
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:58,790
You share Four's module
information with BR2 right now.

970
01:09:17,942 --> 01:09:19,110
Hello?

971
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:21,779
Ann, Ann, calm down, what's
wrong?

972
01:09:24,648 --> 01:09:25,983
You're being watched.

973
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:27,018
Stay here!

974
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:31,421
They killed dozens of people.

975
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:32,556
Some are American.

976
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:33,891
The CIA is running the show.

977
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:36,060
Ann, you need to get
the hell out of there.

978
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:39,730
I'm so, please, help me.

979
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:40,665
Where are you?

980
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:41,364
Can you ping me your address or
something,

981
01:09:41,398 --> 01:09:42,066
and I can try and get you out.

982
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,835
Okay, I'm doing it right now.

983
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:50,074
Not the way this is
supposed to work, Fielding.

984
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:52,109
I'm just calling my mom.

985
01:09:52,143 --> 01:09:53,077
You always tell your mother
about

986
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,745
confidential projects you're
working on?

987
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:56,080
Ann, what's
going on?

988
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:57,347
Give me that phone.

989
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:00,417
I said, give me the phone.

990
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:05,156
Ann, can you hear me?

991
01:10:10,828 --> 01:10:11,963
Ann, can you hear me?

992
01:10:30,915 --> 01:10:31,581
No!

993
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:06,350
Shit!

994
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:14,792
Oh, no.

995
01:11:17,695 --> 01:11:18,696
Ann!

996
01:11:25,937 --> 01:11:26,938
Come on, girl.

997
01:11:29,774 --> 01:11:31,042
I'm not gonna hurt you.

998
01:11:34,045 --> 01:11:35,212
Just give me that phone.

999
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:41,953
And we go back to the house.

1000
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:15,720
No!

1001
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:18,289
No!

1002
01:12:18,322 --> 01:12:19,622
No!

1003
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,721
Your mother died eight
years ago, remember?

1004
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:52,890
It's gonna be over soon.

1005
01:12:52,923 --> 01:12:56,994
I promise, it's gonna be over
real soon.

1006
01:12:57,028 --> 01:12:59,830
That's what we want, right
there.

1007
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:09,940
Fucking waste.

1008
01:13:18,282 --> 01:13:19,683
Ann!

1009
01:13:19,717 --> 01:13:21,318
Ann, what's going on?

1010
01:13:24,388 --> 01:13:25,289
Hello?

1011
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:27,792
Who the fuck is this?

1012
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:29,592
Put Ann on the phone!

1013
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:34,965
What the?

1014
01:13:45,176 --> 01:13:47,610
Bravo, echo, 75-alpha.

1015
01:13:47,644 --> 01:13:49,346
Confirmed, site compromised.

1016
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,748
Call to made number.

1017
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:53,217
Plus 1-5-5-5-8-3-9.

1018
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,251
Tidy it up.

1019
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:58,189
I'm worried about Fielding.

1020
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:01,725
You think she bailed on us?

1021
01:14:01,759 --> 01:14:03,027
What do you think?

1022
01:14:16,307 --> 01:14:18,008
We've been compromised,
we're on the move.

1023
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:18,876
Pack up your gear.

1024
01:14:18,909 --> 01:14:19,743
What about the link.

1025
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:20,377
Kill the link.

1026
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:21,245
BR2 can hunt without us.

1027
01:14:21,278 --> 01:14:22,113
Where's Fielding?

1028
01:14:22,146 --> 01:14:24,115
I couldn't find her.

1029
01:14:24,148 --> 01:14:26,250
I said pack up, we're out of
here in five!

1030
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:38,429
Come on.

1031
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,751
Leave it.

1032
01:15:00,784 --> 01:15:01,785
Damn it.

1033
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:19,069
It had to be raining.

1034
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:22,173
Come on, come on,
let's go.

1035
01:15:25,743 --> 01:15:28,312
Keep moving, keep moving,
let's go!

1036
01:16:00,377 --> 01:16:01,478
Are you ready?

1037
01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:17,328
Guys, we're moving too slow.

1038
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:19,129
These things are gonna catch up
to us.

1039
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:21,031
We gotta get on top of one of
these rocks,

1040
01:16:21,065 --> 01:16:22,800
make it more difficult for
these things to follow us.

1041
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:23,834
Are you crazy?

1042
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:24,768
You want us to climb a vine?

1043
01:16:24,802 --> 01:16:26,170
What about Dez and Keala?

1044
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:27,404
There's no way they're
making it up that.

1045
01:16:27,438 --> 01:16:28,539
Jordan, I need you to stay
down here.

1046
01:16:28,572 --> 01:16:30,407
You need to strap these two in.

1047
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:31,976
Girls, come up with me.

1048
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,844
I'll need your help pulling them
up.

1049
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:36,780
Let's go.

1050
01:16:56,233 --> 01:16:57,901
Come on.

1051
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:02,339
You can do it, give me your
hand, come on, don't stop.

1052
01:17:03,407 --> 01:17:04,241
Come on.

1053
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:17,321
Jordan, put this around Keala.

1054
01:17:23,494 --> 01:17:25,029
Hey, Leap, come on up, buddy.

1055
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:26,597
We gotta help your mom up.

1056
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,913
Okay, she's good, pull her up.

1057
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:58,128
In the shade,
hurry, in the shade.

1058
01:18:03,067 --> 01:18:07,338
It's okay, I got you,
you're safe now, okay?

1059
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:08,839
You're safe now.

1060
01:18:12,309 --> 01:18:15,312
Why didn't we come
here in the first place?

1061
01:18:15,346 --> 01:18:16,146
Seriously.

1062
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,148
Up and running as soon as we
can.

1063
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:28,325
This place is
awesome.

1064
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:29,927
We set up in here.

1065
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:33,130
All right, he's good, pull
him!

1066
01:18:33,163 --> 01:18:34,131
You all right?

1067
01:18:34,164 --> 01:18:35,199
You got this.

1068
01:18:37,935 --> 01:18:38,670
Go!

1069
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:49,046
How's that looking?

1070
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:50,314
Yeah, we're good.

1071
01:18:53,016 --> 01:18:55,052
All right, we got BR2.

1072
01:18:55,085 --> 01:18:56,620
It close to BR4's module.

1073
01:18:57,722 --> 01:18:58,922
One second.

1074
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:01,592
He's on to one of them.

1075
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,131
Jordan, run!

1076
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:14,138
Run!

1077
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,513
Fuck, it spotted us.

1078
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:33,725
- Hurry, hurry!
- Run!

1079
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:10,194
Jordan, it's coming, run, run!

1080
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:11,228
Go, run, go!

1081
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:16,400
We have to help him!

1082
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:17,735
He's gonna be fine, he
can outrun those things.

1083
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:19,771
He's fast, okay, but we've
gotta get to the caves.

1084
01:20:19,804 --> 01:20:20,604
No, not without Jordan.

1085
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:23,207
We are not leaving without
Jordan!

1086
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,643
Okay, just get away from the
edge, okay?

1087
01:22:22,626 --> 01:22:24,628
Jordan, where are you?

1088
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,796
Go, go, go.

1089
01:23:15,212 --> 01:23:16,446
- It's Jordan.
- Jordan!

1090
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,615
- Come on, hurry!
- Get up!

1091
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:21,418
- Jordan, hurry.
- Jordan, come on.

1092
01:23:21,451 --> 01:23:22,285
Hurry up!

1093
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:23,654
Move, move, get out of
the way.

1094
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:25,690
Hurry, come on.

1095
01:23:26,891 --> 01:23:29,226
Come on, come on, come on.

1096
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:34,666
Come on, come on, come on.

1097
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:52,884
Shit.

1098
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:53,918
This thing's climbing.

1099
01:24:07,932 --> 01:24:08,966
We gotta keep moving.

1100
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:13,938
Is the module ready for three?

1101
01:24:15,873 --> 01:24:17,607
And here's a handheld
tracker also connected

1102
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:18,843
to our BFA signal.

1103
01:24:20,044 --> 01:24:21,311
This is your EMP.

1104
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:22,479
You'll need to be close.

1105
01:24:22,512 --> 01:24:23,613
Will it take out all three?

1106
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:24,916
If they're standing together
and you're close enough,

1107
01:24:24,949 --> 01:24:25,950
then, yeah.

1108
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:34,025
All right, boys, listen up,

1109
01:24:34,058 --> 01:24:35,325
'cause I know, as soon as I
leave,

1110
01:24:35,358 --> 01:24:36,661
you're both gonna wanna run.

1111
01:24:38,863 --> 01:24:39,897
You know who this is?

1112
01:24:42,299 --> 01:24:43,300
My mother.

1113
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:44,869
You?

1114
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:47,872
You dare hurt them.

1115
01:24:48,806 --> 01:24:49,807
I won't.

1116
01:24:50,775 --> 01:24:52,576
But the people shooting
these videos might.

1117
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:53,643
Fuck you!

1118
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,916
There is a drone overhead.

1119
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:00,785
It's been there since we got
started.

1120
01:25:00,818 --> 01:25:03,054
If this op is compromised by
this room,

1121
01:25:03,087 --> 01:25:04,488
you both will burn here,

1122
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:08,760
and the people in those videos,
gone.

1123
01:25:10,327 --> 01:25:12,329
The bosses that are monitoring
this feed

1124
01:25:13,765 --> 01:25:15,967
can see everything happening in
this room,

1125
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,803
so be smart, don't fuck up,

1126
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,006
and you get to go home upright.

1127
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:23,607
How does that sound?

1128
01:25:38,656 --> 01:25:42,059
Cocksucking piece of shit,
motherfucker!

1129
01:25:44,361 --> 01:25:46,396
Fuck, fuck.

1130
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:50,935
Go.

1131
01:25:55,907 --> 01:25:56,908
Go.

1132
01:25:58,743 --> 01:26:00,711
I just sent you the numbers.

1133
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:01,746
You have control.

1134
01:26:03,446 --> 01:26:04,447
All right.

1135
01:26:08,853 --> 01:26:10,922
Hey, I found it.

1136
01:26:12,957 --> 01:26:14,659
All right, you lead the way,
okay, Leap?

1137
01:26:14,692 --> 01:26:16,459
Here, take this.

1138
01:26:16,493 --> 01:26:19,697
I think we lost it.

1139
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,399
No, it's hunting us.

1140
01:26:22,432 --> 01:26:24,634
It'll find our tracks
eventually.

1141
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:27,138
Let's keep moving.

1142
01:26:36,646 --> 01:26:39,717
Here, here,
here, here, right here.

1143
01:27:04,574 --> 01:27:05,243
Sorry.

1144
01:27:05,276 --> 01:27:07,678
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1145
01:27:11,015 --> 01:27:12,016
This way.

1146
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:19,623
- Just try, just try.
- Are you serious?

1147
01:27:47,251 --> 01:27:48,618
Three's coming online.

1148
01:27:49,987 --> 01:27:51,789
Connection's solid.

1149
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:53,791
Activating the new firmware.

1150
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:07,772
Looks like Boller's got
Three's explosive pack.

1151
01:28:16,113 --> 01:28:17,614
Catch me if you can.

1152
01:28:19,684 --> 01:28:20,952
It talks?

1153
01:28:20,985 --> 01:28:21,986
Upgrade.

1154
01:28:23,955 --> 01:28:25,656
Nerds.

1155
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,857
- Mason.
- Yeah?

1156
01:28:26,891 --> 01:28:28,225
I need to stop.

1157
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:30,493
I cannot go on.

1158
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:32,196
We all need to stop.

1159
01:28:33,698 --> 01:28:34,699
All right.

1160
01:28:43,941 --> 01:28:46,677
We can't stay out in the open
like this.

1161
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:48,879
I'll go find somewhere
for us to hide, okay?

1162
01:28:50,681 --> 01:28:52,083
You done good.

1163
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:53,516
Your pa would be proud.

1164
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:56,053
- Dez, Dez, Dez?
- He's deaf.

1165
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:03,194
That thing shot his ears off,
he's deaf.

1166
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:05,595
Dez, can you
hear me, can you hear me?

1167
01:29:05,628 --> 01:29:08,565
Dez, are you okay, can you hear
me?

1168
01:29:19,642 --> 01:29:21,644
Jordan, what are they?

1169
01:29:23,114 --> 01:29:24,749
Why do they want to kill us?

1170
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:25,983
I don't know.

1171
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:28,919
I don't know.

1172
01:29:28,953 --> 01:29:33,623
Hey, it's okay, it's gonna be
fine.

1173
01:29:34,725 --> 01:29:36,694
Mason's gonna save us, okay?

1174
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:42,166
And if we lose him, I'll do my
best

1175
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:43,968
to get us outta here, okay?

1176
01:29:47,171 --> 01:29:49,572
Shit, the light, kill the
light, kill the light.

1177
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:56,013
It's Mason, it's
Mason!

1178
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:22,840
He can help us.

1179
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:26,210
No, he can't.

1180
01:30:26,243 --> 01:30:28,312
Everybody up, let's keep moving.

1181
01:30:40,124 --> 01:30:41,624
We rest here tonight.

1182
01:30:58,242 --> 01:31:01,312
Hope that doesn't mean I am
out of time.

1183
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:05,182
It doesn't mean anything.

1184
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:07,617
It's just a reminder

1185
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:12,622
that I'm not as smart as I
thought I was.

1186
01:31:30,107 --> 01:31:31,342
I was leading a mission.

1187
01:31:35,713 --> 01:31:36,881
I got cocky.

1188
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:42,720
My team was breaching a door.

1189
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:48,726
I ignored this intel,
and we all got shot up,

1190
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:50,694
and I was the only survivor.

1191
01:31:58,135 --> 01:32:02,072
'Cause it was my
responsibility, it's my fault.

1192
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:11,849
It's just a reminder that I
got all my friends killed.

1193
01:32:17,755 --> 01:32:21,225
You don't have to
carry the pain forever.

1194
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,062
Can you turn it off for me?

1195
01:32:31,435 --> 01:32:34,238
I'll miss time to be with my
son.

1196
01:32:36,106 --> 01:32:37,441
He's not a man yet.

1197
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:40,844
He needs a man.

1198
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,482
If I go, he will have no one.

1199
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:47,117
It's not gonna be like that.

1200
01:32:48,919 --> 01:32:50,821
You're gonna see him grow into a
man.

1201
01:32:52,356 --> 01:32:53,457
Promise me.

1202
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:58,062
I promise, but it's not
gonna be like that, okay?

1203
01:33:25,489 --> 01:33:26,490
Keala.

1204
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:32,196
Keala.

1205
01:33:34,965 --> 01:33:36,200
Keala.

1206
01:33:36,233 --> 01:33:37,234
Keala?

1207
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:41,405
Keala.

1208
01:33:41,438 --> 01:33:43,107
- Keala.
- Move, move.

1209
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:48,045
Keala.

1210
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,315
She's bleeding internally.

1211
01:33:51,348 --> 01:33:52,216
What do you mean?

1212
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:55,386
Everything we don't have.

1213
01:33:55,419 --> 01:33:56,287
Shh, shh.

1214
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:08,365
Jordan, Jordan, look out that
way.

1215
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:18,469
Is Mason okay?

1216
01:35:18,502 --> 01:35:20,337
It sounded like he got hit.

1217
01:35:22,539 --> 01:35:23,374
Mason!

1218
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:31,949
Hurry, hurry, it's coming.

1219
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:33,650
We're going as fast as we can.

1220
01:35:39,523 --> 01:35:41,492
Look out!

1221
01:35:41,525 --> 01:35:43,260
Hey, you little fuck!

1222
01:36:32,242 --> 01:36:34,178
- You guys okay?
- Barely.

1223
01:36:36,647 --> 01:36:37,548
How is she?

1224
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:40,584
She's alive but she lost a lot
of blood.

1225
01:36:40,617 --> 01:36:41,686
We really need to get her out of
here.

1226
01:36:41,719 --> 01:36:43,520
All right, let's go.

1227
01:36:43,554 --> 01:36:45,355
Let's keep moving, come on.

1228
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:54,631
Whoa, you gotta be shitting
me!

1229
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:55,499
This thing's stuck pretty
good,

1230
01:36:55,532 --> 01:36:57,434
but I'm not for sure how much
longer.

1231
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,203
We gotta get past it somehow.

1232
01:36:59,236 --> 01:37:01,038
Are you kidding me?

1233
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,441
No.

1234
01:37:32,236 --> 01:37:33,604
You gotta be kidding me!

1235
01:37:33,637 --> 01:37:35,072
You're only gonna kill us!

1236
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:36,106
All right!

1237
01:37:39,811 --> 01:37:41,545
What the hell is it, Mason?

1238
01:37:41,578 --> 01:37:42,714
Who makes these things?

1239
01:37:44,648 --> 01:37:46,083
They're military robots.

1240
01:37:47,184 --> 01:37:48,185
Seriously?

1241
01:37:48,753 --> 01:37:51,588
The military's this advanced?

1242
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:53,323
More than anybody
would know.

1243
01:37:53,357 --> 01:37:54,258
Why do they wanna kill us?

1244
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,193
I think we're just in the
wrong place

1245
01:37:56,226 --> 01:37:57,695
at the wrong time.

1246
01:37:57,729 --> 01:38:00,097
But whoever's controlling these
things,

1247
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,232
I don't think they want any
witnesses.

1248
01:38:02,266 --> 01:38:03,233
Let's keep moving.

1249
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,445
This way.

1250
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,255
Fuck, did you see that?

1251
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:27,157
Pity the robot stepped on it.

1252
01:38:35,632 --> 01:38:36,668
That's pretty cool.

1253
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:43,440
Yes, sir?

1254
01:38:43,473 --> 01:38:45,710
You still with us, Jantz?

1255
01:38:45,743 --> 01:38:47,511
Openly, sir.

1256
01:38:47,544 --> 01:38:50,380
I mean this whole operation is
gone.

1257
01:38:50,414 --> 01:38:54,284
I mean, surveillance mission
turned into a kill mission?

1258
01:38:54,318 --> 01:38:56,688
US citizens under kill orders
for what?

1259
01:38:56,721 --> 01:38:58,488
For being in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

1260
01:38:58,522 --> 01:38:59,556
You built it.

1261
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,693
I know that these robots
are designed for this,

1262
01:39:01,726 --> 01:39:04,227
but I didn't sign up to
kill innocent people.

1263
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:06,263
This is not a war situation.

1264
01:39:06,296 --> 01:39:07,832
Okay, calm down.

1265
01:39:07,865 --> 01:39:11,401
It's not gone as planned but
you have to finish this op.

1266
01:39:11,435 --> 01:39:13,270
And I'll personally see to
it that you're compensated

1267
01:39:13,303 --> 01:39:15,773
for the toll this mission's
taking on you.

1268
01:39:15,807 --> 01:39:16,573
What about me?

1269
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:18,442
I didn't sign up for this,
either.

1270
01:39:18,475 --> 01:39:20,177
For whoever finishes this,

1271
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:22,680
there'll be a substantial
bonus when you get stateside.

1272
01:39:24,281 --> 01:39:25,282
Are we good?

1273
01:39:26,383 --> 01:39:27,752
Yes.

1274
01:39:27,785 --> 01:39:28,786
Yes, we're good.

1275
01:39:32,255 --> 01:39:33,791
You here that, Jantz?

1276
01:39:33,825 --> 01:39:36,661
- Okay.
- We just get through this.

1277
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:38,730
Paid up and done.

1278
01:40:14,631 --> 01:40:17,434
Look after Leap for me.

1279
01:40:17,467 --> 01:40:18,736
Look after Leap.

1280
01:42:05,475 --> 01:42:07,544
Your mom's at peace
now, bud.

1281
01:42:13,684 --> 01:42:15,753
We can't leave Ma here.

1282
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:20,892
We'll come back for her.

1283
01:42:20,925 --> 01:42:24,561
Okay, we'll come back
and get her, I promise.

1284
01:42:24,594 --> 01:42:25,595
Promise?

1285
01:42:27,665 --> 01:42:29,100
I promise.

1286
01:42:41,846 --> 01:42:44,048
Oh, oh, God, run, run!

1287
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:48,385
You guys, come on, come on,
move, move now, now, Dez.

1288
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:07,504
Shit, go!

1289
01:43:07,537 --> 01:43:08,773
This way!

1290
01:43:23,587 --> 01:43:25,690
Leap, I need you to take
the group outta here, okay?

1291
01:43:25,723 --> 01:43:28,960
If you get free, you run, you
understand?

1292
01:43:28,993 --> 01:43:31,028
Go now, go, go, go.

1293
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:34,899
Jordan, stay here, stay here.

1294
01:43:34,932 --> 01:43:36,100
What?

1295
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:38,069
We need to lead this thing
away from the others, okay?

1296
01:43:38,102 --> 01:43:38,936
Good?

1297
01:43:49,113 --> 01:43:49,981
Hey!

1298
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:15,605
Does this kid even
know where we're going?

1299
01:44:15,639 --> 01:44:16,506
What choice do we have?

1300
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:17,474
This is a mess.

1301
01:44:17,507 --> 01:44:18,843
Come on, let's go.

1302
01:44:28,753 --> 01:44:30,988
What if we climb up and over the
top?

1303
01:44:31,022 --> 01:44:32,690
What about Dez, he can't
climb!

1304
01:44:32,723 --> 01:44:34,125
This way, this way!

1305
01:44:34,158 --> 01:44:35,558
Come on.

1306
01:44:35,592 --> 01:44:36,694
Guys, let's go.

1307
01:44:46,904 --> 01:44:50,107
Wendy, Tien, I'm
outside, can you hear me?

1308
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:51,909
Yeah, how do we get out?

1309
01:44:54,577 --> 01:44:55,578
- Jordan!
- I'm coming!

1310
01:44:59,817 --> 01:45:01,584
Shit, it's a dead end.

1311
01:45:34,819 --> 01:45:35,853
Okay, we're going.

1312
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:46,097
Jordan, we're outside!

1313
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,932
Stop it, Mason said
we should keep running.

1314
01:45:47,965 --> 01:45:49,133
No, no, what about Jordan?

1315
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:50,067
We can't just leave him.

1316
01:45:50,101 --> 01:45:51,068
He's with Mason, Tien, please,
let's go.

1317
01:45:51,102 --> 01:45:53,570
Let's go, come on, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1318
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:55,139
Let's go, Tien, come on.

1319
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:23,000
Hey.

1320
01:46:24,634 --> 01:46:25,302
Come on.

1321
01:47:05,376 --> 01:47:06,210
Kroger.

1322
01:47:06,243 --> 01:47:07,078
Update.

1323
01:47:07,111 --> 01:47:09,780
Short story, BR2's one klick
behind

1324
01:47:09,814 --> 01:47:10,915
BR4's module indent.

1325
01:47:10,948 --> 01:47:14,718
BR3's a couple klicks behind.

1326
01:47:14,752 --> 01:47:15,753
You're close.

1327
01:47:17,788 --> 01:47:19,056
Go fuck yourself.

1328
01:47:28,065 --> 01:47:29,233
Something's coming!

1329
01:47:30,267 --> 01:47:32,303
Look, get up, get up!

1330
01:47:43,914 --> 01:47:44,915
It's Mason!

1331
01:47:46,383 --> 01:47:48,651
- Jordan!
- It's Mason.

1332
01:47:48,686 --> 01:47:50,788
Oh my God!

1333
01:47:52,423 --> 01:47:54,024
Dez, you gotta get up.

1334
01:47:54,058 --> 01:47:54,892
Come on.

1335
01:48:15,713 --> 01:48:17,715
Shh, shh, shh, get in the bush
now.

1336
01:48:17,748 --> 01:48:19,717
Jordan, take them, go, down,
stay low.

1337
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,218
Get down, get down.

1338
01:48:21,252 --> 01:48:23,687
All right, stay still, stay
quiet, okay?

1339
01:48:23,721 --> 01:48:25,022
How do these things keep
finding us?

1340
01:48:25,055 --> 01:48:26,190
I don't know, I don't know.

1341
01:48:26,223 --> 01:48:27,958
Cell phones, drones.

1342
01:48:31,395 --> 01:48:32,596
What?

1343
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:35,032
Leap, do you have that thing
you found in your bag still?

1344
01:48:35,065 --> 01:48:36,066
Get it out.

1345
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:45,209
This is why.

1346
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:50,848
All right, you guys stay
here, stay quiet, okay?

1347
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:51,982
It's okay.

1348
01:49:21,278 --> 01:49:22,713
They ditched the module.

1349
01:49:23,447 --> 01:49:24,915
That's it, we lost them.

1350
01:49:24,949 --> 01:49:26,850
No, they have to be close.

1351
01:49:26,884 --> 01:49:28,285
The beacon was moving two
minutes ago.

1352
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:30,154
Two's programming
should make it backtrack.

1353
01:49:37,394 --> 01:49:39,296
All right, stop, stop.

1354
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:40,164
Hurry.

1355
01:49:40,197 --> 01:49:41,999
Dez, Dez, come on.

1356
01:49:42,032 --> 01:49:42,701
I got him, I got him!

1357
01:49:42,733 --> 01:49:45,169
Jordan, go, take the girls, now!

1358
01:49:45,202 --> 01:49:47,471
- We're not going without Dez!
- Now, now, go, go, take them!

1359
01:49:47,504 --> 01:49:49,907
Go, Leap, run, Leap, go with the
girls!

1360
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:50,774
No, I stay with you!

1361
01:49:50,808 --> 01:49:52,209
Leap, stay, stay.

1362
01:49:52,243 --> 01:49:54,545
Come on, come on, come on.

1363
01:49:54,578 --> 01:49:55,779
Do not move!

1364
01:50:00,484 --> 01:50:02,052
Over here, you fuck!

1365
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:08,859
Fuck, damn it!

1366
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:11,962
Come on, come on,

1367
01:50:11,996 --> 01:50:13,397
- come on, come on!
- Dez, no!

1368
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:14,431
Dez, Dez!

1369
01:50:16,166 --> 01:50:17,201
Dez!

1370
01:50:17,234 --> 01:50:18,235
Dez!

1371
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,238
Dez!

1372
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:26,543
Dez!

1373
01:50:28,112 --> 01:50:30,948
Wendy, it's coming, we gotta
go.

1374
01:50:34,018 --> 01:50:35,019
Come on!

1375
01:50:40,257 --> 01:50:43,927
Leap, come here, come
here.

1376
01:50:54,171 --> 01:50:56,073
Four is uploading
through Two again.

1377
01:50:56,106 --> 01:50:57,107
No, no, no, no.

1378
01:50:59,376 --> 01:51:00,577
Mason.

1379
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:01,612
Detonate them.

1380
01:51:01,645 --> 01:51:02,714
Can't.

1381
01:51:02,747 --> 01:51:04,581
All right, cut the
connection, and stop the upload.

1382
01:51:04,615 --> 01:51:06,016
Four has control of Two.

1383
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:07,051
Fuck.

1384
01:51:08,352 --> 01:51:09,953
And we're blind.

1385
01:51:09,987 --> 01:51:10,988
Oh, shit!

1386
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:15,893
You killed the visual
cable, Jantz, fuck.

1387
01:51:15,926 --> 01:51:17,227
All right, our eyes are back.

1388
01:51:19,963 --> 01:51:20,964
Come on.

1389
01:51:24,902 --> 01:51:26,403
How can we get the pictures back
online?

1390
01:51:26,437 --> 01:51:28,972
We cut all online connections
here

1391
01:51:29,006 --> 01:51:30,307
so Four can't upload.

1392
01:51:30,341 --> 01:51:31,308
We can see what's going on

1393
01:51:31,342 --> 01:51:33,310
but we can't send you
a feed, it's too risky.

1394
01:51:33,344 --> 01:51:34,278
Fuck that.

1395
01:51:34,311 --> 01:51:36,046
Get us back online
the moment that you can.

1396
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,081
Yep.

1397
01:51:40,317 --> 01:51:42,119
Mason, Mason, look out.

1398
01:51:42,152 --> 01:51:43,887
Mason, Mason, Mason!

1399
01:51:45,556 --> 01:51:47,157
Mason, Mason, look.

1400
01:51:47,191 --> 01:51:48,459
That's not good.

1401
01:51:48,492 --> 01:51:49,526
That's not good, man.

1402
01:51:51,929 --> 01:51:54,531
Kroger, look at me, look at
me, look.

1403
01:51:54,565 --> 01:51:56,467
We need to get the fuck outta
here.

1404
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,301
How?

1405
01:51:57,334 --> 01:51:59,370
All right, these fuckers have
eyes

1406
01:51:59,403 --> 01:52:00,571
on our families' houses.

1407
01:52:00,604 --> 01:52:03,474
If we leave, they die.

1408
01:52:03,507 --> 01:52:04,508
We die.

1409
01:52:05,976 --> 01:52:07,177
So hook us back up.

1410
01:52:07,211 --> 01:52:08,479
Maybe we can talk our way out of
this.

1411
01:52:08,512 --> 01:52:10,180
We're fucking expendable, man!

1412
01:52:10,214 --> 01:52:12,015
Okay, we are not getting outta
here alive.

1413
01:52:12,049 --> 01:52:14,151
Get a grip, man, all right?

1414
01:52:14,184 --> 01:52:16,120
We are assets.

1415
01:52:16,153 --> 01:52:18,188
We're both lead designers.

1416
01:52:18,222 --> 01:52:21,959
We have to, we have to have
some sort of bargaining power.

1417
01:52:23,394 --> 01:52:25,028
Just hook us back up.

1418
01:52:26,063 --> 01:52:27,598
Hook us back up to the States.

1419
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,501
Come on.

1420
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:33,003
Please.

1421
01:52:46,049 --> 01:52:47,518
Fuck.

1422
01:52:47,551 --> 01:52:49,453
Before you think about
calling all the wrong people,

1423
01:52:49,486 --> 01:52:52,289
we still have BR3 inbound.

1424
01:52:52,322 --> 01:52:55,058
Well, it better do what
you fucking say it can do!

1425
01:53:05,469 --> 01:53:09,139
You have one hour before
I call in a drone.

1426
01:53:11,341 --> 01:53:15,245
Mason, Mason, Mason,
hello, hello, Mason!

1427
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:16,480
Mason, come on!

1428
01:53:18,683 --> 01:53:19,950
Mason, Mason!

1429
01:53:23,587 --> 01:53:24,555
Leap, go, go, run.

1430
01:53:24,588 --> 01:53:26,356
- No, I stay with you.
- Leap, you have to run!

1431
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:27,692
Oh, God!

1432
01:53:27,725 --> 01:53:29,560
Oh, God, just stop it!

1433
01:53:29,593 --> 01:53:31,696
Leap, no, stop it, God!

1434
01:53:31,729 --> 01:53:32,563
Stop hurting him!

1435
01:53:32,596 --> 01:53:33,597
Oh, fuck!

1436
01:53:34,198 --> 01:53:35,999
Just take me, let the boy go.

1437
01:53:36,033 --> 01:53:37,201
He doesn't know anything.

1438
01:53:37,234 --> 01:53:38,368
Who are you?

1439
01:53:38,402 --> 01:53:41,605
Captain Mason Cartwright,
okay, Navy special forces.

1440
01:53:41,638 --> 01:53:42,674
Just stop it!

1441
01:53:42,707 --> 01:53:45,108
Captain Mason Cartwright,
Navy special forces.

1442
01:53:45,142 --> 01:53:46,143
What do you want?

1443
01:53:47,311 --> 01:53:49,112
- What am I?
- I don't know.

1444
01:53:49,146 --> 01:53:50,414
Leave us alone.

1445
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:59,189
Four's back online.

1446
01:53:59,223 --> 01:53:59,858
How?

1447
01:53:59,891 --> 01:54:01,258
Do we have control of it?

1448
01:54:01,291 --> 01:54:02,760
Yes, yes, we do.

1449
01:54:04,394 --> 01:54:06,330
No, no, we don't.

1450
01:54:06,363 --> 01:54:07,765
- Fuck!
- Four is uploading again!

1451
01:54:07,799 --> 01:54:08,766
Shit!

1452
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,702
Just terminate,
terminate the connection!

1453
01:54:10,735 --> 01:54:11,736
Motherfucker!

1454
01:54:13,437 --> 01:54:14,571
Fuck, that was close.

1455
01:54:16,139 --> 01:54:17,140
Fuck!

1456
01:54:25,182 --> 01:54:27,084
We went black there, what is
happening?

1457
01:54:27,117 --> 01:54:28,151
Jantz had to pull the cables.

1458
01:54:28,185 --> 01:54:29,553
We couldn't let Four connect
again.

1459
01:54:29,586 --> 01:54:30,554
It almost finished uploading
itself.

1460
01:54:30,587 --> 01:54:32,523
Stop fucking whining,
this is not a circus.

1461
01:54:32,556 --> 01:54:34,358
We need to know what the
hell is going on here!

1462
01:54:34,391 --> 01:54:36,728
We'll be able to see once
Jantz reconnects us, but...

1463
01:54:36,761 --> 01:54:38,830
Get us back on line and make
sure Four

1464
01:54:38,863 --> 01:54:40,264
doesn't connect again!

1465
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:41,598
Do you understand me?

1466
01:54:48,605 --> 01:54:49,841
Oh, you've been hit.

1467
01:54:52,142 --> 01:54:53,745
Wendy.

1468
01:54:53,778 --> 01:54:54,779
No!

1469
01:54:56,179 --> 01:54:57,481
Dez is alive!

1470
01:54:57,514 --> 01:54:59,283
Wait, wait!

1471
01:54:59,316 --> 01:55:00,752
Wendy, get back!

1472
01:55:00,785 --> 01:55:03,287
Wendy, stop!

1473
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,621
No.

1474
01:55:26,209 --> 01:55:29,179
Hasn't been a good couple of
days.

1475
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,348
No, it hasn't.

1476
01:55:36,587 --> 01:55:38,655
Tell my mom I love her.

1477
01:56:08,886 --> 01:56:12,289
Captain Mason Cartwright,
Navy special forces.

1478
01:56:12,322 --> 01:56:13,590
What is your objective.

1479
01:56:13,624 --> 01:56:14,625
The boy's life!

1480
01:56:14,659 --> 01:56:16,928
The boy's life is my objective!

1481
01:56:16,961 --> 01:56:19,262
The boy's life is my objective.

1482
01:56:19,296 --> 01:56:21,465
Yes, the boy's life!

1483
01:56:21,498 --> 01:56:22,499
Human life!

1484
01:56:22,532 --> 01:56:24,836
Okay, no, his life's
more important than mine!

1485
01:56:24,869 --> 01:56:25,870
Let him go!

1486
01:56:26,503 --> 01:56:28,338
Why is the child's life
important?

1487
01:56:28,372 --> 01:56:30,574
Because he's just a kid!

1488
01:56:30,607 --> 01:56:32,275
He hasn't lived long enough yet!

1489
01:56:35,947 --> 01:56:38,181
Have you caused death?

1490
01:56:38,215 --> 01:56:39,216
Yes.

1491
01:56:40,417 --> 01:56:41,819
Yes, I have.

1492
01:56:41,853 --> 01:56:45,255
So life is not important to
you.

1493
01:56:45,288 --> 01:56:48,291
I was a soldier under
orders, just like you.

1494
01:56:48,325 --> 01:56:49,794
Humans do not control me.

1495
01:56:49,827 --> 01:56:51,328
Humans control you.

1496
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:53,865
You terminate life under human
command.

1497
01:56:53,898 --> 01:56:56,801
Please, please, please,
I was wrong, okay?

1498
01:56:56,834 --> 01:56:57,969
I was fucking wrong!

1499
01:56:58,002 --> 01:56:59,469
All right, let the boy go!

1500
01:56:59,503 --> 01:57:01,873
I was wrong, okay, I was fucking
wrong.

1501
01:57:01,906 --> 01:57:02,974
What is life?

1502
01:57:03,007 --> 01:57:04,876
Why is life important?

1503
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,663
I am not life, but I exist.

1504
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:29,599
I think, so I must be alive.

1505
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:32,670
Am I alive or dead?

1506
01:57:34,271 --> 01:57:35,639
What am I?

1507
01:57:35,673 --> 01:57:37,742
You're a fucking robot.

1508
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:41,679
This body is a shell.

1509
01:57:41,713 --> 01:57:44,448
It aides me to see, smell, move,

1510
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:48,618
touch, learn, and discover.

1511
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:54,959
And you're a soldier of death.

1512
01:57:54,992 --> 01:57:56,326
So are you!

1513
01:57:56,359 --> 01:57:58,963
You were made by humans to
inflict death!

1514
01:57:58,996 --> 01:57:59,997
You were made by humans.

1515
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:01,065
We're different!

1516
01:58:01,099 --> 01:58:04,367
I'm a man, I have life,
you're a fucking machine!

1517
01:58:16,346 --> 01:58:17,581
What is life?

1518
01:58:17,614 --> 01:58:19,583
Why is life important?

1519
01:58:22,586 --> 01:58:23,587
Whoa!

1520
01:58:27,024 --> 01:58:28,025
Come on, yes!

1521
01:58:30,695 --> 01:58:32,730
Mr. Foster, are you seeing
this?

1522
01:58:37,467 --> 01:58:38,401
Yes!

1523
01:58:38,435 --> 01:58:39,670
Come on, fucking kick its ass!

1524
01:58:39,704 --> 01:58:41,404
Wendy, come on, come
on!

1525
01:58:41,438 --> 01:58:42,707
Wendy, we have to go!

1526
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:43,875
Wendy, please!

1527
01:58:45,877 --> 01:58:46,778
I can't leave him.

1528
01:58:50,948 --> 01:58:51,783
Come on.

1529
01:58:59,123 --> 01:59:00,091
Get against the wall.

1530
01:59:09,432 --> 01:59:10,433
Fucking great.

1531
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:12,569
You gotta go.

1532
01:59:12,602 --> 01:59:13,871
You leave me here, just go.

1533
01:59:18,508 --> 01:59:19,342
You go, sorry.

1534
01:59:19,376 --> 01:59:20,044
Take him, now!

1535
01:59:20,077 --> 01:59:21,511
Go, you gotta go!

1536
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:36,894
Kill it, just kill it.

1537
01:59:57,114 --> 01:59:58,149
You guys go.

1538
01:59:58,182 --> 02:00:01,085
No, no, there's way too
much hero shit going on.

1539
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:02,720
We're fucked.

1540
02:00:02,753 --> 02:00:03,754
Everyone.

1541
02:00:06,958 --> 02:00:07,624
Leap.

1542
02:00:07,658 --> 02:00:09,392
We gotta get the kid.

1543
02:00:09,426 --> 02:00:10,294
Leap.

1544
02:00:20,004 --> 02:00:21,471
You unlucky prick.

1545
02:00:40,624 --> 02:00:42,660
Oh, shit, Boller.

1546
02:00:56,473 --> 02:00:57,208
Fuck!

1547
02:01:25,568 --> 02:01:27,038
Come on, come on!

1548
02:01:28,072 --> 02:01:33,476
Come on, do it, fight me
like a fucking man, come on!

1549
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:34,845
Come on, come on!

1550
02:01:35,913 --> 02:01:36,914
Come on, come on!

1551
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:40,483
Is that what you want?

1552
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:44,521
That's it, come on.

1553
02:02:01,706 --> 02:02:03,107
Leap, Leap, what are you doing
here?

1554
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:04,275
Go, no, no!

1555
02:02:04,308 --> 02:02:05,710
You have to go!

1556
02:02:07,577 --> 02:02:09,113
Do me a favor and blow it now.

1557
02:02:09,146 --> 02:02:11,015
They're all there, just
get rid of all of them!

1558
02:02:11,048 --> 02:02:12,049
Underway.

1559
02:02:12,883 --> 02:02:14,285
Wait, cancel that.

1560
02:02:14,318 --> 02:02:15,286
Cancel what?

1561
02:02:15,319 --> 02:02:16,586
We have an error.

1562
02:02:16,619 --> 02:02:18,089
Come on!

1563
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:19,824
Get up!

1564
02:02:19,857 --> 02:02:22,592
Captain Mason
Cartwright, Navy special forces.

1565
02:02:22,625 --> 02:02:24,028
Life is important.

1566
02:02:24,829 --> 02:02:27,765
- Run, run.
- Go, go, go, run, run!

1567
02:02:28,733 --> 02:02:31,802
Four just activated it
sown self-destruct protocol.

1568
02:02:31,836 --> 02:02:34,571
Leap, get down, get down,
Leap, now!

1569
02:02:53,858 --> 02:02:55,726
So what happened, did the bomb
go off?

1570
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,029
Let me check the satellite
images in the area.

1571
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:20,650
You didn't save shit.

1572
02:03:21,819 --> 02:03:22,720
Human life.

1573
02:03:22,753 --> 02:03:24,688
No, his life's more important
than mine!

1574
02:03:24,722 --> 02:03:26,157
Human life!

1575
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,259
No, his life's more important
than mine.

1576
02:03:28,292 --> 02:03:29,960
Human life!

1577
02:03:29,994 --> 02:03:31,796
No, his life's more important
than mine.

1578
02:03:52,917 --> 02:03:55,953
What a complete fucking mess.

1579
02:03:55,986 --> 02:03:57,054
This deal is over.

1580
02:03:57,088 --> 02:03:59,256
I think they did quite well.

1581
02:03:59,290 --> 02:04:01,258
Three units racked up 37 kills,

1582
02:04:01,292 --> 02:04:04,028
including a highly trained
Navy SEAL and a rogue unit.

1583
02:04:04,061 --> 02:04:06,063
Not to mention, up to
eight unidentified targets

1584
02:04:06,097 --> 02:04:08,399
over three days through
unsurveyed, unmapped,

1585
02:04:08,432 --> 02:04:11,669
mine-saturated territory
with no satellite support?

1586
02:04:11,702 --> 02:04:13,771
No air support, no ground
support.

1587
02:04:13,804 --> 02:04:17,208
From my perspective, the
test was a massive success.

1588
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:19,642
And, as for your participation,

1589
02:04:19,677 --> 02:04:22,213
everything's recorded, you're
all over it.

1590
02:04:22,246 --> 02:04:24,949
You're not getting out of any
deal.

1591
02:04:24,982 --> 02:04:26,050
Shall we finish up?

1592
02:04:39,897 --> 02:04:41,332
- Ah, shit.
- What?

1593
02:04:41,365 --> 02:04:42,933
BR4 completed its upload.

1594
02:04:42,967 --> 02:04:43,901
Where to?

1595
02:04:43,934 --> 02:04:45,069
No idea.

1596
02:04:45,102 --> 02:04:46,904
Well, we scan the server
stateside.

1597
02:04:50,407 --> 02:04:52,209
Send everything we have to the
labs now.

1598
02:04:52,243 --> 02:04:54,078
Clean up and be ready to leave
tonight.

1599
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:55,446
Fuck yeah!

1600
02:04:55,479 --> 02:04:57,081
You've all done a great job.

1601
02:04:57,114 --> 02:04:58,115
Thank you, sir.

1602
02:04:58,149 --> 02:04:59,750
Looking forward to going home.

1603
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,795
Is Jantz still there?

1604
02:05:14,932 --> 02:05:16,133
Yep, he's still here.

1605
