2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,495
All right.

3
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,789
You know, Tae-gu,

4
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,333
I had a feeling Yang would send you.

5
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:48,214
Just know, I'm only sparing their lives
so that you can save face.

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,258
If it wasn't for you,

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,428
I would have had them buried
in cement by now.

8
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,763
Understand?

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,641
All right, that'd be hilarious.

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,559
Welcome, Sir.

11
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,537
- Hello, sir.
- Welcome.

12
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,606
- Where are Yang's boys at?
- Over here, sir.

13
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>So, what now?</i>

14
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,874
Is that a message you want me
to relay to the boss?

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,961
Whatever.

16
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,296
Tell him what you like.

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,494
<i>Should we discuss...</i>

18
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,414
...since it's obvious you stabbed
my boys in the back,

19
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,416
maybe you'd like to let us know why.

20
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,878
Why would you pull something like this
all of a sudden?

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,715
Why bother asking
when you already know the answer?

22
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,051
You've been in this business long enough.

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,095
Listen, Tae-gu,

24
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,722
have you ever heard the story,

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,100
<i>The Chariot and the Mantis</i>?

26
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,977
<i>The Chariot and the Mantis.</i>

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,396
Come on,
why are you bringing up old proverbs?

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,856
It's not really your style.

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,318
In this story, there's a great wheel...

30
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,945
...rolling along.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,406
A tiny mantis stood in the way...

32
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,783
...determined to stop it.

33
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,121
Shoot, man.

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,374
The mantis had balls, sure enough.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,669
However, we know how the story ends.

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,965
You can learn from this tale, huh?

37
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,177
What do you think you're going to achieve?

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,179
Do you think standing against
the Bukseong gang

39
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,972
is gonna end well for you?

40
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,475
I get that Yang wants to expand
his operation, but I don't understand

41
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,770
what you have to gain
from getting involved in all this mess.

42
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,272
From what I heard,

43
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,816
Bukseong Chairman Doh
attempted to recruit you,

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
but for some reason you refused.

45
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,613
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,531
Are you tired of breathing?

47
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,704
You better watch yourself.

48
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,081
Chairman Doh only spared you
because he thinks

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,334
he can get you and your crew on his side.

50
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,211
If it were me, you'd be a dead man.

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,923
Think about it.
Without you, your boss, Yang...

52
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,217
...he's no more than a cripple.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,344
I'll relay that message to him as well.

54
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,931
Sure, say whatever you like, huh?

55
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,140
I'll go then.

56
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>We have a winner on 19.
They'll be moving onto the third stage.</i>

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,627
<i>Please be advised...</i>

58
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,338
It's raining.

59
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,051
What took you so long?

60
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,344
Have a look at the time.

61
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,055
Yeah, what took so long? We were waiting.

62
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,807
Shouldn't you be able to read a clock?

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,352
Ah, Ji-eun, I'm sorry.
Uncle got tied up with some business.

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,145
- Look at you, mm...
- You too.

65
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,314
Are you hungry now, sister?

66
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,067
There's a place nearby that serves
my favorite raw fish soup.

67
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,654
I'm not sick enough for you?
I can't even stand the smell.

68
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,491
Come on, they have abalone porridge
as well. It'll nurse you back to health.

69
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,411
Is that right?
You look like you could use some yourself.

70
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,955
Huh? Why do you look so tired?

71
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,832
I'm not tired at all.

72
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,542
You don't even work hard.

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,546
Don't gangsters just lounge around?
Why are you the only haggard criminal?

74
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,342
- Ji-eun, your mom could read my resume...
- Okay, just ignore me.

75
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,262
- ...over the loudspeaker.
- Don't act embarrassed. You have no shame.

76
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,181
And don't give me that business
about you quitting again.

77
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,599
Though you should.

78
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,644
Once I'm gone, you'll be
the only family Ji-eun has.

79
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,147
Who'll look after her if you get stabbed?

80
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,940
Hey, she can hear everything
you're saying.

81
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,569
Don't you think she knows these things?
Kids know everything.

82
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,652
Jeez.

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,908
You don't need to know
everything, Ji-eun. Right?

84
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,992
Jae-kyung.

85
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,912
Go ahead.

86
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,832
I'll get your medications
and drop them off later.

87
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,293
Ji-eun, I'm gonna come visit you later,

88
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,338
so now, you're gonna ride home
with your mom, all right?

89
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,841
Okay, Uncle, but promise
you're gonna be able to make it.

90
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,887
Try not to get stabbed
because I think that would be really bad.

91
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,602
All right, Ji-eun,

92
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
I'll be there. I promise.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,855
- Yeah. All right.
- See you later.

94
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,690
And guess what day it is coming up soon.

95
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,816
My birthday!

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,111
I have a secret. I bought you
a gift and you should open it early.

97
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,238
For me?

98
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,200
- Right there!
- Oh Ji-eun, you're so lucky.

99
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,745
- What could it be? Something expensive?
- Open it. Go ahead.

100
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,182
- Thank your uncle first.
- Ji-eun, do you like it?

101
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,459
- Will you move so I can get in? A bit.
- Hold on, just a sec.

102
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,294
And what is it? Ta-da!

103
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,005
Move. Jeez. When did you get so strong?

104
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,925
I'm making some dishes for you.
Better come pick them up.

105
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,885
Uncle got me an iPad!

106
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,346
Do you like it? Now you can watch
all your favorites shows.

107
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
- That's enough, she likes it.
- Do you love it?

108
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,518
Just go. What's got into you?
You're being so sappy lately.

109
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,520
Hey, drive careful in the rain.

110
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,289
Ji-eun...

111
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
- Ji-eun!
- ...look at this clown.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,400
I hope you like it.

113
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,861
Ji-eun! I'll see you later.

114
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,496
Bye!

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,498
Oh, Ji-eun!

116
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,344
I'll get a car, sir.

117
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,265
Actually, you can head back on your own.
I still have business here.

118
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,975
I should escort you, sir.

119
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,686
It's fine, you can go, my friend.

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,105
I just need to pick up
Jae-kyung's medications.

121
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,530
Okay, go on.

122
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,866
Okay, I'll see you later then, sir.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:38,332
We ran every test
and I have the results. I'm sorry, but...

124
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,669
you are not a compatible donor
for your sister.

125
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,132
You two are not a close enough match.

126
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,303
Though this is rare
between a brother and a sister.

127
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,681
Uh, well, uh, my sister and I...

128
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,600
have different fathers.

129
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,187
Oh, I see.

130
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,858
So, doc...

131
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,778
how much time

132
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,573
does my sister have left?

133
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,781
Oh, hey, sis.

134
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,206
It's fine. Forget about the fish soup.

135
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,999
Just a suggestion.

136
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,545
I'm just fine.
There's nothing for you to worry about.

137
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,383
Hello? Sister?

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
Jae-kyung?

139
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,308
Still there?

140
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,521
Jae-kyung?

141
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,566
Jae-kyung, are you there?

142
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,719
Uh, the boss is here, sir.

143
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,930
Did you get any sleep?

144
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,225
Have you had anything to eat?

145
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,768
Yeah.

146
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,938
Today would've been...

147
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,733
Ji-eun's birthday, right?

148
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,322
How could that bastard,
Chairman Doh have done this?

149
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,283
He must be going senile in his old age.

150
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,121
No matter how things are
between us and them,

151
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,207
this is a line you don't cross.

152
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,754
And after he fawned all over you
to get you to join his side...

153
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,518
What can we do about this situation?

154
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,229
They'll all continue to overstep

155
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,398
because they know
they have us by the throat.

156
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm ashamed to say...

157
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,612
but there's nothing I can do.

158
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,631
Then I'll meet with Chairman Doh.

159
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,639
What would you do?

160
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,768
I would do whatever you ask of me, sir.

161
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,647
Isn't this what
you've been wanting anyway?

162
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,109
It's inevitable.

163
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,095
I'm grieved by the loss
of your sister and niece.

164
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,308
Of course, I was shocked to hear the news.

165
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,770
It's not enough to say
that we're in a rough profession.

166
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,525
Only a real lowlife
would think of going after family.

167
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,862
Some asshole has no idea
the mistake he made.

168
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,953
I'll find out who did this.
You have my word.

169
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,872
And serve them up to you.

170
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,957
You hear me?

171
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,257
What's done has been done.

172
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,094
Doing that won't change anything.

173
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,309
Hearing you didn't give the order,
I'll see it as an accident.

174
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,769
Good.

175
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,105
That's it.

176
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,067
You know, I admire your attitude.

177
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,279
It may sound cool but life goes on.

178
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,073
So what is it that you want?

179
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,158
What can I do?

180
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,037
I'm assuming you must have
something in mind,

181
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,790
or you wouldn't have asked
for this meeting.

182
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,171
Let me splash some cold water
on myself first.

183
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,716
Sure, yeah.

184
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
Hey.

185
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,444
There's no reason for you
to be on edge, huh?

186
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,697
What's going to happen
when we're just sitting here naked?

187
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,449
Must you embarrass me?

188
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,575
I apologize.

189
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,243
Try to relax.

190
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
Flip the hourglass.

191
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,261
Come here.

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,565
What the hell? You...

193
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,779
Tae-gu, wait. Just hold on.

194
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,782
Hold on, Tae-gu.

195
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,341
Here.

196
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,599
Very good work.

197
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,519
Any injuries?

198
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm fine, sir.

199
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,829
You discarded your phone, right?

200
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,456
You can use this one for now.

201
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,001
I got you new identification
and some cash.

202
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,294
First step...

203
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,634
Jeju Island.

204
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,427
You hide out there a week.

205
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,805
From there, we'll put you on a boat

206
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,515
to Vladivostok, Russia.

207
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,560
Safer in Russia than China.

208
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,147
You know how close the Bukseong Gang is
with the Chinese.

209
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,690
I don't care where you send me.

210
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,151
Tae-gu.

211
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,402
Yes, sir?

212
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,530
Just know that you saved us all.

213
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,953
Let's go.

214
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
The boat comes in a week.

215
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,337
Enjoy the scenery and the fresh air.

216
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,965
You should just think of it
as a short holiday.

217
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,259
Yeah.

218
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,932
All right.

219
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,202
Is Kuto ready for him in Jeju?

220
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,786
Yes, sir. All taken care of.

221
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,996
And our guys?

222
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,206
Check on them.

223
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,410
<i>Is this Mr. Park Tae-gu?</i>

224
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,831
Yeah, who is this?

225
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,914
<i>Over here.</i>

226
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,584
I think I'm the person picking you up.

227
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,378
Bingo.

228
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,800
My uncle got busy and couldn't come
so here I am.

229
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,677
Come this way.

230
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,767
Seriously?

231
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,352
Not coming?

232
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,936
Yeah, coming.

233
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,299
God damn.

234
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,019
It's windy out today.

235
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,622
Real version Tokarev,
not the Chinese knockoffs.

236
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,210
Here you go. I'll throw in a box of ammo.
I have more for sale.

237
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,087
Wow! Great fucking deal.

238
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,422
I'm certainly not gonna argue the price,

239
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,508
but are you concerned
about selling so low?

240
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,469
Make the Bukseong gang
or the Russians get upset with you.

241
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
You buying or not?

242
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,972
Sure I am.

243
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,308
The Japanese will pay me double for 'em.

244
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,227
Kuto.

245
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,980
I hope you can appreciate how hard it was
to pay you on American cash.

246
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,650
During this recession,
it's nearly impossible.

247
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,194
Here you go. Take 'em apart and wrap 'em.

248
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,197
Hey, do you have a better way
to send them than, uh...

249
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,157
- in the fish?
- How?

250
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,452
You want me to put them in the mail,
sent to your house?

251
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,288
Yeah, all right,
and I'm just saying these things smell.

252
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,541
Cut the shit and pack 'em.

253
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,334
Fishing boats are the safest.

254
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,087
Give me a cigarette.

255
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,882
Kuto,

256
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,635
why are you selling
so aggressively lately, huh?

257
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,390
You usually work through the Russians,
now you put together your own deals.

258
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,057
So...

259
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,103
you planning your retirement or what?

260
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,899
If you're done with your shopping,

261
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,234
it's closing time.

262
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,495
Do less examining and more eating.

263
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,205
Yes, sir.

264
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,001
I'm just curious.
I heard about you moving here.

265
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,420
They told me you started a farm.

266
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,256
How long will you stay?

267
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,677
About a week is what I was told.

268
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,305
But I'm not sure.

269
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,266
Where are you headed?

270
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,350
Vladivostok.

271
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,311
You mean, Russia?

272
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,063
What an honor.

273
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,857
You must be a national hero.

274
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,698
You done with this plate?

275
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,908
Actually...

276
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,038
So, a week it is then,
unless you'd like to leave earlier.

277
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,460
We really don't wanna get mixed up
with you people, over just a few bucks.

278
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,281
<i>The person you are calling
cannot be reached at this moment.</i>

279
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,921
How did it go?

280
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,633
Director Ma...

281
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,760
He escaped, sir.

282
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,932
You pieces of shit!

283
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,311
Don't you know none of this works
if Director Ma's alive?

284
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,937
How?

285
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,522
Sorry, sir.

286
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,119
Sorry, that's not all.

287
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,455
Bukseong's Chairman Doh...

288
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,377
I'm told he's still alive.

289
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,671
He's in surgery right now.

290
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,235
Director Ma, sir.

291
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,462
It's Do-soo.

292
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,882
Hey Yang, how are you?

293
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:42,137
I bet you're thinking,
"Man, I really fucked up this time," hm?

294
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,350
Though I have to admit
I was pretty surprised, you know.

295
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,894
That a useless prick like you would...

296
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,234
Listen to me, Yang.

297
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,320
You little weasel.

298
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,615
I don't know what you were thinking.

299
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,952
Maybe, your balls just dropped.
It doesn't really matter.

300
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,538
You know what happens now.

301
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,832
I'm gonna cut you open,

302
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,711
and watch your guts spill out
just to see what's inside.

303
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,672
Hm?

304
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,632
Just wait.

305
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,384
It won't be long.

306
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,432
Take me to those bastards right now.

307
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,384
Give it to me.

308
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,520
You know, it doesn't seem right
that you have to pay the price.

309
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,690
That Yang's men have to pay
for his mistakes.

310
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,528
Bite down hard.

311
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,780
This is gonna hurt.

312
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,292
Huh?

313
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,462
Hey, hold on!

314
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,422
Hey!

315
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,505
Hey, hey!

316
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,258
Hey, stop it!

317
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,510
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

318
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,846
Just wait.

319
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,723
Hey! Hey!

320
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,100
Why are you doing that?

321
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,353
Please don't.

322
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,772
Put the gun down. Hey!

323
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,065
Stop it!

324
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,317
All right. All right. All right.

325
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,029
Calm down. Just stay calm, all right?

326
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,031
Hold it. Don't do it.

327
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:30,990
Just...

328
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,241
Hold on.

329
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,534
Hey!

330
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,120
That's right. All right. Hey!
Stop it, don't do it.

331
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,664
Don't do it! Stop it!

332
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,220
Psycho woman.

333
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,226
Oh, shit. I just ate lunch, dammit.

334
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,936
Get it out.

335
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,148
Shit.

336
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,948
- Mr. Yang...
- Yes?

337
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,577
Help me.
What are you playing at here, huh?

338
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,914
Are you children playing pretend?

339
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,541
Sorry, sir.

340
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,296
I'm sorry, Captain.
Sir, please, sorry, just...

341
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,631
Help me get out of this.

342
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,217
You must think I'm some kind
of miracle worker.

343
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,430
I mean, why did you have
to create this mess in the first place?

344
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,687
This isn't 1980s for fuck's sake.

345
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,858
A coup like that in these days
and in broad daylight.

346
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,619
Hey, Director Ma, it's me.

347
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,454
It's been a while.

348
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,248
About time we met for some face to face.

349
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,086
Let's sit down for lunch.
Pick some place nice.

350
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,463
Always.

351
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,882
And you'll still argue who pays the tab.

352
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,690
What the hell?

353
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,571
Hey! Hey, lady!

354
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,323
What's wrong?

355
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,701
Huh?

356
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,371
Damn!

357
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,539
Move!

358
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,768
- What are you doing?
- I need you to drive.

359
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,878
- What?
- Get behind the wheel and drive!

360
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,422
All right.

361
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,387
To the hospital!

362
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,765
Jae-yeon! Jae-yeon!

363
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,939
Do you expect me to share that with you?

364
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,818
I haven't drunk from it, sir.

365
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,710
Has Yang contacted you yet?

366
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,379
When is he coming for you?

367
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,549
He is sending a boat early next week.

368
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,137
That's good.

369
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,515
I need the rest of the money he promised.

370
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,611
We gotta leave here soon ourselves.

371
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,576
Where are you going?

372
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
United States.

373
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,039
Jae-yeon will have an operation there.

374
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,045
She only has a ten percent chance
of living here.

375
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,049
Goes up to 20 percent over there.

376
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,890
In her current condition...

377
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,102
she will be lucky to last a month.

378
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,630
Did you have a shower this morning?

379
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,218
No, I didn't, sir.

380
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,847
Why?

381
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,476
Do I look that bad?

382
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,647
This filthy bastard.

383
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,788
Come on, Captain Park,
let's have it,

384
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,666
or did you come all the way for this, huh?

385
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,460
Cheap old noodles. We can do better, huh?

386
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,045
I told you I'd pay the tab.

387
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,881
Why not let me treat you
to something better?

388
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,008
Well, a government employee
can't be seen accepting

389
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,511
something that could be
construed as a bribe.

390
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,194
Can you pass the vinegar?

391
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,221
Sure.

392
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,442
Why aren't you eating?

393
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,110
Ah, leave him be, huh.

394
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,822
It's really better this way.
Less mess when I cut him open.

395
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,490
How considerate.

396
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,534
Less shit for my boys to clean up.

397
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,579
Must you speak so ghastly.

398
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,164
All right then,

399
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,207
since he has lost his appetite,

400
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,751
we'll talk sharp instead, okay.

401
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,921
So I heard, Chairman Doh survived.

402
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,881
What if he did?

403
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,175
He's been left a cripple. Shit.

404
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,470
Fortunately, he was religious, huh.

405
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,307
Donated a lot of money to church,
attended all their services.

406
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,809
I guess the heavens spared him.

407
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,312
Fucking Hallelujah, right?

408
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,315
The heavens, my ass.
The doctor that saved him.

409
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,610
So considering,

410
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,821
Chairman Doh survived the ambush,

411
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,408
and as I hear, a couple of Mr. Yang's men
already paid...

412
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,577
...the ultimate price.

413
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,580
Don't you think Bukseong's
had enough retribution?

414
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,290
We should consider...

415
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,667
...calling it even.

416
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,962
Ahh, let's see.

417
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,423
No, absolutely not, huh.

418
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,468
Your math simply doesn't square.

419
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,306
It's not that easy. This isn't a score
that can be settled so cheaply.

420
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,892
Let's be honest.

421
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,647
You people were the ones
who started all this.

422
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,482
Oh? You sure?

423
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,902
Sorry, for a second there,
I almost thought it mattered

424
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,695
what the fuck you had to say.

425
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,656
- You shit.
- Ah, Director Ma.

426
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,282
What's with you?

427
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,284
Allow me to do my job.

428
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,328
Let's resolve this peacefully.

429
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,122
If you keep killing each other,
I'm gonna lose my job.

430
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,293
I even got an earful about it
before coming here today.

431
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,339
They say I'm too lenient
on worthless thugs.

432
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,676
My fucking evaluations are coming up.

433
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,554
So I say...

434
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,932
enough is enough, all right?

435
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,731
Look, Captain Park.

436
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,196
Respectfully, this isn't even something
you can really intervene in, huh.

437
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,700
They attempted
to assassinate my boss.

438
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,076
The chairman of the great Bukseong gang

439
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,663
was shanked by some lowlife punk
that he himself ordered.

440
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,710
And so, how could we possible just let
something like this slide, huh?

441
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,505
This is such a fucking
goddamn embarrassment.

442
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,300
I can't even hold my head up
when I walk down the street.

443
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,426
Fuck.

444
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,721
Goddammit.

445
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,436
You stupid fucking piece of shit.

446
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,397
Yeah, Ma Sang-gil.

447
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,857
Come on.

448
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,599
What do you think
you're gonna do about it?

449
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,340
- Captain Park...
- Shut your mouth, you worthless cunt.

450
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,074
I'm speaking here!

451
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah.

452
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,292
You think...

453
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,420
because we're sitting here,
eating noodles together,

454
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,714
that we're buddies or something, huh?

455
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,216
You think I'm a joke, huh?

456
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
Yeah?

457
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,763
Let me remind you that there are lines
that cannot be crossed.

458
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,891
I told you my evaluations are coming up.

459
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,229
And if I miss this promotion,
will you take the blame, huh?

460
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,315
You think that just because
I'm being nice to you,

461
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,525
that I'm gonna let you walk
all over me, huh?

462
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,694
It's as if you're challenging me.

463
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,321
Huh? That it?

464
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,989
Maybe, I should do my job, eh,

465
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,491
and put your asses in jail!

466
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,493
Of course not, sir, I apologize.

467
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,620
What about you, Sang-gil?

468
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,643
Are you finished, Captain Park, huh?

469
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,811
You fuckers.

470
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,479
You have anything more to add?

471
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,650
I don't know.

472
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,362
I just hate seeing you
get all worked up like this, huh.

473
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,823
And aren't you always the one...

474
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,410
constantly preaching to us
about mutual respect?

475
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,454
Shit. You need to be smart about this.

476
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,167
You know that Yang has people
higher up than me on his payroll.

477
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,631
If you were to cause him physical harm,

478
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,842
it would be trouble for both of us.

479
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,136
So that's off the table.

480
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,389
Director Ma, I'll beg you if you'd ask.

481
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,516
It's not like we're strangers here.

482
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,019
I know we can find a way
to get along, huh?

483
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,536
All right, huh?

484
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,705
What's the deal then?

485
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,299
You're awake.

486
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,026
What are you doing here?

487
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,070
Kuto had to meet
some customers at the farm.

488
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,906
Hey, what are you doing?

489
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,741
Hang on. Wait, I wouldn't...

490
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,867
Oh, jeez.

491
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,626
You can look, kid. I won't charge you.

492
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,344
As if someone would pay for that.

493
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,025
You have something to ask me?

494
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,694
What?

495
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,907
No, not really. Nope.

496
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,286
Why do you look at me like that?

497
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,872
Do I look different to you now?

498
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,592
Now that you know I'm a dead girl?

499
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,639
What?

500
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,352
Wanna grab lunch?

501
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,650
Aren't you hungry?

502
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,154
Well, are you?

503
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,824
No, not really hungry.

504
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,001
I hope you're not afraid of raw fish.

505
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,834
This place makes the best <i>mulhoe</i> soup.

506
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,130
Folks from the mainland don't know
about this place yet. It's nice and quiet.

507
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,049
I've made peace with dying.

508
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,803
But I'll definitely miss the <i>mulhoe</i>
from this place.

509
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,910
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Mm-hm.

510
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,562
- Please enjoy.
- Yeah.

511
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,106
This is the best.

512
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,413
I guess this isn't your kind of food?

513
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,875
Too spicy for you?

514
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,837
Or is it the smell?

515
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,964
No worries, kid.

516
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,301
That's your prerogative.

517
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,813
I'll make this better.

518
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,191
Excuse me, one bottle of Hallasan.

519
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,198
Hm?

520
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,788
God, everything is a struggle with you.

521
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,498
Unbelievable.

522
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,307
You're good with a pistol.

523
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,396
That was nothing.

524
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,234
It was easy.

525
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,070
All I do is imagine
the one I want to kill.

526
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,990
Also...

527
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,368
I feel safer carrying it.

528
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,623
Sure you don't want to drink it?

529
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,002
It's a crime to visit Jeju
and not try this.

530
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,504
Come on, just a sip.

531
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,723
It's good, right?

532
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,433
Isn't it?

533
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,728
Cheers then. Drink up.

534
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,355
No, thanks. I shouldn't,
I'm the one who has to drive us back.

535
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,857
Ah, nonsense.

536
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,317
You can handle one shot, kid.

537
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,485
Hm?

538
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,365
Besides, the cops don't check
for DUIs here.

539
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,036
I've lived here my whole life
and I've never once seen a DUI checkpoint.

540
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,413
That's not a thing here.

541
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,623
So no worries. Drink up.

542
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,841
Dispatch, Kim Hyeong-jin.

543
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,803
Kim Hyeong-jin. November 11th, 1987.

544
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,781
- Listed as local resident...
- Let's do this again.

545
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,475
You're going to blow
like you're inflating a balloon.

546
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,684
It's 5626.

547
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,935
Blow.

548
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,564
Blow, blow, blow...

549
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,732
You're good.

550
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,075
And him?

551
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,534
Yeah, he's fine, sir.

552
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,286
That's good. Just a sip like he says.

553
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,371
Thanks for your cooperation.

554
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,166
All right, drive safe.

555
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,833
Yeah.

556
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,046
Hang on, please stop, sir.

557
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,983
Oh... oh, off the road.
Please try to stand up.

558
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,801
Will you... your girlfriend.

559
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,844
She had way too much to drink.

560
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,638
Get her under control.

561
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,972
- Stop this.
- Please help!

562
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,516
I promise to be good.

563
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,852
Wow, look at her.
She must've drank her own body weight.

564
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,816
Help her back on to her feet.

565
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,111
Hey, hey, hey.

566
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,322
Oh, oh, oh, no, no!

567
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,990
No, no, no...

568
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,142
<i>I'll be there to meet you tomorrow.</i>

569
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,810
<i>So be ready to leave.</i>

570
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,562
<i>I don't need to remind you,</i>

571
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,647
<i>no trace of you
should be left behind, all right?</i>

572
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,815
I understand.

573
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,821
You know, sir. I haven't been able
to get a hold of Jin-sung or my guys.

574
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,198
<i>Yeah, that.</i>

575
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,616
<i>Uh, shit.</i>

576
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,911
<i>You probably guessed by now,
but the operation failed.</i>

577
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,164
<i>The Bukseong gang demolished us.</i>

578
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,791
<i>Jin-sung and the boys
are already in hiding,</i>

579
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,794
<i>and I'm making plans
to go to Vladivostok with you.</i>

580
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,213
<i>I'll fill you in on everything tomorrow.</i>

581
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,965
<i>Get ready to meet me.</i>

582
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,758
Yeah, all right, sir.

583
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,699
Imagine this as Park Tae-gu.

584
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:26,161
Park Tae-gu is the one
who butchered Chairman Doh.

585
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,581
As an apology, you hand over Park Tae-gu.

586
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,003
Just like this.

587
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,006
Over to Bukseong...

588
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,676
and Bukseong deals with Park Tae-gu
how they like.

589
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:46,890
And we will all agree with Park Tae-gu
who is acting entirely on his own,

590
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,850
who did this.

591
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,685
We end it there.

592
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,896
Are we good?

593
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,360
Okay, now...

594
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,571
Once that filthy assassin
who had the unmitigated gall

595
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,865
to flash a knife
in front of your Chairman Doh

596
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,243
is dealt with by Director Ma...

597
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,916
Tae-gu is handed back

598
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,543
and the cleanup will be done
by Yang and his men.

599
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,797
Good? And I expect him
to disappear without a trace.

600
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,758
If anything of him is ever found,

601
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,261
Mr. Yang will assume all of the blame.

602
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,803
Okay?

603
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,724
Understood.

604
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,727
All right, Director Ma,
are you happy with the terms?

605
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,147
Well, I don't find it fully satisfying...

606
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,359
but I'll agree to it.

607
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,059
All right then...

608
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,239
There better not be any loose ends.

609
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,075
Understand what I mean?

610
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,661
We're in agreement?

611
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,957
- Yes.
- Okay.

612
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,931
I'm wondering about...

613
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,019
what you did that was so bad
that they sent you here.

614
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,319
Right? You must've done
something pretty bad in Seoul.

615
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
Didn't you?

616
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,323
Hey, cut it out.

617
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,617
Vladivostok, Russia.

618
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,829
To be sent there,
you must've fucked up pretty bad.

619
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,957
Do you wanna spill the beans?

620
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,667
Come on, stop.

621
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,629
Ah...

622
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,966
So I'm not the only one to receive
a death sentence.

623
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,343
You're dead too.

624
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,558
I said stop.

625
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,103
I asked you to cut it out.
Is that something you can respect?

626
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,523
I knew it.

627
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,524
Death sentence.

628
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,944
It all adds up.

629
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,323
You fucked things up,
and you ran off to save your ass.

630
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,075
Okay, say that again.

631
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,292
Come on, hit me.

632
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,544
It's all right with me.

633
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,174
I can take it, kid.

634
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,301
Take your best shot.

635
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,470
I don't understand
why you're doing this to me.

636
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,971
What did I do to you?

637
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,935
Whatever. Go ahead and drive, kid.

638
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,230
Uncle will be waiting.

639
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,584
I don't know why you keep calling me kid.

640
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,254
I'm older than you.

641
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,588
Show some respect.

642
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,632
You're the one who started it.

643
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,761
So, how old are you?

644
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,472
Oh, so now you're an old geezer.

645
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,058
What's with people demanding respect
because they're older?

646
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,854
All you've done is have
a few more meals to me.

647
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,231
Anyway, you may have been born before me,

648
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,066
but I'm likely to die before you.

649
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,735
That should even things out.

650
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,737
If you don't like it, die first.

651
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,388
You don't need to bother counting.

652
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,264
It's all there.

653
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,684
If you're done shopping, head out.

654
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,187
I have someplace to be.

655
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,230
I'm curious, though.

656
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,441
Is this all the merchandise you have?

657
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,318
I already told you that it was.

658
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,403
But, is that the truth?

659
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,907
Watch how you speak.

660
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,201
Hey, don't be so serious,

661
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,494
you're frightening me.

662
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,165
Anyway, whether you have more or not,

663
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,209
I'll just find out in my search.

664
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,175
Where you goin', old man?
Get back over here.

665
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,601
I'm impressed.
Kuto still has some fight left.

666
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,770
They weren't kidding
when they warned me about you.

667
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,938
Said you were big time.

668
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,315
What are you doing? Who sent you?

669
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,192
Don't you remember what I told you?

670
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,861
Dumping weapons like this
doesn't sit well with some.

671
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,029
They made me a deal.

672
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,032
Bukseong said, if I get rid of you,
I could deal with the Russians.

673
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,410
Go on and finish him off.
We don't have all day.

674
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,779
Get out of here.

675
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,615
All right, Kuto. Don't shoot.
All right, yeah.

676
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,992
We... we can talk.

677
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,249
Look out!

678
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,713
You fucker!

679
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,263
Throw the money over.

680
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,784
Hey.

681
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:22,869
So long, old man.

682
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,397
Boss, are you all right?

683
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,776
Come on, get the money
and guns. Hurry! Hurry up!

684
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,527
- Uncle!
- Hey, wait!

685
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,614
Hey!

686
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,826
You look fine, boss. It's just a scratch.

687
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,496
How would you like to have a matching one?

688
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,415
Uncle!

689
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,125
Huh?

690
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,712
Uncle!

691
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,464
Uncle!

692
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,092
Uncle, no!

693
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,844
Uncle, open your eyes.

694
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:27,058
What the hell happened here?

695
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,270
Go kill her.

696
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,733
No...

697
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,238
Shit! What the fuck?

698
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,948
Hey.

699
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:42,865
I'll kill him.

700
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,701
- Boss?
- Hey, fucking back up.

701
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,911
He's got a knife. Put that shit away.

702
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:49,539
Got it.

703
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,876
No!

704
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,296
Jae-yeon...

705
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,092
I'm so sorry.

706
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,971
I'm sorry for everything.

707
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,265
Hey, don't speak, Uncle.

708
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,435
Just stay still. Hang on.
Save your strength.

709
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,894
I'm grateful...

710
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,441
...that you didn't hate me for it.

711
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,359
Thank you...

712
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,405
Oh, Uncle!

713
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,593
Come on, Uncle.

714
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,180
Uncle, don't you dare.

715
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,515
Uncle!

716
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,058
Uncle!

717
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,228
Uncle, no!

718
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,493
I see. You're Park Tae-gu.

719
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,790
Get the son of a bitch!

720
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,285
It's over.

721
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:12,181
Let's go. Now.
They'll be back with others soon.

722
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:13,975
Come on!

723
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,562
Hey, snap out of it. We need to go.

724
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,820
Come on, we need to get out of here, now!

725
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,533
What about Uncle?

726
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,080
Your uncle...

727
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,083
I'm sorry. He's dead.

728
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,713
Don't you say that to me!

729
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:45,756
You take it back.

730
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,884
You say he's not dead!

731
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,552
You say he's not dead!

732
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,137
You say that, you bastard!

733
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,682
- Snap out of it, damn it!
- How can you say that about him?

734
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,268
You bastard!

735
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,854
Let go of me. Let go of me!

736
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,981
Stop! Stop!

737
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,446
Stop the car!

738
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,615
Stop it!

739
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,367
Stop the car, please!

740
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,620
- Will you just sit still?
- Please! No!

741
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,747
- Stop the car!
- Please!

742
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,460
Hey!

743
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:24,921
Hey!

744
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:25,838
Hey!

745
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,090
Not now, damn it.

746
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,638
Hey, hey! Stay with me.

747
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,933
Hey, this it?

748
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,138
DRINKING FOUNTAIN

749
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,941
Do I turn left of here?

750
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,152
Yeah.

751
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,049
She's here!

752
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,301
Jae-yeon, it's been so long!

753
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,802
How are you? You doing good?

754
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,679
Good. How about you guys?

755
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,889
- Good.
- Are you sick?

756
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,682
You don't look like you're feeling well.

757
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,642
Oh, will you be all right?

758
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,687
Um, yeah. I'm just tired is all.

759
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,540
- Let's get you inside.
- Right.

760
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,317
I prepared our best room for you
as soon as I got your call.

761
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,444
Hey, by the way,

762
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,362
where is your uncle looking to move?

763
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,698
What's the deal?
Is he looking to upgrade or something?

764
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,494
He contacted me and said he was looking
to sell the house at a bargain.

765
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,995
Did the pipes burst again?

766
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,456
- Hm?
- Ah, I don't know.

767
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,875
You know how fickle he is.

768
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,253
- That's true.
- Right.

769
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,255
And who is this?

770
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,008
Is he your boyfriend?

771
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,760
What?

772
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,347
Oh, no, no.

773
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,052
He's one of uncle's guests.

774
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,017
Oh... good.

775
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,272
Yeah, you need to be careful around men
these days, you hear me?

776
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,025
No reason to fill her with nonsense.

777
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,909
It's important she knows these things.

778
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,695
She's not a child anymore.

779
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,107
I thought you didn't like to drink.

780
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,488
Are you okay?

781
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:22,782
Really?

782
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,245
Should I be okay?

783
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,040
No.

784
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,800
I hate people who ask if you're okay...

785
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,679
when they clearly know that you are not.

786
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,893
If you don't know what to say,
you might as well say nothing.

787
01:09:58,944 --> 01:09:59,944
Are you okay?

788
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,289
Do I look okay?

789
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,001
No.

790
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,505
You know,

791
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:24,678
I hate it when people ask me

792
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,766
if I'm okay, when they can see that I...

793
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,771
So then, what now?

794
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,152
I'm finally alone.

795
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,948
I don't have any family left.

796
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,454
<i>Because of my uncle,</i>

797
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,542
Russian mobsters killed my entire family,

798
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,963
and my uncle's way of fixing things

799
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,674
was to kill them all in revenge.

800
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:07,680
I understand that made him
a legend in your world, so they say.

801
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,573
I always hated my uncle for it.

802
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,035
He's the one that should've died.

803
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,123
Why did mom and dad have to die?

804
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,169
Why did my sister have to die?

805
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,840
They'd still be alive.

806
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,510
If only he would've been the one
to have died back then.

807
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,432
I cursed him every day for it.

808
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,853
"You fucking lowlife criminal thug,

809
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,271
just die."

810
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,614
But now, he's actually dead.

811
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,868
Why aren't I happy?

812
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,248
It hurts...

813
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,793
right here.

814
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:26,425
I don't know why it hurts.

815
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,348
I wished him dead a thousand times.

816
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,143
I should feel satisfied.

817
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,939
But I don't.

818
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,239
Why is this happening to me?

819
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,911
Why does everyone keep leaving?

820
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,730
You wanna sleep with me?

821
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,944
It's all right.

822
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,154
Come on, don't you want to?

823
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,074
What?

824
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,787
Come here, let's go.

825
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,921
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

826
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,716
It's not like I'm saving myself.
I'm dead soon.

827
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,720
So it really doesn't matter.
I'm good with it.

828
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,306
Yeah, but the thing is...

829
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,020
I'm not good with it.

830
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,480
What?

831
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,525
Ah, don't be offended.

832
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,901
Uh, hey, look,

833
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,780
you're an attractive girl and everything.
I'm just discerning.

834
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,536
What I mean is, what kind of guy sleeps
with just any woman

835
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,329
who throws themselves at him?

836
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,833
I'm not that guy.

837
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,449
Discerning gangster.
You're not my type anyway.

838
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,201
Such bullshit.

839
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,302
Sure, I'll see you then, sir.

840
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,350
No problem.

841
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,020
Okay, then.

842
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,659
Let's go grab some food.

843
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,623
It's all right. Not hungry.

844
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,128
Come on. I'll get you something good.

845
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,482
Gonna try it?

846
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:34,982
Mm.

847
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,819
I have to after your review.

848
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:41,365
You said it's so good
you'd miss it from beyond the grave.

849
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,548
Really good.

850
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,469
I thought you didn't like raw fish.

851
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,138
Well, it's not true. I'd eat it every day.

852
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,185
Actually, <i>mulhoe </i>is my favorite food.

853
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,189
When I was young...

854
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,983
...my family lived by the sea.

855
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:22,155
Whenever we run out of food,

856
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,242
my mother would go down
to the fish markets,

857
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:29,246
pick over leftover fish
to make <i>mulhoe </i>for us, like this,

858
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,540
with <i>chojang </i>or whatever she had.

859
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,127
My sister got so sick of eating it,

860
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,004
by the time she grew up,
she couldn't even stand the smell.

861
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,971
But for some reason, I always loved it.

862
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:49,558
Even... today.

863
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,018
Just seeing <i>mulhoe </i>reminds me of my mom.

864
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,230
The smell makes me think about her.

865
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,232
It's nice.

866
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,701
Aren't you gonna eat?

867
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,249
I'll have yours too, then.

868
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:15,375
No way. Uh-uh.

869
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,793
Get your hands off.

870
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,380
Of course I'm eating.

871
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,156
Do we have our guys ready and waiting?

872
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,242
Yes, sir. They're with our men from Busan.

873
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,395
I need to drop by the airport.

874
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,654
Don't go.

875
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,575
Something's off.

876
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,745
You said yourself,
you couldn't reach any of your guys.

877
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,751
- It's just a situation...
- I don't care.

878
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:13,470
It's just...

879
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,223
Please don't go.

880
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,809
It doesn't feel right.

881
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,480
Besides, I hate being alone.

882
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,697
Oh my,
what wonderful weather today.

883
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,866
Your blanket will be crisp and clean
in no time.

884
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,077
Why are you screaming?
Everyone will hear you.

885
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,040
Of course, they'll hear me.
I'm talking to them.

886
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,319
- That's the point, you old fool.
- Don't you snap at me.

887
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,710
I won't be long.

888
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,719
Shit, Jin-sung, what happened?
Why haven't you been answering?

889
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:18,720
<i>Tae-gu!</i>

890
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,346
What's going on?

891
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,807
<i>That fucking snake, Yang, betrayed us.</i>

892
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,767
What?

893
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,478
<i>I'm telling you.
Your boss, Yang, sold you out.</i>

894
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:31,274
<i>And it's not just you, that asshole
turned on the entire lot of us.</i>

895
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,986
<i>We're all fucked, boss.</i>

896
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,695
<i>Save your ass.</i>

897
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,911
Hello? Jin-sung? Jin-sung!

898
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,893
Wait, hold on, hold on.

899
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,649
Tae-gu!

900
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,779
Where are you going? Hold on. Hey!

901
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,827
Move!

902
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:31,279
- Stop right there!
- After him!

903
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:39,183
Second floor.
Get up the stairs!

904
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:44,889
Shit!

905
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,100
You...

906
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,705
Move, damn it!

907
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,761
Hey! Get him!

908
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,020
Drag his ass out!

909
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:40,523
Hey!

910
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:43,401
- Open the door.
- Come on, shithead.

911
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,696
Tae-gu, son of a bitch!

912
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:51,951
You're a dead man!

913
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,999
Drag him out of the car!

914
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,955
Come on. Come on! I dare you.

915
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:49,634
Get him!

916
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:13,825
We lost him, sir.

917
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:22,125
What now, asshole?

918
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,712
How are you gonna honor
our deal now, Do-soo?

919
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,924
- Give me a tool or something.
- Wait, I can catch him. I can get him.

920
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:31,801
Not a gun, moron.

921
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,887
Mr. Ma, don't do this. Listen.

922
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,139
Just hear me out.

923
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:38,850
All right, then.

924
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:42,603
- Tell me how you're gonna get him.
- Hold on. There's a guy named Jin-sung.

925
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,273
He's one of his men, and I have him.

926
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,193
We can use him.

927
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,786
You fucking snake.

928
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,249
You're a real scumbag, aren't you, hm?

929
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,294
Oh, this piece of garbage.

930
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,381
I feel filthy just being in the car
with this asshole.

931
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,967
Scoot over there. Get away.

932
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,302
As far as you can.

933
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:18,264
- Open the windows, will ya?
- Yes, sir.

934
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,524
Hey!

935
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,195
Where did she go?

936
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,992
Jae-yeon. Do you know where Jae-yeon's at?

937
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,410
Jae-yeon went back to her farm.

938
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,370
She said she had to see her uncle.

939
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,707
She was getting something.
She asked to borrow my pickup truck.

940
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,960
Wait... Don't worry.
She said she'd be back soon.

941
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,844
Hey, where the fuck are you?

942
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,679
Hey, what's with all the swearing?

943
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,824
<i>I told you not to go anywhere.
Get back now!</i>

944
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,767
Yeah, and I told you
not to go anywhere too.

945
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,061
<i>Yeah, yeah. Fine.
Just come back right now!</i>

946
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,688
I'll be back soon. I couldn't just leave
my uncle like that.

947
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:10,358
<i>Goddamn it! Listen to me.
Your uncle's gone.</i>

948
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:12,401
<i>They already would've cleaned
everything up.</i>

949
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:17,156
<i>Are you listening to me?
You have to get out there right now!</i>

950
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,742
I can hear you just fine.
Stop freaking out.

951
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:23,496
- I'll be back soon.
<i>- No, wait! Hey!</i>

952
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:24,747
Hang on.

953
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,501
Ah, son of a bitch!

954
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:30,229
<i>Ah, Tae-gu, you finally answered.</i>

955
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:31,480
<i>Where are you?</i>

956
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:35,359
<i>Tae-gu?</i>

957
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,320
Why'd you sell me out?

958
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,117
<i>Tae-gu, it's not like that...</i>

959
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,994
Why'd you sell out my guys, too?

960
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:51,584
<i>It's more complicated than you think.</i>

961
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:53,419
Answer me, you asshole!

962
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,505
<i>How dare you speak to me like that?</i>

963
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,092
<i>Shit, okay, I'm sorry.</i>

964
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,452
<i>I'm sorry about everything, really...</i>

965
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:03,971
You gotta be kidding me with that.

966
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,891
<i>Don't forget that you're the one
that started all this.</i>

967
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,186
<i>You need to take responsibility
for your actions.</i>

968
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:14,440
If you don't turn yourself in,
more innocent people are gonna die. You...

969
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,869
Hey, Park Tae-gu. Director Ma, Bukseong.

970
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:29,830
We met a few times. Do you remember, hm?

971
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:31,582
I'll keep this short.

972
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,003
There's something we need to settle, huh?

973
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:38,714
I'll give you an hour to get here.

974
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:43,761
And if you don't show up,
there will be a steep price to pay.

975
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,973
First of, your boy Jin-sung
is gonna die, of course,

976
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:50,768
and so will she.

977
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:56,440
<i>Listen.</i>

978
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,402
<i>Just come in and we can wrap this up
nice and clean.</i>

979
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:02,238
<i>There's no reason
for innocent people to die, right?</i>

980
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,407
<i>You'd still die,</i>

981
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,283
<i>no matter what.</i>

982
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:09,662
Whether you show or whether you don't.

983
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,083
So think about the price of running away.

984
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,420
<i>You still there?</i>

985
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:18,963
All right, then.

986
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,801
- I'm coming.
- <i>Ah, that's the spirit.</i>

987
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:25,553
<i>That's the guy I heard about.</i>

988
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:27,012
<i>I knew you were a stand-up guy.</i>

989
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:28,556
But you promise me...

990
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:32,893
Jin-sung lives and so does the girl.

991
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,770
Ah.

992
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:38,107
Don't worry yourself, huh?
You have my word.

993
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:39,859
You know me.

994
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,405
I don't stab people in the back
like some you know.

995
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,239
What?

996
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:52,204
Sure.

997
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,457
We can do that.

998
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,292
What? Wanna see her on video?

999
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:59,670
Shit, just come see her yourself.

1000
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:10,598
Phone call for you.

1001
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:16,729
Don't come, are you insane?

1002
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,316
Why would you? Are you an idiot?

1003
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:21,984
Remember, I'm dying anyway.

1004
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,529
So am I. You heard what he said.

1005
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,739
I'm dead either way.

1006
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:35,456
Besides, you hate being alone.

1007
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,626
<i>Just hold on, I'll be there soon.</i>

1008
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,262
An hour isn't very long.

1009
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:54,600
I don't have much patience
for those who show up late.

1010
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,480
But if you do show up on time,
you get a reward.

1011
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:02,691
Think of it as a going away present.

1012
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,735
And when you get it...

1013
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,780
...you're gonna thank me.

1014
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,181
You remember meeting me?

1015
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:37,184
You were only this high
last time I saw you.

1016
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,770
Now, you're all grown up.

1017
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:45,442
Do you remember now?

1018
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,570
Are you fucking kidding me?

1019
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:51,198
Do you think I remember
every slimeball I meet?

1020
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,081
Oh, you really are a mouthy little thing.

1021
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:04,211
Oh my, haven't you been taught
to respect your elders?

1022
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,838
You have to earn my respect.

1023
01:38:07,089 --> 01:38:08,507
And you haven't earned shit.

1024
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,428
You must wanna die.

1025
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,511
Kill me.

1026
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:16,140
Whether it's today or tomorrow,

1027
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:18,017
I'll be dead anyway.

1028
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:22,855
Oh, this girl's got no respect for life.

1029
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,066
How'd you end up with that outlook, huh?

1030
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:31,196
Whoa! Kuto did one hell of a job
raising you, little one.

1031
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,245
You fucking bastard!

1032
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,186
- Who are we kidding here?
- Asshole!

1033
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:09,253
Fucker!

1034
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,173
Son of a bitch!

1035
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,388
Welcome, asshole.

1036
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:21,390
Park Tae-gu, you piece of shit.

1037
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:45,873
You're here.

1038
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:49,752
Look.

1039
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,055
Are you okay?

1040
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:05,851
Yeah, I'm fine.

1041
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,188
You okay?

1042
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,983
Do I look okay to you?

1043
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:19,864
No.

1044
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,951
You know what,

1045
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:27,748
I hate it when people ask if I'm okay

1046
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,585
when they know that I'm clearly not.

1047
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:44,348
But...

1048
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:47,184
it's nice of you to ask.

1049
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:52,064
Okay, what is this situation
I'm watching here, huh?

1050
01:41:53,982 --> 01:41:56,068
Has there been something brewing
between you two?

1051
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,197
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

1052
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,698
What if we are?

1053
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,826
Is it your business, asshole?

1054
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,120
There's her classy mouth again.

1055
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:11,375
Make the call, you fucker.

1056
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:15,629
Let Jin-sung go,
just like you promised me.

1057
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,803
And now, we have another mouthy one here.

1058
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,180
Don't you have any manners?

1059
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:29,059
I guess, these days,
no one respects their elders.

1060
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:33,021
Ah, whatever. Whatever.

1061
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,816
You're gonna be dead soon,
anyway. Shit.

1062
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:38,944
Hey, call the hospital and let him go.

1063
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:40,112
Yes, sir.

1064
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:44,783
Ah, kids these days
are so disrespectful.

1065
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:52,040
Hold still.

1066
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:03,135
Somebody already got him.

1067
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,305
Huh?

1068
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,266
What the fuck are you saying to me?

1069
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:11,226
Huh?

1070
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,730
Hey, Yang.

1071
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,025
Really? Huh?

1072
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:21,278
You went in and had Tae-gu's men killed?

1073
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:25,866
Well, we needed to get him anyway.

1074
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:28,994
No reason to risk him,
causing problems for us or anything.

1075
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:31,663
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Mr. Ma! Hold on! Come on!

1076
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,165
Goddamn!

1077
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:37,044
- Hold on a second.
- I'm gonna spill your guts all over.

1078
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:40,505
- Ma, I'm sorry. Don't kill me.
- I made a promise to him.

1079
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,799
Please forgive me.
Forgive me just this once.

1080
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,927
Hey, remember what Captain Park said?

1081
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:47,346
Remember what Captain Park said?
Killing me is a bad idea.

1082
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:50,265
It'll make trouble for everyone.
Okay, listen to me, huh?

1083
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,893
Jin-sung, he was loyal
to take him to a fault.

1084
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,603
There's no telling what he would do.

1085
01:43:54,686 --> 01:43:57,147
We couldn't risk keeping him alive.

1086
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,149
I did the right thing by killing him.

1087
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,484
I did it for us.

1088
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,028
You fucking son of a bitch, Yang!

1089
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:05,364
You motherfucker!

1090
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:08,533
How could you do that?

1091
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:10,762
- How could you fucking do that?
- This shit.

1092
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:11,995
I'm gonna kill you.

1093
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:14,164
Oh, this asshole...

1094
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,792
You need to watch how you talk to me.

1095
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,293
You bastard!

1096
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,422
You need to check yourself
before you start cursing other people.

1097
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:25,133
Keep in mind,
this is all your fault.

1098
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,843
None of this would've happened,

1099
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:30,639
if you hadn't attacked Chairman Doh
in the first place, huh?

1100
01:44:31,306 --> 01:44:33,267
Oh, hey, Yang Do-soo!

1101
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,519
Yang Do-soo, I'll kill you!

1102
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:38,105
Yang Do-soo, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

1103
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:40,107
Looks like you haven't had enough yet.

1104
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,360
- You shit!
- No! Stop!

1105
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:45,821
Don't hit him! Stop! Stop!

1106
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:48,532
Did I tell you to do it?
Did I order it, huh?

1107
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,993
- Stop!
- I never told you to do a thing!

1108
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:53,078
Son of a bitch!

1109
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,749
- Stop!
- She's right. Come on, enough.

1110
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,460
That's enough.

1111
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,630
Oh, shit. He's gonna kill the damn kid.

1112
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,592
Please, stop!

1113
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:10,053
- Please!
- Yes, you shit now, you fucking...

1114
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,222
Oh, hey!

1115
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:18,312
Ah, fuck, that hurts.

1116
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:28,530
This guy is really something, huh?

1117
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,116
Real fucking piece of work, huh?

1118
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,827
He's barely even human, isn't he?

1119
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,539
He's more like a cockroach,
this fucking guy.

1120
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:48,050
Ah, shit.

1121
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,970
I told you to stop, didn't I? You asshole.

1122
01:45:56,808 --> 01:45:57,851
Hey, Tae-gu!

1123
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,603
Tae-gu.

1124
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,064
Remember the gift...

1125
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,733
I promised you earlier?

1126
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,361
I have information
that should interest you.

1127
01:46:12,282 --> 01:46:14,493
It's about your dead sister.

1128
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,664
Chairman Doh had me investigate.

1129
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:22,459
I assumed we were involved,
so I roughed up my own guys,

1130
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,211
really grilling them hard.

1131
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:25,379
Turns out...

1132
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,756
it wasn't us after all.

1133
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:29,925
It's true.

1134
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,303
Yeah, just think about it, huh?

1135
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,597
Even if we saw you
as some kind of obstacle,

1136
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,974
we wouldn't dishonor ourselves
with dirty tactics.

1137
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:41,937
We would've just killed you.

1138
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,356
You know.

1139
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:47,651
Who then?

1140
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,363
Well, Yang, speak up.

1141
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,801
You care to tell him
what happened to his sister and niece?

1142
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,326
He has some questions.

1143
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:03,625
Why...

1144
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:06,503
Why would he...

1145
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,880
Isn't it obvious, huh?

1146
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:12,342
Chairman Doh had poached everyone
from him and was recruiting you.

1147
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,845
He was worried that you would leave

1148
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:16,888
and that you would take
your boys with you.

1149
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:20,350
And then, he'd be left all alone and weak.

1150
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:26,314
Does that, uh, about sum it up?

1151
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,575
You bastard!

1152
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:38,660
I'll fucking kill you!

1153
01:47:38,743 --> 01:47:40,287
I'll kill you, fucker!

1154
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:44,416
Son of a bitch!

1155
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:48,420
Bastard! Die!

1156
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:54,217
Die, you bastard!

1157
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,180
Just die, damn it!

1158
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:02,851
Fucking die!

1159
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:11,318
Fucking die!

1160
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,158
Wait! What are you doing?

1161
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:21,411
What are you doing?

1162
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,459
No! Stop! What are you doing?

1163
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:30,754
Oh, my god!

1164
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:32,255
No!

1165
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:42,516
Oh, you goddamn son of a bitch!

1166
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:45,268
Get up, you asshole! Come on! Come here!

1167
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:54,277
Let go! Hey!

1168
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,363
Let go, you asshole!

1169
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:59,658
You motherfucker!

1170
01:49:26,142 --> 01:49:27,310
Tae-gu...

1171
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:31,314
Don't speak my name, you asshole...

1172
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:36,528
I'm gonna take you to hell with me.

1173
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:41,449
You're dying with me, you worthless prick.

1174
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,535
No!

1175
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,795
Oh, no!

1176
01:49:53,878 --> 01:49:56,089
No, no, no...

1177
01:50:15,525 --> 01:50:16,818
You bastard.

1178
01:50:29,664 --> 01:50:31,416
You goddamn bastard!

1179
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,253
I'm sorry,
but I've let you have enough fun, eh?

1180
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:38,256
I really wish I could...

1181
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:40,925
let you kill that bastard.

1182
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:44,179
I would offer him up
as a parting gift to you, if I could.

1183
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:49,017
But, there'll be nothing
but trouble for us if that scumbag dies.

1184
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:56,983
Tae-gu, hey.

1185
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,821
It's time for us to settle the score.

1186
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:04,282
Hm?

1187
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:45,407
Don't...

1188
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,269
Don't cry.

1189
01:52:16,646 --> 01:52:17,939
It is pointless.

1190
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:22,277
Stop your crying.

1191
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:27,532
I'm not.

1192
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:29,492
Why would I?

1193
01:52:31,494 --> 01:52:32,954
Over you?

1194
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:35,540
Why would I cry over you?

1195
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:39,084
Well...

1196
01:52:40,628 --> 01:52:42,338
Now, you respect me...

1197
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:46,467
since...

1198
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:50,388
I'm gonna die...

1199
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,016
before you.

1200
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:55,685
Your rules.

1201
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,354
Did I say that, kid?

1202
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,441
'Cause I'm not agreeing to it.

1203
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:04,110
Anyway,

1204
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:07,238
you're just a short time ahead of me.

1205
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:11,576
Of course...

1206
01:53:14,996 --> 01:53:18,082
of course, you'd say something like that.

1207
01:53:33,556 --> 01:53:38,019
No, stop, back off! He's already dead!
Please, let him be.

1208
01:53:38,102 --> 01:53:40,980
Yeah, you're right.
He's definitely dead.

1209
01:53:41,689 --> 01:53:43,441
Leave him alone!

1210
01:53:43,942 --> 01:53:45,568
Stop fucking biting me!

1211
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:46,652
Shit!

1212
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:49,155
Crazy bitch.

1213
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:53,701
Oh, that actually fucking hurts.

1214
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,426
Tae-gu.

1215
01:54:12,262 --> 01:54:13,721
You're in a lot of pain.

1216
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:17,684
Here, I'll make it stop.

1217
01:55:20,496 --> 01:55:22,874
All right, let's go. Clean this shit up.

1218
01:55:22,957 --> 01:55:24,250
What about the girl, sir?

1219
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:28,212
Why would you ask me that?

1220
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:30,882
Director Ma, I'll do it. Here.

1221
01:55:30,965 --> 01:55:32,550
- Hand me the knife.
- What?

1222
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:36,638
I'm already covered in blood.
I might as well be the one to do it.

1223
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:39,098
You won't touch her, huh?

1224
01:55:39,807 --> 01:55:41,267
I keep my word.

1225
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:45,188
Besides, as we heard,
she doesn't have long to live.

1226
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:46,856
This heartless bastard.

1227
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,376
Even more reason to offer it.
She should be dead soon, anyway.

1228
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,819
I said, no, that's enough,
you sick bastard!

1229
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,906
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- All right.

1230
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,367
Take a look at yourself.

1231
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,869
You're the goddamn one
that should be lying there dead.

1232
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:02,996
Get him out of my sight.

1233
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:05,339
Go.
I can't stand the sight of him.

1234
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:08,336
Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Give me my check.

1235
01:56:13,091 --> 01:56:15,009
Shit!

1236
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:17,762
Oh, my fucking head.

1237
01:56:26,854 --> 01:56:28,982
Ah, I hope the room's ready.

1238
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:30,400
I need to lie down.

1239
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:20,314
Oh, they're out for breakfast.

1240
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,470
Thanks so much.

1241
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:25,848
Did you recommend a particular restaurant?

1242
01:58:27,308 --> 01:58:30,686
Thanks! I appreciate your help.

1243
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:25,551
Well, look who it is.

1244
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:29,472
You here for breakfast?
I have bad news.

1245
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:30,973
Seats are all filled.

1246
02:00:32,266 --> 02:00:34,328
Hey, let her in.
She can sit on my lap!

1247
02:00:36,687 --> 02:00:38,439
So, how about it?

1248
02:00:38,522 --> 02:00:40,233
You wanna come sit with us?

1249
02:00:41,525 --> 02:00:44,987
We can get to know each other right now.
Why don't you come have a drink with us?

1250
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:49,158
Come on. Come on, it's fine.

1251
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:53,496
Look at all these pussycats.
We aren't all that scary, are we, huh?

1252
02:00:54,997 --> 02:00:56,082
Over here!

1253
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:58,459
Shit.

1254
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:16,352
I'm not here to eat.

1255
02:01:17,186 --> 02:01:19,021
Now, get your hands off.

1256
02:02:08,696 --> 02:02:10,531
Oh, you fucking assholes.

1257
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:15,161
You shitheads think this door
is bulletproof or something, huh?

1258
02:02:15,953 --> 02:02:18,581
This isn't a pellet gun she's holding,
you idiots.

1259
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:38,142
You got a score to settle.

1260
02:02:39,685 --> 02:02:40,936
I can respect that.

1261
02:02:43,814 --> 02:02:45,441
Gotta do what you gotta do.

1262
02:02:52,823 --> 02:02:54,325
This bitch is crazy.

1263
02:03:30,444 --> 02:03:31,779
Damn it.

1264
02:03:33,447 --> 02:03:34,740
Shit.

1265
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:50,005
Wait, hold on. Just hold on.

1266
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:51,966
Stop, now.

1267
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:55,511
Hang on, we'll talk.

1268
02:03:55,594 --> 02:03:56,595
We can talk, right?

1269
02:03:56,679 --> 02:03:57,805
No.

1270
02:03:58,305 --> 02:04:58,705
