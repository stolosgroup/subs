Can you keep 'em until 7:00?

00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,916
Maybe they could stay the night?

59
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,000
Just have them back by 7:00.

- [woman 1] I'm tired, Noah. Okay?

70
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,541
I just worked the night shift,

to get you guys back. All right? So...

Cars, too.

119
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't think we're gonna get
an ambulance here,

120
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,583
but the VA Hospital's just
four blocks away, and...

121
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,208
you're gonna need stitches.

122
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,041

Uh, Exam Room 3.

126
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,916
Hey, excuse me! Excuse...

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,833
[sighing]

128
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,375
Hey, excuse me. Um, I need a doctor.

129
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,018
Um, uh, we just got into a car accident

130
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
and my daughter was, uh,
spitting up water.

131
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,166
You okay?

132
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,166
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,083
[nurse 1] She's fine.

134
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,625
- [woman 1] Wh... Hey! Hey!
- [nurse 1] I need some help here!

135
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,583
[woman 1 sighing]

136
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,416
It's a terrorist attack, for sure.

137
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,791
What?

138
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,750
Terrorists?
Able to shut off all the power...

139
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,250
- to cars?
- Maybe it was the Chinese, right?

140
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,166
They built all this shit
so maybe they just turned it all off.

141
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,666
[man 2] And maybe we're at war.

142
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,500
Maybe they blew up New York and LA,
and we're next.

143
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,750
[inhales sharply]

144
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,267
- [patient screaming]
- [nurse 2] I gave him ten cc's.

145
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,267
- That should put down a rhino!
- [woman 3] Someone!

146
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,375
[woman 3 speaking Greek]

147
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
[woman 3, in English] It's a miracle.

148
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,875
Please, someone!

149
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,541
[woman 3, in Greek]

150
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,291
[woman 3, in Greek]

151
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,666
[woman 3 continues speaking Greek]

152
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,708
[woman 3 crying]

153
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,541
[in English] He's awake.

154
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,083
[male nurse] He's up, too.

155
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,830
[Doris] The phones aren't working,
the power's out...

156
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,291
What happened?

157
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,541
The car's in the lake.

158
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,500
Always clear out the air.

159
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,458
- Always.
- Good girl.

160
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,833
- Hey, Doris, you good on meds?
- [Doris] I got plenty.

161
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,000
The store's not taking credit cards.

162
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,791
Do you have cash for food?

163
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,625
The cash was in the car. In the lake.

164
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,333
I... I can see if I can pick something
up on the way home from the university.

165
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm in at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I just need to get a little sleep.

166
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,916
You're still going to work?

167
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,166
Yeah. They don't have power.
They're gonna need security.

168
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,125
You know, there's no point
in you walking home.

169
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Why don't you spend the night?

170
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,916
Thanks, Doris.

171
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,625
[clock winding]

172
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
[clock ticking]

173
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,125
[inhaling deeply]

174
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,291
[exhaling]

175
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,791
- [people shouting in the distance]
- [glass breaking]

176
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,208
[people continue shouting]

177
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,375
[breathing deeply]

178
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,958
[Doris] I don't know
how you sleep like that.

179
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,791
I'm not sleeping. Meditating.

180
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,083
[inhaling sharply]

181
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,166
Does it help?

182
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,625
Hmm. Think so.

183
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,541
You know when you wake up in the morning,
everything is good for a minute

184
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,208
before the shittiness hits you?

185
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,750
[inhaling]

186
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,541
I get that minute when I meditate.

187
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,125
I tried yoga when my hip started hurting,
but...

188
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
it didn't work for me.

189
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Do you, uh...

190
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,416
You have a little something
to help me sleep?

191
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,958
I don't do that anymore.

192
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,708
You know the judge said
that I wasn't allowed.

193
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,083
Well, I guess you really aren't using
if you're awake too.

194
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm gonna head to work.

195
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,541
I'll stop at the pharmacy
and get you something.

196
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,916
[floorboards creaking]

197
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,416
[woman 1] Why don't you get some sleep?

198
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,208
[Noah] I'm not tired.

199
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,125
Look at all the shooting stars.

200
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,708
Those are satellites, Noah.

201
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,083
[people shouting indistinctly]

202
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,875
[indistinct screaming]

203
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,000
[more indistinct screaming]

204
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,125
[indistinct shouting]

205
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,458
[people chattering
and laughing indistinctly]

206
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,000
- Hey, hey, hey, I need more stuff.
- Relax, okay?

207
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,666
Downers, benzos, phennies, tooies,
red jackets, people are crazy right now,

208
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,833
amped up. That shit'll be, like, gold.
I'll double the price.

209
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,500
No, fuck, I didn't say that.

210
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,416
Yeah. Yeah, you did say that.

211
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,708
All right. I'll do it. Fucking Gregg's
a man of his word, all right?

212
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,791
Cash in, cash out. Cycle of life.

213
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,833
I'll double the price
on all types of zombie pills. Come on.

214
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,375
- Okay.
- Okay.

215
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,083
Angel?

216
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,458
Where the fuck is everyone?

217
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,666
[keys jangling]

218
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
[brakes squealing]

219
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,083
[indistinct chattering]

220
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,708
[woman 4] How'd you get
your cars to run, huh?

221
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,416
How come our cars aren't working?
What the fuck is going on?

222
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,375
[banging on door]

223
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,291
- Hey!
- Easy.

224
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,416
Easy. I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams.
Out of Fort Huachuca.

225
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,291
What are you doing up here?

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,791
Not active anymore. I mean, I might be.

227
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
I don't know. They call in reserves yet?
I just don't know.

228
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,541
She's fine.

229
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,333
That's a lot of pills, Jill.

230
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,536
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like, I promise.

231
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,041
- [woman 5] Pack those up for me, please.
- [Jill] Yes, ma'am.

232
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,041
I know you stuck your neck out for me
to get this job, and I am so appreciative,

233
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,250
- and... and I know I screwed up...
- I don't care.

234
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,000
Was that an EMP yesterday? Are we at war?

235
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,375
People are saying it's been happening
all over. Who would we even attack?

236
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,291
[Jill] Major Murphy?

237
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,500
Hard drives are useless.
Anything with a microchip is fried.

238
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,500
Here's everything I have on hard copy.

239
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,250
- Hey.
- Hey.

240
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,250
[soldier] Any additional personnel?

241
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,541
I'm starting a hub.

242
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,083
We could use you.

243
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,333
What's going on, Murphy?

244
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,583
We were the "get answers" people
over there. They need those people again.

245
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,666
[soldier] Major...

246
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,458
we need to go now.

247
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,208
I can't do that anymore.

248
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,375
This is the location of the hub.

249
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,750
I'd like you to get Lori and my children,
and...

250
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,750
get down there as soon as you can,
all right?

251
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,125
Absolutely. No problem.

252
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,000
[man 3]
You don't understand how serious this is.

253
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,291
You should have gone with her.

254
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,041
How is Murphy gonna bring the power back?
She's a psychiatrist.

255
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,500
[man 3] It's not about the power.

256
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,916
There are contingencies for that.
Replace enough wires and fuses...

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
It's about the people.

258
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,666
Nobody can sleep.

259
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,166
[exhaling] After 48 hours of no sleep,
there's a loss of critical thinking.

260
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,875
Ninety-six hours,
hallucinations, motor failure.

261
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,500
But what about after that?
Organs will fail but then what?

262
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,708
Days of lying in paralysis
until the heart shuts off?

263
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I know what happens.

264
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,125
Of course, you do.

265
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,000
But this is different.

266
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,916
Everything is accelerated.

267
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,791
Symptoms are appearing
two to three times quicker.

268
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,208
It's gonna be total chaos.

269
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,291
We're not all going to die.

270
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,916
- Well, this is not happening to everyone.
- Yes, it is.

271
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,958
Well, there is this one woman
who can sleep.

272
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,736
They're bringing her to this hub.

273
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,166
Matilda was sleeping too.
My daughter was sleeping.

274
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,958
Are you sure?

275
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,750
Jill, they're setting up a whole station
based on this one sleeper.

276
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,791
That's how big of a deal she is.

277
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,416
Are you sure your daughter was sleeping?

278
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,708
Oh, I-I... I got into a car accident,

279
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,333
- but I'm fine.
- Was your daughter also hurt?

280
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,833
What are you saying?

281
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,958
I'm just saying,
odds are she wasn't sleeping.

282
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,750
What, do you think she's unconscious?

283
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,791
There are no such thing
as unconscious people anymore.

284
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,416
They're either...

285
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,333
on, or they're...

286
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:33,875
off.

287
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,083
[footsteps hurriedly departing]

[dogs barking]

290
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,416
Matilda?

291
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,791
Matilda!

292
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,875
Matilda!

293
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,500
[panting]

294
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?

295
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,846
Where is your sister?
Where is your sister?

296
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,833
You're hurting me!

297
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,416
- [shaky breathing]
- Psycho.

298
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,666
I'm sorry, I know.

299
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,416
Where... Where is Matilda? Is she okay?

300
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,625
Yeah, she's fine.

301
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,875
Where is she? Please, Noah.

302
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,541
Church. Grandma took her to church.

303
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,833
Maybe we are meant to be awake.

304
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,208
'Cause you need to be woke
to see how the world really is.

305
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,708
And the Lord says,
"Come to me, all who labor

306
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,833
and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest."

307
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,458
She's not sleeping.

308
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,375
[knocking on door]

309
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,583

[footsteps approaching]

311
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,333
[door closing]

312
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,291
Not sleeping, Birdie?

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,708
Only my dad called me that.

314
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,166
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm just... tired.

315
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
[pastor sighing]

316
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,416
Not everyone...

317
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,416
asked to be called to God, you know.

318
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,541
Some people just are.

319
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,958
I know that more than most
because before I was a pastor...

320
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,458
I was a drug addict.

321
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,041
[chuckling]

322
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,458
Covered up the evidence with a tattoo.

00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,666
I overdosed.

324
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,250
I mean, I should've died within hours,
but I didn't.

325
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,625
I had built up such an immunity
to narcotics over the years, I just...

326
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,625
laid there for three days in rest...

327
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,541
'til eventually I passed.

328
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,541
But I was only gone for a minute
when they found me.

329
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,500
So, like Jesus, I...
returned from the dead.

330
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,583
[chuckling]

331
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,291
Now, I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.
I just...

332
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,416
[inhales deeply]

333
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,333
I'm saying that...

334
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,291
since that day,
I dedicated my life to serving him.

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,041
And to me...

336
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,375
it was a miracle that I survived,
you know?

337
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,541
And I think people really need
a miracle right now.

338
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm not sure what...

339
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,958
I mean...

340
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,000
You think I need to die?

341
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,083
No.

342
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,875
No, of course not.

343
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,750
No, I'm sorry. No.

344
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,041
I, um...

345
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,625
[inhaling deeply]

346
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,208
[pastor exhaling]

347
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,833
It's just everyone is tired
and... desperate, you know?

348
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,250
People just want to know if you can sleep.

349
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,750
I can sleep.

350
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,875
It's just hard when I'm not tired.

351
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,000
Would it be okay if I prayed with you?

352
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,250
A lot of children say my prayers
are so boring, they nod right off.

353
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,166
[chuckling]

354
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,041
Lord, we thank you for this day
and we thank you for Matilda.

355
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,166
What the...

356
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:48,916
[panting]

357
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,291
Oh, okay.

358
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:55,375
717-127-0414.

359
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:56,958
[grunting]

360
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,750
[mumbling numbers softly]

361
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,416
[Noah] Pizza, really?

362
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,750
Uh, no, it's a test
for mental sharpness.

363
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,000
- [Noah] How'd you do?
- I-I got two wrong. It's fine.

364
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,625
Uh, we need to go and find a car,
and get your sister somewhere safe, okay?

365
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,208
Everything with a circuit's fried.

366
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,916
- Cars don't work, Jill.
- [sighing] Some do, Noah. Okay?

367
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,916
So, can you just help me out, please?

368
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,541
Grab your bag. Let's go.

369
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,416
We need to be careful.

370
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,916
Oh, shit!

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,208
- Your daughter, can she sleep?
- [Jill] What?

372
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,583
- Is this your boyfriend?
- No. No!

373
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,666
[Jill panting]

374
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,500
She can't sleep? Is she okay?

375
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,791
No, she's fine, she's fine. I was wrong.
She was just pretending.

376
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,000
Matilda was totally sleeping.

377
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,083
I woke her up.

378
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,000
[Jill sighing]

379
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,583
What? She was sleeping.

380
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,750
Jesus, Jill, we need to get your daughter
to Murphy.

381
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,883
- Look, she could be key.
- Noah, we gotta go.

382
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,958
I know where the hub is.

383
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,921
They're setting up a station
to help solve this.

384
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,375
Look, they already have this one sleeper.

385
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,458
Brian, we're not going there.
Come on. Noah, let's go.

386
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,375
[Jill yelling] Hey! Yo, that's my bike!

387
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,791
Hey!

388
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,541
[pastor] <i>In our basement,
like an angel of peace,</i>

389
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,000
<i>a young girl sleeps.</i>

390
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,958
So if she can sleep,

391
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,125
- that means we can too.
- [people murmuring]

392
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,250
So, as all mankind lays awake,

393
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,583
we pray for answers.

394
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,000
- [man 4] Pastor...
- Yeah.

395
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,500
So what if she can sleep?

396
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,833
Miracles spread, Jim.

397
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,458
Just like good grows,
if you believe in it,

398
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,875
if you give it a fighting chance.

399
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,375
[man 5] There is no over-the-counter
sleeping pills left.

400
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,218
[man 6] Give us the stuff
behind the counter!

401
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,559
[man 5] You'll have to talk
to your doctors. Get the notes.

402
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,101
[man 6] You know no doctor's answering
his phone.

403
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,416
Please, I can't help you!

404
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,375
[indistinct screaming]

405
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,208
Come on.

406
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,666
Come on, Noah. Keep up.

407
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,416
[indistinct screaming continues]

408
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,791
Come on.

409
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,541
Whoa.

410
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,416
[Jill] Wait here.

411
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,833
[Noah] Oh, God.

412
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,166
It's only going to get worse.

413
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,493
What's happening to everyone?

414
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,458
[indistinct screaming]

415
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,791
[dog barking]

416
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,333
If we don't sleep...

417
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,791
Your mind will bend and bend
until it breaks.

418
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,538
- [Noah sighing]
- You snap.

419
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,541
Life changes like that.

420
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,416
But it's adversity
that prompts us to change

421
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,180
- when we otherwise wouldn't.
- [all] Amen.

422
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,583
So then we embrace it.

423
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,125
[Jim] Pastor...

424
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
She's awake.

425
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,583
[people murmuring]

426
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,833
- Matilda...
- When are you gonna make us sleep?

427
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,583
- Patience, please.
- [man 7] I don't have patience right now.

428
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,666
Raymond isn't responding.
He's eating but not talking.

429
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,583
- He's tired, just like the rest of us.
- He's beyond tired.

430
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,250
- He'll be fine.
- [woman 6] We should sacrifice her.

431
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,375
[pastor] No.

432
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,791
God sacrificed Jesus,
his own son, to save us.

433
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,000
God willingly sacrificed himself
for our sins.

434
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,958
There is no sacrifice needed.
We... We only need prayer.

435
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,541
God help me,
I'm willing to be Pontius Pilate

436
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,500
- and condemn the girl.
- Robert, sit down.

437
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,416
[yelling] Sit down!

438
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,309
- [pastor] That's enough.
- [man 7] What good is prayer?

439
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,416
We need sleep.

440
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,833
Oh. Matilda.

441
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,625
- [Matilda] Mommy!
- Hey, hold on.

442
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,166
Please, sit... Sit down everyone.

443
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,291
Jill, we just wanted to pray with Matilda,
that's it.

444
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,958
She can sleep. Maybe she can help.
Lord knows we all need help right now.

445
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:42,083
Come on. Matilda is my daughter,
and she's coming with me.

446
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,601
- [woman 7] Not legally, she ain't.
- Please, sit... sit down.

447
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,750
Doris... Doris takes care
of those kids by law.

448
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:50,916
You're right.

449
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,875
But right now, with what's happening,

450
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,500
I can help, and you know I can help.

451
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,041
- [Jill] Okay, come on, Matilda. Let's go.
- [Jim] She has to stay here.

452
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,041
[pastor] Hey, Jim.

453
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,125
She's special.

454
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,248
- [woman 8] She is.
- Okay.

455
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,934
- Just calm down, everyone.
- [Matilda] Mom?

456
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,809
- [man] Pastor, you promised.
- Sit down, please.

457
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,666
[Brian] We're on the same team here.

458
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,833
You're all absolutely right.

459
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,458
- She is special.
- [woman 9] That's right.

460
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,000
[Brian] But she can't help anyone here.

461
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,583
Now, we're all gonna die

462
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,458
if we don't solve this.

463
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,750
Right now, your brains
are slowly swelling.

464
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,875
Our cranial walls are impressing
on the brain,

465
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,833
and it's affecting critical thinking.

466
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,250
It's what happens when we don't sleep.

467
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,291
Now, the more excited we get,

468
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,958
the more blood flows to the brain,
the worse we are.

469
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,208
So, the best thing we can do right now...

470
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,416
[inhaling deeply]

471
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,750
is take a deep breath...

472
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,833
[exhaling]

473
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,458
and calm down.

474
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,250
Now, we're gathering scientists
and doctors to help solve this.

475
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,125
And they can.

476
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,208
And all they need is the girl.

477
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,791
Mom?

478
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,583
[breathing heavily]

479
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,791
No one dismisses the value of science,

480
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:16,875
but neither is she a test subject
to run experiments on...

481
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,184
- You're not taking her anywhere.
- [pastor] Jim, please.

482
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,791
- [woman 10] That's right.
- Prayers are not gonna save...

483
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,375
Fucking people,

484
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,833
if you don't hand her over,
I'll be back with the Army,

485
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,250
and they're not gonna ask nicely.

486
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,184
- You calm down!
- [Brian] Is that what you want?

487
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,916
Because unless you people wake up,
that is exactly what is gonna happen.

488
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,375
And book throwing, that's gonna...

489
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,291
[gunshot]

490
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,375
[people screaming]

491
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,541
[pastor] Jim, what have you done?

492
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,583
[woman 7] Doris took her down the back.

493
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,741
Noah, Noah, look at me.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

494
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,601
I need you to meet me in the forest
out back. I'm gonna get your sister.

495
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,500
[people screaming indistinctly]

496
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,726
- [woman 11] She in there?
- [man 9] Hey!

497
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,559
- [man 9] Bring her out!
- [man 10] Get her out here!

498
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,333
[man 9] She's not in there.
Get the guys. Let's look out back.

499
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,916
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

500
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,541
[crowd gasping]

501
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,458
- [Doris gasping]
- Where is she?

502
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,958
[Doris] She's not in there? She was.

503
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,625
It's a miracle.

504
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,000
This isn't Jesus
rising from the tomb, Doris.

505
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,166
This is not who we are.

506
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,041
[pastor] Jim?

507
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,125
Jim!

508
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,541
[soft crying]

509
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:42,666
Matilda.

510
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,666
Oh, my God, my baby.

511
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,833
- Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
- [Matilda whimpering]

512
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:52,291
- Grandma told me to run, but I couldn't.
- Oh, that's okay.

513
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,208
- Are you okay?
- Oh. No, I'm fine, baby. I'm fine.

514
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,500
- Please.
- [Jim] God spoke to me, Pastor.

515
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,458
- Put it down.
- [Jim] We can't let her leave.

516
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,291
Jim, put it... put it down, please.
You're scaring everyone.

517
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,916
[pastor breathing heavily]

518
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,750
[panting]

519
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:20,666
[pastor] Jim!

520
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,291
Please put down the gun.

521
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,458
[gunshots]

522
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,381
- [people screaming]
- [Noah breathing shakily]

523
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,458
[panting]

524
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,833
[Jill] Come on, stay close.

525
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,291
- Come on.
- [Matilda] Mom, stop, please!

526
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,375
What about Grandma!

527
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,916
[panting]

528
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,666
[Jill] Baby...

529
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:56,083
Your grandmother can't run, okay?
She has a condition.

530
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,666
- All right?
- But Mom, please...

531
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,583
No, no, no, no. She's gonna be fine.

532
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,458
- I need you to keep up with me, okay?
- Okay.

533
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,625
How are you feeling?

534
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,708
No more running.

535
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,625
- All right, piggy-back time. Come on.
- Okay.

536
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,583
Let's go, Noah.

537
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,375
[Jill panting]

538
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,458
This way.

539
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,458
Come on.

540
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We're here.

541
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,291
[Matilda panting]

542
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,250
[Jill] Come here.

543
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,750
[Jill panting]

544
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,666
[Jill] We're gonna need a car.
You stay here.

545
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,041
I'm gonna go get one.

546
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,041
Where are we going? [panting]

547
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,916
They call it the hub.

548
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,791
We can't go there.

549
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,583
- You don't know what they're capable of.
- But we need to find a cure.

550
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,791
Noah, it's not that simple.

551
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,375
It... It's right here,
wherever this... this is.

552
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,125
I touched a dead body to get this.
A dead body!

553
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,125
It's not safe there.

554
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,625
What's your plan here, Jill?

555
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,041
We bring Matilda somewhere safe,

556
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,875
we both die, and she lives alone?

557
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,458
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

558
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,875
Here.

559
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,541
Light this. Light it.

560
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,083
- Burn it. Burn this, and we can't go.
- Noah, stop that.

561
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,291
It doesn't work.

562
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,125
[breathing heavily]

563
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,875
Wake up, Mom.

564
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,333
[Noah] This is our only chance.

565
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,041
If we're all gone,
she'll be dead within days.

566
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,708
There's another woman there already.
They're gonna find a cure. They will.

567
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,625
[Noah] Please.

568
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:44,916
Okay.

569
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,000
[birds chirping]

570
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:09,291
[rock clattering]

571
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,666
Hello?

572
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,291
Hello?

573
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,375
Gregg?

574
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,250
215-124-0519.

575
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,416
[mumbling softly]

576
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,416
Not even close.

577
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,333
Hello?

578
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,708
Gregg?

579
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,345
[man 11] We got the pick of the litter.
How about the Beemer instead?

580
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,916
- [man 12] Idiot! It's gotta be an old car.
- [soft thud]

581
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,041
What was that?

582
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,208
[whispering] Gregg.

583
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,500
[Gregg breathing heavily]

584
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,291
[gun cocking]

585
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,833
[Gregg breathing heavily]

586
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,458
It's just Gregg.

587
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,916
He's, like, still awake.

588
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,458
He can't even sleep now?

589
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,041
Shit.

590
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,875
Sleep.

591
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,833
- Sleep.
- [Gregg whimpering]

592
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,833
Sleep, baby, sleep.

593
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:37,000
[stomping]

594
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,083
Okay.

595
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,208
Okay, can we focus?
Get that Camry started?

596
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,791
Goddamn!

597
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,416
World's in chaos
and you're wasting time stomping heads.

598
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,458
Why can't we do the Beemer?

599
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,500
[man 12] This is the last time I tell you.

600
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:57,333
We need an old car. No electronics.

601
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:01,875
It had no battery in it
when whatever the fuck was happening...

602
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,541
[man 11] Now I'll start it.

603
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,458
The Camaro or the Dodge should work
with one of the older batteries.

604
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,958
[wrench cranking]

605
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,541
Get in. Give it a shot.

606
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,458
[man speaking indistinctly]

607
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,458
[car door opening]

608
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,541
[man 12] Ahh...

609
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:18,791
[car door closing]

610
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,583
[man 11] Transmission's in.
Fingers crossed.

611
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,666
[man 12] It's fine.

612
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,767
- [man 11] Tell me when you're ready.
- [man 12] Yeah.

613
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,708
[attempting to start engine]

614
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,916
- [engine revving]
- Whoo!

615
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,416
[man 11] There it is.
Told you we could boost the battery.

616
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,916
- [man 12] Sweet!
- [man 11] Go get the keys for the Dodge.

617
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,250
And grab the battery we brought up
from the basement!

618
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,875
- [engine revving]
- [man 11] Ha-ha!

619
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,291
[man 12] But I get the Camaro.

620
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,375
[man 11] What?

621
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,708
[man 12] I get the Camaro.

622
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,416
- I don't want a Polara. I want a Camaro.
- [man 11] Just grab the keys, <i>pendejo.</i>

623
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
[man 12] All right!

624
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,250
All right.

625
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,208
[keys clattering]

626
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,833
[man 11] You find it?

627
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,125
[man 12] They're in here somewhere.
You find 'em.

628
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,458
I want the Camaro.

629
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,708
Is that right, sheriff?

630
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,750
[man 12] I'm taking that fucking car.

631
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,208
[man 11] You're not.

632
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:12,000
- Yo, you hear that?
- [car accelerating in the distance]

633
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,041
- [man 11] You heard that, right?
- [man 12] Yeah.

634
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,958
Someone else got a car running, too.

635
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,041
[man 11] Fuck.

636
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,375
[groaning]

637
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,875
Man, they were stocked up. Medical shit.

638
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,541
Bet they could sleep with that.

639
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,583
Let's go.

Here. It's easy.

653
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,708
Just one motion.

654
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,208
Who's Emily?

655
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,166
[Noah] My girlfriend.

656
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,333
Ex-girlfriend.

657
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,458
Did you guys ever...

658
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,708
do it?

659
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:27,791
What?

[vehicle approaching]

661
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,333
Shit.

00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,625
Mom?

663
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,416
Everything okay?

664
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,416
Noah's never had sex.

I...

666
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,166
I have.

667
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:49,958
Hey, get in.

[car engine purring]

So, what happened with this girlfriend?

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,250
No.

672
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,916
We're... We're not going to talk about this
right now.

673
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:14,416
Noah, come on. I basically...
I basically had you when I was your age.

674
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,750
We do not need to have this conversation.

675
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,833
Okay.

676
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,875
- But you can talk to me if you...
- [Noah] Are we done?

677
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,750
Yeah, we're done.

679
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,791
[Noah] Why her?

680
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,625
Why not us?

681
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,125
[Jill] What's this?

682
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,250
Stay in the car.

Those were Murphy's guys
that shot up that car.

695
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,750
I worked with Murphy, overseas.

696
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,791
She helped me get a job
at the university and...

697
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,000
helped me with rehab, too.

698
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,083
She's a psychiatrist, Noah.

699
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,458
Sleep expert.

700
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,958
In the desert, she would...

701
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,291
help set parameters for interrogation.

702
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,416
Sleep deprivation, it was torture.

703
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,875
They killed people.

704
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:26,958
The kind of things that we would do
to try to find answers, it's not human.

00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,333
Yeah.

[Matilda] Hey.

715
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,875
[Jill] You okay?

716
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,416
[Matilda] Mm-hmm.

717
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,291
[Jill] Come here.

718
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,916
I... I want to make sure
that you understand how this works, okay?

719
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,791
Mom, I know how a library works.

720
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:23,166
Yeah. The computers don't work anymore,
so...

721
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,625
This is gonna be your new school.

722
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,916
So, when mommy's gone,
you'll need to find a library.

723
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,041
Okay? And... read. Don't stop reading,
and I...

724
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,166
[breathes heavily]

725
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,625
...and I need you to learn
as much as you can, okay?

726
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,291
'Cause you are my smart girl.

727
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,166
All right.

728
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,833
All right. Um...

729
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,541
Um, come with me over here.

730
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:45,958
Here we go.

731
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:50,166
Okay, look at me. I'm gonna teach you
something very important, okay?

732
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,833
I need you to learn
how to shoot this gun, okay?

733
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:56,750
And, look at me, not just for people,
but for animals too. All right?

734
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,291
And we're gonna find you a rifle,

735
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,135
and you're gonna learn
how to shoot that too,

736
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,625
because the world
is different now, baby, okay?

737
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,666
And you gotta be prepared for anything.

738
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,416
All right? Here we go.

739
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,750
Put two hands on the gun for me.
There you go.

740
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,208
Okay.

741
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,708
Hold onto it strong
just like the handlebars of your bike.

742
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,708
Put this foot forward. There we go.
Nice strong stance, okay?

743
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,666
Keep both eyes open.
And you see that eye groove?

744
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,166
I want you to look right through that,
all right?

745
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,500
Now focus, breathe.

746
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:25,583
[shaky breathing]

747
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,666
You can do this.

748
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:29,958
I don't like guns.

749
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,583
- Matilda, please.
- [Matilda] I don't want to.

750
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:33,833
- You have to.
- No!

751
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,791
- You have to.
- No!

752
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,833
- Yes, Matilda!
- We're gonna find a cure, okay?

753
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,666
And you and Noah are gonna shoot the gun.

754
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,583

[Jill] Now you do it.

758
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,142
- Oh.
- [crying] I'm going to the car.

759
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,416
Wait, baby. Baby, come...

760
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,041
[Noah] Hey!

761
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,125
Did you shoot at me?

762
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,375
No. Noah, I thought you were in the car.

763
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,916
I was here. I said I was here.

764
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,875
Who's in the car, Noah?

765
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:02,958
No one.

766
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,916
You said to find books on mapping.

[sighing]

768
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,250
Just don't shoot at me again, okay?

769
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,583
[Noah] I think the coordinates lead here.

770
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,041
[Jill] Mmm.

771
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,375
It looks like...

772
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,041
it... it's 1,500 miles away?

773
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:33,166
I think it's 150 miles. I don't know.
We haven't slept in four days.

774
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,291
I-I wrote down the directions.

775
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,041
I think.

[tires squealing]

00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,666
No. No.

784
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,083
[yelling] Stop! Stop!

785
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,250
[man 14] Hey.

786
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,875
I'm not stopping. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm not stopping.

787
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,000
[tires squealing]

788
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,125
[yelling] Fuck you!

789
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,416
Hey, I ain't gonna hurt you.

790
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,625
I ain't.

791
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,583
I promise.

792
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,000
Just, hey, let me have the boy.

793
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,958
No, you can go. I'll let you go.
Hey, give me the boy.

794
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,541
I'll let you... I'll let you go.

795
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,208
I'm just messing around.
I'm messing around.

796
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,708
We're all free men here. It's all good.

797
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,791
Hey, can I... Can I have that gun?

798
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,208
Noah, I'm gonna shoot at one.

799
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:37,171
They're gonna scatter. You're gonna
go inside and lock yourself in, okay?

800
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
Noah!

801
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:41,875
- Noah!
- Hey, give me... Give me the gun.

802
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,083
Are you gonna shoot me?

803
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,041
Go on.

804
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,373

00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,333
Noah, run.

807
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,416
[yelling] Noah, run!

808
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,250
Yeah, run, Noah, you pretty little bitch.

809
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,291
[tires squealing]

810
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,166
Hey, Mommy. Get in.

811
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,458
- Get in, Mom, please.
- Get in!

812
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:11,708
Yeah, get in.

813
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,291
- Who are you?
- [man 15] Why does it matter?

814
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,583
What is your name?

815
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,041
- I said, "What's your name?"
- Dodge! Dodge, call me Dodge.

816
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,208
How did you get out, Dodge?

817
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,583
I was locked in the cells,
guards were gone, okay?

818
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,546
We were starving, and I thought
that, you know, I was gonna die in there.

819
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,543
And then the guards came back
and opened the cell.

820
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,875
- [Jill] You just walked out?
- Yeah, I just walked out.

821
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,351
- Where are you heading?
- I'm in a red fucking jumpsuit. Okay?

822
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,958
I'm heading far away.

823
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,833
- Far from here, okay?
- Watch out!

824
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,636
- [Jill, Dodge grunting]
- [tires squealing]

825
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,458
[Dodge grunting]

826
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:46,875
[Dodge grunting]

827
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,250
Ha!

828
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,583
[pants, chuckling]

829
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:50,875
[Dodge laughing]

830
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,758
- [Dodge continues laughing]
- [engine idling]

831
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,333
There are no bullets in that.

832
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,416
What?

833
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,750
There are no bullets in that gun.

834
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:00,833
[engine turns off]

835
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,000
I keep the keys. And we need gas.

836
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,500
[door opening]

837
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,583
No bullets, huh?

838
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:12,958
Fuck!

839
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Oh, my God.

840
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,291
[Matilda] Mom?

841
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,041
[Jill] Okay, that should be clean enough.

842
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,708
So, you saw I put it in the gas tank,
right?

843
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:33,125
And now I want you to just, um, suck on it
like a straw,

844
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,375
but do it hard,

845
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:37,416
and then when it comes out,
put the gas in the tank.

846
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,458
You're gonna put it in here, okay?

847
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,958
So your sister can sleep, huh?

848
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,916
Where's your father at?

849
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,166
[Noah sighing]

850
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,250
He died...

851
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,750
in the war.

852
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,791
Oh, he served.

853
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:01,416
Not bad.

854
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,791
Not good either.

855
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,666
[Dodge] Change of clothes, baby!

856
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,375
Go on.

857
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,125
Come on, you can do it.

858
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,208
Come on, you gotta learn, Matilda.
You got this.

859
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,833
[sucking]

860
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,958
- [Jill] Oh! Oh.
- [coughing]

861
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,458
- I drank it.
- Okay, baby. It's okay. It's all right.

862
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,833
- Spit it out.
- [coughing]

863
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,083
Hey, your mom's hardcore, man.

864
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,833
[sighing] She's getting Matilda ready
in case we can't find a cure.

865
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,416
- She thinks I don't know what she's doing.
- A cure?

866
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,208
You guys are trying to find a cure?

867
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,081
You know, the funny thing is,
I usually sleep, like,

868
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,791
two to three hours tops at night,

869
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,625
but now, you know...

870
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,958
So, you're taking our car?

871
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,541
Well, depends where you're heading.

872
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,666
North. Lewisburg, right?

873
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,750
[Dodge] Hmm.

874
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,125
That's where I'm heading, too.

875
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:31,958
North.

876
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:36,833
You know, you should probably
hang onto it.

877
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,291
You, uh, look pretty mean
pointing it at people.

878
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,791
Just in case something happens.
[chuckling]

879
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:53,291
[engine revving repeatedly]

880
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,541
[Jill] That's good, baby.

881
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,916
Remember, two hands on the steering wheel.

882
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,375
Yes, I have two hands.

883
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,916
Okay, I was just telling you
so you don't forget.

884
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,250
You always say
I have a really good memory.

885
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,583
- Why do you think I'll forget?
- Eyes on the road, please.

886
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,375
Thank you.
[sighing]

887
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:15,291
Fixing this car is gonna be so hard.
Oh, man. Okay.

888
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,375
But there are books on that, okay?
You hear?

889
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,958
Burn the books, man. Burn 'em all.

890
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,250
- Don't need those anymore.
- Ah, eyes!

891
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,791
Can you maybe just not...
Focus on the road, please.

892
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,833
Not talk to her
so she can concentrate, please.

893
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,375
[Dodge] Enough people said
that the Earth was flat,

894
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,708
so the Earth was flat.

895
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,958
Then, they said the Earth was round...

896
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,125
so the Earth was round.

897
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,833
The Earth <i>is</i> round.

898
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,291
Prove it.

899
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,750
[Noah] Science proves it.

900
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,125
[Dodge laughing] Science?
And who understands the science, huh?

901
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,000
Eyes on the road, please, always.

902
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,043
[Dodge] Enough people talk
about something, right?

903
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,208
Then it becomes fact.

904
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:03,750
Then they put it in the books,
and then the book becomes fact.

905
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,916
Then it's settled.

906
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:09,166
Then no one understands it anymore,
no one even talks about it anymore.

907
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,125
Fuck, this is why
we gotta burn the books, man.

908
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,666
He said the F-word.

909
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,666
I know. Please shut up.

910
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,875
[Dodge, softly] Sorry.

911
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,541
- She's a kid.
- Okay.

912
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,583
You know, my grandmama,
you know what she used to tell me?

913
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,458
- Huh?
- That all the world's problems

914
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,541
could all disappear in one generation

915
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,541
if every kid grew up
forgetting all the shit they were taught,

916
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:35,166
the shit that doesn't make sense,

917
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,708
but you're taught it enough times,
you believe it.

918
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:39,708
Then we can actually live in a world

919
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,666
where no one is starving...

920
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:44,875
and everyone's equal.

921
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,375
- Really?
- Whoa.

922
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,000
[tires squealing]

923
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,458
I'm sorry, guys.

924
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,500
I used to think she was crazy, though,
Grandma.

925
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,541
[Dodge laughing]

926
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,083
Man, but now...

927
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,458
maybe she was on to something.

928
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,166
- Watch out. You see that there?
- [Matilda] Yeah.

929
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,375
Go right around the car, just like that.

930
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:15,875
Hey...

931
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,750
Slow down. Slow down, put the brake on.

932
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:20,791
[brakes squealing]

933

What the fuck?

934
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:32,708
Let's go.

935
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,511
Let's go, let's go, let's go, right now!
Put your head down, Matilda!

936
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,416
- Come on.
- [Dodge] Move, move!

937
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,708
I'm trying, I'm trying!

967
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,541
We have to get off the road.

968
00:55:58,625 --> 00:55:59,458

[sighing]

972
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,791
Are you guys sure
you don't want me to stick around

973
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,083
and maybe help
with whatever y'all are doing?

974
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,375
No, you go to where you need to get.

975
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,791
- Yeah.
- [Matilda] Bye, Dodge.

976
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,291
Bye-bye, kids.

977
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,250
It's time for me
to get the fuck out of Dodge.

978
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,541
[engine revving]

979
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,125
All right.

Hey, why'd we stop at this place?

984
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,291
We're just gonna, um...

985
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,916
I'm gonna just go first, okay?

986
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,416
Make sure it's safe.

987
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:14,316
If I don't come back,
I want you to stay in this house, okay?

988
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,625
There's enough food
to last you about a week.

989
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,750
- No. No, no, no.
- Mat... [shushing]

990
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:22,041
[whispering] It's just in case.

991
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,166
It's just in case.

992
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,708
And if anyone comes, I want you to hide.

993
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:28,041
Okay? Especially men, okay?

994
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,666
- Okay?
- Yeah.

995
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,166
Okay. Okay.

996
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,083
[Matilda crying]

Hey, Noah.

[continues breathing shakily]

1001
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:01,958
Come back.

1002
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,041
I will.

1003
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:13,750
[crying]

1004
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,375
Don't come after me, okay?

[special op 1] I'll take them up.
You watch the bridge.

1021
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:32,833
We'll get you situated.

1022
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:34,666
It'll be all right.

1023
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,791
[special op 1] Come on, let's go.

- [man 17] Just keep taking the meds.

1029
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,375
It'll help you work.

1030
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,517
[woman 13] I don't have training
on the hemopurifier.

1031
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,583
I'm not equipped for...

1032
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:49,125
[man 17] Ah, shit, what was the code?
I wrote it down.

1033
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,666
Two, zero, four, six.

1034

[woman 13] Two, zero, four, six.

1035
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,583
Okay, let's go.

1036

Two, zero, four, six.

Two, zero, four, six.

What...

1051
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:32,458
Come on.

1052
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,083
Please, please, please, please.

1053
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,750

[man 18] Hey, hey.

1057
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,625
- [Jill] Huh?
- You.

1058
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:12,958
That's mine.

1059
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,333
Huh? Oh, okay.

1060
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,708
Okay, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1061
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,333
Oh, wh...

1062
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,333
Where's the woman, uh, that can sleep?

1063
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,666
Yeah.

1064
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,125
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1065
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,291
You need blood samples?

1066
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:50,458
They already did radio x-ray.

1067
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,875
Yeah, I need blood...
I need to take blood samples.

1068
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:56,791
Yeah. Okay.

1069
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,166
Okay.

1070
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,791
[woman 14 breathing heavily]

1071
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,375
[woman 14 groaning] Oh.

1072
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:41,083
How much blood can you take from me?

1073
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,583
[breathing heavily]

1074
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,375
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1075
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,791
I want out of here.

1076
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,208
[groaning]

1077
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,291
Good. I can help you with that.

1078
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,875
You need to raise my daughter.

1079
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:05,166
I have a little girl. She's ten years old,

1080
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,250
and she needs you to help her
in the new world.

1081
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,333
[clears throat]

1082
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,750
I...

1083
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,250
I can't...

1084
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,333
I...

1085
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:15,458
- I can't...
- No.

1086
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:16,875
Is... Why?

1087
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,416
She can't make it on her own.

1088
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,750
She needs somebody to help her.

1089
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:23,666
Okay? She needs someone to help her.
You're the only one who can do it.

1090
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,416
In the next few days,
the rest of us are gonna be dead, okay?

1091
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,083
I'm gonna take you out of here.

1092
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,458
I'm the one that needs help.

1093
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:34,916
[inhales deeply] I was supposed to be dead
months ago.

1094
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:37,875
You're crazier than the rest of them.

1095
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,833
Jill?

1096
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:42,958
[Jill] Dr. Murphy.

1097
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:44,958
I, uh...

1098
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,958
- [Murphy] What are you doing here?
- [panting]

1099
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:48,916
I came to help.

1100
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,434
After you left the campus,
Brian helped me with the coordinates.

1101
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,458
Brian...

1102
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,041
My family, are... are they with you?

1103
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:58,416
Oh...

1104
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:01,458
No, uh...

1105
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,166
Brian was, um...

1106
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:07,333
I'm... I didn't see him again.
So I'm assuming he was here.

1107
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,416
They're not here?

1108
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

1109
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,166
Uh...

1110
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,083
Is there a cure?

1111
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,625
It's been six days, and we're no closer.

1112
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:26,166
We have, um, a cocktail
that helps with mental acuity,

1113
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,916
but it's... it's causing some...

1114
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:29,958
neurological damage.

1115
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,041
But it is...

1116
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,458
It's buying us some time.

1117
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,750
This morning, I...

1118
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,541
[inhaling deeply] I thought...

1119
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,083
maybe the only answer...

1120
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,416
[chuckling]

1121
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,916
we're gonna get is...

1122
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,041
that none of us are gonna survive.

1123
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,416
But...

1124
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,625
you got here, right?
[chuckling]

1125
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,375
I mean, that must mean something.

1126
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,333
Get some meds...

1127
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,583
get situated, and let's get to work.

1128
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,208
I'm so glad you're here.

1129
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:05,791
[breathing heavily]

1130
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:10,291
Oh.

01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,333
Uh...

1132
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,625
Oh.

- [tires squealing]
- Hands up! Get out!

1145
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,333
- Get down! On your knees!
- Get out of the car.

1146
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:19,434
- [soldier] Hands up!
- No.

1147
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,892
- [Dodge] Don't shoot, okay?
- [soldier] Get down on your knees!

1148
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:22,916
Don't shoot!

- Listen!

- No, no!
- [soldier] On your knees!

1151
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,101
- Okay, okay, I'm here to help!
- Get out of the car.

1152
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:31,833
- [Dodge] I'm here to help.
- Show me your fucking hands!

01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:33,833
- Oh, no.
- [Dodge] Listen.

No, no!

- [soldier grunting]

1157
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,041
[Jill] Oh, God!

1158
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,166
Don't fucking move!

- Keep moving! Show me your hands! Go!

1165
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,000
- [soldier 1] Keep moving!
- [Dodge] She's just a little girl!

1166
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,166
Stop moving!

I can sleep.

[crying]

1171
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,250
I can sleep.

[sighing]

1174
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,958
I can help people sleep?

1175
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:31,666
[Katz] Yes.

1176
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:35,500
And we need to find out
what makes you so special.

1177
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,000
Is he still alive?

1178
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:49,041
[Katz] Oh, yeah, <i>she </i>is still alive.

1179
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,500
We, um...

1180
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,583
had to ease the tension by...

1181
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,833
draining the cerebral fluid, but...

1182
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,125
that hasn't helped.

1183
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:07,791
A catch-22. The only way
to ease the tension is to drain the fluid,

1184
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,375
the only way to clean the brain
is the fluid.

1185
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,541
Can I touch her?

1186
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,125
[Katz] Sure.

1187
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,541
You're such a brave, sweet girl.

01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
[Katz] Ether.

1191
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,833
Well, see?

1192
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:46,208
Nothing.

1193
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,208
- [chimp whimpering]
- No effect.

1194
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,916
Most animals are able to sleep...

1195
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,833
after the incident, but chimps, well...

1196
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,916
they were always closest to humans.

1197
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,750
[Murphy] Hi.

1198
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,708
I'm Dr. Murphy,
I'm... I'm a friend of your mom's.

1199
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,333
Can she?

1200
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,125
[Katz] Uh, we're gonna, um...

1201
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,875
try the ether on you now, Matilda.

1202
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,166
- To prove that you're special.
- [Matilda] Will it hurt?

1203
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,833
[Katz] No, we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm a doctor.

1204
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:21,666
We don't hurt people.

1205
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,375
[Murphy] Kinda weird, huh?

1206
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,458
Yeah.

1207
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,666
[Murphy] Slow, easy breaths, babe.

1208
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,583
There you go.

1209
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,750
Nice and easy. It's okay.

1210
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,291
Nice and easy.

1211
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,083
She sleeps.

1212
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:57,666
Poor thing.

1213
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:04,208
Amazing.

1214
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:18,458
[Murphy sighing]

1215
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,041
Hey.

1216
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,416
I...

1217
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,416
I want to be disappointed...

1218
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,375
that you didn't tell me about Matilda

1219
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
after all I've done for you.

1220
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:34,250
But, as a mother, I understand.

1221
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,833
[sighing]

1222
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,250
How long have I been here?

1223
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:41,875
Uh...

1224
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,333
Eighteen hours.

1225
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,250
Why can she sleep?

1226
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,250
Who?

1227
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:52,958
[Murphy] Who? Matilda.

1228
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,000
Has she had any, um... any surgeries?

1229
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,458
How long have I been here?

1230
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:11,833
It was, um...

1231
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:13,833
some sort of a...

1232
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,916
a solar flare, we think.

1233
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,375
It... changed our electromagnetic wiring.

1234
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,708
It affected our glymphatic system.

1235
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,166
Messed with our...

1236
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,666
our clocks.

1237
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,333
Matilda.

1238
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,291
Matilda.

1239
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,583
Oh, please, let her go.

1240
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,500
Jill, your survival...

1241
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,875
Our... Our survival depends on Matilda.

1242
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:37,833
Hmm?

1243
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,208
Gotta keep trying.

1244
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:40,625
[Jill] Oh, no, please.

1245
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:44,333
Oh, no, please, please.
No, no, no, that's my baby.

1246
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:45,666
That's my baby.

1247
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:49,833
That's my baby girl. Please just take,
like, blood samples or something, please!

[door opening]

You really an electr... electrician?

1250
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,958
[woman 13] Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

1251
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,833
It's a cocktail of anti-inflammatories,
stimulants, other things.

1252
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:10,166
It reduces the beta-amyloid.

1253
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,208
It'll help.

1254
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:18,666
Um, it's most effective
when injected near the brain.

1255
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,833
The carotid.

1256
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,333
Fuck that.

1257
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:24,833
Fuck...

1258
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:25,916
What...

1259
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,125
Okay.

01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,750
[Katz] Ah.

1263
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,541
- [Katz grunting]
- I think she stopped breathing.

1264
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:53,666
[Katz] Huh?

1265
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,541
Defib. Hey! I need your help! Okay.

1266
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Okay, come on.

1267
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:03,166
- I need you to press "charge."
- [Murphy] Okay.

1268
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,250
- [Katz] Okay? Charge.
- [Murphy] Ready. Charging.

1269
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,166
[Katz] Clear!

1270
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,083
You're hurting her.

1271
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,458
[Katz] We're trying to restart her heart.
Do it again.

1272
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,892
- [Murphy] Charging.
- [Katz] Clear!

1273
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:13,017
- [defibrillator beeping, shocking]
- [Katz] One more time.

1274
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,476
- [Matilda gasping]
- [Murphy] Charging.

1275
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,500
[Katz] Clear!

1276
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:29,916
[nurse] It's all the spiders in here.

1277
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:31,541
There's too many.

1278
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,625
That's why they're all melting.

1279
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,958
We have to get rid of the spiders.

1280
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,434
- It's all the spiders in here.
- [Murphy] Well...

1281
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:42,208
Let's get her brother up here...
so we can compare them.

1282
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,958
- [nurse] There's too many.
- What?

1283
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,208
I have to save...

1284
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,125
[gasping] We need to save her.

1285
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,583
We... We need...

1286
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,583
- You lied to me.
- We... We just...

1287
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,986
[Noah] You wanted to find a stranger
to leave Matilda with.

1288
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,416
I guess that's what you do.

1289
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,166
You rely on other people
to raise your kids.

1290
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,833
[screaming] No!

01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:25,791
[Jill breathing heavily]

1500
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:29,958
You were right...

1501
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,041
[Jill whimpering]

1502
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:34,125
about not wanting to come here.

1503
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,291
You were right...

1504
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,291
to try to find someone to help Matilda.

1505
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:47,625
I know you love us.

1506
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:50,916
I know you do.

1507
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:54,750
I can't lose you, too.

1508
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,625
We need you.

1509

[grunting]

1513
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,291
You died, Noah. You died.

1514
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:54,386
Your heart wasn't beating,
I listened to it.

1515
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,875
And then when I got the defibrillator,
I brought you back.

1516
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:58,625
Yeah, I owe you, okay?

1517
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,851
We don't have lots of time to discuss it.
Mom's not gonna make it.

1518
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02,875
[Matilda] Did I die?

1519
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:04,750
Did I die, too?

1520
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:09,041
- What?
- In the water, when the sheriff saved me.

1521
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,258
I mean, there was nothing,
absolutely nothing,

1522
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,500
and then the sheriff was pushing
on my chest, he was hurting me.

1523
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,083
Maybe I started over?

1524
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,500
[Noah] So you're saying...

1525
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,333
I mean...

1526
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:32,875
Oh, fuck.

[Jill heaving]

1528
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,833
You have to trust me, Mom.

1529
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,125
Put her down.

1530
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:55,750
- Gently.
- [exhaling]

1531
01:26:58,666 --> 01:26:59,666
[Matilda] Okay.

1532
