Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,541
Taking me
to see basketball or a cockfight?

3
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,916
We do everything.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,958
Okay.

5
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,250
Big boy.

6
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,666
He's coming.

7
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,833
Do we back up? He's gonna take us out.

8
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,833
Oh-oh!

9
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,666
Uh-huh. What? What did he say?

10
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,041
He wants to go to the NBA.

11
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,750
- Yeah, that's why we're here.
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,750
Very impressive. Tell him.

13
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,666
Just a big man who makes shots.

14
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,590
He would be in the rotation right now.

15
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:50,125
And be a force,
he would be a powerhouse in the league.

16
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,875
I do have to ask something.

17
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,500
So it says in my files,
you're 22 years old.

18
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,875
<i>Da. Da.</i>

19
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,166
- Yeah.
- It's accurate? You're 22 years old?

20
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,375
Yes, I'm 22 years old.

21
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,750
The reason I'm asking…
He's speaking English?

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,458
- Yeah.
- You understand my English?

23
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,458
Because you can't be
in the draft if you're over 22,

24
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,375
if you're from overseas.
Do you have a birth certificate?

25
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,208
It was big fire.

26
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,166
Oh. Okay.

27
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,041
- Who's this?
- It's my son.

28
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,583
- It's your son?
- Yes.

29
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,875
- How old is he?
- He's ten years old.

30
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,541
He's ten years old. Okay. Okay.

31
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,833
{\an8}<i>What was going on on defense?</i>

32
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,166
{\an8}Did you smoke a little before the game?

33
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,833
{\an8}A little bit. Okay.

34
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,583
{\an8}NBA, we need defense. You know that.

35
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,416
{\an8}I know. Okay.

36
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,083
{\an8}- Hey, pretty lady.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

37
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:43,541
{\an8}I'm in Greece enjoying
the local cuisine. It's very good.

38
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,833
{\an8}<i>Babe, you're killing yourself.</i>

39
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,375
{\an8}Yeah, that's the idea.
I love you, I'll see you soon.

40
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,166
{\an8}Hey, Bubba.

41
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,083
{\an8}<i>Dad, when I said
I didn't get geometry,</i>

42
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,791
{\an8}<i>I didn't want you to email
my teacher. So embarrassing.</i>

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,041
{\an8}How about you? You wanna play basketball?

44
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,625
{\an8}Stanley, you know how many scouts
have come to see Haas play?

45
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,333
{\an8}We would love to see him go to the Sixers.

46
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:33,333
{\an8}Embiid. Maxey. Harris. Haas.

47
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,541
{\an8}Dynasty. No?

48
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,875
{\an8}I like the sound of that. Sure.

49
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,250
{\an8}Haas! Haas!

50
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,041
{\an8}<i>The local time is 7:42 a.m.</i>

51
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,208
{\an8}<i>For those of you returning home
to Philadelphia, welcome back.</i>

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,875
- Hey, Stan.
- Hey, guys.

53
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,416
Good to see ya.

54
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,916
- Yeah. Who you've been dating?
- Yeah. Come on, Dad.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,833
- You're not dating?
- I'd never tell you who I was dating.

56
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,708
- Just a second.
- Okay.

57
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,041
Hi. Wow, you look tired.

58
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,916
- I had a red-eye.
- How was the German MJ?

59
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,625
I'm about to get into all that.
You're not staying?

60
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,375
I have an 11:30 call with Adam Silver.

61
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,708
You didn't like the kid?

62
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,708
Oh… shit.

63
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,875
Good luck, Sugerman.

64
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,208
Please don't go.

65
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay. Goodbye.

66
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,601
{\an8}Kid can score at will.
Makes shots from all over the floor.

67
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,625
{\an8}A match-up nightmare.

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,208
{\an8}His true shooting percentage,
same as Steph's was at Davidson.

69
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,375
- You're taking it too far.
- He's just reading the stats, Billy.

70
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,458
I think Doc will like
the way this kid can pass.

71
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,661
You've seen him pass before?
I've never seen him pass.

72
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,500
He's playing with scrubs.
His best chance to win is to shoot.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,333
With us, he'll adapt.

74
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,416
We've done the modeling.
He checks every box.

75
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,083
In three years he could be an All-Star.

76
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,458
Rex, you want to win now,
or in three years?

77
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,416
- We want to win now.
- Yeah…

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,333
Offensively, there's a lot to like,
but I don't think...

79
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,000
So what's <i>not</i> to like, Stanley?

80
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,708
Berlin loses a lot.

81
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,208
Three games
this guy didn't show up to, they won.

82
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,500
They're better off when he's on the bench.

83
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,500
You check out the efficiency stats I sent?

84
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
- I actually have the stats, Stan.
- Thank you.

85
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,041
Everyone in Germany is saying
this guy'll be the next Dirk.

86
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,041
Dirk never left the gym.
This guy shows up late to warm-ups.

87
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,125
The kid can defend all five positions.

88
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,500
He's physically capable of it.
He just gets bored out there.

89
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,000
I've been to Germany four times
in the last two months.

90
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,125
I've yet to see him make a third effort.

91
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,916
He's late on rotations.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,375
Always bitching at refs,
bitching at teammates.

93
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,916
He's bitching because he cares.
He wants to win.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,666
We've all seen the tape.

95
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,583
Referring to the highlights
his mother put together?

96
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,333
Like the Bargnani tape
you tried to trade up with?

97
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,666
- That's too soon.
- Shit.

98
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,500
Listen, Dad, he's a 19-year-old, 7-footer
with a 35-foot range and a guard's handle.

99
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,875
I see him in another team's jersey,
I'm gonna goddamn kill someone.

100
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,958
Yeah.

101
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Cool.

102
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,375
- Yes, sir.
- Get in.

103
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,833
Okay.

104
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:00,250
So, I'm not drafting Haas.

105
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,833
Your son's gonna kill somebody.

106
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,208
Yeah, maybe you.

107
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,125
You shouldn't have backed down to him.

108
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,625
No, no, no, I didn't.

109
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,958
I didn't back down. I was just
trying to save everybody some time.

110
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,958
I remember when you were at Temple.

111
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,250
I think it was the second game
of the season,

112
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,833
and we were playing Saint Joe,

113
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,916
and some guy took Leon's knees out.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,791
Marlon Daly.
I can't believe you remember that.

115
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,250
I remember you knocking him
into the second row

116
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,333
and then having to be held back
from fighting that entire team.

117
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,250
That's the reason I brought you in,
because you never took anybody's shit.

118
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,583
Rex, you're right.
I should have pushed back more.

119
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

120
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,166
No, it won't.

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,750
Karl, could you pull around
to the back, please?

122
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,458
After I bought the team,

123
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,083
this was before your time,

124
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,041
I gave this office to my Uncle Connie.

125
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,000
He helped out with everything,

126
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,375
worked every day.

127
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,583
Sorry, I didn't make it happen
for you sooner.

128
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,708
I know it's not on the bench,
but it's behind the bench.

129
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
So what do you think?

130
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,208
I can't believe you made
your uncle work in this closet.

131
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,291
Thank you.

132
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,458
Feels like I've been waiting
my whole life to become a coach.

133
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,166
Come here.

134
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Come.

135
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,833
Never back down.

136
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,291
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

137
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,250
- I won't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,458
Right.

139
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,541
Look at the berries.

140
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
You need to zoom out
so they can see the whole thing.

141
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
Mom, no one uses filters.

142
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,541
I can't eat that whole cake.

143
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
Looks like you already did.

144
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:09,375
Wow, what a lovely welcome home.
I missed you guys too.

145
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,458
Welcome back. Welcome back. Okay.

146
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,125
Not a side hug. What's with the side hug?
When did you stop hugging me?

147
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,833
Honey, you gotta be more gentle.

148
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,625
- Your baby's got titties now.
- That's disgusting.

149
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,291
I don't want to hear about that.
That's between you two.

150
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,458
Dad, can I go to the cemetery tonight?
They're showing <i>Evil Dead.</i>

151
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,875
I told you I love that movie. Absolutely.

152
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,166
No, she can't.

153
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,125
No, you can't. Why can't she?

154
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,583
She never finished her presentation
on the Homestead Act.

155
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,708
Didn't finish. Why?

156
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,458
I don't know.

157
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,375
Okay, here's what we'll do.

158
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,958
You can go to the movie tonight.

159
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,041
- Oh, wow.
- Yes.

160
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:46,250
No. No, no. But all weekend long,
it's just you, your history books.

161
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,041
Sunday night,
I want a TED Talk on the Homestead Act.

162
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,750
- Fine. Yes.
- All right?

163
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,041
- Okay. Cool.
- Thank you.

164
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
- I love you. Now can I get a hug?
- Love you too.

165
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,875
- No.
- No? No, hug.

166
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,083
Why would you do that?

167
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,416
Because I was happy

168
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
she was actually excited
about something for a change.

169
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,916
And to be honest with you,
I… I wanted to be alone with you.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,583
You think you'll get some love
after that bullshit you just pulled?

171
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,583
Hell, no.

172
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,750
I have some good news.

173
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,083
You might even like me again
once you hear it.

174
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,708
You are looking at…

175
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, you're not looking,
but you're going to look soon,

176
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,916
at the new assistant coach…

177
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,666
…for the Philadelphia 76ers.

178
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,625
Thanks for everything.

179
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Oh.

180
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,666
- Stanley, Stanley.
- Yep. Yep.

181
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,291
- AC! AC!
- We did it. We did it.

182
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,625
- We did it.
- "No! Get down there!"

183
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,333
- "Get your ass up! Get your ass here!"
- That's right.

184
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,791
Yo, check this out.

185
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,375
This video is trending again.

186
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,916
Dr. J still dunking when he was 63.
Isn't that nuts?

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,458
Yeah, you should put your phone away,
though, because you're driving.

188
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,583
Yeah, that's true.

189
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,583
But just look at the hops on that guy.

190
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,000
There was nobody like him.

191
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,250
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,541
What's going on with school?
How's that going?

193
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,208
It's, um…

194
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,291
Nothing. It's fine.

195
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,500
In all honesty,
what do we feel about college?

196
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,208
Is that something you want to do?

197
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,375
You talked about going to film school.

198
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,458
So many kids are applying to film schools.

199
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,416
They're not going to pick me.

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,583
Oh, I'm not worried about all those
other kids. I'm worried about you.

201
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
You against you, baby.

202
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,291
You can get it done.
You just gotta do what you love.

203
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,291
Did you love being away
from home all the time?

204
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,208
That's what you got out of this.

205
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,875
Of course,
I hated being away from home,

206
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,166
but now that I'm coaching,
I'm going to be around a lot more.

207
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,458
So we're going to get your grades up.
Together. Okay.

208
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,583
- Love you. Bye.
- I love you.

209
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,375
Have a good time with these guys.

210
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,750
Hi! I'm so excited! Hi!

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,875
No side hugs for them.
That's just for me? I love that.

212
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,500
Girls. I know you since kindergarten,
none of you say hi?

213
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,583
Bye, Dad.

214
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,208
<i>Good evening, everybody,
Anthony Gargano here,</i>

215
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,458
<i>I've got breaking news.</i>

216
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,541
<i>And it's very, very sad news.
I've just confirmed it.</i>

217
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,708
<i>I don't even want to say it.</i>

218
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,166
<i>But Rex Merrick, you know our beloved Rex,</i>

219
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,666
<i>owner of the Sixers,
has passed away tonight.</i>

220
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,791
<i>I'm at a loss for words.</i>

221
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,250
<i>He was one of the great people.</i>

222
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,583
<i>He was one of our people.</i>

223
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,458
<i>He grew up dirt poor
in Al to on a, Pennsylvania.</i>

224
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,541
<i>He was just like
everybody else in his town.</i>

225
00:13:54,375 --> 00:14:00,041
<i>He built great wealth,
but he never distanced himself from us.</i>

226
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,958
<i>And this is why we lost a great one today.</i>

227
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,375
<i>So Rex, this is for you.</i>

228
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,583
<i>Hi, I'm not here right now.</i>

229
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,375
<i>Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you when I can.</i>

230
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,750
- Leon.
- Hey.

231
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,791
- Julius.
- Hey.

232
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
Rex loved you, man.

233
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,708
Thanks, pal.

234
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,708
I just, I can't believe… I just showed
my daughter footage of you jamming,

235
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,583
and it just brought back
so many nice memories.

236
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,916
You can't let 'em forget.

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,791
- Right, Stanley?
- No, no.

238
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,791
I'll let you old friends catch up.

239
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
- Okay. Stay well.
- Thank you.

240
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,541
- Nice touch with the suit.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,791
Leon, man, I can't believe this.

242
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,791
Anything you ever need, call me, man.

243
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,500
Yeah. I got to make the rounds.
I appreciate you.

244
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,583
- Love you, bro.
- Love you too, Leon.

245
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,916
Let's talk soon, 22.

246
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,791
Trying to think of something to say to you
besides "I'm sorry."

247
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,291
It doesn't seem enough.

248
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,541
I heard you're moving to the bench.

249
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,208
Uncle Connie's office.
Dad was so excited for you.

250
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,250
"We need a spark, Katherine."

251
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,625
No, man.

252
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,708
Your father,

253
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,625
he mentioned it to me years ago,
but with my past, you know,

254
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,625
I figured he'd rather forget about it.

255
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,333
He'd never forget about you, Sugerman.

256
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,208
So my brother's going to be
taking over the team.

257
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,166
You're bailing on us?

258
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,208
No, I'm gonna keep my seat on the board.

259
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,833
Vin's going to run the day-to-day.

260
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,791
- To your pops.
- To Rex.

261
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,958
He really wants this.

262
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,291
Come on, Haas, make him work.
Too easy, Haas, too easy!

263
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,250
- Come on, Haas.
- Whoa, whoa.

264
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,083
No, can't have your arm
straight like that.

265
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,333
Put your forearm into T's back, all right?

266
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,500
Dig it in there. Okay?
You decide where you want him to go.

267
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Like Jrue Holiday, bro.

268
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,000
Exactly. Take him out of his comfort zone.

269
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,666
- Huh? I don't understand what that is.
- Did you sleep last night at all?

270
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,916
- Do your work early.
- Let's go again.

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,875
- Ready?
- Okay.

272
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,958
- Come on, Haas. Make him work.
- Don't let him go baseline.

273
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,541
Hey, just focus.

274
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,500
- Go again!
- Make him work.

275
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,833
Hey, Stan. You got a minute?

276
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,458
You want me now?

277
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,916
- Yeah.
- All right.

278
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,375
How's he doing?

279
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,875
We're working on it.
He's young. We're going to get him there.

280
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,208
I fucked up. Shouldn't have drafted Haas.

281
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,666
- I wouldn't say that.
- To my face?

282
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,583
I would say it to your face.

283
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:29,166
My father always appreciated your honesty.
I'm working on it. I really am.

284
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,250
Cool.

285
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,833
I have one job,
to maximize this team's chances

286
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,833
of winning an NBA championship
by any means necessary.

287
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,375
Hell with the naysayers. Right?

288
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,708
You're not wrong.

289
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,708
I'm glad to hear you say that.

290
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,625
Got the Hawks' pick next year,
we can't afford to miss.

291
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
To be champion requires sacrifice.

292
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,166
Manu coming off the bench.
That's this. That's you.

293
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:58,541
You're valuable as a coach,
you're indispensable as a scout.

294
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,458
I don't want to be out there anymore.
I never wanted to be out there.

295
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,958
I'm not asking.

296
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,541
I haven't been home on my daughter's
birthday for nine years running, Vin.

297
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,541
Stan.

298
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,541
Find me that missing piece,
you're right back on the bench coaching.

299
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,125
So what you gonna do, Sugerbear?

300
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,083
What can I do?

301
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,708
Call Vin right now and say,

302
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,333
"Kiss my fat ass
and fuck your five-star hotels."

303
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,666
You don't need this.

304
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,708
It's not as simple as that.

305
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,500
How can such a beautiful woman
have such horrifying feet?

306
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,541
What is this yellow thing?

307
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,458
It's a callus from exercise.

308
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,916
Remember exercise?

309
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,500
So you're just gonna
give up on your dream?

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,291
<i>Guys in their 50s
don't have dreams.</i>

311
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,375
<i>They have nightmares and eczema.</i>

312
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:22,000
<i>There was only one guy who knew
what I was capable of, and he died.</i>

313
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,458
<i>Welcome to Mallorca, Spain.</i>

314
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,875
<i>The local temperature
is 30 degrees Celsius…</i>

315
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,916
<i>Yo, Double Deuce,
I heard you back on that road, man.</i>

316
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,416
<i>I'm in Spain too, with a client,
so let's have breakfast.</i>

317
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,333
Look at this pool. Check it out.

318
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,083
- No, I can't look at that.
- Yeah, you can.

319
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,750
No, that's going to get me in trouble.

320
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,333
- One look, just one look.
- No. I'll get in…

321
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,291
Teresa will kick the shit out of me.

322
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,833
I swear to God, I saw
a Victoria's Secret mannequin one time,

323
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,458
and T was pissed off at me.

324
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,458
I came to talk to you about something.

325
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,375
Okay.

326
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,583
Why don't you come
and just be an agent with me?

327
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,166
Got an open spot,
I got all the partners on board.

328
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,250
For me?

329
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,000
If I do that, then,

330
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,375
there's no room for growth.
I still want to coach.

331
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,708
This Philly thing,
there's room to grow there?

332
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,916
At least I'm still in the league,
you know.

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,958
Vin came to see me last week.

334
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,041
Talk about Zeke.

335
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,041
Talk about Zeke?
He's going one. We're out.

336
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,625
He could trade up,
package Embiid with that King's pick.

337
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,416
That idiot's talking about trading Embiid?
Are you kidding me?

338
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,583
Look, nobody's safe now.

339
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,583
Guy like Vin, he wants to put
his fingerprints on the team.

340
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,333
Just think about my offer, Deuce.

341
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,208
Yeah, I know.

342
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,083
- I appreciate you looking out for me.
- Always, man.

343
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,583
And do me a favor, please look
at these titties. I'll take the blame.

344
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,083
- Just check them out.
- All right.

345
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,250
- Those are my titties.
- Those are yours.

346
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,625
- Yeah.
- They actually kind of look like yours.

347
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,541
I'm about two sandwiches
away from those titties. Yeah.

348
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,208
So how long has our boy
been off the injury reserve list?

349
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,666
Garcia's knee's swollen.
He's not going to play.

350
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,791
Swollen. Not gonna play.
What am I doing here, then?

351
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,416
You don't wanna talk to Coach?

352
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,875
What's he gonna tell me?

353
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,375
There a place around here
I can shoot some hoop?

354
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,416
They can't guard me.

355
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,291
I'm guarding him.

356
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,083
I got him.

357
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,750
Who you guarding? Nobody!

358
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,208
Tie game! Next point wins!

359
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,875
Here's his chance.

360
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,583
Oh, my God!

361
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,083
- What's the big guy's name?
- I don't know.

362
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,416
You don't know?

363
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,333
That was a bullshit foul.

364
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,541
Give me my money.
That's my money. I won that match.

365
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,541
- That's not your money.
- Where's my money?

366
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,125
That's my money.

367
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,541
What do you mean <i>your</i> money?

368
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

369
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,708
What are you looking at?

370
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,250
Me?

371
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,625
- Do you know who I am?
- You're a nobody.

372
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,458
And you are shit.

373
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,375
You're a clown.

374
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:27,750
You big piece of shit.
Fouling me all game.

375
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,166
- You and me, one on one, right now.
- With those boots?

376
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,291
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,833
Twenty pavos for three shots.

378
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,125
Three shots, he'll never hit the rim.

379
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't do it!

380
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,666
The big dude is hustling you!

381
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,041
He's fucking scared.

382
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,750
There's one.

383
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:17,916
God damn.

384
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:32,958
That's it.

385
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,791
Yo, yo, yo!

386
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:57,833
<i>Amigo.</i>

387
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,708
Shit. Shit. Shit.

388
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,958
I haven't sprinted like that in 30 years.

389
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,333
Just waiting for my Achilles to pop.

390
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,958
Just…

391
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,708
<i>Uno momento.</i> I have an idea.

392
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:35,750
Are you really a construction worker,
or is that all part of the hustle?

393
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,958
I mean, I couldn't
take my eyes off of you.

394
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,041
It got me so excited.

395
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,666
You're a fantasy for a guy like me.

396
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,958
What? Did that sound dirty or something?

397
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:03,750
No, I didn't…

398
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,833
I didn't mean it like that.

399
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,916
I meant it like you're
an amazing basketball player.

400
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,291
Why you follow me here, you fucking crazy?

401
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

402
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,166
You understand English?

403
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,500
I am a scout with the Sixers.

404
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,458
You know the Sixers, correct?

405
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,666
Iverson, Barkley...

406
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,416
Uh… Mom… <i>Madre…</i> Hi.

407
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,333
<i>Mi nombre</i> Stanley Sugerman.

408
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:18,375
<i>Yo soy un</i> basketball scout.

409
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,041
<i>Trabajo,</i> eh, NBA…

410
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:27,416
<i>Hijo…</i> is <i>muy bien. Muy… Muy bien.</i>

411
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,250
She called me an old man.
Yes, I am an old man.

412
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,583
Is that your daughter?
I have a daughter. She's older.

413
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,208
She doesn't talk to me anymore.
Hang on. Hang on.

414
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,791
I have an idea. <i>Por favor.</i>

415
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,375
Let me just call…
I don't know what time it is there.

416
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,541
I hope he's there. Please, God, be there.

417
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,333
Please. Please, please pick up. Pick up.

418
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:52,916
God damn it.

419
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,541
<i>- Uh, hello?</i>
- Hey, Schnitzel. I'm in Spain.

420
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,541
I wanted you to meet somebody.

421
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,833
Dirk Nowitzki. See?

422
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:03,708
How's it going? How's the retirement home?

423
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,375
They still feeding you pudding?

424
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,833
<i>Who is this? How'd you get this number?</i>

425
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,291
Yes.
All right. I deserved that.

426
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,250
<i>I don't know you.</i>

427
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,750
<i>But I've never seen this man
before in my life.</i>

428
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,666
He's starting to believe you, Dirk.
Come on, help me out.

429
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,041
<i>Ah… I'm just kidding,
that's Stan the man right there.</i>

430
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,125
<i>He's a legend.</i>

431
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,958
<i>What's your name, kid?</i>

432
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,083
- Bo, Bo Cruz.
<i>- Where you play at, Bo Cruz?</i>

433
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,125
Nowhere. I just work construction.

434
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,625
<i>Not for long
if Stan is calling me about you.</i>

435
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,250
That's right. You see,
this is <i>mi amigo, amigo.</i>

436
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,625
Thank you so much, Dirk,
and say hi to your grandmother for me.

437
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,041
<i>My grandma died.</i>

438
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,375
That's right. You told me that. My bad.

439
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:02,166
There's 450 NBA players,
another 100 just waiting to get called up.

440
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,125
It's my job to know
every other great player in the world.

441
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,458
I'm very good at my job.

442
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,583
I never heard of you.

443
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,875
So tell me your whole story from the top.

444
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,416
- He was a very strong baby.
- Mama, no.

445
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,041
Good, I said from the top.
This is nice. Go ahead.

446
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,500
A very sweet boy.

447
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,291
When he was ten years old,

448
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,875
was his gym coach idea to do basketball.

449
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:28,416
And the club teams,
they want him to play football.

450
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,458
The gym coach was smart.

451
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,875
Soccer is awful.

452
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,416
But with basketball,
he played with the big kids

453
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,166
when he was still small.

454
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,791
Biggest hands, though.

455
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:45,291
They tease him.
The… The movie with the little alien.

456
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,458
Ehm…

457
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,750
Phone home.

458
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,083
<i>- E.T.</i>
- Yes. Very mean boys.

459
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,625
But also,

460
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,166
he kind of looked like an alien.

461
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,958
- I bet.
- He played every day.

462
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,208
After his father, well,

463
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,125
he went away. We don't have him anymore.

464
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,958
I'm sorry. Losing your dad at any age...

465
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,041
Oh, no, he's not lost.
He moved to Portugal with whore.

466
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,708
Mama, <i>la niña.</i>

467
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,458
What? It's true, she knows.
After his father left…

468
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,125
<i>Mi roble.</i>

469
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,416
<i>Roble? Que es "roble"?</i>

470
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
My strong oak tree.

471
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:28,500
Uh-huh.

472
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,583
He played basketball all his time,
so he no think of him.

473
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,166
He was invited to a club team
in America when he was 15,

474
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,791
but before he left, Lucia's mother

475
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,916
got pregnant.

476
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,875
- So he stayed here for Lucia.
- Right.

477
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,750
I'm gonna make a couple of calls
so I can see you play

478
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,708
with some guys on your level tomorrow.

479
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,166
I got to work.

480
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,000
How old are you?

481
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,083
- Twenty-two.
- Basketball years are like dog years.

482
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,958
We're gonna do this,
we actually got to do this now.

483
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,875
- And how much money will you pay him?
- To come to Philly?

484
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,458
It'll be a prorated league minimum.

485
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,833
But you say he was great.

486
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,958
For great, you pay the maximum, no?

487
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:18,583
Yeah. Yes, NBA contract
of any kind is maximum, no?

488
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:25,833
- And how much is the minimum?
- Minimum salary in the NBA is $900,000.

489
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,250
He will call in sick.

490
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,083
All right.
I'll text you the details in the morning.

491
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,833
What a pleasure.

492
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,166
Bo Cruz. Love the name.

493
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,083
Doing good, Stanley?
You look nervous.

494
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,375
I'm not nervous.
I'm just very excited, Coach.

495
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,833
When is your kid coming in?

496
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,583
Don't know. His bus must be running late.

497
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,791
He doesn't have a car.

498
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,250
Right on time.

499
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,375
Here's my man, the Cruz Missile.

500
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,791
- What?
- What?

501
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,125
You don't like that?
I thought you'd love that.

502
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,750
No? I'll keep thinking.

503
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,541
So I want you to meet Coach Scariolo.

504
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,833
- You know him. Spanish national team.
<i>- ¿Qué tal?</i>

505
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,083
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Bo Cruz.

506
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,375
Felipe. Álex.

507
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,583
These guys are being nice.
They're gonna let you play with 'em.

508
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,916
Willy, José, Pierre. Bo Cruz.

509
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,708
Go on down and get laced up,
stretch out a little bit.

510
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,291
We're going to have some fun.

511
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,458
You want to try?

512
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,541
Willy, you're off the team.

513
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,250
Yo, get some sneakers on.

514
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,500
Be careful.

515
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,833
- He can jump.
- Yeah, he can jump.

516
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:58,875
<i>You believe this?
He hit 44 out of 50 from the side pocket.</i>

517
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,250
<i>He's incredible!</i>

518
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,625
You watch the workout?

519
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,791
<i>Of course, I watched.
Kid's impressive.</i>

520
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,083
But there are other considerations.

521
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,791
Character, mentality.
Playing within a system.

522
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,416
I sound like you right now.

523
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,291
Vin, this kid is the new Freak.

524
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,750
He's a unicorn, a mythical creature.

525
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:20,375
The kid hasn't played
organized basketball in eight years.

526
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
There's a reason for that.

527
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,541
- Let's see what he can do in the G League.
<i>- You fucking play in the G League, Blake.</i>

528
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,083
All right, listen to me, Vin.

529
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,875
<i>Nobody knows about him.</i>

530
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,791
<i>You're going to see this guy,
you're gonna freak the fuck out.</i>

531
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,958
I promise you, you have to see him live.

532
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,208
It's not gonna happen, Stan.

533
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,875
I'm indispensable.

534
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,208
So valuable, right?

535
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,708
<i>You told me if I wanted to get back
on the bench to find the missing piece.</i>

536
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,625
Well, here I am delivering him
for no money.

537
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,041
And it's not gonna happen?

538
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,166
I pay you to find players,
not tell me what to do with them.

539
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
Pay me.

540
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,500
You got something to say, Stan?

541
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,750
<i>I don't understand.</i>

542
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,041
<i>It's all good. It's just they
don't have a roster spot at the moment,</i>

543
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,291
<i>but they love what they saw
and want to see more.</i>

544
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,750
And let's just say a spot doesn't open up,

545
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,500
we'll get your name in the draft.

546
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,208
So you play like you did yesterday,
at the combine, you'll be a lock.

547
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,916
They still pay me to come.

548
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
They'll pay you for sure.

549
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,625
It might not come at once,
but you'll get the money.

550
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,125
- I promise you.
- Okay.

551
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,666
Giant body like yours
on an eight-hour flight is gonna be rough.

552
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,333
You'll take my seat, okay?

553
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,416
- Oh, really?
- Okay. Yeah, no problem.

554
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,083
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

555
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,708
<i>I'd like to welcome everyone aboard
Flight 718. We're currently cruising at…</i>

556
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,333
Psst, Stanley. Stanley. Here.

557
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,958
Look what I got.

558
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,708
- Oh, yes.
- They are warm.

559
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,333
- That's good.
- You want some?

560
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:23,833
Uh… I don't want to start a riot
back here. It's cool, thanks.

561
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,166
- One bite?
- No, I'm trying not to, badly.

562
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,625
- It's really good.
- Just give me a fucking roll. Thank you.

563
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:39,541
Next, please.

564
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,500
Sir, I need you to come with me.

565
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,541
Oh, hey, that's my kid.

566
00:36:56,125 --> 00:37:01,000
Yo, excuse me.
No, no, he's with me. He's with me.

567
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,666
What's up, Oscar? What happened?

568
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,541
He got flagged
for an aggravated assault charge.

569
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,083
Beat up a guy pretty bad five years ago.

570
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,958
- Ah, Jesus.
- He needs to be very careful.

571
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,875
He goes in front of a judge
for even running a stop sign,

572
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,958
he can get his visa permanently revoked.

573
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,666
Right. Okay.

574
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,666
Are you looking at him for the draft?

575
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,875
Yeah. We're all very excited about him.
This is something I should have caught.

576
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,125
I don't want the team
paying for my mistake.

577
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,875
So keep this between us.
I'll cover your hours.

578
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,958
No problem. Just bring us back home
a championship, right?

579
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,458
- Will do, Oscar.
- Good.

580
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,541
Thank you.

581
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,250
Fuck.

582
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,166
Anything else you need to tell me?
Now is the time.

583
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,666
We all have stuff from our past,

584
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,625
but having a criminal record's
a pretty big detail to leave out.

585
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:05,000
No more secrets
from now on, all right?

586
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,333
No big deal, moving on.

587
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,458
I got you this,

588
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,083
for local and international calls.

589
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,750
You can talk to your daughter anytime.

590
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,375
- Thanks, Stanley.
- Philadelphia, baby.

591
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,083
You're gonna love it.
Best sports fans in the world.

592
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,708
Actually the worst,
but that's what makes 'em the best.

593
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,083
He's at that hotel
all by himself?

594
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,041
Yeah.
He wanted to call his daughter.

595
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,875
I gave him money. He's settling in.

596
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,500
So when are you taking this,
what's his name again?

597
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,500
Bo Cruz.

598
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,750
When are you taking Bo
across the river to train with the team?

599
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,500
I don't know
if I want to give them this guy yet.

600
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,083
Just wanna make sure
I do what's right for the kid.

601
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,875
What?

602
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,208
The Sixers don't know you stashed him.

603
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:09,000
You don't get it. The kid is like
if Scottie Pippen and a wolf had a baby.

604
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:12,083
So what are you saying?
He has a hairy face.

605
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,666
I'm saying if this kid puts it together,

606
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,125
when he puts it together,
he will be top ten in the league.

607
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,541
And being the guy who finds the guy
matters in this business.

608
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,833
- Won't Vince fire you for this?
- T…

609
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:29,250
The kid is… special.

610
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,666
Okay.

611
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,416
With the cheese or with the whole thing?

612
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Yeah?

613
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:44,166
You should have stopped me again.
This is fucking atrocious.

614
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,916
Yeah.

615
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,875
You're looking for the big man?
He ain't here.

616
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,625
- Where is he?
- Make a right on 13th.

617
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,416
Hey, what are you doing?

618
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,333
Careful, please.

619
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,125
All right, that's it. That's it.

620
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,708
Take your money.

621
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,291
Goodness.

622
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,750
I see. We're not here to hustle, man.

623
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,625
Why not?

624
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,666
Let's go.

625
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,083
Good Lord.

626
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,208
- Why?
- Hey, Stanley.

627
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,375
Have you ever tried these Ishkabibble's?

628
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,250
Oh, my God.

629
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:52,125
Yeah, but you got five cheese steaks.

630
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,875
Yeah, but each one is different.

631
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,416
But you only took
one bite of each one.

632
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,750
You take one bite and you don't eat
it all, because if not, you get fat.

633
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,666
Why did you look at me when you said that?

634
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,416
- Come on, Stanley, I don't say that.
- Okay.

635
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,916
What the fuck did you do to the minibar?

636
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,875
Sixers are paying, don't worry.

637
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,916
Yes, but we don't eat $9 Pringles.
A man must have a code.

638
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,583
I literally eat one chip.
They are not that good.

639
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,791
It's still $9.
They don't charge you per chip.

640
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:23,416
Okay. Anyways, I got some good news.

641
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,541
- Um, an old friend, Leon Rich…
- Leon Rich who played for Timberwolves?

642
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,625
Right. We played together in college.

643
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:34,000
He's a power agent now, and he's in Philly
with a few of his guys for an open run.

644
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,625
Like, who are these guys?

645
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,333
College kids.
NBA prospects getting ready for the draft.

646
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,916
It's a scrimmage,
but it gets serious out there.

647
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,958
So it's like a real tryout?

648
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,666
No, no, no.

649
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:50,416
It's just a showcase, not a big deal,
just a step in the process.

650
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,208
The whole idea is to give
young bucks a place to shine.

651
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,333
So you're just gonna go out there,
and you're gonna shine, Bo Cruz.

652
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,291
Okay, let's go.

653
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,166
Stanley.

654
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,791
Come here.

655
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,166
- Hey, Matisse, Kyle.
- 'Sup?

656
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,041
Bo. This is Vin Merrick.
He's co-owner of the Sixers,

657
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,000
but he basically runs the team.

658
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,291
And Leon Rich, basically,
he runs the world.

659
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,708
The Double Deuce
told me a lot about you, man.

660
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, yeah, Bo Cruz.

661
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:43,750
We certainly have heard a lot about you
from Stanley, and Oscar Morales.

662
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,250
Our in-house counsel,
he met you at the airport.

663
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,541
Yeah, they met. Go get laced up, bud.

664
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,500
- Huge fan.
- Thanks, man.

665
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,708
- How you know he's talking about you?
- Come on.

666
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,458
Sorry, but I had to bring him.

667
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,833
You're going to see why
after you watch the kid play.

668
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,916
Good luck.

669
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,791
Appreciate it.

670
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,000
Fellas.

671
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,416
What is Kermit Wilts doing here?
The guy's a lock at two.

672
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,208
He thinks he should be number one.

673
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,875
He can shoot from anywhere.
Just stay with him wherever he goes.

674
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,875
Don't let him score in bunches.
Don't let him get hot. Okay?

675
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:29,666
He's here to show off.
Use that. Get physical with him.

676
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,166
You give Kermit Wilts the business, your
whole world's going to change overnight.

677
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,250
You got this shit, go get it.

678
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:46,958
Best of luck out there, man.

679
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,625
- What's your name?
- Bo.

680
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,583
Bo. I like that.
Strong, strong like a bull.

681
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,958
Let's give these people a show.
What do you say, Bo?

682
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,250
So, where are you from?

683
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,541
Spain.

684
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,458
Shit sounds wack.

685
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,250
Y'all like bull fights over there, right?

686
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,291
So, here's what's going to happen.
You're the bull.

687
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:14,916
I'm the motherfucker with a cape running
your big dumb ass in circles. That's cool.

688
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:16,833
Let's get it.

689
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,375
Get up on him, baby.

690
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,958
Stay with him.

691
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,083
We're good.

692
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:44,916
Right here.

693
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,500
Go ahead, make something happen.

694
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,250
That's it. Yes, sir.

695
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,666
- Who's this?
- Stan brought him.

696
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,083
Nice vision.

697
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,750
Welcome to America.

698
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,250
Hey, hey.

699
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,666
I don't need no help.

700
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,208
That's it. Nice.

701
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:32,125
I like... I like him. I like him.

702
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,000
This is gonna be good.

703
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,583
He's got a lot of length.
Does he have any control?

704
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,416
- Yeah!
- Nice swat! Way to get after it.

705
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,333
Good D.

706
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,625
Finna hit you with a hazy, cross sidestep.

707
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,708
Think you can stop me?

708
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,541
Yeah!

709
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,583
Stan's kid getting a lesson here.

710
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,458
You're good. Don't come over here.

711
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,541
- Shit.
- He's like a giraffe on roller skates.

712
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,750
Shake that off. Shake it off.

713
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,333
You get it, right?

714
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,000
Step back three.
Really can't guard me, bro.

715
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,458
Damn, you slow.

716
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,291
- Hey, let's take a seat for a minute.
- No.

717
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,375
Just give yourself a breather.

718
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,666
Listen to him.
Listen to your daddy.

719
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,000
Here comes a brick.

720
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,291
Oh, yeah!

721
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,416
You can see it's getting to his head.

722
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,833
- Oh! It's okay.
- I think the game's too fast for him.

723
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,083
Nothing.

724
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,583
Move out the way.

725
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:17,958
All right, kid.

726
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,458
<i>Olé,</i> bitch!

727
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,958
Shit.

728
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,541
He had his moments. I saw it.

729
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,958
That wasn't him.
That wasn't even close to him.

730
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,166
It's my fault.
I rushed this whole thing.

731
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,000
Remember our freshman year,
we were playing at Gonzaga,

732
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,750
they put John Stockton on me?

733
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,416
You said watch out for this guy.
I said nobody looking like

734
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,333
an insurance salesman
going to bust my ass.

735
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,458
Midway through the second half,
20 points, 20 assists.

736
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:03,291
- None of y'all would look at me. Remember?
- I remember.

737
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,208
Remember me playing like that again?

738
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,875
No, 'cause I never wanted
to feel that feeling again.

739
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,041
So tonight's a good thing.

740
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,166
Nothing was good about tonight.

741
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,083
That was some awful…

742
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,708
- Wanna grab some din-din?
- I got to catch a plane.

743
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:21,041
You're gonna have to pick up the tab
on the Spanish kid. I'm not interested.

744
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,208
Time to get back out there
and keep looking.

745
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,375
You're gonna miss
another one of your daughter's birthdays.

746
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,583
The Sixers will send
something nice for her.

747
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:37,500
Hey, I never asked you
to pick up the tab on him, Vincent.

748
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,666
Frankly, I'm not interested

749
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,083
in working for a smug,
born-on-third fucking bitch.

750
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,208
So how's this?

751
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:50,041
Kiss my fat ass,
and fuck your five-star hotels.

752
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,500
I quit.

753
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,916
So Stanley's not coming to dinner?

754
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,875
I really wish he was now.

755
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,208
Stanley knows
how to fuck up his life.

756
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,083
Another bad decision in the books.

757
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,208
The combine's in six weeks.

758
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,958
Can you get my guy in?

759
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:25,916
I'll work on it.

760
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,916
Don't have a heart attack, man.
Come on, 22.

761
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,916
I fly home tomorrow.

762
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,375
Is that what you want to do?

763
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,041
You come all this way,

764
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:47,500
have one bad day,
and you're ready to back down?

765
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:50,583
- No, but I suck.
- Do you love this game?

766
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,833
Love it with your whole heart?

767
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,500
Because if you don't,
let's not even bother.

768
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,750
Let's not open that door.
They're gonna slam it right in our face.

769
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,833
I love this game. I live this game.

770
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:12,791
And there's 1,000 other guys waiting in
the wings who are obsessed with this game.

771
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,708
Obsession is gonna beat talent every time.

772
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:21,875
You've got all the talent in the world,
but are you obsessed?

773
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,583
Is it all you ever think about?

774
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,916
Let's face it,
it's you against you out there.

775
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:33,125
When you walk on that court, you have
to think, "I am the best guy out there."

776
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,958
"I don't care if LeBron's playing."

777
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,625
So let me ask you again.
Do you love this game?

778
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,833
Yes.

779
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,666
Is there a newborn kitten
purring in here right now?

780
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,791
I couldn't hear you.

781
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,291
- Do you want to be in the NBA?
- Yes!

782
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:53,875
Let's make that happen.

783
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,375
Never back down.

784
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,416
Hello.

785
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,791
Buenos días, <i>Bo Cruz.</i>
<i>I'm out front.</i>

786
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,041
Stanley, it's 4:10, man.

787
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,375
Come on downstairs.
Bring your shit.

788
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,916
Kobe used to get up at 4:00 a.m.
so he could practice before practice.

789
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,333
I got you a gift.

790
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,250
- Kobes.
- That's right, for inspiration.

791
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,041
Let's get to work.

792
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,041
The combine's in a month and a half.

793
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:45,208
It's a televised game, so the whole
world's gonna get to see you play.

794
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:46,500
We got to get you ready.

795
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,666
So you see this hill?

796
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,875
Average professional biker can get
to the top of this hill in two minutes.

797
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:58,125
We're gonna come out here every morning
till you get the top, running, minute-45.

798
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,375
- Shit.
- Yeah.

799
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,541
And three, two, one.

800
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,958
Let's go. Move it, kid. Yup.

801
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,375
Looking good.

802
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,833
That's it, man. That's it. I like it.

803
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:11,916
Go, go, go!

804
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,208
Pump it.

805
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,166
Pump those arms.

806
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:24,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Don't stop. To the top.

807
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,166
Oh, we're going to be here
a lot, bud. Let's go!

808
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:38,291
Keep going, come on. Find it in you.

809
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:43,041
You got to push it, bro.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna hit your heels.

810
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:46,416
Oh, my goodness gracious.

811
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,875
Okay. All right, so that's time.

812
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,500
I had no idea
this stopwatch went that high.

813
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm not shitting you.

814
00:52:56,083 --> 00:53:00,041
When we were teaching my daughter to walk,
she got up this hill faster than you.

815
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,458
Just get in the car.

816
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,500
Whew. We've got a lot of work to do, baby.

817
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,666
Ah, you're getting sweat in my Malibu.

818
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,750
Oh, all right.

819
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,125
Bo.

820
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,333
Hi. This is my daughter, Alex.

821
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:23,083
- This is Bo.
- Nice to meet you.

822
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,291
- Hi.
- She's going to be shooting us today.

823
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,958
Are you ready, kid?

824
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,708
- Alex.
- Yes.

825
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,375
All right. All right.
I've never seen her like that.

826
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,458
That was funny.

827
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,916
All right.

828
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,000
Get this.
Alex, get this round. Initiate contact.

829
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,833
Don't get jammed. Get past that.

830
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,750
Drive. Use your legs. Downhill.
Down. Finish...

831
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,666
Come on. All right.

832
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,958
Your first year in the league, no calls.

833
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,166
You need a hand up?

834
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,208
Get out of here. Don't look so sad.

835
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:53,250
Go ahead. Zoom in
on that sad face of his right now.

836
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,250
I want you to finish through it. Let's go.

837
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,458
All right,
shoulders down, that's right. Go!

838
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,541
Okay. All right.

839
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,958
You absorbed the contact. I need you
to finish through the contact.

840
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:06,541
Alex, you get that?
Okay, we're getting there. Go, go, go!

841
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:10,000
Cut. Move. Go downhill!
All the way, now finish it.

842
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,708
Oh! That's how you take it to the rim.

843
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,541
What happened? Were you on me?
Always on the money, sweetheart.

844
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:17,625
Good God.

845
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,708
He is mad because he's hungry.

846
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,416
What'd he say?
Because I'm what? He made a fat joke?

847
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
- He's special.
- Special, right?

848
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:36,458
- What's that baby chick about?
- Um…

849
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,458
That's for my daughter, Lucia.

850
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,833
We call her <i>Pollito.</i>
It means little chicken.

851
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:43,208
So all these are for my mom
and my daughter.

852
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,666
They mean everything to me.

853
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,875
- What about your dad?
- All these are for him.

854
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:53,701
<i>Don't think, react!</i>

855
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,291
- She did it.
- She's good with camera.

856
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:59,291
She's good. She didn't have to put
her name on your… But that's fine.

857
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,291
<i>Okay. This ain't Europe, baby.</i>

858
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,166
<i>It gets quick here. Offense takes skill.</i>

859
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,125
<i>Defense takes balls, baby. That's right.</i>

860
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,000
<i>Oh! Stop that shit!</i>

861
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,375
<i>Game gets quick! Okay, here we go!</i>

862
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,583
<i>Oh!</i>

863
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,041
<i>- Took the charge!
- Come on! Hell fuckin' yeah!</i>

864
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,125
So, how do you think you did?

865
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,458
They scored a couple times,
but I think I did pretty good.

866
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,541
Three guys were running at you full tilt
for five minutes straight,

867
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,125
and they scored a couple times.

868
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,708
You crushed it.

869
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,791
The only thing in your way
is that big brain of yours.

870
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,375
You're sensitive.
I get that. I'm sensitive too.

871
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,541
I cried at the end of <i>Titanic,</i>
but I'm not in the NBA.

872
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,083
You? You can never be soft again.

873
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,750
- I'm not soft.
- Please.

874
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,666
Kermit, a guy named after a frog,
said some mean words to you,

875
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,125
and you wanted
to take your ball and run home.

876
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,583
It was a trick.
It's never gonna happen again.

877
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,458
- Nothing he said bothered you?
- No.

878
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,666
- Kermit?
- Okay, my bad.

879
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,458
<i>I'm</i> over thinking it, I guess.

880
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:59,958
So, uh, take 20 threes. Every miss,
you're gonna run the bleachers.

881
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,208
Oh, nice.

882
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:11,583
Nice.

883
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:13,541
- Your mom's a whore.
- What?

884
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,500
- What?
- What was that?

885
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:19,500
- Just said some words. That's it. Hey.
- It's not cool, man.

886
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,166
What are you still
standing here for? Let's go.

887
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,500
You know what's not cool?

888
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:27,333
A grown man letting another
grown man hurt his feelings.

889
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:30,916
Players are gonna try to get in your head
every time you step on the court.

890
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,958
You gotta be an iceberg out there,

891
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:37,166
all floating around
and sharp and taking down ships.

892
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,875
When I played college ball,
every time I took a shot,

893
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:43,583
somebody tried to insult me.
They called me short or slow or chubby.

894
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,750
- You know what I did?
- What'd you do?

895
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,458
I started passing
'cause I couldn't shoot for shit.

896
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,333
But you don't want my career.

897
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,541
You wanna be Bo Cruz,
All-Star, Hall-of-Famer.

898
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,958
So, let's do this.

899
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,500
Your sweat smells like piss.

900
00:56:58,208 --> 00:56:59,583
Good. Good. Good.

901
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,208
Son of a thousand sluts.

902
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:04,458
Stanley been working on his Spanish.

903
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,458
Yeah. Right. I looked it up
so I can insult you, my friend.

904
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:10,041
Get fucked by a fish, dumb-ass.

905
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,541
- I love it.
- Yeah. All right. Good.

906
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:16,000
- Your mom's not a whore, by the way.
- Thank you.

907
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,083
Yeah. Whores get paid.
She gives that fat ass out for free.

908
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,958
What?

909
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,208
Come on! We're building a callus!

910
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,458
Get outta here!

911
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,375
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

912
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,125
Smells good.

913
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,583
What's all this?

914
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:43,708
Two hundred dollars' worth of Pringles?
These are meals for the week.

915
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:46,333
Tell him to rinse the containers,
so I can reuse them.

916
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:49,750
And also, tell him
pornography is free on the Internet.

917
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,166
He's paying for porno?

918
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,166
And who is Paula Serrano?

919
00:57:56,208 --> 00:58:00,708
- You've been wiring her $500 a week.
- "Paola." Paola's Bo's mother.

920
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:05,958
They live check-to-check, so I had to.
He's got a daughter to support.

921
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,791
- You got a daughter to support.
- Right.

922
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,708
Just tell him
to pump the brakes on the Pringles.

923
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,541
At least until the Sixers
start picking up the tab.

924
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:19,291
Yeah, so I wanna talk to you
about the tab.

925
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,416
It's gonna be fine. Don't worry.

926
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,416
Worry? Why would I worry?

927
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,208
You're just unemployed, spending money
on some man I've never...

928
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:31,083
- He's an investment.
- We don't have money to invest.

929
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,250
You told me to quit.

930
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:34,625
And I meant it until you actually did it.

931
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,750
- Now I'm freaked out.
- Well, I'm not.

932
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,250
I know what I'm doing.
You'll see. I'll show you.

933
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,083
Yeah, you do that.

934
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:51,500
Hey! Hey! Hey!

935
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,375
Rise and shine, Marine!

936
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:55,416
Sorry. Sorry.

937
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,333
Okay.

938
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,291
Stanley, what you want, man?

939
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,000
It's 3:30.

940
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,083
There's two weeks left to the combine.
We gotta get rolling.

941
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,916
What happened here?
Was there something wrong with this?

942
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:11,208
- I told you, just one bite.
- On a $40 steak?

943
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,333
You're gonna throw $39 away. I don't know.

944
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,750
Here. This is for you.

945
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:20,041
- What's this?
- That's your meals for the week.

946
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,333
My wife made them, so they're healthy.
You can eat the whole thing.

947
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:26,625
I got a notice from accounting.
Scale back on the room service.

948
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,750
- I'm sorry, Stanley. I didn't mean...
- No. It's all good.

949
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,791
They also mentioned
they'd love you to stop with the porno.

950
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:35,041
Porno? It wasn't me.

951
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,708
Then who was it?

952
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,000
Okay, it was me. Fuck.

953
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:44,333
Get ready. Downstairs.
Five minutes. All right?

954
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:47,000
We'll have fun,
but we're gonna kick your ass today.

955
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,916
Try not to whack off while I'm gone.

956
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:54,625
Okay.

957
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,416
So, what happened to your hand?

958
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
My hand?

959
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:03,291
It was a freak thing. Car accident.
A long time ago. No more stalling.

960
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,375
Run.

961
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:10,500
- Always running.
- Go get 'em.

962
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:16,916
Okay.

963
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,291
We'll work on you driving in
and escaping out.

964
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,583
So as you take the cone in
and place it down,

965
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:25,125
those fans are gonna blow it at you,
so you gotta escape trouble, quick.

966
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,833
Yeah, I know it's tough.

967
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,833
Knees up! Let's go!

968
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,541
Okay. Bring out the big guy.

969
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:36,708
You gotta work on your precision,
hit small targets out there.

970
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:39,041
We gotta get right through this.
Don't think about it.

971
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,208
Go, go, go, go.

972
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,750
Down low. Athletic. Athletic. Athletic.

973
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,958
Come on. Yeah.
Let's go. You're an athlete.

974
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,083
Let's turn it around.

975
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,166
Go! Go!

976
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,291
Eh!

977
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:55,000
2:22.
It's you against you out there.

978
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,083
And right now, you is kicking your ass.

979
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,958
Go! Go! Move it!

980
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,541
Let's go, baby!

981
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,250
Push. Let's go! Yes!

982
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:18,750
Come on! Forty seconds.
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

983
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,750
Yeah. Stay low.
Low. Low. Low. Low.

984
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:26,541
Hands and feet work together.
You're thinking too much.

985
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,083
Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey.

986
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,000
Gotta do this in under five.
Remember that.

987
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:31,833
Come on. Pound it.

988
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,875
Oh!

989
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,041
Run for me. Let's go.

990
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,125
Yep! That's it!

991
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,958
Get outta the fucking road!

992
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:50,000
Push it! Catch that prick!

993
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:53,833
We'll get there.

994
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,750
Let's go again.

995
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,875
The hips low. Yeah. Right. Use that.

996
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:02,208
- <i>¡Vamos!</i>
- Hey. Let's go.

997
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:06,166
I don't care about that shot.
It's about the next shot.

998
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,416
And the next shot. And the next shot.

999
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,541
Okay. Yes, sir.

1000
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:17,416
Now, see how he explodes.
Explodes. You gotta explode right off.

1001
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,583
Yeah, that's it.

1002
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:21,541
All right.

1003
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,166
That's it, all in the wrist.
Come on. Lower the hip.

1004
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,375
Feel the fire. God damn it, yes.

1005
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,958
Push! Go right through him! That's it!

1006
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:40,083
Track two. Go.
Push this little asshole, come on!

1007
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,916
Yeah!

1008
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,875
We're moving forward.
Let's go again, though.

1009
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:55,375
Hard, hard. Nah, you don't have
to put it down so soft.

1010
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,833
It'll be okay.

1011
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,625
Let's go again. Let's go again.

1012
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:02,583
Let's go. Come on! Come on! Come on!

1013
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,083
Keep going to the top!
You're not done.

1014
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,291
Pass clean. Pass clean.

1015
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,000
Come on, man. Easy.

1016
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:14,291
You're running
out of steam, pal!

1017
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,750
What are you gonna say to him?

1018
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,208
Nothing, kid.
He's gotta tell himself.

1019
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:47,791
Settle.

1020
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,083
Come on, man.

1021
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,583
Let's go. Back in.
Back in. Back in. Back in.

1022
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:55,125
No stopping. No quitting.
No quitting. Let's go.

1023
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:58,416
Let's go. That's it.
Right through. Right out.

1024
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,958
Come on. Think about it.
Let's go. Down now.

1025
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,750
Right through. Finish that shit.
Whoa! That was nice. Okay.

1026
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:09,166
- Switch it back. Getting good, bud.
- Almost, Stanley! Almost! Cool!

1027
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,375
- You're getting good. Let's go.
- Pretty close.

1028
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,375
Better than yesterday, baby.

1029
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,000
Ah! You're crispy today, <i>cabrón!</i>

1030
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,875
A good player knows where he is on court.

1031
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,718
A great player knows
where everybody else is.

1032
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:32,333
Get to it. Get to it. That's it. Go. Go.

1033
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:35,708
To the red. Then to me. Let's pick it up.
You got to be faster.

1034
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:38,333
Look good, man! Cruz-ing!

1035
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,250
All right, Bo. You always wanna be low
and have good balance.

1036
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,291
Guess who? Attack! Step back! And finish!

1037
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,666
- Good.
- Always staying low.

1038
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,000
Stay low. Handle the pressure.
Let's go. Grab that.

1039
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:52,125
You can get more than that.
That's it. Stay strong.

1040
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,708
Good. Good. Good.

1041
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:58,541
- Hey! Be bold, man! Be bold!
- Yeah, baby.

1042
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,291
Go! Don't stop, baby! Go!

1043
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,500
Right through it! And, Bo!

1044
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,458
2:01! We're getting there, baby!
We're on the right track. Let's go!

1045
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,750
- Eight, nine.
<i>- ¡Mi roble!</i> Let's go! <i>¡Mi roble!</i>

1046
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:16,958
Damn. Smells like a truck full of shit
emptied itself into your mouth.

1047
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:21,375
Nothing affects this young man.
I like that. Hey. Nice.

1048
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:23,291
I'm gonna catch those feet!

1049
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,666
Oh, look how scared he is!

1050
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,208
No stopping.
Got nothing for you.

1051
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,916
That's what I'm talking about.

1052
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,708
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

1053
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:47,458
You know how much I love that.
Hard work, baby.

1054
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:50,125
<i>I knew when I saw you.
That's a hardworking fool.</i>

1055
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:52,416
<i>- You're going somewhere.
- We're going together.</i>

1056
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,041
We're going together. Whoo!

1057
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:58,333
Okay, good. Look around. Who's open?
Be patient. Now! Attack! Go! Go! Go!

1058
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,791
Okay, retreat.
Yeah, that's good, man. That's it. Wait.

1059
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,541
You'll find times you go down there,
and nothing's open, wait, you'll find it.

1060
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,750
You're hot, baby! You're hot.

1061
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,958
Bo Cruz coming down!

1062
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:13,375
- Low, yeah...
- Gotta make passes under pressure.

1063
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,875
That's it! Okay, nice.
We're cooking. Last one.

1064
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:20,166
Push it!
Get into the next gear! Go! Go! Go!

1065
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,958
Jimmy Butler's up on you.
Now what? Now what?

1066
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:25,458
We're doing this
'cause nobody else is doing this.

1067
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,041
Come on! Whoo!

1068
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,083
That's it. Back. Pass.

1069
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:32,041
Let's go, Bo.
Finish that. Come on now, Bo!

1070
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,750
Good, Bo! Yeah, Bo!
Use that clock! Use that clock!

1071
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:38,291
Find a shooter! That's it! Hit that!

1072
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:39,291
Whoo!

1073
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,791
You're ahead, baby! Now!

1074
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:44,125
On your right! Kick his ass!

1075
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,041
Leave him in the dust! That's right!

1076
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,541
Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!

1077
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:53,791
Yeah! Yeah, suck it, baby!

1078
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:56,833
Go! You're gonna get this!
You're gonna get this!

1079
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:01,500
That's it, brother! Yes, sir!

1080
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:05,666
Minute forty-four
with room to spare, baby! Yes!

1081
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,625
The Cruz Missile!

1082
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,416
You know you like that!

1083
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,958
Look at him go!

1084
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:15,791
That a baby!

1085
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:16,916
Stanley!

1086
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,666
We did it!

1087
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,250
Yeah! Rocky!

1088
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,625
- Yeah!
- Love it!

1089
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:40,125
For God's sake,
get the kid more butter.

1090
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,750
I mean, it's almost
the whole stick of butter.

1091
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,291
Hey.

1092
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:47,208
What do you think
of the Cruz Missile as a nickname for...

1093
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,875
- The Cruz...
- He doesn't like it.

1094
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,250
That nickname is stupid.

1095
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,625
He says it's stupid.

1096
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:54,041
Don't be rude.

1097
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,875
- So, do you have any pictures of Lucia?
- I miss her so much.

1098
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,166
Aw!

1099
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,166
She has your eyes.

1100
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,500
Yeah. She does. They're beautiful.

1101
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,750
Easy, tiger.

1102
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,500
No.

1103
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,000
So, have you ever been
away from her this long?

1104
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,458
- I've never been away from her.
- Never? Oh, my goodness.

1105
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:19,333
So, anyway, Mrs. Sugerman,
tell me how you met this guy.

1106
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:23,666
- "How'd she become so lucky?" He's asking.
- Okay. All right. Story time.

1107
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:29,583
So, I was on the women's track team,
and we had a meet at Virginia Tech,

1108
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:34,625
and it was the same time
that the men's basketball team had a game.

1109
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,833
And, unfortunately for us,
our bus broke down. So…

1110
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,458
Mm-hmm. I paid the bus driver.

1111
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:44,041
We had to bum a ride home
with those fools.

1112
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:48,708
Stanley sat next to me
for three hours, the entire ride home,

1113
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,666
and he didn't say one word.

1114
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,708
I didn't think
she wanted to talk to me. I was scared.

1115
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:56,000
And then, as everybody is walking off,

1116
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,916
he just says crazy loud,
"One day, I'm gonna marry you,

1117
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,375
and we're gonna have
very athletic children!"

1118
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:04,875
- I'm like, "What?"
- You really say that?

1119
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,625
I did. Yeah, it worked. Right?
Look, I do. We both have a…

1120
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:11,416
- Well, not athletic at all...
- Hey! What the heck?

1121
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,750
- Not even badminton. Not Frisbee.
- Okay.

1122
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,416
Playing checkers, she falls down.

1123
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
- I'm just saying.
- Oh, my God.

1124
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:20,833
- Oh, my God!
- That was when you played at Temple?

1125
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,291
I played at Temple. Yeah.
How'd you know that?

1126
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,625
Come on, Stanley.
You follow me to my home,

1127
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,291
offer me, like, crazy money,

1128
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,583
you don't think
I'll look you up on Internet?

1129
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,916
Number 22. Double Deuce.

1130
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,333
Uh-huh!

1131
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,083
Somebody did his homework,
unlike somebody else.

1132
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:39,875
Well, Stan can ball.
You do know he can handle the rock.

1133
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,500
- Stanley?
- If he didn't get hurt,

1134
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,791
- it'd have been a different story.
- Who wants coffee?

1135
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,541
- You want coffee? I'll get coffee.
- Spanish coffee, please.

1136
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:50,166
Okay. I'm gonna go to Spain.
I'll be right back, guys.

1137
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:03,666
Yo. Leon.
Thanks for getting back so quickly.

1138
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,625
<i>I'm sorry. The list is locked.</i>

1139
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:08,791
<i>What? I thought you said
you could get it done.</i>

1140
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,291
You should've told me about all this shit
before I called all around the league,

1141
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,541
<i>vouching for this guy.</i>

1142
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,000
Shit. What? What shit you talking about?

1143
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:19,541
<i>He's got an assault charge.
And Vince is all over TV talking about it.</i>

1144
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:24,083
<i>And joining us now,
the co-owner of the 76ers, Vince Merrick.</i>

1145
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,208
<i>- Vince, thanks for being here tonight.
- Thanks for having me.</i>

1146
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,875
<i>So, Vince, is it true
the Sixers brought in Bo Cruz,</i>

1147
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,666
<i>who has a history of assault,
to play in the combine?</i>

1148
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,333
<i>No. Bo Cruz has no affiliation
with the 76ers.</i>

1149
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:41,208
<i>He was brought over here by
a disgruntled employee, Stanley Sugerman.</i>

1150
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,916
<i>I specifically told Mr. Sugerman
not to bring him over.</i>

1151
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,791
<i>He lied to the organization
and to this young man.</i>

1152
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,916
<i>Mr. Sugerman's selfish behavior
has been part of his track record.</i>

1153
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,208
<i>He's been let go.
He's no longer part of the 76ers.</i>

1154
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,625
<i>Vince, we loved your father.
Thank you for bringing this story to us.</i>

1155
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,708
Hey, Bo. Just get in the car, man.
Let me talk to you.

1156
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:20,416
What are you gonna do?
Walk to Spain? Just please, let me...

1157
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,375
- You fucking lied to me!
- I know.

1158
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,416
- You lied to me.
- All right. He's all right.

1159
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,583
I quit my job for you!
You said "trust," and I fucking trust you.

1160
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,291
- I'm sorry.
- You gambled with my life!

1161
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:32,000
- It wasn't a gamble. It was a sure thing.
- It's fucking over.

1162
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,458
You and me is fucking over!
You hear me? Over!

1163
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,375
Hey. No. Just stop. Right now. Please.

1164
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,833
Don't throw it all away.

1165
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,375
I'm begging you, just let go of me.
Get in the car. It's not worth it.

1166
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,875
I'm not worth it. Just stop. Okay.

1167
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,000
All right. Get in the car.

1168
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,250
- Everything okay here?
- Hey, guys. Yeah. Everything's good.

1169
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,500
When Lucia was two…

1170
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,333
Her mom, Maria, asked me for her.

1171
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,583
She didn't wanna share custody anymore.

1172
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,333
I asked her, "Why?"

1173
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,500
She told me it was her boyfriend.

1174
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:35,083
He told her they can get money
from the government if she got Lucia.

1175
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:38,916
So…

1176
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,291
I went to his home.

1177
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,958
I swear, I just wanna talk to him.

1178
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,000
I know I make a mistake.

1179
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,916
But I'm not how they say I am.

1180
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:57,791
I get it.

1181
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,791
You don't get shit, man.

1182
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:06,416
You live in your perfect world,
with your perfect family.

1183
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Mm.

1184
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,791
One night, after a game at Villanova,
we went to a party.

1185
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,375
Me and Leon.

1186
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:32,250
And on the way home, I…

1187
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,125
I had a few drinks in me.

1188
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,833
I looked down at the radio.

1189
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,708
When I looked back up,
I saw a telephone pole.

1190
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,875
I shot my hand out

1191
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,750
to stop Leon
from flying through the windshield.

1192
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:55,083
He still got banged up a little bit,
but my hand was pulp.

1193
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:03,916
I cost Leon and all my teammates
a shot at the NCAA title that year.

1194
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,750
I got to think about that.

1195
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:12,291
I mean, really, really marinate in it

1196
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,166
for six months in jail.

1197
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,666
Everything I worked for.

1198
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,041
My whole life.

1199
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,458
Everything I wanted.

1200
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,083
Gone.

1201
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,416
Half the fucking list are favors!

1202
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,083
I'm not asking for a favor.
This guy can play!

1203
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,833
Everybody keeps saying that. That...

1204
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:02,083
But you don't know the whole story.

1205
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:04,000
He's... Meet the kid!

1206
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:09,083
Just set it up! I'll bring him anywhere!
Anywhere! He'll play anyone!

1207
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:11,166
Will you... Yes. Ryan!

1208
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,541
Yes, I know. I know.

1209
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,208
And you almost
didn't let Damian Lillard play!

1210
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,916
Right! So, you do make mistakes!

1211
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,208
Don't make a mistake on this kid.
I'm begging you, pal. For…

1212
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,500
For your sake, not just mine!

1213
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:32,416
God damn it. I spoke
at your father's camp every year!

1214
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,791
And I never asked for anything back! Okay?

1215
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:39,166
So I'm asking you now for something!
Please help me!

1216
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,791
Jesus Christ!

1217
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,666
You know what? I have…

1218
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:59,208
Been in this league
for 30 years, and it's like I'm nothing.

1219
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:04,083
It's like I wasn't even here.

1220
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:08,250
Stanley, it's not about the last play.

1221
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,000
It's about the next one, right?

1222
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:13,583
That's if you're in the game, T.
I wasn't even in the game.

1223
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,916
It's okay.

1224
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:22,708
It's okay.

1225
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,958
Hey. Wake up.

1226
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,958
You fell asleep in the chair.

1227
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,125
Yeah?

1228
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,041
Okay.

1229
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:46,750
- Hey, Dad, I was thinking...
- Just a second, let me finish this.

1230
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:54,250
Stan, you're gonna
give yourself a heart attack.

1231
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:02,208
- People just need to see him play, right?
- Certain people. Yeah.

1232
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,375
Well, remember that video you showed me
of your doctor friend?

1233
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,916
My doctor friend?

1234
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,208
We take the right one home
from the hospital?

1235
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,291
That's Dr. J.
He's not a real doctor.

1236
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,250
Oh. Well, whatever.

1237
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,958
That video has, like, two million views.

1238
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:19,208
- I was thinking...
- I can't ask him to do that.

1239
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,125
Well, I can.

1240
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,458
- No, no.
- No, I'm gonna ask him.

1241
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:30,291
Hey, sweetie. It's T.

1242
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:38,833
This is gonna be good.

1243
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,333
Hey, guys.

1244
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,875
I was hoping you could
help us out with something.

1245
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:46,375
- Yo, is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, that's Dr. J.

1246
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,333
Yo, Doc!
Say "what's up" for my story!

1247
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:52,666
Yo. That's my friend Bo Cruz over there.
They call him the Boa.

1248
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,750
You know why they call him that?

1249
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:57,416
Because he squeezes the life
out of his prey.

1250
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,666
So, guys, here's the deal.

1251
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,416
I got money here.
He's gonna go out on the court.

1252
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,916
Somebody gets a shot off him
and can hit the rim,

1253
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,208
I'll give you 50 bucks.

1254
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:09,958
If you put a bucket in against this guy,
we'll give you 100 bucks.

1255
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:12,666
If you beat him in a game
of one-on-one to five,

1256
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,791
we'll give you 1,000 bucks.
What do you say?

1257
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,208
I got next.

1258
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,458
All right. Let's go.

1259
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:30,916
We got one!

1260
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,125
We got one, baby!

1261
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:45,333
<i>Holy shit. Bo Cruz.
Where did this kid come from?</i>

1262
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,958
<i>Yo, Bo Cruz. I wish I had you
on my Rutgers team in the '70s.</i>

1263
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:52,041
{\an8}<i>We talkin' about practice?
Man don't need no practice.</i>

1264
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,791
{\an8}<i>A legend in the making.
You heard it from your man AI.</i>

1265
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:21,041
If you not here, you not nowhere.

1266
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,375
Oh!

1267
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:28,083
{\an8}<i>…been taking on street ball
legends, NBA players. Doesn't care.</i>

1268
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:29,916
{\an8}<i>Why aren't they inviting him
to the combine?</i>

1269
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,791
{\an8}<i>That's why you have the combine
for players like this.</i>

1270
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,000
{\an8}<i>Let the world see this talent.</i>

1271
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:39,000
<i>It's ridiculous what he's doing out there.
This ain't no gimmick, this real.</i>

1272
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:41,583
<i>The Boa needs to get to the combine.</i>

1273
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:45,333
<i>As much as it pains me to say this,
you two guys are right.</i>

1274
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:47,500
<i>This kid Bo Cruz is special.</i>

1275
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,083
Bo Cruz.
How does it feel getting into the combine?

1276
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,125
The combine? I'm in the combine?

1277
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,875
You are as of 30 minutes ago.

1278
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,541
Have you thought about
what team you wanna play for?

1279
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,833
- It'd be an honor to play for any team.
- I tell you what.

1280
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,166
He could be playing
for the Sixers right now,

1281
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:07,041
but Vince Merrick didn't want him.
He specifically said that. You remember?

1282
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,333
Anthony, you remember that, right?

1283
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,333
- You were interviewing him.
- That's right.

1284
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:13,500
He's 22. You're messing with his life.

1285
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,375
- What kind of ballplayer...
- Hang on.

1286
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:18,541
Have some respect for your profession.
Get the whole story next time.

1287
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,333
What kind of ballplayer...
I'll answer that question.

1288
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:25,500
This guy is as if Scottie Pippen
and a wolf had a baby,

1289
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,625
and Lisa Leslie raised him.

1290
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:29,791
And Allen Iverson was the babysitter.

1291
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,708
It gets weird, that stuff.
But you handled it great.

1292
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:37,583
What else is bothering you? Tell me.

1293
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,000
Nothing. See you tomorrow.

1294
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:42,791
Yeah.

1295
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,583
<i>So, he got into the combine,
and he's not excited?</i>

1296
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,791
He's in his own head.
He's not telling me anything.

1297
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,041
Well, maybe he's just sad.

1298
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:04,166
Eh. I think he's overwhelmed.
The pressure's getting to him.

1299
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:08,000
Mm-mm. I bet it's the kid. Lucia.

1300
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,916
I mean, he's never been away from her.

1301
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,291
Like ever.

1302
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:44,166
Okay, here we go.

1303
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:50,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1304
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:53,208
Superstars don't carry
their own bags. I got this.

1305
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:07,708
I'll meet you in the lobby
in one hour, okay?

1306
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,916
This is very, very good.

1307
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,708
Ray Hancock can't stop
working his ass off.

1308
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:20,000
Come on. Come on. Come with me.

1309
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Hey.

1310
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:24,458
When you train for a marathon,

1311
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,333
you don't run 20 miles
the day before the race.

1312
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,416
You do nothing.

1313
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,500
All we could do now
is get you hurt or wear you out.

1314
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,000
So we're gonna do this.

1315
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,541
- Lucia!
<i>- Papi!</i>

1316
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,125
<i>¡Hola!</i>

1317
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:56,791
Boa challenge is still trending.

1318
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:59,625
People are excited to see
what you're gonna do tomorrow.

1319
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:01,583
Look at this. Look at this.

1320
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:05,291
You think I know that many people?
This is all for you, pal.

1321
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,750
- That's for us.
- Okay, it's for us. Let's get 'em.

1322
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:12,750
Tomorrow, they're gonna be watching you.
Every move you make, the camera's on you.

1323
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,958
And it's not just about how you play.
It's the intangibles.

1324
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:19,416
More important than making a shot
is how you handle missing a shot.

1325
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,666
Shit's gonna go wrong. So what?

1326
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,208
You've dealt with adversity
your whole goddamn life.

1327
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:26,041
- Yeah.
- It's Bo's turn.

1328
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,458
You're nervous, huh?

1329
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,375
It's all right.

1330
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,416
Hey. Clyde Drexler used to get
so nervous before games

1331
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,750
that he'd actually faint.

1332
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,958
I'm not kidding you.
The guy did it so much

1333
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,916
his teammates followed him around
so they could catch him.

1334
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,500
It became kind of a ritual.

1335
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,625
It's good to be nervous.
It means you give a shit.

1336
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:45,833
- All right?
- All right.

1337
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:49,041
- Mama, you'll get him to sleep?
- Okay.

1338
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,625
Okay. Lucia, go easy on the Pringles.

1339
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,666
All right. <i>Adiós.</i>

1340
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,333
- <i>Adiós.</i>
- Bo Cruz.

1341
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:59,625
You're gonna Cruz-ify them tomorrow. Huh?

1342
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:01,625
- It's still not funny. Get out.
- It's no good?

1343
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:03,333
- Good night, my man.
- Good night.

1344
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:04,416
Crush 'em.

1345
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,250
- So, this is their shot?
- It is a big deal to be here.

1346
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,413
What kind of advice
do you have for this guy?

1347
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:17,541
This guy? Yeah, I've seen him play.
He's got a lot of talent. He's got it all.

1348
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:20,958
He can do a bit of everything.
I don't think he needs any advice from me.

1349
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,208
{\an8}Yeah, most guys
in your position would not be here.

1350
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:26,958
{\an8}You're already a lottery pick.
So what's your goal?

1351
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:29,625
{\an8}Just gonna tear it up
and dominate and let the world know.

1352
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:30,791
{\an8}You like that, Khris?

1353
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:33,208
- Cocky bastard, ain't he?
- Yeah.

1354
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,125
You against you. All right?

1355
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,375
We've done this a hundred times.
It's just another workout.

1356
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:43,500
You're an iceberg.

1357
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:45,666
Focus. Kick some ass.

1358
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,458
<i>Te quiero, papá.</i>

1359
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:51,000
That's good.

1360
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:53,625
<i>- Madre.
- Te quiero, mama.</i>

1361
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,458
Have fun out there.
Where do you wanna sit?

1362
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,541
- Double D! I see you!
- Yeah! Hey, Leon.

1363
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Come on, guys.

1364
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,666
3.04.

1365
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,208
Hey, yo, Stan. He can fly.
Damn. He can fly, man.

1366
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,291
- Tell Coach.
- Yes, sir.

1367
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,041
Thanks, Khris.

1368
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,916
It's from football.

1369
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,666
Okay. Well, then, soccer is good.

1370
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,750
I hate soccer. I can't say that.
I really do hate that sport.

1371
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,000
He's quick, but can he shoot?

1372
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,833
He can shoot.

1373
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,041
<i>Olé,</i> bitch.

1374
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:43,833
Calm.

1375
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:49,791
<i>Fran Fraschilla here
at the NBA draft combine.</i>

1376
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,458
Bo Cruz and Kermit Wilts
crushed it yesterday,

1377
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:55,500
blowing the roof off
with the speed and agility drills.

1378
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,916
I cannot wait for this match-up.

1379
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,333
We've been watching Kermit
since his AAU days.

1380
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,375
We know he's gonna be an NBA star,

1381
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:05,125
but this kid, Bo Cruz,
he's come out of nowhere.

1382
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,875
I thought I knew
every international player on the planet,

1383
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,083
but this kid is a revelation.

1384
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,250
It'll be a good game.

1385
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:15,541
Of course he's nervous, but I told him
the whole Clyde Drexler

1386
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:18,541
fainting-before-every-game story,
and that calmed him down.

1387
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:22,208
Clyde... That was me who fainted
before every meet, not Clyde Drexler.

1388
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,666
That was you? Sorry. Just…

1389
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:28,083
Either way, it worked.
He's… He's feeling good.

1390
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,791
My wife says hi. My wife says hello.

1391
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,583
- Oh, hi.
- Hello, hello. They're excited.

1392
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:36,833
Okay. I love you.
I'm gonna watch the game.

1393
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:42,916
Strong like bull, huh?

1394
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,208
My bad. It's the Boa now.

1395
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:47,541
Hashtag Boa.

1396
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:51,375
They call you that
'cause you swallow anything, right?

1397
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,250
Unhinge that jaw. Hey.

1398
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:57,333
Hey, you hear me? Hey.

1399
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:05,166
And we're off. Here we go.

1400
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:14,750
That's it! That's it!

1401
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,000
Good start, Bo.

1402
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,208
On your left, Bo. On it.

1403
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:28,666
That's all right.

1404
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:32,125
Let's get out and go.
Get out and go. Run wide.

1405
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:36,500
I'm good. I'm good.

1406
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:45,291
That a baby!

1407
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:00,625
Oop.

1408
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,166
Go get it. Go get it.

1409
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:06,208
Ooh.

1410
01:31:08,291 --> 01:31:09,583
Time out!

1411
01:31:09,666 --> 01:31:12,125
These guys behind us
are drooling over him.

1412
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:15,750
Go, Papa.

1413
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:30,375
That your little girl over there?
What's her name?

1414
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,375
Easy, boy.
Acting like I asked her out or something.

1415
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:36,083
Just trying to get to know you.

1416
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:37,750
Oh, shit.

1417
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:39,083
Where's her mom at?

1418
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:44,666
Oh, okay. I see what's going on.
That's your mom.

1419
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,916
Is it legal to have a kid
with your mom in Spain?

1420
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,708
We don't roll like that out here.

1421
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,625
Hey, I know you hear me. Hey.

1422
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:05,208
Yo. Greg. Greg.

1423
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,291
- Communicate to each other.
- Give my kid a breather.

1424
01:32:23,041 --> 01:32:24,750
He pushed me.

1425
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,458
Take him out. Give him a rest.

1426
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,125
- Stanley, we got it.
- You don't have it.

1427
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:31,500
Jesus Christ.

1428
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,875
Don't got it. All right.

1429
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:47,500
Where's her mama anyway?
How come she ain't here?

1430
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,750
She probably shackin' it up
with somebody else.

1431
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:52,166
Tell her to shack it up with me.

1432
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,125
I'd be a great stepdad.
Give her a real man to look up to.

1433
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,083
Huh? What you got?

1434
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,958
Keep coming. Keep coming.

1435
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,041
Good. Good. Good.

1436
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,416
Look. She likes me.

1437
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:12,875
Hey! Bo! Bo!

1438
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:27,666
Bo!

1439
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,875
Get off me.

1440
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:46,208
<i>I've been coming
to the NBA draft combines for a long time,</i>

1441
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:50,041
<i>and what you don't wanna do
is show the NBA scouts and GMs</i>

1442
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,625
<i>that you can't keep your cool.</i>

1443
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:56,208
<i>This is gonna hurt him.
This is a problem. Kermit's really…</i>

1444
01:33:56,291 --> 01:34:00,875
They got him labeled now.
"Violent kid from a violent neighborhood."

1445
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:02,750
You know how it works.

1446
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,916
Ron Artest?

1447
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,875
He beat up the entire city of Detroit,
and everybody loves him.

1448
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:10,291
Just give it some time.
That's all it takes.

1449
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,583
You know,
everybody loves a redemption story.

1450
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:16,375
Some people don't get one.
Just keep falling.

1451
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,791
Shit, he was playing too. God damn it.

1452
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:21,875
Hmm.

1453
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:57,041
You played marvelously.

1454
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,250
Mama, don't.

1455
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:01,541
Look at me.

1456
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,666
Don't you see how incredible you are?

1457
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,208
You carry this weight.

1458
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,875
All that you do for Lucia, for me,

1459
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,458
it's never enough.

1460
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,708
All this love…

1461
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:21,750
And no love for yourself.

1462
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:26,500
When I first saw you here…

1463
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:30,375
The day we arrived,

1464
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,750
you looked…

1465
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:35,125
Different.

1466
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,375
You looked lighter,

1467
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:39,833
like the weight was lifted.

1468
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:44,375
And I think that Stanley does for you

1469
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,833
what you do for us.

1470
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:50,458
He put all the weight on him

1471
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,958
so you can be you.

1472
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,708
He is <i>your</i> oak tree.

1473
01:35:57,166 --> 01:36:00,083
You can say goodbye
to pro basketball here,

1474
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:05,250
but you don't need to say goodbye
to what this man has given you.

1475
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:22,375
Sorry I couldn't get you guys
all on the same flight.

1476
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,458
It's fine.

1477
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:29,500
So, if Sixers weren't paying,
who was paying?

1478
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:33,666
Me and... Me and T.

1479
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,708
I ate so much minibar.

1480
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,666
On top of the porn addiction, yes.

1481
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,166
I… I'm gonna pay you back.

1482
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,250
What? No.

1483
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:49,875
Coaching you.

1484
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,625
That was the best month of my life.

1485
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,625
You can return it.

1486
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:11,916
Thank you.

1487
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,875
Okay. All right.

1488
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:17,875
Mr. Cruz Missile.

1489
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,291
Now you like the Cruz Missile?

1490
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:24,375
Nah.

1491
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,541
Still stupid.

1492
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:31,708
Get out of here. Don't miss your flight.

1493
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,416
Couldn't give me just one, huh?

1494
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:15,166
- Big I, what's up?
<i>- I got a game for you.</i>

1495
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,500
Open run. Last-minute, very hush-hush.

1496
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:20,000
No press. Just players and front office.

1497
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:21,291
<i>Lot of front office.</i>

1498
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:23,000
No, no, no. We... We can't.

1499
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:24,125
Oh, yes, you can.

1500
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:27,041
'Cause I had to grind
to put your damn names on the list.

1501
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:28,833
<i>- There's a list?</i>
- What's up, Leon?

1502
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:30,666
Of course there's a list. Look.

1503
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:34,166
Cardinal Hayes High School,
650 Grand Concourse, the Bronx.

1504
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:37,708
<i>- They start at 5:00. Don't be late.</i>
- We're… I'm at the airport, man.

1505
01:38:37,791 --> 01:38:39,958
Bo's not even with me. It's too late.

1506
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:42,166
- Is the plane in the air?
- No.

1507
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,791
<i>Then what the fuck
are you still talking to me for?</i>

1508
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:48,666
Sorry.

1509
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,375
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1510
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,666
Okay. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1511
01:39:24,791 --> 01:39:26,750
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1512
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:29,375
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Did it start yet?

1513
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:31,750
- What's your...
- They're good. They're with me.

1514
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,666
- Okay.
- Y'all are good.

1515
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,958
- I still need that. Your phone.
- The phone?

1516
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:37,625
Relax. Gonna take my phone too?

1517
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:40,833
No, well, I don't trust the big one.
He's beating people up.

1518
01:39:45,916 --> 01:39:46,958
- Yo.
- Stan.

1519
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,458
- Hey, Mark.
- Good to see you.

1520
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:50,666
How are you? Right on. Aaron.

1521
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:53,125
Good to see you. Staying in shape, I see.

1522
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:54,791
My man Bo.

1523
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,208
- All right. Show us what you got, fella.
- Yes, sir.

1524
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:09,541
Look who's here.

1525
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,875
You know what? He just said
the same thing about you.

1526
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:15,666
And I'm gonna say
one last inspirational thing to you.

1527
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,541
They can't kill you
if you're already dead.

1528
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:32,791
Hey.

1529
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:38,708
Trae. Trae. Trae.

1530
01:40:42,333 --> 01:40:43,250
God damn.

1531
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:44,333
Good pass!

1532
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:48,208
All right. Let's go, baby. Come on!

1533
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,583
- All right, big fella.
- I got it.

1534
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,083
- You got it? You sure?
- I got this.

1535
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:56,708
- Well, come on.
- That dude is waving off Trae Young.

1536
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,309
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

1537
01:40:58,333 --> 01:41:00,708
But the Mavericks think he's 18.

1538
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:05,833
I saw. I saw.

1539
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,166
Move it around.

1540
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:20,083
Right here.

1541
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:21,708
That's it!

1542
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:22,916
You're trash.

1543
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,375
- That's a beautiful shot.
- That's nice.

1544
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:35,208
- That's your boy, Stan?
- Yeah, yeah.

1545
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,666
Yeah, Mark. Yeah.

1546
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:42,041
What you got? Let's go.

1547
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:44,250
Do what you do. Do what you do.

1548
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:48,041
Stay with him.

1549
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:58,875
Oh, yeah.

1550
01:42:01,125 --> 01:42:02,583
Bo. Come get it.

1551
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
What you want?

1552
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:17,791
Oh, yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

1553
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:20,333
- Stanley lookin' like a proud daddy.
- That's right.

1554
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,916
Give me the fucking ball, man.

1555
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:27,791
Ooh!

1556
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:34,750
- Who is that guy?
- I don't even know.

1557
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:44,541
Yeah.

1558
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:48,583
Looks like a guy that could
impact winning at our level.

1559
01:42:48,666 --> 01:42:51,500
- Take it to him.
- We need to get him up to Boston.

1560
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:52,875
- Absolutely.
- Hey.

1561
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:56,083
- We'll talk soon.
- Okay, Brad. Nice seeing you.

1562
01:42:56,833 --> 01:43:00,708
- "If Scottie and a wolf had a baby..."
- You saw that?

1563
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,458
The whole city saw it.

1564
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:06,125
Well, luckily, Philadelphia sports fans
are calm, reasonable people.

1565
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:07,250
Bo, get this.

1566
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,958
So, what are you doing here?

1567
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:11,791
I'm taking a more active role.

1568
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:18,583
Vin is gonna share the throne with you?

1569
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:19,666
No.

1570
01:43:20,166 --> 01:43:24,041
He made a big mess,
and I could use some help cleaning it up.

1571
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:27,708
I like that.

1572
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,291
That's it. Go. Go, go, go.

1573
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,500
Finish it.

1574
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:09,625
Hey, Bubba.
How's the film school final coming along?

1575
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:12,625
It's good. We wrapped early,
so I can catch the game.

1576
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:14,916
You're voluntarily
watching a basketball game.

1577
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,600
Well, now we gotta win.

1578
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:18,142
Let's do it.

1579
01:44:18,166 --> 01:44:21,166
- Yes. Coming, Coach. Gotta split.
<i>- Good luck. I love you.</i>

1580
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,333
I love you too.

1581
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:25,166
Nice suit, Stan.

1582
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:27,291
Just trying to look like you, Doc.

1583
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:30,458
- You think that's working?
- Uh, not even close. Don't worry.

1584
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:32,375
All right, gentlemen.

1585
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:34,458
Very good.

1586
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:28,458
Hey, Coach!

1587
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:33,250
Twenty-two? I see you.

1588
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:36,166
After we kick your ass,
you should try to coach soccer.

1589
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,416
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

1590
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,041
I'll move to Spain
and shack up with your mother.

1591
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:44,166
That doesn't work anymore.

1592
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,791
Aw. I thought I had you there.

1593
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:49,625
Okay. Good to see you, son.
You be aggressive tonight.

1594
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:53,125
Play hard, all right?
Don't tell these guys I'm pulling for you.

1595
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:04,041
Doesn't miss. Doesn't miss.

1596
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:07,333
Hey, guys. Let's bring it in.
First play is V4.

1597
01:46:07,416 --> 01:46:09,041
Stepping up to set this pick.

1598
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:11,666
Tyrese, if you can
turn a corner, shoot it.

1599
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,791
If not, get it to Tobias.
He'll be wide open. All right?

1600
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:16,875
- Let's get it in.
- Come on, let's go.

1601
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:19,333
- "Together," on three. One, two, three.
- Together!

1602
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:23,375
Twenty-two, he goes to his right,
he wants to get to the rim.

1603
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,416
Left, he wants to get to his step back.

1604
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,958
I got you, Coach. I'm ready for round two.

1605
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:29,208
Be aware.

1606
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:40,041
<i>Give a warm welcome</i>

1607
01:46:40,125 --> 01:46:44,916
<i>to your Philadelphia 76ers!</i>

1608
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,291
{\an8}<i>Hernangómez drives speed,
Reed with the step.</i>

1609
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:49,708
{\an8}<i>That's high percentage.</i>

1610
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:51,958
<i>And Juancho
continues to be red hot.</i>

1611
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,250
<i>Harris, with the hammer!</i>

1612
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:02,916
{\an8}<i>Maxey baseline…
What a reverse by Tyrese Maxey!</i>

1613
01:47:03,666 --> 01:47:05,625
{\an8}<i>Speaking of making things look easy.</i>

1614
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:11,333
{\an8}<i>The steal artist Matisse Thybulle.</i>

1615
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:17,041
{\an8}<i>And a little extra-curricular activity
after the miss.</i>

1616
01:47:17,125 --> 01:47:19,541
{\an8}<i>Getting a little heated there.</i>

1617
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,916
{\an8}<i>Getting fired up.</i>

1618
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:30,125
{\an8}<i>Anthony Edwards,
that time he does finish.</i>

1619
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:34,208
{\an8}<i>Smith looking for the three.
He's been on fire. It hits!</i>

1620
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:37,250
{\an8}<i>He's tied the game. Kenny Smith…</i>

1621
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:40,583
{\an8}<i>I think of the Doctor.
Yes, he's got it. Here he comes.</i>

1622
01:47:40,666 --> 01:47:42,666
{\an8}<i>Wait. The Doctor made a sensational play.</i>

1623
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,958
{\an8}<i>Nowitzki goes right at Bowen</i>

1624
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:48,666
{\an8}<i>and the foul! So Nowitzki to the line.</i>

1625
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:49,583
{\an8}<i>Marjanovic.</i>

1626
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:52,250
{\an8}<i>That was pretty
Harlem Globetrotter-esque.</i>

1627
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:53,625
{\an8}<i>That was pretty funny.</i>

1628
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:57,166
{\an8}<i>Iverson! He is the man!</i>

1629
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:00,291
{\an8}<i>Listen to this crowd as AI rejoices.</i>

1630
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,791
{\an8}<i>- Shaquille O'Neal.
- The Shaq Attack!</i>

1631
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:07,458
{\an8}<i>- Hold on to the roof.
- I have never seen that.</i>

1632
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:08,791
{\an8}<i>Barkley!</i>

1633
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:12,208
{\an8}<i>He has 37, two under his playoff…</i>

1634
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:15,125
{\an8}<i>It's gonna take some Luka magic
to save the possession.</i>

1635
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:16,541
{\an8}<i>And he put it in!</i>

1636
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,833
{\an8}<i>Wagner! Wow!</i>

1637
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:24,166
<i>Oh, me, oh my,
Mark Jackson right down the throat.</i>

1638
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:27,416
<i>Kyle turns the corner,
drives, got it.</i>

1639
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,291
<i>- Kyle Lowry...
- He got 'em!</i>

1640
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:32,125
<i>Trae drives it all the way
and lays it in.</i>

1641
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:33,708
<i>Bingo! Trae Young.</i>

1642
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:37,458
{\an8}<i>That was amazing!
Aaron Gordon, you win!</i>

1643
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:39,583
{\an8}<i>Jordan Clarks on, my goodness.</i>

1644
01:48:39,666 --> 01:48:40,791
{\an8}<i>Broken ankle. Wow.</i>

1645
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:42,625
{\an8}<i>Tough shot. Count it, for Clarks on.</i>

1646
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:45,666
{\an8}<i>Driving all the way!</i>

1647
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:49,416
{\an8}<i>- Khris Middleton in the face.
- Oh, my goodness. Oh, man.</i>

1648
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:52,458
{\an8}<i>Calderón!</i>

1649
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:28,041
<i>And the crowd
rising to their feet.</i>

1650
01:49:28,833 --> 01:49:31,416
<i>- Demps to the basket.
- Dell Demps with a dunk.</i>

1651
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:34,916
<i>With another three-point basket,
his third of the game.</i>

1652
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,083
<i>The owner loved it.</i>

1652
01:49:37,305 --> 01:50:37,361
