is only the beginning.

159
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,666
Soon they'll all revert
to their base biology,

160
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,601
triggering a brutal hunt
for resources,

161
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:27,539
which means they'll go back to
ripping our bloody brains out.

162
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,375
How do you know that for sure?

163
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,211
A few isolated cases
doesn't make a pandemic.

164
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:35,547
We've already lost thousands
in Dublin.

165
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:39,151
If we don't find a solution in the
next 72 hours, London will be next.

166
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:44,156
However, we may have one.

167
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,562
The Armada?

168
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:54,466
Harvester ships have resilient core
drives which repair their tech.

169
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,670
But every one of them we've converted
put together won't be able to stem

170
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:01,507
the tide of three billion
Pilots. The Armadas can.

171
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,446
Its core drive is powerful enough to
restore every Pilot on Earth for 100 years.

172
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,250
But I destroyed it
five years ago.

Take a closer look.

174
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:23,996
Its core warped out.
Right before impact.

175
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,000
And you know where it went?

176
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:31,136
We cracked their entire
navigational database.

177
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,272
All the way back to this world.

178
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,242
We're calling it Cobalt One.

179
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:40,612
Every question we've ever
asked... Where are they from?

180
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:44,049
Who are they? What do
they really want?

181
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:48,053
All the answers lie on
that shiny, blue rock.

182
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:54,293
The only way that we can
defend our hard-fought peace,

ensure a secure future
for all humanity,

is to get there.
