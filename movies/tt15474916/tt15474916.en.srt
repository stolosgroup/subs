00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,649
Dr. Cotter.

3
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,343
\hHe's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

4
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,345
Mom's gonna die. \hl'm
gonna die. \hEverybody dies.

5
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:11,689
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

6
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:15,054
I haven't been able
to get him to talk...

7
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:16,517
respond to me, nothing.

8
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:19,520
Just this.

9
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,699
Yeah.
I got it.

10
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:23,832
Thanks, Dan.

11
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,328
She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

12
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,835
I'm gonna die.
Everyone dies.

13
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,870
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

14
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,905
He doesn't matter. She doesn't
matter. Mom doesn't matter.

15
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:32,742
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

16
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,646
I don't matter. I don't
matter. I don't matter.

17
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,307
\hHe's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

18
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:39,540
He's gonna die. I'm
gonna die. Everyone dies.

19
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,377
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

20
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,412
He doesn't matter. She
doesn't matter. Everyone dies.

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,853
I'm gonna die.
Nobody matters.

22
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,855
She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

23
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,549
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

24
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,320
I don't matter.
I don't ma...

25
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:53,026
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

26
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:56,062
She's gonna... She's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

27
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,361
I don't matter.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

28
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:05,468
Hi, Carl.

29
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,142
What's going on today?

30
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,749
I'm dying.

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,949
No.

32
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,479
I don't think so.

33
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,450
\hl think you're having
another manic episode.

34
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,661
Don't...

35
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,663
Don't you tell me.

36
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,126
You don't know.

37
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:30,998
I feel it all around me,
squeezing.

38
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm scared.

39
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:43,010
Carl, I know that what
you're experiencing feels real,

40
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,211
but it can't hurt you.

41
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,084
I promise.

42
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:53,317
\hHe's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

43
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,319
Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,761
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters.

45
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:01,963
Hey, Wanda. I'm gonna put Carl
Renken into observation for a few days.

46
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:03,965
He's harmless. Just make
sure someone checks on him

47
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,164
every couple hours.

48
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,770
You got it.
\h\hThanks.

49
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:09,070
Hey, Dr. Desai
was looking for you.

50
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:11,006
Thank you.

51
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,349
No! No! Please!

52
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,484
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

53
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,895
No! No! Please!

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,765
No!

55
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,196
No!

56
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:54,247
Come in.

57
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,449
Hey, did you send
a patient named, uh,

58
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,056
Sarah Marquet
over to residency yesterday?

59
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:05,026
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

60
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:07,721
and she's been in and out
of our unit a few times.

61
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:09,393
Rose, she has no insurance.

62
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,999
Okay, but she needs treatment.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,166
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

64
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,970
for another bed
in the residency program.

65
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,840
Maybe the board should try
giving a shit

66
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,568
\habout the point \hof our
job here once in a while.

67
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,110
I'm not questioning
your judgment.

68
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,639
I just need you to
come to me first

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,212
so I can get ahead of
it next time. All right?

70
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:27,675
Yes.

71
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:29,743
Okay. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:32,747
Hey, you haven't been here since
the late shift last night, have you?

73
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,321
Dr. Cotter.

74
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,422
Laura Weaver, 26.
She's a grad student.

75
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,589
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

76
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,624
EMS brought her in.
Got any psych history?

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,725
Nothing on file, but the
police sent over a report

78
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:20,101
for a different incident she
was involved in last week.

79
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,070
And what was that one about?

80
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,238
A professor at her school bludgeoned
himself to death with a hammer.

81
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,438
\hShe was interviewed
as the only witness.

82
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,880
A hammer?

83
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,155
Hi.

84
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:41,925
Laura?

85
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,657
My name is Dr. Cotter.
I'm a therapist.

86
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,165
Do you wanna sit down?

87
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:54,532
\h Okay.

88
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,041
I know you're nervous.

89
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,878
That's okay.

90
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:02,946
I just wanna have a chat.

91
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:05,213
I promise this is a safe place.

92
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,743
Not for me.

93
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,954
Why do you say that?

94
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,721
Come on. Let's sit.

95
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,334
Please.

96
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,224
Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you a couple
of questions that might sound stupid.

97
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,625
What day of the week is it?

98
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:56,594
Thursday.

99
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,727
And the month?

100
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,498
October.
I'm not crazy.

101
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,072
Nobody's saying that.
But I need you to understand.

102
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:06,207
I'm a PhD candidate. I'm
not some lunatic. Okay?

103
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,308
Let's just take a breath,

104
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:11,213
and you can just
tell me what's going on.

105
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,159
I'm seeing something.

106
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,823
Something no one else can see
except for me.

107
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,233
I know how insane that sounds.
I do.

108
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:35,765
But it's... This thing,
I can't explain it.

109
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,768
What is it you're seeing?

110
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,704
It looks like people,

111
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,509
but it's... it's not a person.

112
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm not sure I understand.

113
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,052
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

114
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,714
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

115
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:54,486
Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...

116
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,192
Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather

117
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:59,624
who died in front of me
when I was seven.

118
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:04,530
But it's all the same thing.
It...

119
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,864
It's... It's like...

120
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,540
It's... It's like it wears
people's faces like... like masks.

121
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,377
Okay.

122
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,545
Do you see it right now, here?

123
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,518
What happens when you do see it?

124
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,952
It's smiling at me.

125
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,921
But not a friendly smile.

126
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,824
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

127
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,200
And whenever I see it,
I just get this

128
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:42,535
god-awful feeling like something
really terrible is gonna happen.

129
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,539
I've never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

130
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,938
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

131
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,314
ever experienced hallucinations?

132
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,316
It's not a hallucination, no.
It's real.

133
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,450
You don't get it.
It does things to me.

134
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,518
It causes shit
to happen around me.

135
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,259
It's taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

136
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,229
it tells me things.

137
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:10,826
It told me that to...
\h\htoday... \h\hToday's the...

138
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,368
Today's the day that I'm...
I'm gonna...

139
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,029
Okay. That's okay.

140
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,273
That's okay.

141
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:24,180
I know that what you're
experiencing feels incredibly real.

142
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:27,150
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

143
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:30,813
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds tend to...

144
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,321
You're not listening to me.

145
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,125
Oh, my God.

146
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,689
I'm gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

147
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,197
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

148
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:42,595
Oh, God.

149
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,366
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

150
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,534
Hey, c-can you look at me,
please?

151
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,064
It's okay.

152
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,242
Look at me.

153
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:55,575
I...

154
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,184
Oh, my God. No!

155
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,548
No! It's here!

156
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:03,978
Please!
Laura. It's okay.

157
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,188
It's just us.
Get away! Please!

158
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,519
There's nobody else here.
No!

159
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,623
No!

160
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,598
Oh, my God.

161
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:23,338
I... I have a patient
emergency in eval 2.

162
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,241
I need staff here now.

163
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:26,374
Hurry.

164
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,463
Laura?

165
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:07,095
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

166
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,231
No. Would you say she was
typical of the patients you see here?

167
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:14,378
This is an emergency
psychiatric unit.

168
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,512
Typical is not really
a thing here.

169
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,613
Right. But she was
a head case, yeah?

170
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:21,847
I'm sorry, a head case?

171
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:27,918
I think we're just trying
to get your opinion

172
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,954
of her mental state.

173
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,694
She could've been suffering from

174
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:36,697
acute post-trauma psychosis.

175
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,800
She was
having paranoid delusions.

176
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,637
What kind of delusions?

177
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:45,838
She was convinced that some

178
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,809
sort of evil presence
was haunting her.

179
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,910
Yikes.

180
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:56,584
It's just, we're gonna have to
contact Ms. Weaver's family

181
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,652
and attempt to explain
what happened.

182
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:02,623
So we're looking for anything that
might make some sense of all this.

183
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:06,661
If there's anything else you
can tell us that... that might help.

184
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:19,872
Uh, before she died...

185
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:25,383
she was... smiling.

186
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,046
Yeah, she sounds
fucking crazy to me.

187
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,504
Rose.

188
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:13,078
Whoa.

189
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:17,477
My bad. Did I scare you?

190
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:19,315
I didn't hear you come in.
Shit.

191
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:21,151
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHi.
Hi.

192
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,285
Hi.

193
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,222
What's up?

194
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,598
Nothing. Sorry.

195
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:30,326
Something's wrong.

196
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:35,528
A patient died today.

197
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,167
My patient.

198
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:38,707
Oh.

199
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,270
Hey, come here.

200
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,580
I'm sorry.

201
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:45,880
It happened
right in front of me.

202
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,816
It was awful.

203
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,951
\hl'm so sorry.
What can I do?

204
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,484
This is a nice start.

205
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:05,196
Maybe we should
bail on dinner tonight.

206
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,135
We can't.

207
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:13,709
Holly hired a sitter,

208
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,712
and it's just gonna be a
bigger headache if we don't go.

209
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,978
No way. Holly turning
into a headache?

210
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,543
Hey.

211
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:36,094
I'm sorry,
you wanna talk about being tired?

212
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,733
Now that Jackson's
in the first grade,

213
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,527
I'm literally up
at 6:00 a.m. every day

214
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,870
to make him breakfast
and pack him lunch.

215
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:46,709
God knows what kind of non organic
garbage that cafeteria is even serving.

216
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,205
Then I have
to drive him to school,

217
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,273
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

218
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,408
Like, I haven't been to Pilates in
weeks. Okay, my body is so fucked.

219
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,718
Not true. I have to go
back to school, pick him up,

220
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:59,414
then I have to take him to either soccer
practice, swim lessons, karate, theater...

221
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,449
Oh, and he just started
taking Spanish.

222
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,761
I mean, my
weekdays are literally impossible.

223
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,194
Mmm. You are coming
Saturday, right?

224
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,394
What?

225
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,462
Uh, sorry, what's Saturday?

226
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,431
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hl'm sorry,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\his that a joke? Wow.

227
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,741
\h\h\hRose, Jackson's
\h\h\hseventh birthday party. Wow.

228
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,633
I've told you, like, five times.

229
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,042
I can't. I have work.

230
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,912
What do you mean work?
It's Saturday.

231
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:25,979
I work Saturday.

232
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,607
See, this is exactly why

233
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,114
you have to
get out of that gross hospital

234
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,116
and into a private practice...
Gross?

235
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,316
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hlt is not
gross... working normal-people hours.

236
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,220
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

237
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,024
who will actually
pay you for your time.

238
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,620
Thank you so much
for your input, Greg.

239
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,962
That's very sweet.

240
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,733
I'm just saying,
why become a doctor

241
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,834
if you can't get
disgustingly rich?

242
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:46,968
You're kidding, right?

243
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,102
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

244
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,204
What...

245
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,306
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

246
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,946
\hwe could always \hsell the
fucking house. Can we not right now?

247
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,981
\hl don't understand you.
It's just sitting there.

248
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,082
We grew up in that house.

249
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,854
Rose, it's a total teardown. \h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhy
not just get the money for the land?

250
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,725
Can you guys just
shut the fuck up?

251
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,222
Wow.

252
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:13,191
Thank you.

253
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,688
Thank you so much.
Sure.

254
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,593
I've been
looking forward to this.

255
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:52,803
You okay?

256
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,398
Yeah.

257
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,450
Morning, Doc.

258
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:17,894
Morning.

259
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:29,971
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver...

260
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:33,942
The police had sent a report about a
different incident that she was involved in.

261
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,372
Can you get that
forwarded to me?

262
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:36,945
You got it, Doc.

263
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:39,409
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

264
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,380
Oh, yeah. She pulled out a bunch of
her hair overnight and swallowed it all.

265
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:45,954
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

266
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:48,188
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hShit.

267
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,520
Uh, Rose.

268
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,097
What... What are you... \hl was
on a... \hl was on a call nearby,

269
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:58,792
and I just thought I would...

270
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,101
Um...

271
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:02,839
You know, we didn't really
get to talk yesterday,

272
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,073
other than the whole...
Whole thing.

273
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:09,142
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

274
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:11,639
I had no idea
it was gonna be you.

275
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,311
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

276
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,248
It's your job. I get it.

277
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,118
How you been?

278
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,154
Joel, why are you here?

279
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,860
You know, like I said, I was
on a call nearby, and I just,

280
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,456
you know, thought I would...

281
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:29,492
come check on you.

282
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:33,166
After everything that happened yesterday,
that's... that's not an easy thing.

283
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,698
Okay. I appreciate it, but I
don't need you to check on me.

284
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:42,879
Right.

285
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,707
No, yeah, I mean... Sorry.

286
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:48,643
I have to get back to work.

287
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:49,985
Yeah.

288
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:51,251
See you around.

289
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,029
You do know
she's engaged, right?

290
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,967
Yeah.

291
00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:07,696
I'm single.

292
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,634
Hello.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHi.

293
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:48,208
Um, look, I just wanted to say
sorry about last night, okay?

294
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:51,343
I shouldn't have
kept going at you like that.

295
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:52,774
Uh, no, I...

296
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:55,084
I should apologize.

297
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:58,185
I've been just dealing
with some stuff.

298
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,814
I wasn't being
very good company.

299
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:03,553
Okay. If you can't make it to
your nephew's party tomorrow,

300
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,995
you could at least
get him a present.

301
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:09,262
If you need an idea, he's
really into electric model trains.

302
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,857
Uh-huh.

303
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,266
You sound weird.
Are you okay?

304
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,434
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

305
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,461
Hey, Carl.

306
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,036
How you feeling today?

307
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:57,938
Carl.

308
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:04,450
Carl?

309
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:12,985
She's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

310
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:14,822
\hEverybody dies.
Carl, look at me.

311
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,758
You're going to die.

312
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,463
You're going to die.

313
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:20,234
You're going to die.

314
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:23,732
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

315
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,999
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

316
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,803
You're going to die.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHelp!

317
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,113
Help! This patient is 5150!

318
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:33,050
He needs to be restrained!
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGo, go, go!

319
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:36,283
No! No!

320
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,549
No!

321
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:42,091
No! No! No! No!

322
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:44,258
No! No!

323
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,920
No! No!

324
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:49,264
No!

325
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,408
He was aggressive.

326
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:04,377
Acting psychotic.

327
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:07,083
Carl Renken has been in
and out of here a dozen times

328
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,383
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

329
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,682
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDo you think
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hl'm making it up? Of course not.

330
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:15,091
But yesterday,
a patient in your care

331
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,688
killed herself brutally
in front of you.

332
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:20,492
Is it possible,
when you presumed

333
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,461
that Carl Renken
was a danger to himself,

334
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:24,827
that that's what your mind
was reacting to?

335
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:32,109
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

336
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,112
Okay.

337
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,742
So, here's what's gonna happen.

338
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,909
You're gonna take
a paid week off.

339
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,779
Morgan,
that's really not necessary.

340
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,255
You've been working
80-hour weeks for months.

341
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:50,082
I'm concerned
that you haven't been sleeping.

342
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,921
We can't help these patients unless
we have our own mental health in check.

343
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,857
And it's in
the unit's best interest

344
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:58,057
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

345
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:01,336
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

346
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:15,695
Fuck!

347
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,924
\h

348
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:29,097
Hello?
This is First Line Security.

349
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:31,473
May I have your name
and the pass code?

350
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:33,475
Uh, Rose Cotter.

351
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:35,070
Um, "Acapulco."

352
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,841
Ma'am, we've detected
a door alarm.

353
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:40,680
Yeah, uh, the... the back
door of my house is open.

354
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:42,617
Are you alone
in the house, ma'am?

355
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,376
Yes.

356
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:45,818
Are you sure?

357
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:51,560
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhat? Are you sure
you haven't let something inside, Rose?

358
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:55,894
Look behind you.

359
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:27,563
Shit.

360
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,571
Hello?

361
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:38,166
This is First Line Security.

362
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,334
May I have your name
and the pass code?

363
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,665
We did a full sweep
inside and out. It's all clear.

364
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:06,799
Um, what about the back door?

365
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,001
Is it possible it wasn't fully
latched last time it was closed?

366
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:13,707
I... I don't know.
Maybe.

367
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,071
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

368
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:17,744
These false alarms
happen all the time.

369
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,341
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

370
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,343
Okay.

371
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,751
Evening, sir.

372
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:27,348
Um, evening.

373
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,353
What happened?

374
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:37,094
Mustache?

375
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,602
Mustache.

376
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:44,133
So, is there a reason
you set the alarm?

377
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,036
Uh...

378
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:47,906
I literally
don't remember doing it.

379
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:51,009
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

380
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,045
By accident?

381
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:57,014
Sorry. Sorry.

382
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:59,181
My head has just been
in this, like,

383
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:02,151
foggy, creepy,
spacey place all day.

384
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:05,187
And there was this weird
incident at work and then...

385
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,564
And then my boss
is making me take a...

386
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,866
Sorry.

387
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:16,869
Everything is okay.
Are you sure?

388
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,939
No, no, I'm fine.
I was just venting.

389
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,206
Okay.

390
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:29,915
Can you see
if you can find Mustache?

391
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,917
I haven't seen him
anywhere at all.

392
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:33,150
Yeah.

393
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:41,961
Rose, did you
break another glass?

394
00:35:46,702 --> 00:35:48,066
Mustache?

395
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:52,939
Come on, kitty.

396
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:57,647
Please. Please.

397
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,817
Mustache.

398
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,105
It looks like
people. It looks like different people.

399
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:03,602
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

400
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:06,539
Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...

401
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,146
Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather

402
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:12,017
who died in front of me
when I was seven.

403
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:14,580
- But it's all the same thing.
- It...

404
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:17,319
It's smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.

405
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,618
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

406
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,423
And whenever I see it, I
just get this god-awful feeling

407
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:25,657
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

408
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,804
Oh, my God! No! No!

409
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:32,631
No! It's here! Please!

410
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,502
Get away! Please! No!

411
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:39,341
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hl... I have
a patient emergency in eval 2.

412
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:42,180
I need staff here now. Hurry.

413
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,216
Laura?

414
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:57,294
Laura?

415
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:10,306
Laura?

416
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:12,573
Rose.

417
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:22,022
Laura?

418
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,361
Rose!

419
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:44,945
Rose?

420
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:47,706
Whoa! Oh, my God! Rose!
Rose! Whoa, whoa!

421
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:50,181
What the fuck?
Rose, put the knife down!

422
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,418
Rose!

423
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:15,075
Hi.

424
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,111
Rose?

425
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,180
This is a surprise.

426
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,580
It wasn't so much the blood.

427
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:27,956
It was, um...

428
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:30,925
her face.

429
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:32,862
The look that she had.

430
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,359
How did it make you feel?

431
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,131
Uh...

432
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,529
Terrified, obviously.

433
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:43,796
Um...

434
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:46,304
Vulnerable.

435
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,141
Guilty.

436
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:49,670
Guilty?

437
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:52,276
Well, she was my patient.

438
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:56,445
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

439
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:58,481
Yeah. I just...

440
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:01,681
I just feel like
I've gotten stuck on it.

441
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:04,189
I can't, you know,
get it out of my head.

442
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,995
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

443
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:10,757
could actually be more about
your mother's suicide?

444
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:17,500
Do you still blame yourself?

445
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:21,008
That...

446
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:22,768
I'm really not trying
to relitigate

447
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,706
that part of my life
right now. So...

448
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:29,314
What would you like
to talk about?

449
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:36,420
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

450
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:44,065
Ever since that...

451
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,860
patient, I've been, um...

452
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,534
seeing things

453
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:54,240
and hearing things.

454
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:58,540
I'm sure it's just a symptom
of post-trauma.

455
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,115
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

456
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:04,987
What is it you've been seeing
and hearing?

457
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,487
Echoes of what happened
with my patient.

458
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:14,061
You know, just fleeting moments

459
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:16,427
of stress-induced
hallucinations.

460
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,795
But when they're happening,
they feel so...

461
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:27,042
corporeal and unsettling.

462
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:32,476
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

463
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,346
And certainly not psychotic.

464
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:38,250
It's my impression \hthis
experience with your patient

465
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,845
triggered old anxieties

466
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:42,155
compounded with too much
stress, not enough sleep.

467
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:45,962
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

468
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:51,296
And it is possible they never will
completely. That's the nature of trauma.

469
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:54,762
But you can learn
to get control over it.

470
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,205
Have you been continuing
to see patients

471
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,042
while you've been coping
with all this?

472
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:04,981
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo. I'm just taking
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\ha short hiatus. Good.

473
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,049
If you want my advice,

474
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,776
use this time
to do something different.

475
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,185
Anything that will
take your mind off

476
00:42:12,186 --> 00:42:14,451
the triggers
that are causing you stress.

477
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:17,994
I also think it would be helpful

478
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:21,657
if we resumed
our regular sessions again.

479
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:27,960
Sure.

480
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:35,703
And what about the Risperdal?
Just... You know.

481
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:39,477
Let's talk again next week
before we consider any medication.

482
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:43,877
In the meantime,
you can always call me.

483
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:48,948
Sure.

484
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:24,291
No, I asked you
for a white wine spritzer. Jesus.

485
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:28,327
\h\h\h\hOh, my God. You made it.
Hi. Surprise.

486
00:43:28,328 --> 00:43:29,890
Come on in. Come on in.
Oh.

487
00:43:30,726 --> 00:43:32,760
I thought you had to work?

488
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:35,367
Oh, I decided to take the
afternoon... \hl'll take that.

489
00:43:35,368 --> 00:43:37,072
Hey, Greg.
What are you doing?

490
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,503
I told you not to take
those out yet. Mmm, mmm.

491
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,175
Geez.

492
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:43,111
Uh, ladies, I have to go
corral my dipshit husband.

493
00:43:43,112 --> 00:43:45,938
Would one of you please show
my sister to the adult refreshments?

494
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:48,380
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

495
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,547
Wait.
You're that therapist, right?

496
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:51,845
Yes, I... I am.

497
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,682
Oh! Fantastic.
Can I ask for advice?

498
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:59,655
♪

499
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:04,891
♪

500
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,059
♪

501
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,726
So cool.

502
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,960
Harper.
Harper's mom.

503
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,935
Ooh, that one's from Aunt Rose.

504
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:51,972
Open it!

505
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:54,480
Rip it open!

506
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:11,200
What'd you get, sweetheart?

507
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,413
No. No.

508
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:30,945
Oh, my God.
No, no. Mustache.

509
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:36,147
What the hell is wrong with you?

510
00:45:36,148 --> 00:45:37,853
This can't be happening.

511
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:46,267
No. No, no. No, I promise
you, this wasn't me.

512
00:45:46,268 --> 00:45:49,765
It wasn't.
It wasn't me, I swear.

513
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:52,834
You have to... You guys
have to believe me, please.

514
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:56,003
Somebody
please fucking believe me.

515
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,949
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

516
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,117
You see her.
You have to see her.

517
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:15,120
Please, Holly,
tell me that you see somebody.

518
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:16,331
Please.

519
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:26,241
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

520
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,496
\h Hey, Rose.

521
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:51,190
Fuck.

522
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:54,434
I heard you were brought
into the ER.

523
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,503
I wanted to come check on you.
How're you doing?

524
00:46:57,372 --> 00:46:58,999
Fine.

525
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,804
It was just an accident.
Thank you.

526
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:06,106
Yeah. They... They said that you
had had a anxiety attack.

527
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:09,449
Rose, I'll be honest with you,
I'm... I'm concerned.

528
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,011
And I... I mean this
as your friend,

529
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:13,244
but I really think you
should speak to someone.

530
00:47:13,245 --> 00:47:15,587
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

531
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:23,530
Rose, are you listening?

532
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:49,358
Wait.

533
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:52,184
I need to tell you something,

534
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:58,092
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

535
00:47:58,697 --> 00:47:59,763
Okay.

536
00:47:59,764 --> 00:48:00,963
Okay.

537
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:03,031
Um...

538
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:08,443
Something is happening to me.

539
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:15,208
And it's gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

540
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,278
Maybe we should just go inside.

541
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:23,491
No, wait. Just listen to me!
Sorry. Sorry.

542
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,790
I'm really sorry.

543
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:27,693
Okay, um...

544
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:31,367
Something is threatening me.

545
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:37,801
Some kind of a evil spirit,
or energy.

546
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:42,575
I... I don't really know
what it is, but...

547
00:48:42,576 --> 00:48:46,040
But I think that it...
It killed my patient.

548
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:50,484
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

549
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:54,423
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

550
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:57,052
And...

551
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,658
I'm just really scared

552
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,354
that something bad
is going to happen.

553
00:49:08,536 --> 00:49:10,637
I really need you
to say something.

554
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,541
What do you want me to say?

555
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,480
I want you to believe me.

556
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:21,680
Rose, you're talking about
a fucking ghost.

557
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:23,715
No, no, no. It's not...

558
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:25,179
It's not a ghost.

559
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,851
It's something else.

560
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,183
Okay.

561
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:34,287
I'm sorry.

562
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:36,498
I can't.

563
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:39,225
I cannot fucking do this
right now.

564
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,864
No. Trevor.

565
00:49:40,865 --> 00:49:43,098
Whoa, whoa, wait. \h\h\hNo,
no, no. Don't walk away.

566
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:45,803
I need you...

567
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:47,167
You're not listening
to what I am saying.

568
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,070
Okay, Rose.

569
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:53,371
What the fuck am I supposed to
say to respond to this right now?

570
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:55,912
Do you hear yourself? I mean,
Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

571
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,749
I am not crazy!

572
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,620
Sorry. Sorry.

573
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:02,348
But it's genetic, isn't it?

574
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:04,757
What?

575
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,353
Mental illness.

576
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,421
You can inherit it
from a parent.

577
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:11,565
I looked it up.

578
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:13,095
Why would you look that up?

579
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:16,735
Because...
I wanted to know

580
00:50:16,736 --> 00:50:20,069
what I was potentially
hitching my entire life to.

581
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,270
Is that so fucking unfair?

582
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:27,482
I'm going in the house.

583
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,913
No, no, no. Please,
Trevor. I'm in danger!

584
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:31,080
Rose.

585
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:33,950
Did you kill Mustache?
N... No!

586
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:37,723
No! That was not...
That was not me.

587
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:40,958
Then tell me,
what happened to him?

588
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:44,896
It was the thing.

589
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:48,063
Trevor, please.

590
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:49,934
Please. Please.

591
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,234
Please. Please.

592
00:52:07,913 --> 00:52:09,585
Rose.

593
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:20,024
Come here.

594
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:50,791
Rose.

595
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:55,059
Baby...

596
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:58,931
Please. Help me.

597
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:03,363
- \h\hMommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

598
00:53:06,037 --> 00:53:07,434
No, no, no.

599
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,811
Rose!

600
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:13,109
Look where you're going!

601
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,475
Are you crazy?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

602
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:39,532
Mrs. Muñoz?

603
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,074
At first,

604
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,374
I noticed small changes in him.

605
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:51,610
Then it all happened so fast.

606
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,053
He was on edge.

607
00:53:55,856 --> 00:53:57,319
Paranoid.

608
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:02,324
He would wake up in the
middle of the night, screaming.

609
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,735
I'd never heard him
scream before.

610
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,202
Then he just
stopped sleeping altogether.

611
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:18,669
I would catch him having
these conversations with himself.

612
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,342
He was seeing things.

613
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:22,574
Doing strange things

614
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:24,786
that he didn't even
seem to remember.

615
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,415
Then one morning he was gone.

616
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:33,091
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

617
00:54:36,688 --> 00:54:38,657
They asked me
to identify his body.

618
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,902
His face.

619
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:46,301
Twenty-five years of marriage,

620
00:54:46,302 --> 00:54:49,239
and that's what I have left
to remember him.

621
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:54,948
I'm so sorry.

622
00:55:05,827 --> 00:55:11,063
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things that he was seeing?

623
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:16,970
I'll show you.

624
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:30,676
I should take it all down,

625
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:33,745
but I can't stand being in here.

626
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,272
This is what Gabriel said
he saw.

627
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:07,614
He kept saying it was trying
to get inside of him.

628
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:12,783
That is Gabriel's brother.

629
00:56:12,784 --> 00:56:16,424
He died in an accident
20 years ago.

630
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:19,493
Gabriel never got over it.

631
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:21,627
How long had this been going on?

632
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,005
Ever since he got back from that damn
conference he would go to every year.

633
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,076
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

634
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,541
But no one reports on that.

635
00:56:35,983 --> 00:56:38,986
He watched someone
die by suicide?

636
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:41,648
Yes.

637
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:43,418
I assumed you knew this.

638
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:44,860
What was her name?

639
00:56:46,158 --> 00:56:48,589
I don't remember.
I'd have to find it.

640
00:56:51,757 --> 00:56:52,901
Um...

641
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:56,498
Did... Did he ever, um...

642
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,501
say why
all of this was happening?

643
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:03,978
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

644
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,475
What kind of reporter are you?

645
00:57:07,476 --> 00:57:12,018
Mrs. Muñoz,
your husband was not insane.

646
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:15,582
The things that he was seeing,
they're real. I've seen them.

647
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,486
What are you, a fucking nutcase?

648
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,158
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhat?
Some kind of morbid fanatic?

649
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,962
How fucking dare you?

650
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:23,623
No, please. Please.

651
00:57:23,624 --> 00:57:26,197
What happened to your
husband is happening to me.

652
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:28,430
Out of my house. I want
you out of my house, now.

653
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:30,828
\hJust please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

654
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:33,370
Get the fuck out of my house!

655
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,078
Oh, fuck. Shit.

656
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:25,092
Yeah?

657
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,759
Hey.

658
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:40,833
Come on in.

659
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:58,125
Finally got rid of
that ugly yellow couch.

660
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,622
Uh-huh.

661
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,361
So, uh, what's up?

662
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,528
I assume you're not here
to catch up

663
00:59:06,529 --> 00:59:09,532
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

664
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:13,667
\h\h\hl need a favor.

665
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:16,043
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

666
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:18,936
Terrific.
Yeah, let's hear that.

667
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:20,839
Uh, so, nine days ago,

668
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,414
a man named Gabriel Muñoz
killed himself.

669
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:30,222
I need to know if he had been involved
in any other recent police reports.

670
00:59:30,223 --> 00:59:32,884
Can you find that out?
Here, for me.

671
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:34,689
Come on. Are you serious?

672
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:38,923
This is my one day off.
Go to the station.

673
00:59:38,924 --> 00:59:40,365
Joel, please?

674
00:59:47,141 --> 00:59:48,307
Fine.

675
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:50,606
Goddamn it.

676
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:57,008
All right,
what was his name again?

677
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,384
Gabriel Muñoz.

678
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,427
All right.
I see the report on his death.

679
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,627
Yeah. There's another
incident report here

680
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:15,168
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

681
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:18,336
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhat
was it for? He gave a witness statement.

682
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:20,998
He was staying at a hotel where
a woman committed suicide.

683
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:23,903
Okay, um... And what was
her name? The woman?

684
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:29,380
Um,

685
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:31,382
Angela Powell.

686
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:33,010
She's a real estate agent.

687
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,221
What is this?

688
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:38,390
\h\hFuck.
What? What is it?

689
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:40,919
It's a picture from the scene.

690
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,020
Let me see it.
No.

691
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:44,725
Let me see it.
No, no.

692
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,661
Look, you don't wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

693
01:00:46,662 --> 01:00:48,961
Or, just, you know, have at it.

694
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:53,603
Holy shit.

695
01:00:55,066 --> 01:00:56,936
Told you it was gross.

696
01:00:58,938 --> 01:01:00,181
Okay, um...

697
01:01:02,073 --> 01:01:05,383
Okay, uh, I need you to do the same
search again, but this time on her.

698
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:06,846
The woman, Angela.

699
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:08,584
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

700
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:11,686
Joel, you said you weren't
gonna ask me any questions.

701
01:01:11,687 --> 01:01:13,886
No. You said I wouldn't
ask you any questions.

702
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:15,856
Joel, I need your help.

703
01:01:16,824 --> 01:01:18,133
Okay?

704
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:22,566
Please?

705
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,147
\h

706
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:41,584
Hmm.

707
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:43,223
There was a previous report

708
01:01:43,224 --> 01:01:45,754
filed four days
before her death.

709
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,657
That's a weird coincidence.

710
01:01:48,658 --> 01:01:51,023
She was also interviewed
about a suicide.

711
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:03,310
What is this?
Is that a video file?

712
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:09,106
It's, um,
security camera footage.

713
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:12,286
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPut it...
Put it on. Just... It's... It's loading.

714
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,023
What the fuck is this?

715
01:02:56,363 --> 01:02:58,496
You know,
my day was going just fine.

716
01:02:58,497 --> 01:03:00,630
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCan you rewind it?
Really?

717
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:02,270
Rewind it, Joel.

718
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:08,606
Okay, stop.

719
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:16,977
Is he smiling?

720
01:03:26,217 --> 01:03:28,120
Rose, who are these people?

721
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,899
I have to go.

722
01:03:38,669 --> 01:03:40,132
Where are you going?

723
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,872
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

724
01:03:44,873 --> 01:03:46,412
I'm so confused right now.

725
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:48,008
Can you do me one more favor?

726
01:03:48,712 --> 01:03:50,208
Do you have a printer?

727
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:31,524
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

728
01:04:32,723 --> 01:04:33,921
Hey.

729
01:04:33,922 --> 01:04:35,462
Hi, Rose.

730
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:40,059
What is this?
What is she doing here?

731
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,929
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

732
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,932
I was talking to my fiancé.

733
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:46,638
I called her.

734
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:49,839
Why?

735
01:04:51,445 --> 01:04:55,976
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

736
01:04:55,977 --> 01:04:57,384
I... I don't...

737
01:04:57,385 --> 01:04:59,012
And I... I didn't know
what else to do.

738
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:00,685
Are you fucking kidding me?

739
01:05:02,313 --> 01:05:05,722
I came to you, the person I'm
supposed to trust most in the world,

740
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:09,859
and I... I confided
that I was scared to death.

741
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:13,159
That I needed you.

742
01:05:14,897 --> 01:05:16,997
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

743
01:05:16,998 --> 01:05:19,604
No. Why do you think
I even called her?

744
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:21,837
All I'm trying to do here
is help you.

745
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,873
No! All you're trying to do is make
it so you don't have to deal with it.

746
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:28,646
You're fine as long as
everything is easy and agreeable,

747
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:31,143
but God forbid
anything become real,

748
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,980
or even a tiny bit difficult.

749
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:35,279
And... And you just...

750
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,854
You just think about how it's gonna fuck
up your whole little perfect life plan.

751
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:41,824
Are you serious right now?
\hYeah.

752
01:05:41,825 --> 01:05:44,355
If that's how you feel,
then why are we even together?

753
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,829
Maybe I just don't know.

754
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,435
Why don't we all
just take a breath...

755
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:51,438
Why don't you just
fucking make yourself at home!

756
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:54,200
Rose, are you
actually leaving right now?

757
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:08,048
Greg. Rose, what
are you doing here?

758
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:09,379
Is Holly here?
I need to talk to her.

759
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,150
I don't think
that's a good idea.

760
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:13,251
Greg, let me talk
to my fucking sister. Holly!

761
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:14,857
You're gonna come
and talk to me like that?

762
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:16,661
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

763
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,355
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo, I don't think...
Can I please talk to you?

764
01:06:18,356 --> 01:06:20,159
I don't think this is a
good idea. Honestly.

765
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,029
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHolly.

766
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,066
Just go the fuck inside.
I don't... All right. Fine.

767
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,398
Jesus.

768
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:30,005
Okay, okay, okay.

769
01:06:32,546 --> 01:06:33,844
How are you?

770
01:06:34,713 --> 01:06:38,277
My eyes are open now.

771
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,314
I have been cursed.

772
01:06:42,787 --> 01:06:43,952
Okay, uh...

773
01:06:43,953 --> 01:06:45,954
Or somehow wrapped up
in a curse.

774
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:48,088
I... I got it from my patient.

775
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:51,762
She was cursed, and then when
she died, she... she transferred it to me.

776
01:06:51,763 --> 01:06:57,263
And now I'm being threatened
by this... this entity.

777
01:06:58,066 --> 01:06:59,605
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBy an entity?
No, no.

778
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:01,365
It... It's what killed Mustache.

779
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:04,742
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

780
01:07:04,743 --> 01:07:07,273
Nobody else can see it,
except for me.

781
01:07:07,779 --> 01:07:08,911
Jesus Christ.

782
01:07:08,912 --> 01:07:10,110
No, look, Holly,

783
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:12,244
I know it's so hard to believe,

784
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:14,917
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

785
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:16,754
But look... look at this. Look.

786
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:20,219
Oh, my God. Rose. Why
the fuck do you have that?

787
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,056
Because this has happened
to other people.

788
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:23,563
And they're all dead.
Rose.

789
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:25,092
And I...
Holly, I'm gonna be next!

790
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:27,391
Rose, curses are not real.

791
01:07:27,392 --> 01:07:29,537
Okay? You are
having some sort of a...

792
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,902
A breakdown.

793
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:35,675
What? No, no. Holly.

794
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:37,808
You're not hearing me.

795
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:40,646
You are not hearing me.
Rose.

796
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:43,474
This is exactly
what happened to Mom.

797
01:07:48,787 --> 01:07:50,382
You sound just like her.

798
01:07:55,827 --> 01:07:57,664
How the fuck
would you know that?

799
01:07:58,258 --> 01:07:59,533
I'm sorry, what?

800
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,326
You were never around
when Mom got bad.

801
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,097
Where the fuck were you
when she died?

802
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:05,836
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

803
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:08,707
Okay? Because I was older, I
got the worst of Mom's insanity.

804
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,368
I had to fucking
leave the house.

805
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:13,240
That was the only way
I... I could survive.

806
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,815
And I'm... I'm sorry

807
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:22,116
\hthat I left you alone and that
you had to be \hthe one to find her.

808
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:24,383
I know that
that fucked you up, and...

809
01:08:25,516 --> 01:08:26,956
And I know that that's not fair.

810
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:28,628
I wish I could do
something about it,

811
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:31,059
but, Rose, I have tried so
hard to move on with my life,

812
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,160
to leave all of that shit
behind me, okay?

813
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:35,525
You, it's like
you can't accept the fact

814
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:37,835
that Mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

815
01:08:37,836 --> 01:08:39,430
And you let it
define your entire life,

816
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:41,300
and you punish me
because I don't want to.

817
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:44,072
Well, I'm sorry that I'm
actually trying to help people

818
01:08:44,073 --> 01:08:47,845
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

819
01:08:47,846 --> 01:08:52,147
who lives in her own
\h\hself-centered, smug little bubble!

820
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,890
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOkay.
I don't know why I said that.

821
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:04,455
You know what, I'm... I'm not
doing this. I'm not doing this with you.

822
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,766
You've completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

823
01:09:08,196 --> 01:09:10,737
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

824
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:23,442
Fuck.

825
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:26,016
Fuck.

826
01:09:54,748 --> 01:09:56,783
Holly?

827
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,895
Fuck! Fuck!

828
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:16,165
Fuck!

829
01:10:16,803 --> 01:10:18,530
Motherfucker!

830
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:28,203
Joel?
Why didn't you tell me

831
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:31,008
about your patient's
connection to the others?

832
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:32,845
Wha... \hAfter you
left, \hl kept digging.

833
01:11:32,846 --> 01:11:34,638
These cases?

834
01:11:34,639 --> 01:11:36,409
This same pattern.
It goes back further.

835
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:39,379
\hSo far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

836
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,480
with a direct line
linking them all together.

837
01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:44,351
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

838
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:45,990
Holy shit.

839
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:49,488
Wait, you said, um, 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

840
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:51,226
One of the cases
mixes up the pattern.

841
01:11:51,227 --> 01:11:53,228
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

842
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:55,560
His business partner commits
suicide right in front of him,

843
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,199
and four days later, Talley goes

844
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,168
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met before,

845
01:11:59,169 --> 01:12:00,532
completely out of the blue.

846
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:02,809
But get this, a week later,

847
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,635
the key eyewitness to the murder

848
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:06,736
also commits suicide.

849
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:08,078
Pattern resumes.

850
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:10,113
\hSo, he's alive?
Yeah.

851
01:12:10,114 --> 01:12:11,643
He's sitting in holding
in Al to on a.

852
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,283
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

853
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:43,047
I'm gonna need you
\hto say something.

854
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,708
Yeah, I... I will.

855
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,446
Just... Just...

856
01:12:48,482 --> 01:12:50,120
Give me a second.
I mean, Jesus...

857
01:12:50,121 --> 01:12:52,551
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

858
01:12:52,552 --> 01:12:55,224
\hcrazy suicide cult,
or blackmail scheme.

859
01:12:55,225 --> 01:12:57,964
I mean, this? This is...
This? This is... Hey, Joel.

860
01:13:00,098 --> 01:13:01,428
Okay.

861
01:13:01,429 --> 01:13:03,760
Let's just put aside
the possibility

862
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:05,234
that some sort of evil,

863
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:06,973
extraordinary force
could even exist.

864
01:13:08,106 --> 01:13:09,370
What you're saying

865
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:11,537
is that this thing
\his jumping around

866
01:13:11,538 --> 01:13:12,912
from person to person,

867
01:13:12,913 --> 01:13:15,343
and it is causing them
to kill themselves?

868
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:17,741
Okay,
but maybe it's not suicide.

869
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:19,050
What do you mean?

870
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:21,547
Okay. So, my patient,
she was terrified,

871
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:23,252
but she was not suicidal.

872
01:13:23,253 --> 01:13:26,486
And then at... at the end,
everything about her changed.

873
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:32,097
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

874
01:13:33,362 --> 01:13:37,399
And something else
had taken over.

875
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,107
So, it's kind of like the guy...

876
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:45,010
Yes... on the security
camera footage?

877
01:13:45,011 --> 01:13:47,078
Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

878
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:49,884
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

879
01:13:56,022 --> 01:13:58,354
In the cases that you found,
um...

880
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:04,063
how long was it
between each victim's death?

881
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:10,366
None of them survived
longer than a week.

882
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:17,703
Some of them didn't even
\hmake it past four days.

883
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,117
Today was my fourth day.

884
01:14:26,987 --> 01:14:28,252
Hey.

885
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:30,880
Whatever happened
to those people,

886
01:14:30,881 --> 01:14:32,817
it's not gonna happen to you.

887
01:14:35,622 --> 01:14:36,788
I promise.

888
01:14:57,644 --> 01:14:59,579
Transfer guard to gate three.

889
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,515
Transfer guard to gate three.

890
01:15:01,516 --> 01:15:02,747
Thank you.

891
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,155
Give them a buzz through.

892
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:06,323
\h\hThey're clear.

893
01:15:07,324 --> 01:15:08,918
I owe you one for this, Doug.

894
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:11,756
You're just lucky
that he fired every lawyer

895
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,098
he was assigned.

896
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:15,364
You do know
what this guy did, right?

897
01:15:15,365 --> 01:15:17,564
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

898
01:15:17,565 --> 01:15:19,269
on a similar case for us.

899
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,239
Oh. Well, Talley's
a whole box of fruit loops.

900
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,867
So, good luck.

901
01:15:23,868 --> 01:15:25,902
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

902
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:28,113
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

903
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:29,907
Well, I appreciate it.

904
01:16:05,085 --> 01:16:07,911
Mr. Talley, my name
is Dr. Rose Cotter,

905
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:11,651
and, um, I was hoping
you'd be willing to

906
01:16:11,652 --> 01:16:13,719
answer some questions about...

907
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,227
I'm done answering questions.
I confessed.

908
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:19,725
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

909
01:16:19,726 --> 01:16:25,072
What I need to know is what you
experienced in the days leading up to it.

910
01:16:30,275 --> 01:16:32,046
I have a patient,

911
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:34,477
a young woman.

912
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:37,611
Four days ago,

913
01:16:37,612 --> 01:16:40,350
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

914
01:16:40,351 --> 01:16:47,094
And ever since then, she has
been seeing something.

915
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:51,395
Something that pretends
to be other people.

916
01:16:52,231 --> 01:16:55,299
The man that
she saw kill himself,

917
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,501
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

918
01:16:59,502 --> 01:17:01,833
What the fuck
do you want from me, huh?

919
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:04,210
What is it?
I don't know.

920
01:17:05,376 --> 01:17:06,508
I don't know.

921
01:17:06,509 --> 01:17:07,938
Why is it that everybody else

922
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:10,809
who's seen it is dead
and you're alive?

923
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:12,184
Why? Please.

924
01:17:12,185 --> 01:17:14,517
Mr. Talley, you
can help her. Okay?

925
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:16,222
Please.

926
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,986
Make the cop leave.

927
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:25,659
Not gonna happen, pal.

928
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:29,301
Make him leave,
and I'll tell you what I know.

929
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:34,031
Joel, please.

930
01:17:39,674 --> 01:17:41,412
I'll be outside, all right?

931
01:17:54,326 --> 01:17:57,757
I tried to research anything and
everything I could about this thing.

932
01:17:57,758 --> 01:18:00,199
There's been other chains
in the past.

933
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,027
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

934
01:18:05,832 --> 01:18:08,637
A man there escaped that chain

935
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:13,378
by killing his neighbor and
passing it to his neighbor's wife.

936
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,513
Your patient is going to die

937
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:19,977
unless she kills someone.

938
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:22,486
That's the only way
you can get rid of it.

939
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:24,916
The only way.

940
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:27,391
She has to make sure there's
a witness for it to pass to,

941
01:18:27,392 --> 01:18:29,558
'cause this thing needs trauma
to spread.

942
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:33,298
That's what gives it power.
Trauma.

943
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:36,059
Your patient has to
make it count.

944
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,699
Tell her to use
some kind of weapon.

945
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,800
Make the biggest mess she can...

946
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:43,672
I can't kill someone!

947
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:46,213
You?

948
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,139
You have it?

949
01:18:50,547 --> 01:18:54,319
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

950
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,079
You're not giving it back to me.

951
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,147
Get out of here!
I'm sorry.

952
01:18:58,148 --> 01:18:59,456
Get out of here!

953
01:18:59,457 --> 01:19:01,392
Get her away from me!

954
01:19:01,393 --> 01:19:03,955
Get her away from me!

955
01:19:03,956 --> 01:19:06,056
Get her away from me!

956
01:19:06,057 --> 01:19:07,893
Get her away from me!

957
01:19:15,066 --> 01:19:16,342
Hey.

958
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:19,004
Hey! Wait.

959
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,909
\h\h\hWhat happened in there?
Nothing.

960
01:19:23,646 --> 01:19:25,043
What'd he say?

961
01:19:26,682 --> 01:19:27,914
Nothing.

962
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:30,619
Nothing?

963
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:32,589
He's out of his fucking mind,
Joel.

964
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:18,464
Ah, fuck.

965
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:15,311
What are you doing here?

966
01:22:15,312 --> 01:22:17,280
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

967
01:22:17,281 --> 01:22:19,018
That was the wrong approach.

968
01:22:19,019 --> 01:22:20,184
\h\h\hl'm sorry.
Yeah.

969
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,560
I think you should go.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRose.

970
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:25,464
We both know I have a
responsibility to notify the authorities

971
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:27,961
if you're a danger
to yourself or others.

972
01:22:27,962 --> 01:22:30,800
I need you to help convince me
you're not a danger.

973
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:46,211
Trevor mentioned \hthere
had been \htalk of ghosts.

974
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,555
I never used the word
"ghosts."

975
01:22:51,117 --> 01:22:53,790
Evil beings, then.
Paranormal.

976
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,664
I admitted to him that I was seeing
things, the same thing that I told you.

977
01:23:00,665 --> 01:23:02,259
That's not happening anymore.
Okay?

978
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,999
It was stress and lack of sleep.

979
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,772
I confided in him, and that
was obviously a mistake.

980
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,004
But that's it.

981
01:23:11,005 --> 01:23:12,974
Okay? Are we good?

982
01:23:14,338 --> 01:23:16,482
How are you feeling today?

983
01:23:20,014 --> 01:23:21,312
Let me think, um...

984
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,854
I'm pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I'm crazy.

985
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:31,662
My sister has just
totally shut me out.

986
01:23:31,663 --> 01:23:33,159
And now

987
01:23:34,028 --> 01:23:35,600
my former therapist

988
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:38,999
is making unannounced
house calls

989
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,507
to ensure that
I am not a danger.

990
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:45,171
So, other than that,
I'm really good.

991
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,919
Should you get that?

992
01:24:02,089 --> 01:24:03,353
What?

993
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:06,026
Rose, it's Madeline.

994
01:24:06,027 --> 01:24:09,029
I've been trying your mobile
all morning.

995
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:11,868
I'm very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.

996
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:17,401
Rose? Are you there?
\h\h\h\h\h\hNo.

997
01:24:22,648 --> 01:24:23,979
Hello?

998
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:26,520
\h\h\h\h\h\hNo.
Rose?

999
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,313
No. No.

1000
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,525
Almost time, Rose.

1001
01:24:32,955 --> 01:24:34,792
What the fuck are you?

1002
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:39,565
Ple... Please.

1003
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:44,395
No, no.

1004
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:47,101
No. No, no.

1005
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,504
No.

1006
01:26:04,508 --> 01:26:06,476
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

1007
01:26:06,477 --> 01:26:08,951
Aren't you supposed to be
on leave?

1008
01:26:08,952 --> 01:26:11,482
Just grabbing something
from my office.

1009
01:26:51,027 --> 01:26:53,095
Carl. Hi.

1010
01:26:57,099 --> 01:26:58,737
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo.
No. It's okay.

1011
01:26:58,738 --> 01:27:00,332
No, no, no.

1012
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,169
It's okay.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, God.

1013
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,336
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

1014
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:06,635
Shh. Shh. Just calm down.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo! No, no!

1015
01:27:06,636 --> 01:27:09,781
No! No!
Shh! Shut the fuck up.

1016
01:27:11,245 --> 01:27:12,916
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

1017
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:14,182
Rose.

1018
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:16,315
What are you doing here?

1019
01:27:19,759 --> 01:27:21,288
I don't know.

1020
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:25,325
Rose, you can't
be around patients.

1021
01:27:57,962 --> 01:27:59,656
Fuck! Rose!

1022
01:28:19,676 --> 01:28:22,645
Fuck!

1023
01:28:31,831 --> 01:28:33,360
\h

1024
01:28:37,463 --> 01:28:39,399
Rose, what are you doing here?

1025
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:41,434
Nothing.

1026
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:44,205
I don't... I don't know.

1027
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:47,241
I don't know why. I, uh...

1028
01:28:47,242 --> 01:28:49,573
Why don't we go inside together
and we can just talk?

1029
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,179
No! It's...

1030
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,741
It's not safe.

1031
01:28:52,742 --> 01:28:54,886
Rose, I don't think you should
be alone right now.

1032
01:28:54,887 --> 01:28:56,515
I need... I need to be alone.

1033
01:28:58,682 --> 01:29:00,794
I need to be...
I need to be alone.

1034
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:05,623
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1035
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:10,231
Rose, I don't think you should
go anywhere, okay?

1036
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:12,762
You just relax, I'm gonna make
a phone call, all right?

1037
01:29:14,467 --> 01:29:16,039
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

1038
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,502
Wait. Rose, please.

1039
01:29:17,503 --> 01:29:19,504
Please don't go anywhere, okay?
Just hang...

1040
01:29:19,505 --> 01:29:21,848
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

1041
01:29:47,907 --> 01:29:50,975
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJoel.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRose, I saw a police APB go out for you

1042
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:52,977
that says you're dangerous.
What the fuck happened?

1043
01:29:52,978 --> 01:29:54,242
I know what I need to do.
\hWhat?

1044
01:29:54,243 --> 01:29:57,311
This thing, it needs
all of its victims

1045
01:29:57,312 --> 01:29:59,082
to pass it on
in order to survive,

1046
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:02,151
but if there's no one else
around, it has no way to pass.

1047
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:03,647
As long as I'm alone,

1048
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,319
I can deprive it
of what it needs.

1049
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,024
That doesn't make any sense.

1050
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:09,290
\hYour plan is just to
avoid people forever?

1051
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:12,030
I am not gonna
keep running, okay?

1052
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:14,427
I've got to face it.

1053
01:30:14,428 --> 01:30:16,759
Okay, Rose, I'm coming to you.
Just tell me where...

1054
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:48,246
Rose.

1055
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,944
Baby...

1056
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:01,292
Help me, please.

1057
01:34:05,197 --> 01:34:07,595
Mommy made a mistake.

1058
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:16,065
Get the phone.

1059
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:19,035
Call for help.

1060
01:34:29,221 --> 01:34:31,157
Rose!

1061
01:38:42,936 --> 01:38:45,378
Rose.

1062
01:38:50,845 --> 01:38:52,341
It's okay, baby.

1063
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:54,343
Come here.

1064
01:39:05,662 --> 01:39:09,259
I am so sorry.

1065
01:39:11,734 --> 01:39:13,835
I... I haven't been a good mom.

1066
01:39:17,036 --> 01:39:22,073
I want to be.
I really try to be.

1067
01:39:22,074 --> 01:39:28,212
But sometimes
everything is just too much.

1068
01:39:29,587 --> 01:39:33,085
There is something terrible
inside of me.

1069
01:39:34,053 --> 01:39:37,628
I hate myself.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1070
01:39:38,255 --> 01:39:39,861
Are you ashamed of me?

1071
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:42,259
No.

1072
01:39:42,996 --> 01:39:44,602
Then why did you let me die?

1073
01:39:48,606 --> 01:39:51,003
\hWhy didn't you save me?
It's not my fault.

1074
01:39:51,004 --> 01:39:53,808
You could have called for help.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hStop. Stop it.

1075
01:39:53,809 --> 01:39:55,843
\hBut you didn't.
Stop it.

1076
01:39:55,844 --> 01:39:58,747
You wished that I would die.
Because I was afraid of you!

1077
01:39:58,748 --> 01:40:01,454
I was ten years old

1078
01:40:02,653 --> 01:40:04,853
and you were a monster.

1079
01:40:07,383 --> 01:40:12,388
And I know that it's not fair.
You... You needed help.

1080
01:40:14,027 --> 01:40:15,468
But I couldn't.

1081
01:40:20,396 --> 01:40:22,475
And I have carried that guilt

1082
01:40:23,707 --> 01:40:26,941
for my entire life.

1083
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:33,849
And I... I have to let it go.

1084
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:37,721
I ha... I have to let it go.

1085
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:46,191
This is not real.

1086
01:40:46,994 --> 01:40:48,962
But Rose,

1087
01:40:48,963 --> 01:40:53,132
your mind makes it real.

1088
01:40:57,433 --> 01:40:58,775
What are you?

1089
01:40:59,974 --> 01:41:01,976
Why are you doing this to me?

1090
01:41:02,779 --> 01:41:04,341
Because your mind...

1091
01:41:05,276 --> 01:41:07,619
...is so inviting.

1092
01:41:58,461 --> 01:42:02,332
You can't escape
your mind, Rose.

1093
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:04,268
\h

1094
01:42:09,615 --> 01:42:10,583
It's...

1095
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:14,752
- It's my mind.
- \h\h\h\h\h\h\h

1096
01:42:22,089 --> 01:42:23,893
You can't escape it either.

1097
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,240
Rose!

1098
01:42:44,012 --> 01:42:45,651
Rose!

1099
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:11,033
Holy shit.

1100
01:44:13,596 --> 01:44:15,267
Are you okay?

1101
01:44:15,268 --> 01:44:17,875
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCan I just
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hcome in for a sec? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1102
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,443
Where have you been?

1103
01:44:29,953 --> 01:44:31,757
I'm sorry.

1104
01:44:33,484 --> 01:44:39,192
I'm sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

1105
01:44:41,459 --> 01:44:43,295
For most of my life,

1106
01:44:43,296 --> 01:44:49,500
I've been afraid of
letting people get too close,

1107
01:44:50,501 --> 01:44:52,811
because I was afraid of...

1108
01:44:55,847 --> 01:44:58,640
what they might see
if they really looked.

1109
01:44:58,641 --> 01:45:03,711
And so I... I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

1110
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:07,925
And then...

1111
01:45:11,357 --> 01:45:12,962
I met you,

1112
01:45:12,963 --> 01:45:16,900
and I could feel
those walls coming down.

1113
01:45:16,901 --> 01:45:19,937
And it scared the shit
out of me.

1114
01:45:22,841 --> 01:45:24,304
And so...

1115
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:31,949
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

1116
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:37,086
And I am so, so sorry.

1117
01:45:38,549 --> 01:45:43,256
And I'm... I'm being selfish
again by even asking,

1118
01:45:43,257 --> 01:45:44,686
but do you think that...

1119
01:45:44,687 --> 01:45:47,657
That I could stay here
and just...

1120
01:45:49,934 --> 01:45:51,364
just sleep?

1121
01:45:54,532 --> 01:45:55,874
Could you...

1122
01:45:57,568 --> 01:46:00,307
stay with me while I sleep?

1123
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:04,850
Please.

1124
01:46:06,577 --> 01:46:08,744
Yeah, of course
I'll stay with you.

1125
01:46:16,785 --> 01:46:18,754
I'll stay with you forever.

1126
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,366
No.

1127
01:46:33,406 --> 01:46:34,770
No.

1128
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:37,146
No, no, no, no.

1129
01:46:38,114 --> 01:46:39,213
No, no.

1130
01:46:53,965 --> 01:46:55,131
No.

1131
01:47:19,551 --> 01:47:21,553
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h Rose.

1132
01:47:24,622 --> 01:47:27,229
No, no, no!

1133
01:47:34,973 --> 01:47:36,974
Rose!
No.

1134
01:47:36,975 --> 01:47:38,944
Rose, open the door!

1135
01:47:40,836 --> 01:47:43,872
\hOpen the door.

1136
01:47:45,346 --> 01:47:46,874
Rose!

1137
01:47:56,852 --> 01:47:59,723
No!

1138
01:48:00,493 --> 01:48:03,660
\hNo!
Fuck. Uh...

1139
01:48:03,661 --> 01:48:05,332
Hold on. I'm coming!

1140
01:48:05,333 --> 01:48:07,940
No!

1141
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,604
Rose!

1142
01:48:15,145 --> 01:48:17,806
No!

1143
01:48:59,255 --> 01:49:00,619
Rose.

1144
01:49:34,884 --> 01:49:36,127
Rose?

1145
01:49:42,397 --> 01:49:43,332
Rose?

1145
01:49:44,305 --> 01:50:44,940
