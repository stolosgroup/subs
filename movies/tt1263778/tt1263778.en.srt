00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
What?

3
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,331
Well, Miss Fancy School,
not very chatty today?

4
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,438
Why did you change school?

5
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,639
Didn't they want you anymore?
Or you weren't up to scratch?

6
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,107
You OK?

7
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:12,748
Forget it.

8
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,545
I warned you, he's a real dick.

9
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,065
Just don't show him you're upset.

10
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,798
I'll introduce you
Henri, Junie, my cousin.

11
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:25,157
- That's Otto in the scarf.
- Sorry for the welcome.

12
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:27,494
- And that's Jacob.
- Hello.

13
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,673
I'm Marie.
Sister of that pretentious cretin.

14
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,060
- And lastly Catherine.
- You don't have to remember my name.

15
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,872
If there's one name you should retain
it’s Catherine's.

16
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,671
- Him and his water!
- I know.

17
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,113
Henri, you and your damn water!

18
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,447
Yes, I had a great night too Nicole,
and it's thanks to you!

19
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,630
Sandrin, don't bump the girls please.

20
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,597
- Henri IV just let you go?
- They can't make you stay.

21
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,840
- Are courses better there?
- I'll let you know in a week.

22
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,752
- Kids, smoking's banned now you know!
- Come on Nicole, chill out.

23
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,897
Talk to the hand,
the face ain't listening.

24
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:42,302
Couldn't you have stayed at Henri IV
and live at home?

25
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,714
I'd made my mind up.
I had my reasons.

26
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,910
Maybe, but you weren't expecting this.

27
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,228
- Chocolate's up.
- Don't worry, she knows all about us.

28
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,428
She even doesn't mind Henri's hair.

29
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,147
Showing off in front of your cousin?
Buy me a coffee instead.

30
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,615
Leave him alone,
as if you never show off.

31
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,712
You told them
you're not going to Italy yet?

32
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,321
What's that shit?

33
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:09,647
Our dear parents said I mustn't
cost them money.

34
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,313
- That's not exactly it, Henri.
- Well that's the official version.

35
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,585
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I love you, my angel.

36
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,798
The people were shocked and
Luther was excommunicated in 1520.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,958
He spread his ideas in Germany
through printing.

38
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,630
Notably the idea that salvation
doesn't depend on charity...

39
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,229
Don't even think about it,
she's mine.

40
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,954
He went on to condemn indulgences.

41
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,472
These are remissions for punishments
sold by the Church to the faithful

42
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,399
to shorten their time in purgatory.

43
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,277
Money was spent on constructing
Saint Paul Church.

44
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,559
Other movements spread in Europe.

45
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,388
Zwingli preached Protestantism
in Switzerland.

46
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,478
Calvin lead the Reformed Church
in Geneva.

47
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,559
He put forward the theory
of pre-destination...

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,155
God chooses those who go to heaven,
and the individual can't change anything.

49
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,579
What a crock of shit!

50
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,810
If you don't mind Henri,
please make your comments constructive.

51
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,489
I appreciate strong views

52
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,321
but let's say there are at least
2 ways to see everything.

53
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,611
and no one can know the whole truth.

54
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,619
Point taken?
Good, let's continue.

55
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,738
Madame, excuse me... are you married?

56
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,409
No.

57
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,972
- But you have a boyfriend?
- Yes, but what's it to you?

58
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,779
- Do you love him deeply?
- Yes, deeply.

59
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,137
And you've never imagined
that you could just as well hate him?

60
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,969
No.

61
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,374
Well if that's really the case,

62
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,475
can we stop with all the bullshit
about 2 ways of seeing everything?

63
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,737
That little jerk is much too clever
and much too sexy.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,313
I'd like to bring him down a peg.

65
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,832
- You lied to him.
- Sorry!

66
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,565
- Mind my head.
- What?

67
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,498
You should have admitted it.

68
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,450
- You can both love and hate at once.
- If only I could.

69
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,585
Don't make me prove you can.

70
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,814
Go ahead and try.
But be careful, young man!

71
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,498
I could hurt you without hating you.

72
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:34,331
Florence! Does that mean they know?

73
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,730
- They know about us?
- That a problem?

74
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:38,897
I'd rather not.

75
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:40,837
I'd rather they didn't.

76
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,454
In that case, tell them yourself
that it's not you I love deeply.

77
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,410
Valois!

78
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,726
- Not you, your sister.
- What an idiot he is.

79
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,217
Tell me, you haven't said anything about me
to Henri have you?

80
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,329
Like what?

81
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,211
What I told you about Miss Perrin,
and about us too.

82
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,967
Of course, I told him everything,
what do you expect?

83
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,694
I'm class rep.

84
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,409
If you do that, bitch.
it's over between us.

85
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:47,115
- ־.
- Do you understand me?

86
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,849
- Ciao, bellora
- Eh, cretino, come va?

87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,497
- Go do your math my friend.
- Yes, the mathematico. Aspeta.

88
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,108
- Aspeta what?
- I dunno!

89
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,359
Aspeta means wait.

90
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,306
Hello. Avanti, populo!

91
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,595
- The math teacher is back.
- Well then we're cool.

92
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,584
- Are you going to skip math too?
- No, we're going.

93
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,454
I want you to know I'm screwing Mathias.

94
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:35,256
- Does Henri know?
- No, of course not.

95
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,770
That's why I'm telling you.

96
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,077
Mathias is worried you'll find out.

97
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,636
He wants to protect you,
and that bugs me, see?

98
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,440
I want to carry on seeing him.
Well now you know.

99
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm trusting you,
and if you betray me, watch out.

100
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,577
Do we have to do that now?
Does that matter?

101
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,132
Has to be done for tomorrow.
Or else you won't be in it.

102
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,116
Take that off.
You'll see, Jacob's very talented.

103
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,756
Isn't this a bit much for her first day?

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,956
It's OK, my cousin's not that delicate
We need to talk.

105
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,773
- What about?
- We'll be right back.

106
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,118
Wait, stop giggling.

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,868
Look at me. Towards me, a bit more.

108
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,910
Don't move. Stay like that.

109
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,122
You have such fair skin.

110
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,077
OK, good, that's it, let's go.

111
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,578
- I'm not done.
- Too bad, Cartier-Bresson.

112
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,129
- You won't have enough light.
- Wait! One without the sweater.

113
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,081
Come on, let's pack up.

114
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,305
I'm not coming with you tonight.

115
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,238
Fine, no questions asked.

116
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,968
I want to tell her something.

117
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,529
Are you always so perfect?

118
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,890
What do you mean?

119
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,938
Nothing.

120
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,498
How about we do some more photos?

121
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,829
I've some great kit at my place.

122
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,535
- Have you seen Mathias?
- He's over there.

123
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,777
Thanks.
Excuse me, I forgot your name.

124
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:38,133
- It's Jeanne.
- OK, thanks Jeanne.

125
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,173
- Hey, Otto.
- Hey.

126
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,961
- What's up?
- My mom works up here, you know.

127
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,698
- Yes, you said.
- I'm going to meet her.

128
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,246
Well, we're nearly there.
How about we go for a coffee?

129
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,490
Sorry, I'd better get home.
I have stuff to do.

130
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:22,530
Yes but you can't go home ahead,
when I get in they'll kill me.

131
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,696
Doesn't matter, I'll just...
We'll do it tomorrow.

132
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,338
I'll just leave you a sec have to buy bread.
I promised Mom I'd buy some bread.

133
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,379
See you in a minute.

134
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,979
You OK?

135
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,738
That's nice.

136
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,898
You're not worn out?
They didn't drive you mad?

137
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,750
- I warn you, I'm quieter.
- Really?

138
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,965
Yes. I like to have fun, but within limits.

139
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,590
- My name's Otto by the way.
- Yes, I know, you said this morning.

140
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,948
- You might have forgotten.
- I didn't forget.

141
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:14,984
Junie, that's pretty.

142
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,575
It's in Racine, Neron's tormentor.

143
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,859
Yes, and fleeing him ends badly for her.

144
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,822
- She kills herself, no?
- No, she takes the vows.

145
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,133
And as a nun, she can no longer marry.

146
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:31,092
Otto... I don't think there's
a story with my name in it.

147
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,893
- Yes.
- I don't think so.

148
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,433
I'm sure there's an Otto in a novel.

149
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,444
Maybe in a kids' book.

150
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:42,265
The story of a rabbit called Otto
with burrow problems. Maybe.

151
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,385
- Talking literature?
- That's right.

152
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,695
Well, I'm off.
Enjoy your baguette.

153
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:47,696
Bye.

154
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,150
- So did he tell you?
- What?

155
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,156
He wants to go out with you.

156
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,226
Are you nuts?

157
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:00,579
He's such a drip!

158
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
Leave him alone.

159
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:05,702
Hey guys!

160
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,143
Hi Junie, how are you?

161
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,133
What's up with her?

162
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,021
She buried her mother a week ago.

163
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,979
And what about Otto?

164
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,669
I think it's off to a bad start.

165
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,305
Your turn, Jacob.

166
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:49,633
So Jacob...

167
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,103
- Absolutely.
- Yes, absolutely.

168
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,238
Can you explain to us your workings?

169
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:59,780
Uh, yeah. So... we stated U)x( = 0.12x
and v)x(=...

170
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,964
exponential of -1/60x...

171
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,919
The derivative of the function equals
the product of the 2 functions

172
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,319
and the derivative
of a function product...

173
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:13,198
Henri, do you mind?

174
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,407
Concentrate.

175
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,386
So we'll have to calculate
U')x( and V')x(.

176
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,423
"The virgin, vivid and beautiful today

177

183
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,493
Pass it to Junie.

00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:49,795
"... in the radiant boredom of

"how futile is exile for the swan. "

191
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,637
Would you take over please, Mathias.

192
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:22,375
<i>You idiot.
That's it. You haven’t done anything.</i>

193
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,263
"A swan of old remembers that it is he

198
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,065
For next time,
please revise the chapter on humanism.

199
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,499
Go on...

200
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,308
It's now-or never. Go for it.

201
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,218
I don't know what to say to her.

202
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,261
You look her in the eye
and tell her you love her

203
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,566
Isn't that a bit dumb?

204
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,838
- How do I kiss her?
- You don't deserve her.

205
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,562
I'm giving her to Jacob.

206
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:22,793
Go on, do it!

207
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,422
You're mean,
he's going to get a slap.

208
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,149
What are you looking at?

209
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,886
I love you Junie, from when I saw you.

210
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,767
That's the way it is.

211
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,335
Is that just to have me?

212
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,168
Not at all. I pledge myself to you.

213
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,520
Then don't let me down
and look after me, always.

214
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,701
Come in.

215
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,095
- You're late, young lady.
- Where shall I sit?

216
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,645
Mr Nemours, this is Junie de Chartres,
Mathias' cousin.

217
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,682
Hello. Come and sit next to me.

218
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,655
The libretto of Donizetti's
Lucia di Lammermoor

219
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,320
- is an adaptation from Walter Scott.
Anyone know Walter Scott?

220
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,344
Quentin Durward... Ivanhoe...

221
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,478
That'll do. Move on please.

222
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,391
It's based on a 17thC Scots story.

223
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,025
Can you slow down a bit please?

224
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,970
Enrico, Lucia di Lammermoor's brother,
wants her to marry Arturo.

225
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,201
It's a marriage of convenience,
like many of the time.

226
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,328
But Lucia refuses
because she's in love with another.

227
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,705
He's Edgardo,
and the two have vowed fidelity.

228
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,802
Enrico tells her Edgardo is cheating

229
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,135
so that she accepts the marriage.

230
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,560
On her wedding night,
she kills her husband in a fit of rage.

231
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,722
This is the passage I'll play.

232
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,678
It's a magnificent duo with flute
when the girl goes mad

233
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,238
with despair.

234
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,815
How does it end?

235
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,530
The usual. Lucia dies
and Edgardo kills himself.

236
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:08,043
Ready?

237
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,450
Try not to use the French translation.
Use the Italian text.

238
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,566
I've chosen Callas.

239
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,066
- Are you OK?
- Excuse me.

240
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,763
Let's carry on.

241
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,735
She moved in at my parents'
a week ago.

242
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,370
- What about her dad?
- That's another matter

243
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,610
But she's getting on all right, in fact.

244
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,821
Does she want to come on the trip?

245
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,095
I don't know, I haven't asked.

246
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,964
I wanted to ask you, if there's more
of us, is it cheaper?

247
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,682
No, if there's more than 20
we need another teacher.

248
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,644
The secretary doesn't want that.

249
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,741
She left her school things
Can you give them back to her?

250
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,090
There's only 16 of us.
Henri's not coming.

251
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,615
Why not?

252
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,129
That's bad if we're only 16.

253
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,968
There has to be 20 of us.
If we're down to 16, it's off.

254
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:45,516
Unless we invite others
We could open it up to Latin students.

255
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,650
No. There's 40 in the class.
How could I pick just 4?

256
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,675
- I was thinking...
- Could you think outside?

257
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,600
Why don't we organize a soccer match
between teachers and students?

258
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,055
I don't think so.

259
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,811
Or an inter-class
table-tennis tournament?

260
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,300
- Not that.
- We'll invite the parents...

261
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:07,716
- I'm going to...
- I'll tell you.

262
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:10,732
You're going to convince your cousin.
Then we'll be 17, OK?

263
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,361
We can do our French project together.

264
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,915
I can't work as a pair.

265
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:21,676
Shall we go?

266
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:23,658
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

267
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,092
Ciao, dude.

268
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,917
Bye Junie, see you tomorrow.

269
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,728
I don't get it. You spend all day
kissing, then you dump him.

270
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,203
Junie? Stop being such a bitch.

271
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,530
Don't give Otto the run around,
I'm sure he's sincere.

272
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,350
You're giving me sincerity lessons?

273
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,090
Save it for Esther and Catherine.

274
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:58,097
Otto's different.

275
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:01,020
So are you. At least I hope so.

276
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,930
And what about you?

277
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:07,375
I do the best I can.

278
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,527
You've kissed now,
that means something.

279
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,135
I know, but it's as if...

280
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,446
she only does it not to hurt me,
as if she pities me.

281
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,127
You always exaggerate.
Aren't you happy to have her?

282
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,161
I don't see how she can love me.

283
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,188
Give her a little time.

284
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,482
Why didn't she fall for me
at first sight?

285
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,205
Easy on the romanticism.

286
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,029
Call me tonight if you need to.
Ciao, big kiss.

287
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,109
Why are you here?

288
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,718
- Guess. Can I come up?
- No.

289
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,115
I want our relationship
to end here.

290
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,599
- Is it Miss Perrin?
- No, it's got nothing to do with Florence.

291
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,959
You've made your mind up,
and I have to keep my mouth shut?

292
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,160
See? You're already starting
to go on about it.

293
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:31,355
I don't want to talk.

294
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,678
Please, just leave it.

295
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,385
You're ashamed of me.
That's the truth, you're ashamed.

296
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,629
No, I'm not ashamed. I just want
our relationship to stop here.

297
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,756
I'm breaking it off.

298
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,434
4 quick fucks, call that a relationship?

299
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,360
Fine then. You screwed a teacher.

300
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,832
Why are you lying to me?
Why not say there's someone else?

301
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,721
- Who's next in line?
- Go on, go home.

302
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:08,845
- It's late, I'm tired.
- I'm not homeless.

303
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,245
Go on.

304
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,157
It doesn't mean
we have to be enemies, OK?

305
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,716
What do I tell the others?
They'll think I made it all up.

306
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,520
I wouldn't worry about that.

307
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:33,885
Do you know that joke.

308
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,878
Even a stopped clock is right
twice a day?

309
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,160
No. And I'm not sure I get the joke.

310
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:44,149
It's silly,

311
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,314
but it's very painful to leave you, Sir.

312
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,599
Come on, make a bit of space.

313
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,720
You should go shopping,
it's no good eating junk every night.

314
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:06,631
You're right, next time I'll do that.

315
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,155
- Is that the new one?
- Yeah.

316
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,556
- Pretty girl, huh?
- Very.

317
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,240
- She looks sweet. Junie, isn't it?
- Yes.

318
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:17,229
She left that in my class, so...

319
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,280
- You're going to give it back, I hope.
- No, I'm not.

320
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:24,840
Watch it, I've got my eye on you.

321
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,748
Young girls ought to be respected.

322
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,514
Loving them isn't disrespecting them.

323
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,558
You know very well what I mean.

324
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,918
You know very well what I mean.
They're fragile as glass at that age.

325
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,276
I get it, you're just jealous.

326
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,393
You want me to have a photo of you!

327
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,280
I haven't aroused desires in years.

328
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:57,269
Why's that?

329
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:58,491
Go and sit down.

330
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,275
I'm sure you have secret loves.

331
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,030
Go and sit down.

332
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,790
Go on. I haven't been
French-kissed in 23 years.

333
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,838
Now d’you get it?

334
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,200
- Can I see?
- Yes, of course.

335
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,365
Jacob, can you do me a print?

336
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,316
I gave one to Junie
You'll have to ask her if she minds.

337
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,955
- Otto? You’re 17 books overdue.
- Yeah, I know.

338
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,394
And did you know you therefore
undesirable in this library

339
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,501
- I’ll bring them back tomorrow
- Yes, do.

340
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,646
Goodbye.

341
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,868
So, Jacob.

342
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,320
Will you hold the ladder for me?

343
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:49,915
Mathias...

344
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,280
You don't want to give it to me?

345
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,005
Or have you already given it away?

346
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,634
Or you're keeping it to admire yourself?

347
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,276
I lost the photo.

348
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,391
- That a true lie?
- Yes.

349
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,237
- Did someone steal it?
- I don't know.

350
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,974
I find that woman beautiful,
very dignified.

351
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,703
Me too. I've always thought she was great.

352
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:29,633
And I've heard a few tales about her.

353
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,925
My aunt knows her
through mutual friends.

354
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,905
She told me a funny story.

355
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,560
- Want to hear it?
- Tell me.

356
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,792
She married young to this man
and they had a child.

357
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,160
The man got killed somehow
before the child was born.

358
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:46,675
I think he got murdered.

359
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,094
Everyone was sorry for her.

360
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:51,487
She was already at the school.

361
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,796
Everyone thought she was brave.

362
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,470
One day a new sport teacher arrived.
Sancerre, he's left now.

363
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,354
He fell for her. And she welcomed it.

364
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,440
But because of her child,
she didn't let him come home

365
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:08,150
And in school, she kept it a secret.

366
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,992
This went on for months.

367
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,840
The funny thing was that everyone thought
she was a heartbroken widow

368
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,035
when in fact she had this liaison.

369
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,750
- Then one day Estouteville...
- The math teacher?

370
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,230
The math teacher, a friend of Sancerre.

371
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,597
So Estouteville confides in Sancerre.

372
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,636
He tells him that for the past 6
months he's had a secret love affair.

373
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,582
Sancerre wanted to know who with.

374
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:40,806
After making him swear to secrecy,

375
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,513
Estouteville confessed that it was
Madame Tournon.

376
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,918
You never really know people,
even those you love.

377
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,155
- Any chance that I could interest you?
- I'll be right back.

378
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,873
Are you OK?

379
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,159
Yes, I'm fine.

380
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,676
I wanted to say sorry for last time.

381
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,885
I wanted to ask you something.

382
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,391
When I left my notebook on the table,
did I drop a photo?

383
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,114
A photo? A photo of what?

384
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,675
A photo of me.

385
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,999
I don't think so.

386
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,793
Doesn't matter.

387
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,235
Well, better go in then…

388
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,877
Good day!

389
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,388
What's going on?

390
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,989
There's only 15 now for the Italy trip.

391
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,631
Well, then it's off.
Who's not coming?

392
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,510
We'll just have to cancel.

393
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,948
Thanks very much.

394
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,794
The secretary will think I'm an idiot.

395
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,277
Junie, hand out the photocopies please.

396
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,994
Junie, can you start reading please?

397
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,713
Well?

398
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,680
Does that make you think of anything?

399
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,519
Nothing at all? It's part of our
series on Italian pop songs.

400
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,275
No one has any idea?

401
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,040
Shall I sing it for you?

402
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,914
Never mind.
I see you're being humiliating today.

403
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,246
Clever bunch.

404
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,749
Junie, start the translation please.

405
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,469
I sing to the rhythm
of your sweet breath,

406
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,117
It's spring,

407
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,596
It's because I love you.

408
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,078
A star falls down,

409
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,271
But tell me where we are.

410
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,472
What do you care?

411
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,035
It's because, I love you.

412
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,795
And fly, fly away,

413
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,271
Always higher we go,

414
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,750
And fly, fly with me

415
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,039
The world is crazy because,

416
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,791
And if there is no love,

417
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,396
All it takes is one song,

418
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,255
To spread confusion,

419
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,791
Around and inside you.

420
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:48,670
Hello.

421
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,316
- Here.
- Thanks.

422
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,876
- Is it working today?
- It only works with francs.

423
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,011
That's a shame.

424
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,878
This one's for you
But I warn you, it's not modern.

425
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,919
Nice, isn't it?

426
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,640
<i>She was so pretty</i>

427
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,800
<i>That I didn’t dare love her</i>

428
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,240
<i>She was so pretty</i>

429
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,160
<i>I can’t forget her</i>

430
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,440
<i>She was that pretty</i>

431
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,800
<i>When the wind took her away</i>

432
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,520
<i>She fled in rapture</i>

433
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,800
<i>And the wind whispered to me</i>

434
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,160
<i>She's much too pretty</i>

435
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,880
<i>And I know you too well</i>

436
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,160
<i>You could never love her</i>

437
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,440
<i>A whole life through</i>

438
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,280
<i>But then she left</i>

439
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,080
<i>It's crazy, yet it's true</i>

440
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,640
<i>She was so pretty</i>

441
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,080
<i>I'll never forget her</i>

442
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,800
<i>Now it's the autumn</i>

443
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,800
<i>And I weep often</i>

444
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,000
<i>Now it's the autumn</i>

445
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,400
<i>So far from the springtime</i>

446
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,080
<i>In the park where the cruel wind</i>

447
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,720
<i>Shakes the leaves</i>

448
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,680
<i>Her dress billows</i>

449
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,680
<i>And then disappears...</i>

450
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,559
Go on, tell me.

451
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,998
I don't know what to say.

452
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,392
- I don't want to moralize.
- Go on, say anyway.

453
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,040
In any case, you should be careful.
She seems a bit crazy.

454
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,029
You think so?

455
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,234
Always in control, and yet, so vibrant.

456
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,356
That sort scares me.

457
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,925
That's because she's...

458
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,449
- Sensitive?
- No, she's fragile.

459
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,756
I don't think that girl's fragile.

460
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,712
You can see she's a tough one.

461
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,960
You shouldn't fool around
with students. It's too easy.

462
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:10,713
It's not easy with her
You've got no idea.

463
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,725
- Is it over with Florence?
- Yes, it's over.

464
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,833
Over with Florence,
over with the others. Clean sweep.

465
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,836
I'm in a total love-sick mess.

466
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,635
I feel so ridiculous.

467
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,279
I'm just head-over-heels in love
It's completely stupid.

468
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,950
It's been such a long time
since I fell in love.

469
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,438
I haven't felt this for ages
You know,

470
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,671
your stomach all knotted up,
your chest on fire, your legs weak.

471
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,635
I know I've got to calm down,
get a grip,

472
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,111
but I can't, I just can't.

473
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,045
Sorry for pouring all this out on you.

474
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,675
But I can't talk about anything else
Want to change the subject?

475
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,549
Carry on, it's fine.

476
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,511
I don't want to whine on.

477
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,697
That girl will never love me.
She'll never love me.

478
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,595
I'm lying to myself too.
She can't not love me.

479
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,120
You seem more disappointed in love
than in the grip of love-at-first-sight.

480
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:53,109
Maybe...

481
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,717
Nicole!

482
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,038
We need some shots.

483
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,840
Vodka? Dubrovka?

484
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,474
There's Patrick, he's here all day.
How's it going Patrick?

485
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,028
- Here you go, Dubrovka. Good health.
- Spassiba.

486
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,743
Cheers.

487
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,469
Bottoms up.

488
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:25,361
That's it.

489
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,396
I don't want to embarrass you.

490
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,750
Let's get drunk,
we'll work it out later.

491
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,795
Embrace you? Embrace me?
You want to embrace me?

492
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,299
- Oh, embrace you?
- That's what you said.

493
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:42,514
No, I said embarrass you.

494
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,473
Long live Tibo and his wife!

495
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,872
Look Koudi...

496
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,229
She's not a responsible woman.

497
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,471
Let's go!

498
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,335
Do you think they saw us?

499
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,217
Sooner or later everyone will know.

500
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:23,075
Come on.

501
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,366
What a life!

502
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,036
Jeanne, can I talk to you?

503
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,995
- Have you got Nemours' letter?
- Yes.

504
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,039
- Can I have it?
- Here.

505
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,805
Have many people read it?

506
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,149
You bet, they were all over it.

507
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:42,709
Careful, there's Nemours.

508
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,416
Don't forget to give it back to Marie
She found it.

509
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,845
I love you too much to let you think
I can live without you.

510
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,960
Don’t care if you cheat on me
as long as you are honest and tell me.

511
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:41,057
I don’t care if you hide me away
as long as you come find me again.

512
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,620
I am patient. And while I await you
I will recall your whole body.

513
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,690
I'm even in love with your knees.

514
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:16,520
There's no point looking
She's not here.

515
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:18,700
She's a big girl, she won't get lost.

516
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:21,373
This is absurd, where is she?

517
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,380
- Have you read Nemours' letter?
- What letter?

518
00:49:24,415 --> 00:49:27,015
Marie found it
It fell out of his pocket.

519
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,536
He's such a heartbreaker, Nemours.

520
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,417
What are you waiting for?

521
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,545
Where's Marie?

522
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,140
You not going to wait for Junie?

523
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,420
Florence! I'll stay here.

524
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,785
Have you got Nemours' letter?

525
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,380
No, and I don't really want
to talk about it.

526
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,705
What did you do with it?

527
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,060
I gave it to Jacob
He should have it.

528
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:14,336
He just told me you had it.

529
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,813
Well I haven't, so drop it.

530
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,191
D'you think Henri's got it?

531
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,370
No idea.
You're starting to piss me off!

532
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,653
Mathias, you stay here.

533
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,891
I'll wait for my cousin with Mr. Nemours.

534
00:50:35,523 --> 00:50:36,848
What are you doing here?

535
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,180
I just saw Marie,
she said you've got the letter.

536
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:41,940
No, I gave it back.

537
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:43,345
You sure?

538
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,656
Er, no... I don't know.
Be discreet, he's right there.

539
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,852
Jeanne had it.

540
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,689
- Anyone seen her?
- I haven't.

541
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,932
- She got a mobile?
- No, she doesn't want a mobile.

542
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,897
Think she got the wrong station?

543
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,572
Can I talk to you, Sir?

544
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,979
It's personal.

545
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,417
Don't worry about my cousin,
she knows Paris, she's not lost.

546
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,132
What's on your mind?

547
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,578
Everyone thinks you lost a letter
in the cinema.

548
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,772
Really? I lost a letter?

549
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,420
Marie found a letter and she thinks
it fell out of your pocket.

550
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,490
In fact, it belongs to me.

551
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,387
And it's really very private.

552
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,448
Sir, I'm going to need your help here.

553
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,134
OK, take it easy.

554
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,835
We'll find Junie
then we'll deal with the letter.

555
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,160
I'm asking a real big favor here.

556
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,545
I'll do it, don't worry.

557
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,496
You have to ask Marie for the letter
back, saying it's yours.

558
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,012
What does this letter say?

559
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,695
It's a love letter, Sir.

560
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,545
Are you kidding?
What the fuck's going on?

561
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,096
Marie can't know the letter's mine,
and she can't tell Henri.

562
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,647
What's Henri got to do with this?

563
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,420
It's started as a game,
then became more serious.

564
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:38,138
Especially for Henri.

565
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,054
I realized he was in love.

566
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,185
Then I met Martin.

567
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,099
We saw each other in secret,
between lessons at lunchtimes.

568
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,938
We couldn’t live without each other.

569
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,945
I never thought he'd do that.
He threatened us.

570
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,768
He told us if we carried on he'd put
the photo on the school website.

571
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,974
Run along, I'll take care of your cousin.

572
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,694
- Thank you, Sir.
- No problem.

573
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,185
Where's he going?

574
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,858
He's not waiting with us?

575
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,898
- We've been here an hour!
- Why did you wait for me?

576
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,718
I need a bit of space, Otto,
leave me alone.

577
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,549
Wait a second.

578
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,607
I have to talk to Junie privately,
about her cousin.

579
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,116
Is Mathias OK?

580
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:09,252
Give us a moment.

581
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,239
Mathias is upset over a letter
do you know anything about it?

582
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,705
Yes, but what's it to him?

583
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,156
It concerns him because
the letter belongs to him.

584
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,773
I don't think so,
it fell out of your pocket.

585
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,466
- Did you see it fall?
- No.

586
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,916
Whoever told you that is wrong.

587
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:39,371
The letter belongs to Mathias,
it matters to him...

588
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,807
and he needs it back.

589
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,478
Fine. Why are you getting involved?

590
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:47,897
I'm not getting involved, I'm just...

591
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,043
That letter isn't mine,

592
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:57,252
but I'm going to pretend it is for
your cousin. I want you to know that.

593
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,209
Do you believe me?

594
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,854
It's not me you have to convince.
Marie found the letter on your chair.

595
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,530
She'd better not tell Nemours.

596
00:56:16,966 --> 00:56:18,702
If she says a word, I'll kill Marie.

597
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,571
D'you have any proof it's not yours?

598
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,177
I can't reveal Mathias' secrets.

599
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,699
There are no secrets
between Mathias and me.

600
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,091
It's from a guy called Martin.
I haven't even read it.

601
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,736
I've read the letter,
it's from a woman.

602
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,931
Are you sure about that?

603
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,772
Do you believe me now?

604
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,656
Can I have the letter please?

605
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,532
I tore it up.

606
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,260
But if you don't give it to Marie,
she'll smell a rat.

607
00:57:36,295 --> 00:57:38,804
Do you recall the letter?
Write it yourself.

608
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:42,654
Martin gave it me just before the film
I read it quickly.

609
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,976
I remember what it says,
more or less anyway.

610
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,615
It wasn't a long letter.

611
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,250
That's great! You can rewrite it.
A girl's handwriting is better.

612
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,886
Tomorrow you give it to Marie.

613
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,345
This is ridiculous.

614
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,570
I don't think saving my skin
is ridiculous.

615
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,537
What was this letter written on,
what kind of paper?

616
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,498
Ordinary white paper.

617
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,452
I've got some. Let's do it now.

618
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,985
Come and sit down.

619
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,053
Come on.

620
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,295
Paper. Pen.

621
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,801
You don't mind writing
a love letter to me?

622
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:30,560
"I love you too much...

623
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:33,539
"to let you think...

624
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:37,779
"I can live without you.

625
00:58:39,173 --> 00:58:41,015
"My love, I beg you, don't leave me. "

626
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,882
Oh, no. Don't joke around.

627
00:58:43,917 --> 00:58:45,754
It's already bad enough for Martin.

628
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,823
One can be a little lyrical.

629
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:50,688
I'd rather we keep it as near to true
as we can.

630
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,130
What's next?

631
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,656
How long have you been together?

632
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,699
Since October, the 12th.

633
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,091
You're the only person who knows.

634
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,937
I think Esther knows.

635
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:52,775
She's got no idea.

636
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,731
You don't mind when he's with her?

637
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,334
Yes, of course.

638
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,860
But if Mathias wanted us to be open,

639
01:00:09,046 --> 01:00:10,345
I'd feel uneasy about that too.

640
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,734
I couldn't hide way all the time.

641
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,738
You're lucky,
because Otto's a real saint.

642
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,686
I've gotta go.
My brother's waiting for me at judo.

643
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,291
- Will you call?
- Yes.

644
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,505
- I'm sick of this.
- What's up?

645
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,771
Dunno. I'm not going to Italian.
Will you stay with me?

646
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,217
You give the orders, I follow on.

647
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,465
Where will you go for now?

648
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,500
Maybe to my dad's, if he'll have me.

649
01:01:22,535 --> 01:01:25,014
Or there's my aunt in Brittany.

650
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,265
I don't get why you want to leave.

651
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,610
You were just settling in.
Why run off so soon?

652
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,545
I went too fast, I know it.

653
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:40,308
I thought going to a new school was
the right thing after Mom died.

654
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:42,067
I over-estimated myself.

655
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,694
- Mathias' folks will let you go?
- I think so.

656
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,334
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

657
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,940
I might come back after the holidays.

658
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:56,896
Don't take it personally.

659
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,340
Of course I take it personally!
Your leaving means I didn't help you.

660
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:05,208
You're the only one who helps me.

661
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,976
Not enough, because you're leaving me.

662
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,436
I'm not leaving, just distancing.

663
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:12,452
Honest, it's better that way.

664
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,780
Can't you tell me why?

665
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:20,265
I just explained.

666
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:23,417
I want the truth, or I can't fight back.

667
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,171
What's happened to you?

668
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,940
Should I make a useless confession?

669
01:02:40,975 --> 01:02:42,299
What does that mean?

670
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,576
Tell me, I'd rather know than imagine.

671
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:51,413
You promised not to lie, so don't lie.

672
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,105
I'm going away to protect myself
from someone here.

673
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:01,197
The truth is I'm fleeing.

674
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,619
Someone you're in love with?

675
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,831
Someone I don't want to love.

676
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,104
You've fallen in love with someone else?

677
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,411
No, the opposite.
I'm going away to not fall in love.

678
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,134
I respect you, Otto.

679
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,730
I'm telling you that
because I care for you.

680
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,728
You care for me but love another.

681
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,182
That'll pass. I just have to go away
for a while.

682
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,347
Who is it?

683
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,538
- You can't force me to say.
- I want to know.

684
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,770
Must be some special if you're
going to ruin your year for them.

685
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:51,978
I admitted there was someone, because I
don't want to hide things like the others.

686
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,299
But I can't tell you who.

687
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,373
Has this boy said that he loves you?

688
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,413
No, but I understood he does
in other ways.

689
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,492
Does he know we're together?
If we still are...

690
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,892
If I didn't want to be with you
I'd have left without a word.

691
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,465
Sir!

692
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,129
Henri and Mathias are fighting,
we can't break it up.

693
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,055
You're going to have a few bruises.

694
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,898
Stop it now!

695
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,096
Are you insane?

696
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,255
- Give me your bag, dear.
- I'm fine Mom.

697
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,737
- Will he get out?
- Yes, they're not going to hold him.

698
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,673
Goodbye.

699
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:53,375
Thank you.

700
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:33,335
Thank you.

701
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:36,577
I'm sorry.

702
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:38,492
It doesn't matter. Thanks.

703
01:07:39,987 --> 01:07:41,034
Bye.

704
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,705
I can understand.

705
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,890
Even if I can't, he leaves me no choice.

706
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,176
I hate that he lied me for months.

707
01:09:40,598 --> 01:09:42,331
He could at least have told me.

708
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,874
It wasn't that easy for him.

709
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,124
Perhaps he was a bit mixed up.

710
01:09:47,282 --> 01:09:48,974
I'd like to help him but he refuses.

711
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,620
- Did he say he doesn't want to see you?
- Yes.

712
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:56,585
He says it's for the best to not suffer.

713
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:00,060
He's afraid the others will mock me
because of Martin.

714
01:10:01,681 --> 01:10:02,857
He wants to deal with it alone.

715
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:06,120
You have to give him some time.

716
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:07,985
I can't even be jealous.

717
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:11,449
He doesn't love him.
He can't love him.

718
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,218
Anyway, you didn't see Mathias
all that often.

719
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,825
You don't have to be joined at the hip.

720
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,615
Shit, I ought to hate him,
but the only thing I feel is afraid,

721
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,893
afraid for him.
I'm always afraid.

722
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,417
For me, it was true love.

723
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,145
- Did you tell him?
- No.

724
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,500
He forbid me
He said it was mawkish.

725
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:40,297
Hello.

726
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,333
I was looking for you.

727
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,259
How is Mathias?

728
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,217
He talked to Esther.

729
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,265
What did he say to her?

730
01:11:04,068 --> 01:11:05,291
He told her he loves Martin.

731
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,689
There you go!

732
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,180
The little lad's being brave again.

733
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:13,225
Brave and selfish.

734
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:17,139
He doesn't give a damn how Esther feels
He's just relieved.

735
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,380
Having the courage of your convictions
isn't always easy.

736
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:25,257
You think, it’s easy?

737
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,379
Would you mind leaving me alone?

738
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,813
If you don't mind.

739
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,380
- You not with Junie?
- She got stuck in the cafe with Nemours.

740
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,371
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

741
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,489
Hello.

742
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,280
- What do you want?
- I came to find you.

743
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:17,540
What for?
Haven't you got Russian at 2?

744
01:12:20,175 --> 01:12:21,248
Don't you have Italian at 2?

745
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,329
I'm not going.

746
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,185
- Why not?
- I just don't want to.

747
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,973
- Have you got anything to tell me?
- No.

748
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,578
What do you expect me to say?

749
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,297
Go on, it starts in 5 minutes.

750
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,416
See you later.

751
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,178
Listen, Junie's in the courtyard.

752
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,173
So? She's outside not in Italian.

753
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,813
- Can you spy on her?
- What do you think she's up to?

754
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,899
No questions asked, please.

755
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,254
- It'll cost you.
- Drop it, doesn't matter.

756
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,978
Excuse me, can I leave the room?

757
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,532
Does that mean yes?

758
01:13:29,642 --> 01:13:30,664
Thank you.

759
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,074
Take out your Pasternak texts.

760
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,529
We can't go on like this.

761
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,338
I'm as lost as you are.

762
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,852
So, did you see her?

763
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,818
Who was she with?

764
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,978
What was she doing with Nemours?

765
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,932
They were kissing?

766
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,392
You come with me then say nothing.

767
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,415
I'm waiting for you to speak.

768
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,570
Don't start with that please.

769
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,480
When do you go to your dad's?

770
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:01,357
I can't go to my dad's.

771
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,259
And it would be mean to leave Mathias.

772
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,352
It wasn't mean kissing Nemours?

773
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,536
Are you mad?
I didn't kiss Nemours.

774
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:16,292
- I'd never kiss him!
- You were seen.

775
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,692
No one can have seen us.

776
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,211
You've got good hiding places.

777
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,999
I beg you...

778
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:30,303
don't accuse me of something
I haven't done.

779
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,656
I thought you were different.

780
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,897
But you're the same as Marie.

781
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,330
Except Marie doesn't act superior.

782
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,697
<i>Sometimes we lack the rain</i>

783
01:17:55,732 --> 01:17:59,215
<i>The storm gathers more pace</i>

784
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,065
<i>To cry out in our pain</i>

785
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,251
<i>These words throw in your face</i>

786
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,656
<i>Sometimes we lack the rain</i>

787
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,759
<i>As in the sun we die</i>

788
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:17,899
<i>From its heat we refrain</i>

789
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,620
<i>When love has gone away</i>

790
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,133
<i>Sometimes we strive in vain</i>

791
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,452
<i>To fight I would prefer</i>

792
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,410
<i>To beat her, give her pain</i>

793
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,934
<i>So no one would want her</i>

794
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,812
<i>Sometimes we strive in vain</i>

795
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,894
<i>Our arms they do betray</i>

796
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:56,811
<i>When love we would retain</i>

797
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,835
<i>Like sand just slips away</i>

798
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:19,980
<i>Sometimes sobs we contain</i>

799
01:19:20,015 --> 01:19:23,597
<i>Yet outpours have more class</i>

800
01:19:23,632 --> 01:19:27,179
<i>A few tears would explain</i>

801
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:31,539
<i>But that's too much, alas</i>

802
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:35,099
<i>Sometimes sobs we contain...</i>

803
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,455
<i>Sometimes the day's a strain</i>

804
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:01,331
<i>The nights better express</i>

805
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,391
<i>Stars like crosses do ordain</i>

806
01:20:06,377 --> 01:20:09,028
<i>A sky in mourning just for us</i>

807
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,455
<i>Sometimes the day's a strain</i>

808
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:16,314
<i>The night is long to come</i>

809
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,777
<i>When it falls you feel the pain</i>

810
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,053
<i>Of every starry dome</i>

811
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:54,379
Good night.

812
01:21:55,894 --> 01:21:56,980
Be strong.

813
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,820
Junie hasn't been in class for 3 weeks.

814
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,776
I'm aware of that.

815
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,960
I haven't said yet
to the secretary anything...

816
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:49,380
You understand?
I can't pretend nothing's going on.

817
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,389
- Could you persuade her?
- I'll try.

818
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,460
Tell her I won't be here Monday.
I'm taking sick leave to the end of year.

819
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,848
Because you're sick?

820
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,093
I'd like everyone
to introduce themselves.

821
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,180
- What's your name?
- My name is Antonin.

822
01:23:13,696 --> 01:23:14,774
- And you?
- Martin.

823
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,092
- And you?
- I'm Emilie.

824
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,260
- And what's your name?
- My name is Junie.

825
01:23:23,153 --> 01:23:24,992
Delighted to meet you.

826
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:28,289
- And you?
- Clement.

827
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,454
Go on, I'll catch you up.

828
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,505
You wanted to talk to me?

829
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,745
I'm sorry for acting like this,

830
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:57,300
I feel so pathetic doing this
but I have to talk to you.

831
01:24:57,897 --> 01:24:59,905
Otherwise I'll go mad.

832
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,651
That's fine, but don't expect anything.

833
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,619
I'm not ashamed to talk frankly.

834
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,735
I thought that's one thing
you liked about me.

835
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,738
My openness.

836
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,940
Imagining you could no longer love me
is far worse for me

837
01:26:44,975 --> 01:26:48,649
than what you call the rules
I set for myself.

838
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:54,175
I know we're two people,

839
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,849
and so like anyone,
we could be together.

840
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,333
But for how long?

841
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:05,780
If we're two ordinary people
how long will our love last?

842
01:27:05,815 --> 01:27:10,251
Eternal love doesn't exist,
not even in books.

843
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,829
So loving means for a finite time.

844
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,945
There'd be no miracle for us,

845
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,973
we're no different to anyone else.

846
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,367
Otto is the only man
who'll love me all his life.

847
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,334
It sounds dumb, but it's almost true.

848
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,731
If I give myself to you, you'll go off.

849
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,499
You don't trust me much, then.

850
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,371
I'm not a fool.

851
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:52,093
You're handsome.

852
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,453
Everyone likes you.

853
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,693
You've known a lot of women,

854
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,816
I've met at least two of them.

855
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:07,100
As with them, one day you'll leave
to love another

856
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:10,420
that you find more pleasing.

857
01:28:10,455 --> 01:28:13,093
And I won't survive.

858
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,172
Not to mention the jealousy.

859
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,740
The state that letter put me in.

860
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,929
I'd always think you're loved by,
and in love with, another.

861
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,013
Perhaps I'd be able to endure
my sadness, others do.

862
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,656
It won't work Junie.

863
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:49,059
You can't hold out alone
against our love.

864
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,417
Because I am armed.

865
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,850
And I'm not going to let you do it.

866
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,931
- See you tomorrow?
- No.

867
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,293
Not tomorrow, the next day.
Come round if you like.

868
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,613
5 o'clock?

869
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,865
Mathias, it's Nemours.

870
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,785
I'm outside. I was meeting Junie at 5.

871
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,580
It's nearly... 7 o'clock.
I didn't see you come home, I'm worried.

872
01:29:42,615 --> 01:29:45,617
Call me when you get this message.

873
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,452
- Hello.
- Hello, Mathias.

874
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,488
My mom didn't let me come today.

875
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,254
Junie left yesterday afternoon.

876
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,147
Where did she go?

877
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:26,200
I can't tell you.

878
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:30,319
She's gone far away.
You shouldn't wait for her.

879
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,745
She said not to pass on any news,

880
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,658
that she never wants
to hear from you again.

881
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,946
Thank you, go in, you'll catch cold.

882
01:30:49,305 --> 01:31:49,444
