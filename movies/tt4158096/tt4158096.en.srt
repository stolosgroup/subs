2
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,717
Move your fat ass, you A-town motherfucker.

3
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,846
Shut the fuck up, Bernie.
My fucking head's about to explode here.

4
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,847
That guy sure messed you up.

5
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,972
Yeah, well, I ever see him again, he's dead.

6
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,108
Not so pretty now, hey, pretty boy?

7
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,776
I look like I tried to fuck
a reluctant panda bear.

8
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,741
Yeah, well, you did worse than that, huh?

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,366
Oh, don't fucking talk about it.
It didn't happen, okay?

10
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,916
- Where the fuck are they?
- It's okay.

11
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,675
We have ten minutes yet.

12
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,596
Oh, Frank. Stop giving out
like an old lady, will you?

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,550
I just want everyone
to go home happy from this too.

14
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,852
Exactly. Do you hear that, Frank?

15
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,678
Fucking hate this shit.

16
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,349
You're take no notice of him.

17
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,233
The baggage handler's lost his charm
at the airport, apparently.

18
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,407
Look at this fucking <i>mulignan.</i>

19
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,078
Man, her asshole brother's got his feet
so far under the fucking table.

20
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,742
You know what you should do?

21
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,327
Should just tell him to leave.

22
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,535
I can't, man. It's all part of the deal.

23
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,788
Man, I hate house guests.

24
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,176
Yesterday he put my shoes
out on the porch and polished them.

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,338
I mean, what the fuck does that even mean?

26
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,306
Oh, Jesus. You got any headache pills?

27
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,557
Nah, I got smack.

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,148
Talk about a fucking sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,311
Here you go.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,190
What your old lady say?

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,118
I ain't been home yet.

32
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,949
Oh, right.

33
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,747
- She's pregnant.
- Aw, shit. Again?

34
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,161
Considering how much you hate her,
you sure seem to fuck her a lot.

35
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,589
Where are we going?

36
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,472
So what's the deal with you and Frank?

37
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,559
It's Frank's job to make sure
that no one gets in my way.

38
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,635
And it's my job

39
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,438
to make sure that Frank
doesn't get in his own way.

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,245
Hey, Saint Francis.

41
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,617
- What's going on?
- Get over here.

42
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,044
- Hey!
- Where the fuck have you been?

43
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,462
My sister's worried sick about you.

44
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,415
Don't worry about it. When she's pregnant,
she's sick all the time.

45
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,791
Jeez.

46
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,382
- What happened to your eye?
- Huh?

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,466
Listen, son, don't you show me up.

48
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,141
Trying to help you here,

49
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,186
give you an opportunity, bring you in.

50
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,729
Is that why you polished my shoes?

51
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,765
What?

52
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,434
I got work gloves.

53
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,527
Come here, Justine.

54
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,151
You're not FBI, are you?

55
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,156
- I'm I.I.F.M.
- What?

56
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,912
In it for myself.

57
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,286
- All right?
- Fuck!

58
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,743
- Fucking sort it out.
- Jesus, Frank.

59
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,504
My fucking balls, man!

60
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,795
Get over here. Straighten up.

61
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,093
You look like the fucking
Hunchback of Notre Dame.

62
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,171
Fuck! My beautiful balls.

63
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,217
Now, introduce yourself to the lady.

64
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,298
Sure.

65
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,680
- Stevo.
- Justine.

66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,137
Justine. <i>Enchanté.</i>

67
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,063
Charlie's missing an angel tonight, huh?

68
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,311
Oh, my God, beautiful.

69
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,313
Great.

70
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,395
So, Stevo, where did you get the vehicle?

71
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,986
Oh, the vehicle? That's cool.
No, I did exactly what I was told.

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,489
Yeah? That's a first, eh?

73
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,410
Hey, Justine, I need some of that brown stuff

74
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,534
you girls like to trowel all over your face.

75
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,081
What do you mean? Like powder?

76
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,453
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,041
I feel a little conspicuous
with the black eye.

78
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,713
- Oh.
- Yeah, Stevo, I'll do it for you.

79
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,126
- I'll help you out here. Now, how's that?
- Hey, careful.

80
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,337
- There we go.
- Careful, Chris. It's bruised.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,467
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

82
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,890
I'll fucking do it.

83
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,808
So where's our guy, then?

84
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,021
- We didn't come 3,000 miles for the view.
- Here he is. I'll handle it.

85
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,024
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, sweetheart.

86
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,730
Christopher?

87
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,986
So what do you think?

88
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,821
Sure, we'll give him his day in court.

89
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,528
I don't like his jumper.

90
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,365
A thousand apologies.
Hate it when people are tardy.

91
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,707
This is Ord.

92
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,001
It's good to meet you boys.
Thanks for coming out.

93
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,750
Maybe later.

94
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,338
You didn't masturbate before you got here,

95
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,510
- did you.
- You what?

96
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,509
Told you, I don't wanna work with anybody
who's carrying a loaded weapon.

97
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,179
So if you need time,
go find yourself a dark corner.

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,393
I'm just saying relax. It's all good.

99
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,683
If you wouldn't mind, as we agreed upon...

100
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,981
- I'll check for wires.
- I've got a gun.

101
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,779
Good. Well, soon you guys
will have even more.

102
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,866
Come on, big guy.

103
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,288
You know, where I'm from, boy,
we'd be halfway up the aisle by now.

104
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,336
Would you hold your makeup there for me?

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,504
Thank you.

106
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,921
- All right there, Smokey.
- You smell good.

107
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,549
Thank you. It's your mother.

108
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,633
Okay, no wires. If no one's listening in,

109
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,012
I guess we're all friends.

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,760
The, uh...

111
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,013
The fag and the retard are an interesting
choice of muscle to bring to the party.

112
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,143
- Just right there.
- Ow!

113
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,644
You ain't got them blended.

114
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,856
You know what? Fuck the small talk.

115
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,483
Let's buy some guns, eh?

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,277
All right. Step into my office.

117
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,006
What the fuck are you doing?

118
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,095
I'm leaving a trail of breadcrumbs.

119
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,222
So, what did Justine tell you
about these people?

120
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,637
Why don't we hear it from you, fella?

121
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,269
Okay, I appreciate that you're a serious guy,

122
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,568
I mean, fuck Britain and all that,
but you're on a different level now.

123
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,444
The guy who represents this merchandise,

124
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,739
his lawn is bigger
than your whole fucking country.

125
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,282
As big as your fucking mouth, then.

126
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,615
Tell me, Frank, is it true you people
live in houses with mud floors?

127
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,362
- What?
- I'm just saying, you know,

128
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,994
my ancestors probably ate raw onions
and fucked goats, so...

129
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,791
Nah, I doubt they were that advanced.

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,118
Oh, God damn it.

131
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,249
- Watch yourself there.
- Look at this shit.

132
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,705
It's a real fucking palace.

133
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,381
Hey, beggars can't be choosers, Cinderella.

134
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,709
I wonder what kind of factory it was.

135
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,296
Well, whatever it made, nobody wants it now.

136
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,365
Ugh. It's cold.

137
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,447
You think this is cold, sweetheart?

138
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,329
You should try Holywood in February.

139
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,160
Freeze the tits of a brass witch.

140
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,083
It's so fucking dirty.
Who put all the lights on?

141
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,884
Only thing a girl needs to stay warm
in Los Angeles is a flexible outlook.

142
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,377
I'm not talking about your Hollywood.

143
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,804
I'm talking about the real Holywood.

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,382
- Holywood, County Down, Northern Ireland.
- You know we've walked like half a mile?

145
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,557
Not your Cecil B. DeMille bullshit.

146
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,054
You guys got a Hollywood, too?

147
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,182
Have to carry all the fucking guns
through here, all the way over there.

148
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,600
That's what I like about this business.

149
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,148
It can be financially rewarding
and you can still learn something new

150
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,772
- everyday.
- Stick with your ABCs, son.

151
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,603
Right, introductions, yeah?

152
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,024
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

153
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,665
Vernon, why don't you come join us?
The gang's all here.

154
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,037
Here we go.

155
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,502
Vernon is in the blue suit.

156
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,669
Howdy, boys. How's the digs?

157
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,918
- Who's the other fella?
- Martin.

158
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,920
He was a Panther, but it didn't work out.

159
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,260
Vernon was misdiagnosed

160
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,054
as a child genius and he never got over it.

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,473
- What is he now?
- Let me do the talking, eh, boy?

162
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,642
An international asshole.

163
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,429
Vern, these are the boys
from across the pond.

164
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,144
Well, everyone's from somewhere, eh?

165
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,186
Justine. How are you, doll?

166
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,530
As gorgeous as ever,

167
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,279
well, you've, uh, put on a bit of weight.

168
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,404
- Did somebody impregnate you?
- Fuck off.

169
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,115
- Good. There's still a chance.
- What the fuck is that accent?

170
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,826
Uh, I think it's like, Swiss or something.

171
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,162
- Austrian.
- Oh, right. That's it. Austrian.

172
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,293
What do you say we check out the merch?

173
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,091
That's why we're here, eh?

174
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,507
She's a bit shy.

175
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,097
So, you'll be pleased to know

176
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,898
that I have a whole truckload
of these gorgeous dolls just outside

177
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,816
and they're all looking for dance partners.

178
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,651
It's not what we ordered.

179
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,187
Eh...

180
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,941
You're a little bit rude, eh?

181
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,243
I was presenting the merch
and you start chirping the bird there.

182
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,618
He says it's not what he ordered.

183
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,868
- Fuck, really? Uh...
- Let me explain.

184
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,088
- What, uh... What did you order?
- So, we ordered M16s.

185
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,843
You've heard of them? Now, this is an AR70.

186
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,549
Different weapon.

187
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,925
It's not what I ordered.

188
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,385
You should teach your boy some manners.

189
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,144
Learn a thing or two from the English.

190
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,273
Keep your shit together.

191
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,100
Martin, stay out of this.

192
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,480
I'm not running
a fucking pizza delivery service.

193
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,736
You want the weapons
or you don't want the weapons?

194
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,533
- Look...
- They're assault rifles.

195
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,657
You said rifles.
Justine, you said rifles, doll.

196
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,283
- They're fucking rifles. What do you want?
- Look.

197
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,535
- This is what was available.
- You're not gonna find anything else

198
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,743
of this quality or consistency on the market.

199
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,121
Not in the numbers that you need
or in the time that you've got.

200
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,623
He has a point.

201
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,064
Where from?

202
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,726
Stop with the questions.

203
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,775
You're a curious fucker, eh?
We're gonna get on, you and me.

204
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,278
- They're surplus.
- So fucking curious about the world.

205
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,700
Fucking hell, man.

206
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,199
Look, they're surplus.
They won't be missed, all right?

207
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,788
All right, take her for a spin.

208
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,536
Give us the mag.

209
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,371
No manners again. So simple.

210
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,922
Just load it, Martin.
Just a fucking "please."

211
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,385
Like fuck I'm gonna load it.

212
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,308
What are you doing in front of the client?

213
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,635
Get your shit together.

214
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,647
If you want something done right,
you do it yourself, eh?

215
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,352
- Amen, brother.
- Okay.

216
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,777
Yep.

217
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,701
I think we got off on... a little bit
of a bad footing there, eh?

218
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,995
I think what we need to do
is just start afresh,

219
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,165
so I'm gonna be the gentleman
in this relationship

220
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:18,292
and I'm gonna chuck in a free box of lube
'cause she likes to run wet.

221
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,586
Whoa, whoa. Slow the roll for a minute.

222
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,584
Public safety announcement
while the rifle's hot.

223
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,419
I'm gonna pull my pistol out.
Nothing personal.

224
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,055
Knock yourself out, Sparky.

225
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,636
Okay, just try not to hit
any of the metalwork,

226
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,848
'cause I don't wanna get any
of those blim-burns on my new s...

227
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,191
- ...suit.

228
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,772
Sorry, what was that?

229
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,355
This is from Savile Row...

230
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,737
I don't know about you guys,
but I for one think

231
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,288
Vern's merchandise is a real gas.

232
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,287
My guess is you're whatever
you're paid to be, pal.

233
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,035
Do you see what you did here?

234
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,731
Good.

235
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,395
Okay.

236
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,742
I'll overlook it this time.

237
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,196
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

238
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,209
So, let's open Pandora's box, eh?

239
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:52,678
All right, my, uh...

240
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,008
Associate.

241
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,227
...associate here will do the count,

242
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,308
see if it's all there.

243
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,272
It's better this way. The machine don't lie.

244
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,999
Gordon. Gordon,
are you sure that radio is on?

245
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,414
Course it's fucking on.

246
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,591
Good, 'cause I don't wanna miss my cue.

247
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,465
What the fuck you gonna do?

248
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,640
High-kick your way in there
with a fucking top hat and cane?

249
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,522
And, plus, it's my cue, okay?

250
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,766
Whatever.

251
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,731
- I'm just ready, you know?
- Yeah?

252
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,778
And I want Vern to know that.

253
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,573
Vern doesn't give two fucks
about what you want.

254
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,151
Vernon can't even see you, you're that small.

255
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,326
Plus you need to wash them knuckles
or they're gonna get infected.

256
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,124
Fuck me.

257
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,536
You like John Denver?

258
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,213
I must admit, I never tire of looking at it.

259
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,427
I never tire of looking at you, doll.

260
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,553
So what do you know?
It's all there. On the nose.

261
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,809
- That's heart-warming.
- And you can keep the case as well.

262
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,104
- Oh.
- Yeah, I was going to.

263
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,271
Thanks, eh?

264
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,849
Real nice teeth.

265
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,810
- Looks like a fucking cock jockey.
- Yeah.

266
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,062
You can bring the girls in.

267
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,192
<i>On the way.</i>

268
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,654
Okay, so, Vern's boys are gonna drive
the car in

269
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,952
- they're gonna put the crates of guns...
- Get your fucking hands off me.

270
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,449
Grandpa, you gotta relax.

271
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,956
They're gonna put the guns right here.
When they are done, they're gonna leave.

272
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,080
Then Tweedledee and Tweedledum can
load them up into your little clown car.

273
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,247
And you're the first one I'm gonna take
down if this goes south, big lad.

274
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,628
- That's probably a good idea, Grandpa.
- I reckon.

275
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,421
Oops.

276
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,807
- Oh, sorry, you're just... You're molting.
- Hmm.

277
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,310
Bigfoot.

278
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,487
So before we head home,
do you wanna go for dinner with me?

279
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,618
Oh, wow. I didn't factor that in.

280
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,954
Well, I mean, I know
we just met and all, but...

281
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,788
it's unlikely that I'll be over here again
before too long so I thought we could maybe...

282
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,497
...grab a bite.

283
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,994
Wow, when you put it like that, it doesn't
sound like a very good investment.

284
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,347
Yeah, fuck it. But you know, fuck it.

285
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,969
- Forget I said that.
- I will.

286
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,059
Oh... fuck it.

287
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,290
Fuck.

288
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,581
Come here.

289
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,836
Where you going? What's the matter with you?

290
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,337
Holy mother of fuck.

291
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,258
That's the guy who attacked me last night.

292
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,057
That's the guy. That's the guy from the bar.

293
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,009
That's not good. That's not good.
That's very...

294
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,657
Bernie...

295
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,202
Boss, keys.

296
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,916
Okay.

297
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,463
Lekker, man.

298
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,169
You know what this is?
It's the key, key to victory.

299
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,924
For you and the Irish.

300
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,634
A van full of AR70s. Fantastic.

301
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,889
Just let it go. Let it go, mate.

302
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,016
- We didn't wanna get in the way.
- You didn't wanna get in the way?

303
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,313
What are you, on holidays or something?

304
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,560
You're supposed to be helping with the van.

305
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,483
I'm paying you 100 bucks
to help with the van.

306
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,980
Get over there, all right?

307
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,482
- Okay?
- Sure. Sure.

308
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,438
- Oh, we... we thought that...
- Shh. Just do it.

309
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,946
Sure. You can't fucking go there.

310
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,614
I'm telling you, you're gonna be so happy
with these weapons,

311
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,865
you're gonna come back for more.

312
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,446
All right, Gordon,
let's get those boxes down.

313
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,372
- You take that end.
- You're gonna be like my bird,

314
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,200
- begging for more, eh?
- Yeah, bring them over here,

315
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,331
- stack them up like a...
- Yeah.

316
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,836
- Yup, you got it.
- Okay.

317
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,835
- Come on, guys. Come, come.
- Harry, for future reference,

318
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,666
let's not drop the automatic weapons.

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,626
Swell, man. Stop fucking complaining.

320
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,710
Let's get the job done.

321
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,138
I've never, uh, I've never been to Ireland.

322
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,214
You what?

323
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,425
I said... I said,
I've never been to Ireland, eh?

324
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,596
Oh.

325
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,438
You should go, man.
They'd, uh, they'd love you over there.

326
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,442
- Perfect.
- Fuck, still more, eh?

327
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,735
All right, guys, come on.
Let's get this done.

328
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,028
Shit, I didn't know it was this many.

329
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,276
I think you might owe me
a bit of extra boodle, eh?

330
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,743
One, two, three...

331
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,197
Hey. Come here.

332
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,782
I'm mingling. What the fuck?

333
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,330
What about the ammo? Back of the truck.

334
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,667
- Oh, yeah. I'm... I'm sorry.
- Watch my fucking fingers!

335
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,965
I think that just saying no
is kind of a reflex.

336
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,462
- Yeah. Fuck it.
- It's stupid.

337
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,340
No, we're not giving them that, man.

338
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,296
I told you, I only brought that along in case

339
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,847
I had to sweeten the deal.

340
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,142
- The Irish went for the AR70s.
- You're the man, man.

341
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,220
We give the M16s to the Libyans, eh?

342
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,474
Vern and learn, baby.

343
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,895
We should probably lock it up,
just in case they see it.

344
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,859
I think we could.

345
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,187
We could probably both use a drink
after this.

346
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,988
Yeah, that'd be nice. I'd like that.

347
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,191
- Last one.
- Yeah, you're right.

348
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,119
Okay, just don't let them see you.
Just do it subtly.

349
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,533
- As soon as they're done packing.
- Oh, God!

350
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,114
- What?
- Jesus!

351
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,289
What happened?

352
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,206
- I got a splinter.
- Let me see that.

353
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,832
Vern and fucking learn.

354
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,255
Been dealing with this fucking guy all day.

355
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,128
Hold still. Let me take it out with this.

356
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,759
- Fuck off!
- Pussy.

357
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,553
A fucking splinter. Are you serious?

358
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,881
Sorry, boss. Harry distracted me.

359
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,308
- I just suddenly feel a little bit sick.
- Really? Really?

360
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

361
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,144
- Yeah, I think...
- Sympathy's in the dictionary

362
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,971
between "shit" and "syphilis," son,
all right?

363
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,227
Get the fuck over there.
You make me look stupid.

364
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,318
Three birds in a nest.

365
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,362
Do your puking when you're walking.

366
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,064
- Go, go, go.
- All right, Frank.

367
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,615
Can you open up the rest of them?

368
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,742
Here it is, eh?

369
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,412
- The rest are all like that.
- Yeah, open the rest of 'em.

370
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,658
- You're fucking kidding.
- No.

371
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,709
- There's three in every box.
- Good.

372
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,415
- It's, uh, ten boxes, 30 like we agreed.
- Vern.

373
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,000
We covered this. Transparency, remember?

374
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,384
Okay. Okay, mate. Harry, open them all.

375
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,885
The customer's always right.

376
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,805
You're not very trusting, eh, Irish?

377
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,262
I'm English, but I'm English-South African.

378
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,938
It's different. Trust's not your thing, eh?

379
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,562
Son of a fucking bitch!

380
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,689
- Jesus. What the fuck?
- ...piece of shit!

381
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,190
Step in there, man!

382
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,898
Come here, you fucking junkie.

383
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,234
I'll fuck you up again,
you fucking piece of shit.

384
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,570
- Leave it, will you?
- Calm the fuck down.

385
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,247
Blah, blah, blah,
you fucking knuckle-dragger.

386
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,665
All right, Stevo.

387
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,333
...just calm that little dog.

388
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,412
FYI, your breath stinks of shit
and you got a serious case of BO.

389
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,418
All right, you mark my words,
you filthy addict!

390
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,541
Eat wood, you fuck!

391
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,001
Oh, shit.

392
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,256
- Whoa! Hold on!
- Sorry!

393
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,507
- You fucking wanker!
- Sorry.

394
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,590
- You little fucking cocksucker!
- Vern, Vern, Vern. Hey, hey.

395
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,347
We got the money. The deal's done. No use.

396
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

397
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,273
What are you fucking doing,
you fucking clown!

398
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,645
- Prick.
- I swear to God,

399
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,101
you're a waste of fucking skin.

400
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,440
- Unprovoked.
- It was uncalled for.

401
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,114
- Took me on the... on the pip. Unprovoked.
- I know, I know. Does it hurt?

402
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,157
- You fucking bottled her...
- No, no, it doesn't hurt.

403
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,906
- I'm from Africa, man.
- Come over here.

404
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,612
- Africa's not for sissies.
- I understand.

405
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,868
Fuck it, I don't even...
I don't even feel it.

406
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,290
But it's the principle, doll.

407
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,288
- Fuck, he really got you.
- Yeah, principle, yeah?

408
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,586
- Oh, God.
- Oh, fuck, okay.

409
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,788
It's all right, I got a handkerchief.

410
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,464
- Fix you right up.
- Okay, okay.

411
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,001
The fuck's going on? Eh?

412
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,086
Let them deal with it. Let them deal with it.

413
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,260
- You're fine right here with me.
- All right.

414
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,337
All right. All right. All right.

415
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,848
- Little bit of a newsflash.
- Please.

416
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,551
Harry here says that Junkie Joe over there

417
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,432
did something pretty unconscionable
last night.

418
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,263
I'll get to the bottom of this.

419
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,982
All right, listen, his name's Steven.

420
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,027
There's something wrong with him, okay?
Apologies.

421
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,445
That's a dirty name around here, all right?

422
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,612
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

423
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,907
The suspense is killing me.
What... what did Steven do?

424
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,577
That fucking junkie came on to my cousin
last night at the Harlequins.

425
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,699
And when she wouldn't suck
his fucking dick, he bottled her.

426
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,992
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

427
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,211
I'm serious as fucking cancer.

428
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,420
She's scarred, man,
permanently, and she's 17.

429
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,167
Hang on, Harry. Is this true, Gordon?

430
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,547
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

431
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,345
The place erupted like fucking Vesuvius, man.

432
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,798
There's not a stick of furniture left
in the place, for real.

433
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,303
If you were to walk into Harlequins
tomorrow night

434
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,726
with his head on a fucking stick,
you'd be a hero, man.

435
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,929
Why would you even say that?
Why would you say that?

436
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,565
What are you doing?
You're just making it worse.

437
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,065
Everybody, take a chill pill, okay?
Just calm the fuck down.

438
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,734
Now, listen here.

439
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,366
- We'd like to leave with our money...
- Uh-huh.

440
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,038
...and I'm sure that you boys
would like to leave

441
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,036
- with the weapons, okay?
- Uh-huh.

442
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,162
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,494
- This is not good for business.
- Mmm-hmm.

444
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,712
Well, you know, you know,
bringing AR70s to an M16 deal

445
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:29,917
is not good for business.

446
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,047
Neither is bringing a sex pest.

447
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,472
It's under control, doll. I got this.

448
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,012
The bird has a point. Okay?

449
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,765
- We'd like to trust you...
- Uh-huh.

450
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,186
...but we can't because your boy...

451
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,433
- Okay.
- ...has been disrespectful.

452
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,811
All right, fair enough.

453
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,518
- Okay?
- Just give me a minute. All right, enough.

454
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,319
- Hey?
- You all right, Chris?

455
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,396
Get out of my...

456
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,480
Shit.

457
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,564
He's doing the right thing.

458
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,485
Jesus Christ, get the fuck off me!

459
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,578
That's the hiding of his fucking life.

460
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,905
Why don't you fucking tickle him to death?

461
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,365
Fucking bottled a fucking woman?

462
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,448
- ...what?
- Is that your thing?

463
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,709
Is that your fucking thing, Stevo, huh?

464
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,079
I swear on my wife's life, what the...

465
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,834
- He bottled him, doll.
- Who does that?

466
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,005
- I would never do that.
- No, no, no.

467
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,086
- I would never lay my hands on a woman.
- I know. I know, you never have.

468
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,221
You gotta believe me, Frank, he's confusing
me with some other handsome fucker.

469
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,469
- Frank, seriously.
- All right?

470
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,101
As God is my witness,
I did not bottle that slut.

471
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,180
- Right, you fuck!
- Frank, please!

472
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,981
I swear to sweet Jesus.

473
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,854
Look, he's family, Chris, all right?

474
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,153
- So I should be the one that...
- Fuck, Frank!

475
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,741
Fuck, Frank!

476
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,036
I'm fucking telling you.
Do you understand me?

477
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,988
I'm gonna fucking bury you in a grave.

478
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,618
- Piece of shit.
- There you go.

479
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,745
Don't kill me, Frank.

480
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,667
They're taking care of their own, all right?

481
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,495
No, no, they... they... they've done it.

482
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,579
- Just...
- All right.

483
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,289
You're fucking going out there

484
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,337
- and you're gonna fucking apologize.
- Okay, so...

485
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,044
Steven has been reprimanded, all right?

486
00:25:56,138 --> 00:26:00,098
He's gonna... he's gonna pay
for your cousin's, um, hospital bills.

487
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,215
He's gonna write

488
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,802
- a sincere letter of apology.
- That's great.

489
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,889
That's great. He's paying for the bills
and a letter in... in... in his blood.

490
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,190
- In his own fucking blood if needs be.
- In his blood.

491
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,983
Are you kidding me, man? A fucking letter?

492
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,151
- Can we just get back to the guns?
- A fucking letter?

493
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,024
Maybe she doesn't read.
Maybe she wants it drawn.

494
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,355
Like a little, remorseful pony.

495
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,611
- She can fucking read, Ord!
- That... stop it!

496
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,193
- Wanna do this?
- Back off. Calm down.

497
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,825
- Fucking relax.
- Steven's gonna apologize.

498
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,406
See? There you go.

499
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,130
- Let him do it.
- I'm calm.

500
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,923
Man to man.

501
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,129
About last night...

502
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,388
I'm real sorry.

503
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,599
- That's great.
- There you go.

504
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,601
That's great. There you go.

505
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,768
I'm really sorry.

506
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,652
I'm really sorry, guys.

507
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:02,452
'Cause I came so hard in your cousin's
mouth that I think I knocked some of her

508
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,279
- rotten fucking teeth out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

509
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,698
You're gonna have to pick 'em out
of her fucking stools

510
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,079
at the fucking hospital!

511
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,502
- I'm gonna give him a hiding.
- Fucking cocksuckers!

512
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,204
Shut that motherfucker up!

513
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,789
You said he was gonna apologize.
What was that?

514
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,920
- Alright?
- How many times have I told you?

515
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,127
- That's clear provocation.
- Vern, you're not helping. Alright?

516
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,803
Just cool it, Harry, okay?

517
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,098
Just cool it down.
Just fucking drop it, Harry.

518
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,641
Put one of them in your fucking mouth.

519
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,218
Fuck off back to Austria!

520
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,974
Big fucking mouth on a little lad.

521
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,646
- Muzzle that one.
- Okay, okay! Enough.

522
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,019
The fuck is wrong with you, Frank?
You bring a druggie, fucking...

523
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,146
You bring a fucking...

524
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,353
Hey! Who are you talking druggie?
You know nothing about the lad.

525
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,312
You're only making it worse.
Now shut the fuck up.

526
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,818
We don't need you yelling at him. Calm down.

527
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,275
- Who gives a shit anyway?
- Hey!

528
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,405
What the fuck are you doing
with my gun, Harry?

529
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,236
- No, no, Harry, Harry. Harry, no!
- Suck on this.

530
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,710
Some fucker's gonna die!

531
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,540
Calm down!

532
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,671
You're just winded. You're all right

533
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,003
- I've got it under control.
- Will you control your fucking man?

534
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,840
- I've got him.
- Come here, you fucking cocksucker!

535
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,551
Fuck you!

536
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,346
- Fuck.
- I've been shot!

537
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,646
Ord! Ord!

538
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,524
I've been shot. I've been fucking shot.

539
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,196
- He shot me.
- I got you. Come here.

540
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,200
- Fuck.
- He barely nicked you, Vern. You're fine.

541
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,443
Eh?

542
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,487
You're gonna be okay. It's mostly the suit.

543
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,868
Is the bullet not in there, doll?

544
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,283
It just looks like it's the shoulder pad.

545
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,335
My fucking suit!

546
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,126
Chris!

547
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,382
Frank!

548
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,929
Ord, my gun's jammed.

549
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,685
Christ. It's usually so reliable, man.

550
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,478
- Fuck.
- Dust got in there.

551
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,645
Here, take it.

552
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,113
Don't shoot! The deal's off!

553
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,037
Just have to wait for him
to show me his little pip.

554
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,502
Keep cool out there.

555
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,328
I got him.

556
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,548
Cocksucker!

557
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,627
- He's still moving, Vern.
- Eh?

558
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,383
You fucking bastards!

559
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,509
Chris is hit, Frank!

560
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,269
Fuck!

561
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,523
Will everybody calm the fuck down!

562
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,523
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

563
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,854
- They shot my boy.
- Oh, shit.

564
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,447
- Stand up.
- Martin.

565
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,821
You bring that fucking money
over here right now.

566
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,491
- Harry, did you get shot, you idiot?
- Fuck!

567
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,415
Stevo! Stevo, you all right?

568
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,620
Fuckers!

569
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,665
You okay, Stevo?

570
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,091
Chris, you all right?

571
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,759
Frank! Frank, let's get out of here, Frank!

572
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,602
Shut the fuck up.

573
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,430
- Shit.
- All right, I'm coming over.

574
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,985
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

575
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,404
I'm... I'm hit, but I'm good.

576
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,447
I'm not leaving a case full of boodle
out there, okay?

577
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,069
- Of course not.
- Ord, cover me.

578
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,196
- I'm going for the boodle.
- Wait, Vernon.

579
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,493
You don't wanna do that. Th...

580
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,611
Fucker.

581
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,877
- Stop fucking shooting, man!
- You okay, Vern?

582
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,875
One shot me, man! I'm shot...

583
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,127
Vern, shut up!

584
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,379
Fuck you, Chris!

585
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,133
Fuck!

586
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,136
Ord, what's happening?

587
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,347
Show us your big face.

588
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,656
Please, nobody do anything!

589
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,612
Stay back, sweetheart.

590
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,620
Fuck, fuck. I'm running,
I'm running. Nobody shoot!

591
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,541
Stay down, please, Vern.

592
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,373
It's not gonna happen, Ord.

593
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,170
- He's really heavy.
- Come on.

594
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,173
Load for... load for Verny. Yes!

595
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,795
- Come on, Vern. Make your move!
- Come on, please say something?

596
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,879
Vern, stay down.

597
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,057
It's too late. I've been insulted.

598
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,304
Let me get him!

599
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,691
Oh, fuck. Holy Jesus.

600
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,320
Here we go. God damn it!

601
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,275
Oh! Now we're cooking!

602
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,494
Hey, Ord, bet you thought
you were too handsome to get shot, huh?

603
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,789
I'm just impressed
you haven't needed a nap yet, Francis.

604
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,289
Martin, look at me. Look at me.

605
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,712
Look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

606
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,255
You're gonna be okay. Just say something.

607
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,052
What the fuck?

608
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,223
Gordon, over here.

609
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,603
Gordon, you all right?

610
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,026
What the fuck is that now?
Who's shooting that?

611
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,609
- Frank?
- Oi!

612
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,949
Who the fuck is shooting at us now?

613
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,743
- You good?
- What the fuck was that?

614
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,328
Sounds like a fucking rifle.

615
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,163
Move back! Move back!

616
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,427
What the fuck?

617
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,466
Redeem yourself and get that case.

618
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,966
You get the fucking case, asshole.
Fuck you, man.

619
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,676
Ah!

620
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,774
Whatever. I forgot whose side I'm on.

621
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,644
Oh, fuck, fuck.

622
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,195
- Doll!
- What?

623
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,271
Go for the case.

624
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,857
You're a bird.
They're not gonna shoot the bird.

625
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,694
- Just go for the case.
- Don't... you get the fucking case!

626
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,195
Okay, let's try something.

627
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,911
Fuck!

628
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,170
Shit! Shit.

629
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,796
Jesus. F...

630
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,139
Great.

631
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,182
Ord, get the case.

632
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,435
Got it, Vern.

633
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,059
Go for the case.

634
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,774
No.

635
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,275
No, what are you doing? Not that case!

636
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,153
Hang in.

637
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,659
Stop fucking shooting!

638
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,539
Did you cheaters bring a sniper?

639
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,374
Not with us!

640
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,747
He's not with us.

641
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,163
Sounds like a fucking Garand.

642
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,544
Someone's firing a carbine behind me.

643
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,375
Vern, your friend needs serious help.

644
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,007
He'll have to wait.
I'm a bit preoccupied right now.

645
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,427
Shit.

646
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,593
- Fuck!
- All right, little wallflower.

647
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,105
Don't be shy. Come out and play.

648
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,523
Fuck!

649
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:35,540
- Give me the fucking gun.
- Give me that fucking...

650
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,512
- Let it go. Let it...
- Not a fucking chance.

651
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,575
Ord!

652
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,458
Ord! Ord!

653
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,167
Ord, I'm taking fire!
Cover me! Cover me! I'm coming in.

654
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,542
I'm taking fire!

655
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,467
- Here. Here I come.
- I got your back. Move.

656
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,007
Christ!

657
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,924
- You all right?
- Yeah.

658
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,010
- You still breathing?
- Yeah.

659
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,813
Two shooters. One behind you.

660
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,686
One at two o'clock.

661
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,643
I'm gonna flank that fucker, eh?

662
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,941
He's dying everyone stop it. Just stop it.

663
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,321
- Stay with me.
- Leave him. He's done. Come on.

664
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,744
Come on, come on. Come with me.

665
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,788
Oh, fuck!

666
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,541
- Shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, sure.

667
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,341
I can't believe that I gave a shit
about your cousin. You little asshole!

668
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,424
Fuck! You fuck!

669
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,431
Ah! Fucking bastard!

670
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,939
Ah, no!

671
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,032
Frank. Over here, Frank.

672
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,715
- Fuck.
- Chris, you all right?

673
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,417
No.

674
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,754
Fuck.

675
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,096
Harry? Harry, are you okay?

676
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,063
Go on. Go on, keep going. Get up.

677
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,234
All right.

678
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,865
All right.

679
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,915
All right. All right, nice and steady.

680
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,962
Bernie!

681
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,303
- Just taking a fucking walk.
- What the fuck are you doing, Bernie?

682
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,050
Aim with two hands, Vern.

683
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,719
Fuck.

684
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,467
- Ah!
- No fucking way!

685
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,597
I nailed him.

686
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,220
Nah, I'm all right, Stevo.

687
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,431
- Great shot, Vern.
- I fucking nailed him.

688
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,932
I'm all right.

689
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,859
Frank, he shot Bernie in the back!

690
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,322
Bernie, get up!

691
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,822
Quit your fucking whining, Stevo.

692
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,705
- You fucking knuckle-dragger.
- You fucking cocksucker.

693
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,080
- Bernie!
- Gordon.

694
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,164
Yeah?

695
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,171
I'll give you my fucking Rolex,
if you go for that case right now.

696
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,253
Your Rolex is a fake, Vern.

697
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,135
Don't do this to me, Bernie.
What am I gonna tell your mother?

698
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,980
I hate these fucking freelance jobs.

699
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:47,018
- You're gonna make me fucking puke, Stevo.
- Shut the fuck up, man!

700
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,107
I'm gonna fucking kill these bastards,
fucking cocksuckers.

701
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,709
You're fucking dead, you fuck!

702
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,786
Piece of shit!

703
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,588
This is legit. It's worth £700, mate.

704
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,337
I'm telling you, Vern, it's a fake.

705
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,009
- I don't want your fucking watch.
- Fuck me!

706
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,102
These bastards should
fucking hang their heads in shame

707
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,478
for what they done today.

708
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,479
I know I speak for everybody
when I express my sympathies to Steven

709
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,529
for the loss of his special friend.

710
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,493
Fuck Steven, man. He started the whole thing.

711
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,695
He shot the boy.

712
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:40,905
I'm not dead.

713
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,449
I'm just regrouping.

714
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,287
Fucking hang their head in shame
for what they done today.

715
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,914
That's right, you're a fucking angel, man.

716
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,253
You're a fucking angel sent from heaven,

717
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,335
that's what you are.

718
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,972
Anyway,
I'm sure Bernie's off to a better place.

719
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,883
Maybe he'll even make
something of himself down there.

720
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,681
I'm fucking grieving here!

721
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,229
Fucking grieving.

722
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,432
I'm coming for you, man.

723
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,768
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

724
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,854
You fucking try it, you cocksucker!

725
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,443
- Cover me. I need to come over.
- Fine, Vernon.

726
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,571
- We need to strategize.
- Okay.

727
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,325
You still collecting a pension, Frank?

728
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:23,531
Fuck off.

729
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,329
All right,
I'll mark you as present on the roster.

730
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,372
Justine?

731
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,421
Here!

732
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,208
Good girl. I like your style.

733
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,550
This goddamn dust,
it's bringing on my allergies.

734
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,552
Shut the fuck up, Gordon.

735
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,638
Fuck you, Harry.

736
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,685
You'll always be in my thoughts, Bernie.

737
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,310
They'll never take away the good times.

738
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,653
I think something actually just...
hit my head. I'm just...

739
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,822
Just a little thing.

740
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,653
A scratch.

741
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,735
It was nothing.

742
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,504
Chrissy,

743
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,873
do you remember that time Frank got...

744
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,090
got so drunk he stripped down to his Y-fronts

745
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,423
at Kieran's wake
and cried over the coffin like a baby?

746
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,133
Oh, you fucking asshole.

747
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,301
No comment!

748
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,104
That was the last time he had a drink.
Right, Frank?

749
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,854
Frank, you're an alcoholic?

750
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,565
Recovering.

751
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,654
Somebody better tell me

752
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,069
who invited these gatecrashers?

753
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,610
Yeah, who were those gatecrashers, Vern?

754
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,411
Mmm.

755
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,709
Steve. Stevo.

756
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,342
Hey!

757
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:00,836
How many?

758
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,596
Oh, come on, for fuck's sake.

759
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,636
Tall one.

760
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,061
How many fuckers are over there? Oi.

761
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,277
What?

762
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,787
- Never mind.
- Steve.

763
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,495
You, fucking chocolate teapot.

764
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,538
Huh?

765
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,998
How many?

766
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,505
Fuck you, Frank.

767
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,547
Yeah, lucky thing your friend Vern's
too cheap to pay for good shooters.

768
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,969
They couldn't be with Vernon.

769
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:49,351
Must have been someone that got wind of the
deal and then decided to chance it.

770
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,590
Fucking Stevo and his big fucking mouth.

771
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,066
What the fuck is Chris doing with Justine?

772
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,576
She's tending... She's tending to his wounds.

773
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,245
- Vern, go shoot him.
- Has he kidnapped her?

774
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,573
Stop. I don't wanna die.

775
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,501
You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine.

776
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,252
I'm just gonna check on Frank.

777
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,962
What you're gonna do...

778
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,165
When you get out of here,

779
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,044
you find the first restaurant,
and I'll meet you there.

780
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,342
All right?

781
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,433
All right.

782
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,729
They're playing us, okay?
She's on their side.

783
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,023
And these urks are with them.

784
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,778
Yeah, but, Vern, one of them shot her.

785
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,990
Or did we shoot her?

786
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,205
Fuck.

787
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,843
You've got two choices.

788
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,261
One, you distract them
with your badinage and I leave.

789
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,140
My what?

790
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,767
Or two,

791
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:16,230
you kill all of these motherfuckers
and I leave.

792
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,818
Now's a good time to bring up our contract.

793
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,615
For the amount of money we agreed on, there
were no extenuating circumstances like this.

794
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,240
What the fuck is wrong with you?

795
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,872
How can you talk about money
at a time like this?

796
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,167
Get me an ambulance!

797
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,299
I know that voice.

798
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,881
We can't leave here empty-handed.

799
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,265
Where the fuck is Leary
when you need him, eh?

800
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,854
Howard Mathison?

801
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:03,853
Ord, if I'd known you was in on this,
I wouldn't have taken the job.

802
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,814
That geriatric reprobate's
supposed to be retired.

803
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,148
What?

804
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,617
- What are you doing?
- I need help!

805
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,161
- Ord.
- You've no idea.

806
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,408
Protecting our asses, Vern.

807
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,156
Wooden boxes don't stop bullets.

808
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,583
The college fees, the medical bills.

809
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,960
Plus Rita left me.

810
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,215
I hooked up with this Asian chick.

811
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,841
She cleaned me out.

812
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,388
Howard, I'm gonna stack
the bodies of your 11 children

813
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,012
on top of each other
and burn them on your lawn

814
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,263
if you don't tell me who hired you right now!

815
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,687
Tell us, Howard!

816
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,348
That's good. That's good.
That's what I'm paying you for.

817
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,729
Don't listen to him.
He's not the boss of you.

818
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,230
Fuck you, you junkie!

819
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,270
The junkie's still fucking alive?

820
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,360
I'm no rat.

821
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,452
Gonna die anyway.

822
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,994
Seeing as it's you, Ord...

823
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,500
I'll tell you.

824
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,416
It was...

825
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,730
My guys.

826
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,356
Fucking made it.

827
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,778
Howard's done talking.

828
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,860
Ord, I'm feeling light-headed.

829
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,321
I think I'm losing too much blood.

830
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,820
Relax. It didn't even hit an artery.
You're fine.

831
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,496
You got at least an hour and a half.

832
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,539
Eh?

833
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,243
It's the golden hour and a half. It's a rule.

834
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,914
How long's... How long's it been?

835
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,251
Ord!

836
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,002
What?

837
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,338
We're here for the guns, right?

838
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,931
You're here for the money.

839
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,766
Let Justine get out.

840
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:03,972
What are you doing?

841
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,191
Right, she makes contact

842
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,236
with our respective people,
they come find us.

843
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,863
Everyone's happy.

844
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,115
- Yeah.
- No.

845
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,158
- She can leave.
- What are you doing?

846
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,531
Good.

847
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,700
Justine, you're good to go.

848
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,826
Thank you.

849
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,241
There you go.

850
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,537
All right.

851
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,997
I'll do it if Vernon promises
not to shoot me in the back.

852
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,001
She's making it personal now.

853
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,503
Promise her.

854
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,141
Cross my heart, doll.

855
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,803
Okay.

856
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,557
Ord, I shot that guy.

857
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,937
That's the death penalty in Massachusetts.

858
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,355
Yeah. I vote we barbeque
this whole fucking place.

859
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,361
There's more blood on the floor here
than a sausage factory, man.

860
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,152
You think this is a fucking senate committee?

861
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,861
- You don't get a vote.
- Fuck you.

862
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,036
Shut up.

863
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,698
She's a snake in the grass.

864
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,531
- She was tending to him.
- Okay, Vern, listen.

865
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,086
- Vern, shh.
- She was tending... She's on their side.

866
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,755
Look at that. I told you, she's escaping.

867
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,542
Wake up and smell the Ricoffy, Ord.

868
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:20,883
There's a phone in this building.

869
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,650
If there's a phone, I can call the boys.

870
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,737
You're a fucking dead man, Vernon!

871
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,283
She's firing back.
I told you, she's on their side.

872
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,331
'Cause you shot at her, Vern.

873
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,879
A pushy woman isn't sexy, Justine.

874
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,581
Chrissy thinks they are.

875
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,968
You come back here, Justine.

876
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,178
# <i>Justine and Chrissy</i>

877
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,222
<i># Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...</i>

878
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,551
Frank, I'll shoot him in the head.

879
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,181
- Steven, Steven.
- I'll shoot him in the fucking head.

880
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,013
- I will shoot him in the fucking head.
- You keep this up,

881
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,686
I'll wash my fucking hands of you. All right?

882
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,733
I know what you're up to, Justine.

883
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,312
You fucking maniac. I'll shoot you myself.

884
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,647
- Nail her, Gordon.
- Okay, boss.

885
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,026
There's a promotion in it for you, boy.

886
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,403
You fucking turncoat.

887
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,906
You don't even get an opinion.
You fucking started this whole thing.

888
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,077
It's your fucking fault.

889
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,868
Ord, stop it, man.

890
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,663
What you doing, man? Stop it, Ord!

891
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,244
You think you're a big man.
Look at you, you fucker.

892
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,623
Stop.

893
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,125
- Stop that!
- Get off of me!

894
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,380
Come on!

895
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:39,961
Boys.

896
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,923
Boys, knock it off, man.

897
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,842
- Ow!
- Man, watch the foot, will you?

898
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,347
Hey, what the fuck?

899
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,851
Hey, help me out here.
Get this fucker loaded up.

900
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,647
- Stop.
- ...you're a fucking kid.

901
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,107
You fucking baby.

902
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,610
- Stevo, here, take the radio.
- What the fuck you gonna do?

903
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,776
- Give me that sand, give me cover.
- Make sure she gets out of here.

904
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,324
Do you hear me? Make sure she gets out.

905
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,276
- Ord, stop it.
- Stop it.

906
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,080
Ord, where you going? Ord, where you going?

907
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,410
Hey.

908
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,418
Ord, come back here!

909
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,418
- Come back here right now!
- Oh, what is his fucking problem, man!

910
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,857
You sneaky fucker.

911
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,748
Fuck!

912
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,352
Get out of here, woman, for Christ's sake.

913
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,024
I'm going!

914
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,584
Fuck!

915
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,670
Oh, fuck!

916
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,299
I just shot Ord.
He's gonna fucking kill me, man.

917
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,143
You smell of perfume.

918
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,022
It's beard oil.

919
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,106
- Fuck. Do it, Frank.
- I can't get a clear shot at him.

920
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,562
Go, Ord! Nail him, boykie!

921
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,646
Oh, fuck!

922
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,832
What are you doing, Vern?

923
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,251
Huh?

924
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,675
You making a new suit over there?

925
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,131
Here, Chrissy, come on.

926
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,763
Oh, fuck.

927
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,485
Ah! My fucking leg,
you've got my leg, you cunt!

928
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,209
Did you see that? That was me.

929
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,791
Fucking hell.

930
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,067
Yeah, I didn't see that, Steven.

931
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,587
You know why?

932
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,717
'Cause it fucking happened to me.

933
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,840
Huh?

934
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,092
Oh, yeah. That was fucking awesome.

935
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,923
You're a fucking hero.

936
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,514
Does anyone care
what happened to me by any chance?

937
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,681
Save it for your fucking autobiography.

938
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,733
- Hey, Vern.
- What?

939
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,069
I like your cardboard armor.

940
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,401
It's protection from infection.

941
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,525
Frank.

942
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:14,781
What?

943
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,826
Frank, one of us needs to get
to this fucking phone.

944
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,506
I'll do it.

945
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,887
Rhodesian Special Forces trick.

946
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,507
No shit.

947
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:39,185
You know, I'm more likely to die
from the germs

948
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,767
infecting the wound than any bullets.

949
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,848
Well, I guess you're covered.

950
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,105
You'll be fine, though. You've got about...

951
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,728
You've got about an hour 20

952
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,365
before you're in trouble with that wound
and I've got to get to that phone.

953
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,243
Hey, Vern, is everybody like you
where you come from?

954
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,747
Vern is a rare and mysterious jewel.

955
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,326
Feast your eyes, boykie.

956
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,002
Watch and Vern,

957
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,005
then go back to your miserable life.

958
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,258
All right, I'll see you later, Vern.

959
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,102
Where you running off to, Frank?

960
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,600
We're just getting started.

961
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,868
- Frank!
- Ord, give us a hand, man.

962
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,872
Oh, fuck!

963
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,054
God!

964
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,231
Oh, fuck. Shit. It's me.

965
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,319
Justine, stay still!

966
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,992
Fuck. What the fuck?

967
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,868
- Martin.
- The bullets.

968
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,876
Ah! Fuck. Fuck.

969
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,504
Go fucking get them.

970
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,724
God damn it!

971
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,400
Harry, move! Move.

972
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,064
Fuck!

973
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,703
Fuck!

974
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,700
Oh, fuck! Ah! Jesus.

975
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,957
Stop shooting, you assholes.

976
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:01,464
Oh, fuck.

977
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,685
So, Ord,
are you gonna go pat down Martin's body?

978
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,777
Oh, you fucker.

979
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,206
Ten grand.

980
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,293
Fuck. Why not 20?

981
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,589
We'll leave an IOU for Vern.
I'm sure he'll understand.

982
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:50,809
I see him. I see Frank. I see Frank.
He's going for the phone! He's winning!

983
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,517
- Fuck.
- Do you think Frank's okay?

984
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,150
- What do you care, huh?
- I clipped his wing.

985
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,072
All right, I'm gonna go out there.

986
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:19,792
I gotta get the keys so I can open
the van and get the bullets, Martin.

987
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,126
Steven?

988
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,622
Ste... Fuck.

989
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:29,009
Fucking brilliant. North face of the Eiger.

990
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,486
So that's what a fucking brain looks like.

991
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,613
Whoa! Fuck!

992
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,575
Man, I thought you were fucking dead.

993
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,082
Ord! Ord! Hey, get the fuck off of me.

994
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,244
You got shot in the head, Martin.

995
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,208
Where the fuck am I?

996
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,211
Hey, hey. Party Marty.

997
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,426
I know you.

998
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,805
- Come on, man.
- Get the fuck out of there.

999
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,095
I just want my money.

1000
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,644
It's okay. I'm not shooting. It's cool.

1001
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,270
Stop running!

1002
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,739
Jesus!

1003
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,078
Ord? Yo.

1004
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,326
Where's the fucking money?

1005
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,492
Safe, man.

1006
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,876
I put it in the Fireman's Fund.

1007
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,208
Justine?

1008
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,795
Justine!

1009
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,885
Don't leave me in the dark, baby.

1010
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,051
Think she made it?

1011
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,345
Yeah, course she did.

1012
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,392
Fuck!

1013
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,187
Fuck!

1014
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,524
Fucking stop!

1015
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,279
Howard, you up there?

1016
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,112
Yo, come down, man. It's cool.
I know you fucked it all up.

1017
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,622
What's your gun doing here, man?

1018
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,877
Howard!

1019
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,338
I'm not your boy, Vern!

1020
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,629
Hey, Howard.

1021
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,928
What are you doing
all the way over there, man?

1022
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,348
It was a simple fucking plan, man.

1023
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,891
You fucked it up.

1024
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,736
What the fuck are you looking at?

1025
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,081
Get the fuck...

1026
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,802
Give me a second. I'm just gonna reload.

1027
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,680
Give me my fucking money!

1028
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,479
Fuck!

1029
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,782
- Don't do it, man.
- No?

1030
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,665
- You know where the money is?
- It's right there.

1031
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,498
Okay, look, it's all good.

1032
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,277
That's beautiful.

1033
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,784
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

1034
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,345
All right, everybody hold your fire

1035
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,853
until I find out if this motherfucker
is dead this time.

1036
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,900
Poke him in the eye. See if he flinches.

1037
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,451
Justine!

1038
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,347
You're scared.

1039
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,597
I can feel it.

1040
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,812
Look, I just want you to know,

1041
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,478
before I do this for Vern,

1042
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,815
I've been right where you are now.

1043
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,574
<i>I've scrabbled around in some lousy job,</i>

1044
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,746
<i>I've made personal sacrifices,</i>

1045
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,204
only to have some fucking parasite

1046
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,202
<i>turn up at the last minute</i>

1047
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,621
and take all the credit.

1048
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,588
That's why I appreciate the arts, you know?

1049
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,004
<i>If it wasn't for them,</i>

1050
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,808
then all we're doing... is just this.

1051
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,857
Ow! Fuck! Fucking shot me!

1052
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,785
You seem like a nice girl.

1053
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,917
We can't all be nice girls.

1054
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,120
God! No!

1055
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,751
Ow! Fuck.

1056
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,564
Fuck! You fucking shot me again!

1057
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,544
You dropped this.

1058
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,970
Oh, oh...

1059
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,719
Oh, fuck.

1060
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,992
Fuck.

1061
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,373
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1062
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,799

1065
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,486
- Stevo, you all right?
- Yeah.

1066
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,913
Yeah? I gotta go and check on Frank.

1067
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,410
Keep an eye out, all right?

1068
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,242
You stay here. You stay awake.

1069
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:34,826
I tell you what,

1070
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,836
we'll have a fucking cigarette.

1071
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:41,676
Chrissy and Stevo have a fucking cigarette.

1072
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:44,882
Mmm.

1073
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,944
Remember, Stevo, stay awake for me, yeah?

1074
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,527
'Cause if you go to sleep, you're dead.

1075
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,989
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1076
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,282
Good man.

1077
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,517
What the fuck?

1078
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,476
Oh, men.

1079
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,403
Fuck!

1080
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,334
Wait.

1081
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:34,882
I don't think so.

1082
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,679
Frank.

1083
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,820
Oh, Frank.

1084
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,664
I see you, you fucking yeti.

1085
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,175
Hello? Hello, Sandy.

1086
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:17,466
Listen to me. Where's Leary? He didn't show.

1087
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,385
Ooh, fuck!

1088
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,561
It's fucking Chris, Sandy.

1089
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,316
He's meant to be here.
I'm fucking here. Where's Leary?

1090
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,779
...look for fucking Brendan.
Tell him I'm sorry.

1091
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,191
Sandy?

1092
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,610
Fuck!

1093
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:49,923
Frank.

1094
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,339
Chris.

1095
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,487
Over here, Leary!

1096
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,657
Leary, up here, boy!

1097
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,071
Ah!

1098
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,827
You fucking cunt!

1099
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,538
Ow!

1100
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,089
Leary!

1101
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,856
Oh.

1102
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,150
Holy shit!

1103
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,117
Come on there, big man.

1104
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,782
Fuck off, you freak of nature.

1105
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,505
Stay the fuck down!

1106
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,085
Oh, fuck.

1107
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:18,758
Oh, fuck.

1108
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:22,970
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh.

1109
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,527
I'll get you home, Frank.

1110
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,526
Don't worry, I'll get you home.

1111
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,865
I'm sorry, pal.

1112
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,917
Where do you think you're going,
little Harry?

1113
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,999
I'm going to the hospital.

1114
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,790
To see my cousin.

1115
01:15:58,345 --> 01:15:59,711
Stop moving.

1116
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,135
If you go any farther with that money,
I'll shoot you in the head.

1117
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,716
Fuck you, Ord.

1118
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,702
I'm getting away, Ord.

1119
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,126
See you 'round!

1120
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,045
Don't wait up for me, Ord.

1121
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:46,136
Damn.

1122
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,060
You gotta smoke less dope

1123
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,229
if you wanna hit something
once in a while, Ord.

1124
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,557
Fuck you, trash.

1125
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,608
Start, you piece of junk.

1126
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,654
Ah.

1127
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,076
Let's go.

1128
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:06,615
Here we go.

1129
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,031
Come on, Ord.

1130
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,256
That you, Harry?

1131
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,050
<i>Is that John Denver, Harry?</i>

1132
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,509
<i>Four-eyed fucking faggot.</i>

1133
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,507
- What the fuck?
<i>- I'm still here.</i>

1134
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,763
I'll be the last man standing.

1135
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,640
Ha!

1136
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,120
Get the fuck out of here, you fucking zombie!

1137
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,582
Nice ride!

1138
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,370
Ah, get the fuck out of here!

1139
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:28,898
I'd say we got about 15 minutes
before the fuzz shows up.

1140
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:36,496
Yeah? What do you wanna do?

1141
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,830
Get a beer.

1142
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,636
Sure. Why the fuck not?

1143
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,590
Who's buying?

1144
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,306
Technically, you are.

1145
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,183
Yeah?

1146
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,436
Hey, how about we go Dutch, eh?

1147
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,991
Oh...

1148
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,041
Oh, fuck!

1149
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,961
- Get your fucking hands off.
- Hey, hey, come on, come on.

1150
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,762
- Fuck off.
- Proud bastard.

1151
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,677
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1152
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,139
You could catch your death of cold in here.

1153
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,476
Boy, they really did a number on you,
didn't they?

1154
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,400
Do you want me to hold that?

1155
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,436
You know, I think I can manage.

1156
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,689
Why don't you sit down right there?

1157
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,490
Go grab a seat.

1158
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,448
Fuck...

1159
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,837
Oh, fuck. I think they shot Harry in the ass.

1160
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:21,143
All right, I got a John Denver story for you.

1161
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,933
So...

1162
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:27,849
Huh?

1163
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,607
You made it. Good for you.

1164
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:17,857
Yeah.

1165
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,079
I'm sorry, you got in the way.

1166
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,032
Well...

1167
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,164
Hey, who were the shooters?

1168
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,913
Oh, I'm not good with names.

1169
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,959
- Martin hired them.
- Oh.

1170
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:41,882
So, about dinner... can I take a rain check?

1171
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,603
Hey, you take what you want, girl.

1171
01:23:48,305 --> 01:24:48,826
