3
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,751
Freddie!

4
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:29,817
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,784
Should we go in?

6
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:35,784
No, no.

7
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:39,417
No, just let her get some rest.

8
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,317
...temporal lobe where
most of the damage took place.

9
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,651
Due to the hematoma

10
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:50,417
and the CNS pathways
being affected,

11
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,517
there's been an onset
of Aphasia.

12
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,417
Sorry, it's just, uh...

13
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,584
It's a lot of words now...

14
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:02,617
really know what
any of them mean, so...

15
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:08,517
I don't think things are ever
going back to the way they were.

16
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:14,250
Some choices need to be made
for us to move forward.

17
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,784
Okay.

18
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,050
So, um... I mean how...

19
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,183
How much time
does she have, then?

20
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,250
We'll know more
in a couple of days.

21
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,484
Is there any hope of her
memories returning?

22
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,517
Well, in theory,

23
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,784
every experience
we have in our lives

24
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:40,617
is stored in our
brain somewhere.

25
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:00,350
<i>Identifying patterns
in past data</i>

26
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,651
<i>to predict trends
in future data</i>

27
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:07,217
<i>is how all successful organizations
make beneficial decisions.</i>

28
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,617
<i>And that's what we do here
in data analytics.</i>

29
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,217
Inventory levels, employee break times.
It could be anything.

30
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,250
It is all just patterns
for us to identify,

31
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,551
<i>quantify and label.</i>

32
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:52,284
So I see here
a bit of schooling in...

33
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,584
Visual Arts?

34
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,817
Yeah, I... That's, um...

35
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:59,050
Dreams of youth, I guess.

36
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,551
Fred got a new job!

37
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,450
You should tell her
about it, Fred.

38
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,083
<i>It's really great.</i>

39
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,717
<i>He's doing really well.</i>

40
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,384
She's not gone, you know,
she's still here.

41
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah, no, I know.

42
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,350
- I love you.
- I love you too.

43
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,183
Fuck it.

44
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,517
<i>Hello?</i>

45
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,551
<i>Hel...</i>

46
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>Hel...</i>

47
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,784
Come on.

48
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,150
Obey...

49
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:46,284
Prison...

50
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,651
System...

51
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,684
Language...

52
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:56,751
<i>Fred...</i>

53
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:04,083
Cindy?

54
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,450
Don't let me go.

55
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,484
Fucking asshole.

56
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,484
What?

57
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,517
Fred.

58
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,851
Yeah?

59
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,584
What are you doing?

60
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,183
Uh...

61
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,484
Nothing, just...

62
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,317
You know, organizing.

63
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:09,183
In the middle of the night?

64
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,484
Yeah.

65
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,651
<i>And so
our portal-based software</i>

66
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:19,584
will enable a new level
of granular metrics.

67
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,517
Essentially, we need to
anticipate our clients' needs

68
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,817
to know what they want
before they do.

69
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,851
Now, we to understand
how they think before they do.

70
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,217
We need, in effect, to be...

71
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,784
The Art Spirit.

72
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,284
What?

73
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:35,784
<i>The Art Spirit</i> by Robert Henri.

74
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,117
You borrowed that
your senior year

75
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,450
and it was never returned.

76
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:42,150
Oh, oh. Okay, uh, yeah.

77
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,350
I could see-see
what I could do about that.

78
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,784
How do you even remember that?

79
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:50,117
I remember
little Freddie Fitzell.

80
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,350
And, yes, I do remember
Cindy Williams,

81
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,817
due to her, well,
um, troubles, you know,

82
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:58,484
<i>attendance and whatnot.</i>

83
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,484
<i>So, I've been having
trouble tracking her down.</i>

84
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,350
<i>I haven't been able to find
a single trace of her</i>

85
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,517
<i>since graduation.</i>

86
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:04,617
<i>Well, that figures.</i>

87
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,183
<i>She never turned up</i>

88
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,751
<i>for final exams
your graduation year</i>

89
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,317
<i>so she didn't graduate.</i>

90
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,517
<i>She just vanished.</i>

91
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,384
Of course, that was the time

92
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:21,450
when that awful drug
went around the school.

93
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,517
Lost a couple students to it,
if I remember.

94
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:29,684
What was that
horrible stuff called?

95
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,517
Uh, Mercury.

96
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,484
It was called Mercury.

97
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,117
I was thinking maybe we could
knock down the wall

98
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,584
between the spare room
and the closet.

99
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:41,551
Maybe make a walk-in
or a home office.

100
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,150
Eventually a baby room?

101
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:45,584
You know who I saw today?

102
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,284
Who?

103
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,484
Mrs. Shouldice.

104
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:52,183
Remember, from Fairgate?

105
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,751
Do you believe it,
she's still there?

106
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,217
Where'd you see her?

107
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:59,484
Uh, I went by the school,
actually, um...

108
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:04,751
I don't know, I guess I was
feeling nostalgic or something.

109
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,284
What?

110
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,350
Nothing, it's just
a little weird.

111
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:10,784
You wanna choose one?

112
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,817
Sure.

113
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,384
Um...

114
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,784
No, we are not having
a purple bathroom.

115
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,484
It says medieval wine.

116
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,617
Why? Goes with the curtains.

117
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,584
We could be like

118
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:44,417
the couple that matches
their bathroom stuff.

119
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:14,250
Anyone talking during
the test will receive an automatic zero.

120
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,150
Anyone getting up
from their desk

121
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:18,317
during the test
will receive a zero.

122
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,450
Anyone looking
at someone else's paper

123
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:25,450
will receive a big, fat zero.

124
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,317
Miss Williams?

125
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,751
Are you with us?

126
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,450
Talking. Moving. Looking.

127
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,684
Zero.

128
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,717
If you do not
do well on this quiz

129
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,384
it means you have not familiarized
yourself with the material.

130
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,417
Which means you will probably
fail your final exam,

131
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,183
not graduate high school,
not find gainful employment,

132
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:52,684
which means it will be
very difficult for you

133
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:57,517
to entice the woman
of your dreams.

134
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:01,517
Mr. Fitzell, have I connected

135
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:05,384
D to C to B
all the way back to A,

136
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,817
which is where you're sitting,
in a way that is sufficient

137
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:12,484
for you to understand
the significance of A?

138
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:14,551
Yeah.

139
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:17,684
There's your girl.

140
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:21,217
You'll have 60 minutes.

141
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,651
And begin...

142
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,050
now.

143
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,350
Mr. McDonald, could I go
to the bathroom really quick?

144
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,284
When you've finished
your test, Mr. Fitzell.

145
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,217
Finished!

146
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,817
Hey, man. You got them?
Come over here.

147
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:41,784
Thank you.

148
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,117
Lobby.

149
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,384
Lobby...

150
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,317
Language...

151
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,083
...your.

152
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,150
...your.

153
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,217
What?

154
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:46,183
I'm in... your... lobby.

155
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,083
What the fuck am I doing?

156
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:07,384
Fred...

157
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,183
It's all right.

158
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,317
Fred, stay with me.

159
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,183
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.

160
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:17,817
Fred! Fight!
Fred, fight! Get off of him!

161
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,484
Let him go!
Fred, fight!

162
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:23,350
- Fred!
- Fred! Don't let me go.

163
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,384
Fred!

164
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,217
Hey.

165
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,150
You're okay.

166
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:37,117
Jesus, what happened?

167
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:01,617
Fred?

168
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:04,584
She's ready for us.

169
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,617
Okay, I'll be right there.

170
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,484
Look who's here!

171
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,384
Hey, Mom.

172
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:20,584
How you feeling?

173
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,450
Wow, what's all this?

174
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,317
Janice has been helping
her organize her photos.

175
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,751
Those my old drawings?

176
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,551
Oh, wow.

177
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,250
Ma, hey, you remember this one?

178
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,183
Remember?

179
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:52,284
The little yellow house?

180
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,584
I always said
I wanted to live in

181
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:55,751
an all yellow house
when I grew up.

182
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,284
It's okay.

183
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:15,250
<i>Come on, Freddie.</i>

184
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:20,083
Time to clean up your crayons
and brush your teeth.

185
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,751
Come on, buddy.
Put them all away.

186
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:26,484
I don't want to.

187
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,617
Freddie,
Santa knows which little boys

188
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,117
listen to their mothers
and which ones don't.

189
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,417
You want Santa to bring you
presents or coal?

190
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,350
Freddie!

191
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:33,183
So, we're all moved into
our new apartment.

192
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:34,684
You should tell her
about it, Fred.

193
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:12,150
Here, take this!
Hide it! Hide it!

194
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:15,117
Look, man,
they won't suspect you.

195
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,117
<i>Hey!</i>

196
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,717
Look, I know it's really hard
to see her...

197
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:59,450
Just stop, she...

198
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,450
She doesn't know who I am.

199
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,384
She's gone,
she's-she's already gone.

200
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,117
Motherfucker!

201
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:56,250
Shit, man.

202
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:57,617
How long has it been?

203
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,651
- Thirteen years?
- No!

204
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,083
Yeah. I can't believe you were
at your mom's when I called.

205
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,584
- I didn't expect that.
- No, man, I live there.

206
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,517
Mm, fuck, really?

207
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:09,484
Yeah, man. You know, I got
all my creature comforts there,

208
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:12,384
and it's just a stone's throw
from my "office,"

209
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,651
- So, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

210
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:17,551
It's so crazy
seeing you, man.

211
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,117
Yeah. You too, man.
I can't even remember how we lost touch.

212
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,450
No, me neither, man.
Me neither.

213
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,050
Well...

214
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,851
Let's get fucked up.

215
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,450
Hey, I'm so glad
you called, man.

216
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:35,717
So, you really...
You didn't keep in touch

217
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,851
with Cindy at all
after graduation?

218
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:39,517
Aw, you kidding, man?

219
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:43,817
I forgot that chick
as soon as I could.

220
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:46,350
You, on the other hand,
I'd never forget.

221
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:49,517
It's just...
I've been remembering things.

222
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:53,350
This one night, you, me, Cindy,
when we were on Mercury...

223
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:57,217
What the hell was that shit?

224
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:00,284
Who knows?

225
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:01,851
You don't remember anything
bad happening to her?

226
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,617
Man, that shit was strong.

227
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:06,284
I couldn't remember
what happened the next day.

228
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,350
You think I'm gonna remember
that shit now?

229
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:15,450
Hey, I'll tell you
what I do remember:

230
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:19,117
the first time you tried Merc.

231
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,817
Do you remember that?

232
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:24,217
Yep. How could I forget.

233
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,117
Janitors gotta get high too.

234
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:15,450
Andre, Cindy, this is Fred.

235
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:18,450
Fred has a talent for being in
the right place at the right time.

236
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:21,350
I just hid the bag.
It wasn't a big deal.

237
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,617
Mm-hm. Well, it's time
to stop hiding it.

238
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,551
- It's time to stop hiding it, Fred.
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

239
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:37,250
Here's your reward.

240
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,517
You've never done Merc, huh?

241
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,517
Merc? Uh...

242
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:50,250
No, I just stick to weed mostly.

243
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:51,417
Mm.

244
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,450
- I smoke it a lot.
- Mm. Hm-hm.

245
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:58,751
Hey, man, once again,
right place, right time, huh?

246
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:01,317
Could you just
stop fucking talking?

247
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,083
Move.

248
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,717
Don't worry,
it's not even pure Merc.

249
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,817
Cut with other shit, diluted.

250
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,284
Yeah, when are we
getting the real stuff?

251
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:24,484
- Soon.
- Oh, what...

252
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:25,584
What does it do to you?

253
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,117
Hey...

254
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,150
Don't let anything
influence you.

255
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,284
Make a choice yourself.

256
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:01,183
Well, what do we do now?

257
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:04,517
Sit back... enjoy the show.

258
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,584
You shouldn't have
given it to him, Sebastian.

259
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:06,784
Look at him.

260
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,050
He's fine.

261
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:14,551
What?

262
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,651
You're doing good.

263
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,417
There's so much to explore if you
don't succumb to pleasure or fear.

264
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,284
Are you following me?

265
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:52,751
Uh...

266
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:55,817
No, no. I don't...
I mean, I...

267
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,817
You're either coming with me
or you're letting me go.

268
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:00,083
Which one is it?

269
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,651
I'm coming.

270
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:08,284
I'm not your tour guide.

271
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:10,717
I don't take it to be like them.

272
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,317
<i>I take it to explore.</i>

273
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,217
<i>Explore where?</i>

274
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:25,317
<i>Anywhere but here.</i>

275
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:39,617
Wait, wait...

276
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:50,684
I'm sorry.
My mind's just wandering.

277
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,317
Your mind is wandering?

278
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:05,083
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

279
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:21,551
You're drawing again?

280
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,484
No, no, that's, uh...

281
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:27,450
Not really.
Just, uh, some illustrations.

282
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,417
How's the job going?

283
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,617
Karen, relax. It's just
a couple of drawings, okay.

284
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:40,150
I just asked
how the job was going.

285
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,784
Nothing for 13 years,
now I can't get rid of you.

286
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:05,350
I can't believe
you still live here.

287
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:08,784
Listen, my mom's having
a little nap, so, shh.

288
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:13,417
Oh, I got a little
surprise for you.

289
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:22,551
No shit. Andre?

290
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:24,183
Sorry.

291
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,684
It's good to see you, Fred.

292
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:27,150
Dude...

293
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:30,484
It's good to see you too, man!
Holy shit!

294
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:33,551
Oh, Andre, man, what's going on?
How you been?

295
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,617
Well, um, married,
two kids, two and a half.

296
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:39,183
Jenny's pregnant again.

297
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:42,083
Wow, Jesus. Shit.

298
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,284
What about you?

299
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:47,417
I'm an information analyst
right now, so...

300
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,817
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, old times, huh?

301
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,517
Old times.

302
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,784
<i>The play has been overturned
to an incomplete pass.</i>

303
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:56,150
Cindy? No way.

304
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,817
Uh, she hasn't even
crossed my mind in 15 years.

305
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,450
What about her friend,
what was her name?

306
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:02,784
Laurie something, I don't know,

307
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:04,417
but you think maybe
she kept in touch with her?

308
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,384
Man,
wherever she is, she's fine.

309
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,183
That girl never needed anyone.

310
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,183
Why are we even
talking about her?

311
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:11,817
Sebastian? Honey?

312
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:15,284
Oh, shit. Well, she's up.

313
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:17,551
- Sebastian!
- Yeah, Ma?

314
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:23,517
So, what's this whole
Cindy thing about anyway?

315
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,617
I don't know,
it's just been, um,

316
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:32,250
I've been remembering
things recently.

317
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:36,417
There's just one night
we were on Merc.

318
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,584
And I can't just sh...

319
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,517
I can't shake the feeling
that something...

320
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,484
something bad happened to her.

321
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,050
You know, and we all forgot.

322
00:38:55,117 --> 00:39:00,284
Man, that whole time back then
is just "shew"... You know?

323
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:02,083
Hard to make heads or tails
of any of that.

324
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:08,350
Have you studied at all?

325
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:10,317
What?

326
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:18,284
Have you studied yet?

327
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,417
Hey, what the fuck
you talking about?

328
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:27,651
For final exams?

329
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,651
You don't understand
what I'm saying?

330
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:57,183
Hey, Fred.

331
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:11,284
Yeah, hi, Fred.

332
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:13,584
Look at these two already.

333
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:16,083
All right, you crackheads,
let's go.

334
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,150
I got to meet my guy.

335
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:40,284
How old are you?

336
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:42,717
Old enough to know this place
is a piece of shit.

337
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,250
I'll meet you out back.

338
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,284
Where we going?

339
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,751
What if they catch us up here?

340
00:40:58,684 --> 00:41:00,183
They don't.

341
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,284
What?

342
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:10,284
I was just realizing that...

343
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,284
I don't know if we've ever
had a conversation

344
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:14,350
where we weren't on Merc.

345
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:19,784
It's like you only exist
when I'm on this drug.

346
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,517
What are you looking for?

347
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:31,050
Why is it so important
for you to explore?

348
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:34,517
I don't want to be like them.

349
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:39,284
Locked in a prison

350
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:41,284
that they forgot
that they're in.

351
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,384
What prison?

352
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,183
Look at all of them.

353
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,751
Running around.

354
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:51,484
Pretending they know
exactly who they are

355
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:53,350
and why they're doing
what they're doing.

356
00:41:53,384 --> 00:41:56,417
They-they don't
have a fucking clue.

357
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,350
None of it matters.

358
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:04,284
All they're doing is...

359
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:07,250
giving things labels.

360
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:09,651
Giving inaccurate names
to things that are

361
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,551
infinite and unknowable.

362
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,484
This is your name.

363
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,684
This is your house.

364
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:21,250
This is your language.

365
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:23,250
This is your job.

366
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:25,117
Labeling every
little thing,

367
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,784
even the fucking label-maker.

368
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:31,450
And then they look around
at their world of...

369
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,050
utterly meaningless labels

370
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:39,651
and say...

371
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:44,384
"This is our reality."

372
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:48,784
That prison.

373
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:56,284
But how do we break free, then?

374
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,284
We?

375
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,117
Are you following me again?

376
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:04,083
Uh...

377
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:06,517
Yeah.

378
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,617
We have to remember

379
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,584
the power that we have.

380
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:18,050
The power of choice.

381
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,350
The power
of every single second.

382
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:27,083
The power of... now.

383
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:30,784
Now.

384
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:37,083
Now.

385
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:52,217
Well, they're probably
looking for us.

386
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:01,083
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.

387
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:02,851
Hey-hey-hey-hey, calm down.

388
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:04,651
Get her on her side.

389
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:11,217
Choosing...

390
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,384
Life-form... Which...

391
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:16,083
Shape...

392
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:17,050
Gold...

393
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:19,784
Hey, man!

394
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:21,717
Whoop.

395
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:24,284
Massive score. It's in.

396
00:44:24,317 --> 00:44:27,717
How'd you like to do pure,
uncut Merc.

397
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:30,217
They said we could get some

398
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,551
at, uh, this place...

399
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:34,250
next week...

400
00:44:36,684 --> 00:44:38,484
...if we drop by.

401
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:43,384
This is it.

402
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:46,617
This is how it happens.

403
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,350
- Fred?
- Yes, um...

404
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:56,817
What are you doing?

405
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:58,617
Uh... What am I...?

406
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,050
Um...

407
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,350
Dreams of youth?

408
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:05,651
Yeah, that's, um...

409
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:11,517
Sorry, what's, uh, up?
What's up?

410
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,117
Are you ready for tomorrow?

411
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,851
What's tomorrow?

412
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:19,250
Tomorrow, yes, the Q2
presentation, of course. Um...

413
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,851
- Yeah, um, I'm getting there.
- You're getting there?

414
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,284
Yeah, I'm almost...
It'll be...

415
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:24,784
- You're almost ready?
- Yeah.

416
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,851
- Whoo.
- Could I steal you for a second?

417
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:32,117
Sure, okay.

418
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,517
I am sensing a lack of focus.

419
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:39,417
Also, you have been late
three times this month.

420
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,150
If it happens again, there will
have to be consequences.

421
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,117
Sorry. Sorry.

422
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,250
Um, no, I know,
I'm trying to, uh...

423
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:50,484
I understand. I'll be better.

424
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:53,150
You have to present
your Q2 report to the board.

425
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,484
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow.

426
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:55,651
- Mm-hm.
- Nine AM.

427
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:58,717
- I know.
- Are you going to be ready?

428
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,050
Yeah, I'm gonna be ready
for tomorrow. Mm-hm.

429
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:06,417
Is that... Are you...
Is that all?

430
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,651
Jesus, man, what?

431
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:14,117
<i>I remember.</i>

432
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:30,784
It... It was
right before final exams.

433
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:35,617
Those weird fuckers
I used to grab off of...

434
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:37,717
told us we could get uncut Merc.

435
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:40,350
Yeah, you're sure
Cindy came with us?

436
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,083
I don't remember this at all.

437
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:43,851
I don't remember any party
or any...

438
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,717
Then why the fuck are you here?

439
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,150
Okay, can either of you guys
honestly tell me

440
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,417
you ever remember seeing
Cindy after that night?

441
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:05,417
We gotta go back.
We got to go back.

442
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,284
We gotta... we gotta try to remember
what happened to her that night.

443
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:11,384
We gotta retrace our steps.
We gotta remember.

444
00:47:12,484 --> 00:47:14,317
So, where did we go that night?

445
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:28,817
It was a...

446
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:33,250
It was a building,
it was like a...

447
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:37,517
<i>old broken-down building.</i>

448
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:40,284
Blackbird street.

449
00:47:42,817 --> 00:47:44,551
It was on Blackbird Street.

450
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:52,517
No time like the present?

451
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:57,317
No time like the present.

452
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,717
<i>Do you know
where the fuck we're going?</i>

453
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:16,684
I know where we're going!

454
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,250
Here we are.

455
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,584
Well, we saw it.

456
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,651
Guys...

457
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:22,317
Fred, no!

458
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,784
There's absolutely
no reason to go in there.

459
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,717
Fuck.

460
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,284
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

461
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:14,651
Squatters.

462
00:50:14,684 --> 00:50:16,284
What?

463
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:18,417
Fucking bums, man.

464
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:38,150
This is it.

465
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,450
This is where it happened.

466
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,651
I can't go in there.

467
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:48,584
I-I can't go in that room.

468
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:53,551
Okay. It's all right.
You guys stay here.

469
00:51:58,317 --> 00:51:59,651
Let's leave.

470
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,450
Now. Let's just go.

471
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:09,150
What do you know?

472
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:11,817
You know something,
I know you do, tell me.

473
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:15,584
I don't know. I just...

474
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,751
I know that
we're supposed to be here.

475
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:22,684
Well, well...

476
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,284
Hundred percent pure.

477
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:30,250
Shall we?

478
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:53,651
Fuck. Let's not stay long.

479
00:53:11,851 --> 00:53:13,684
What are you doing?

480
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:16,551
Stop pulling my ear.

481
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:18,183
Stop.

482
00:53:19,284 --> 00:53:20,617
Okay, okay.

483
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,617
Fuck it.

484
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,183
Jesus, Andre, what the fuck?

485
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:36,484
Listen to me, listen to
me, listen to me, listen to me.

486
00:54:36,517 --> 00:54:39,817
Don't...
Don't-don't take it, okay?

487
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:41,651
- What?
- It's not what we think it is.

488
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:43,083
And then
they're-they're everywhere.

489
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:44,018
They're all over
the fucking place

490
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,484
so we have to get
the fuck out of here.

491
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:46,651
Who? Who are you talking about?

492
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:48,350
The-the bums.

493
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,150
The fucking bums
are in the fucking building.

494
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:51,484
- Okay, we got to, we got to go.
- Calm down.

495
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:52,651
Calm down.
You got to breathe. Okay?

496
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:55,250
- Take a fucking breath.
- Oh, oh, shit.

497
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,450
Shit, Andre.
What the fuck is happening?

498
00:54:57,484 --> 00:55:00,417
Fred, Fred, okay,
just-just whatever you do,

499
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,817
just don't take it,
whatever you do.

500
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:04,284
I already fucking took it, okay?

501
00:55:06,117 --> 00:55:08,684
What's going to happen to me?
Huh?

502
00:55:08,717 --> 00:55:09,817
Andre...

503
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,784
Oh, shit, it's already
fucking happening to you!

504
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:44,150
Music...

505
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:48,551
Interpret...

506
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,817
True...

507
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:38,450
Your...

508
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:42,784
Elaborate...

509
00:56:45,384 --> 00:56:47,183
State...

510
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,584
What's wrong with him?

511
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:53,651
And...

512
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:58,717
Not a thing in the world.

513
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:01,217
Trying...

514
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,217
How much Merc is he on?

515
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,350
Sane...

516
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:10,417
A lot.

517
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,250
Itself...

518
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:15,217
He's just a kid.

519
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,384
He's no more a kid
than you are an old man, man.

520
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,217
True...

521
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,050
Same...

522
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,183
On...

523
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:32,150
Invasive...

524
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,250
As...

525
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:38,050
Controlling...

526
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:42,551
When...

527
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:45,350
Temporarily...

528
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:50,517
Eliminating...

529
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:55,651
Consciousness...

530
00:57:57,117 --> 00:57:58,684
What are you all
still doing here?

531
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:01,851
We never left.

532
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:03,551
Neither did you.

533
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,050
Fred...

534
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:28,417
Here is still here.

535
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,250
No...

536
00:58:34,284 --> 00:58:36,217
No, no, no. No!

537
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,183
No! No! No!

538
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:40,484
No, I need help!

539
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,117
Tell them I need help!

540
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,284
I took too much!

541
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,450
It's okay, Fred.

542
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,751
It's okay.

543
00:58:48,884 --> 00:58:50,250
It's okay.

544
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,284
You're here. You're really here.

545
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,751
Fred, I understand...

546
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,651
I understand what the Merc
is doing to us.

547
00:58:59,684 --> 00:59:02,551
I thought I was back here...
here.

548
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,384
I was older...

549
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,817
It's not a matter
of one point being real

550
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:08,150
and the other not.

551
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:11,117
All points exist simultaneously.

552
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,784
Try a small transition at first.

553
00:59:15,484 --> 00:59:18,584
Concentrate on your
experiences here.

554
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,517
In this place.

555
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:27,784
Memory...

556
00:59:27,817 --> 00:59:29,584
Are you talking about memory?

557
00:59:30,517 --> 00:59:32,417
Concentrate...

558
00:59:45,717 --> 00:59:48,217
Oh, shit. It's already
fucking happening to you!

559
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:53,584
Oh, my God.

560
00:59:56,317 --> 00:59:58,183
It's not a memory.

561
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:01,384
It's still happening.

562
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,217
No! No, no!

563
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,817
No, I don't believe it.

564
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:09,350
What... What do you want from me?

565
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:11,083
Fred.

566
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:20,617
This is only one of my lives.

567
01:00:24,517 --> 01:00:29,350
One set of choices
and I exist in all of them.

568
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:31,784
Simultaneously.

569
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:36,284
I'm more free
than you could ever imagine.

570
01:00:40,117 --> 01:00:44,417
I've seen the skylines
of a thousand cities.

571
01:00:47,317 --> 01:00:51,484
I've looked into the eyes
of a hundred grandkids.

572
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:55,617
The ones that I love the most,

573
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:57,450
they look like you.

574
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:03,384
Come with me.

575
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:09,584
I'll show you
all the possibilities.

576
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:15,050
How?

577
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,250
Go with him.

578
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,551
He'll show you the way.

579
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:27,517
Itself...

580
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:31,217
Color...

581
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,384
Language...

582
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:35,684
Control...

583
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:36,817
Shape...

584
01:01:36,851 --> 01:01:38,450
Misinterpretation...

585
01:01:38,484 --> 01:01:39,684
On...

586
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,417
The system you are using
to interpret reality

587
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,584
is not one of your choosing.

588
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:50,651
Numbers. Language. Color.

589
01:01:50,684 --> 01:01:51,784
Shape.

590
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:53,183
All a misinterpretation

591
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:55,284
of the information around you.

592
01:01:55,317 --> 01:01:57,484
A misinterpretation
imposed on you

593
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:58,851
by an invasive life-form

594
01:01:58,884 --> 01:02:01,417
that is trying to control
your consciousness.

595
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,817
The substance you ingested

596
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:04,751
temporarily counteracts
the influence

597
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:07,551
of the invasive life-form
that is trying to force you

598
01:02:07,584 --> 01:02:11,350
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:

599
01:02:11,384 --> 01:02:12,817
in a linear fashion.

600
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:16,317
To perceive choices
as having inescapable outcomes.

601
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,350
Outcomes it has dictated to you,

602
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:22,551
thereby controlling all of your choices
and, in effect, eliminating them.

603
01:02:22,584 --> 01:02:24,384
It achieves this goal
by influencing you

604
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,484
to perceive the most elaborate
of all misinterpretations...

605
01:02:28,117 --> 01:02:29,183
Time.

606
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:31,517
Fred.

607
01:03:32,817 --> 01:03:36,050
Fred! Fred, it's all right.

608
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:38,817
Stay with me.

609
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:41,384
Do you hear me?
Stay with me, Fred. Fred.

610
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,717
Fred! Fred! Fight!

611
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:47,350
Get off him! Let him go!
Fred, fight!

612
01:03:47,384 --> 01:03:48,651
- Let him...
- Fred...

613
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,250
Fred!

614
01:03:57,284 --> 01:03:59,384
Get the fuck off of me!

615
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:02,050
Fuck you! I'll fuck you up!

616
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,484
Fashion...

617
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:27,384
Influence...

618
01:04:29,117 --> 01:04:30,817
- Force...
- Hey, come on, Fred.

619
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:34,217
Come on. Let's go!
Fuck. Come on, let's go!

620
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,150
Fred, come on!

621
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:41,651
Hey!

622
01:04:41,684 --> 01:04:43,284
Fred! Fred.

623
01:04:44,717 --> 01:04:48,117
Fr... Fred! Jesus Christ.
It's okay.

624
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,484
Did you take something?

625
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:52,651
Hey, hey, Fred.

626
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,150
Hey!
Please.

627
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:59,751
Fred?

628
01:04:59,784 --> 01:05:01,250
Honey?

629
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:02,751
Are you all right?

630
01:05:02,784 --> 01:05:05,384
Fred!

631
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:06,817
Open the door!

632
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,517
Are you all right?

633
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:56,050
Shit, shit, shit!

634
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,517
Shit, shit, shit.

635
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:46,717
Freddie.

636
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,751
You're not gonna say anything?

637
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:05,450
About yesterday?

638
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,150
You have finals today.

639
01:07:14,517 --> 01:07:17,350
Do you know
how important that is?

640
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:19,417
To your whole life.

641
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:27,784
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

642
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:37,817
I'll be right there.

643
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,350
Anyone not at their
desk in the next ten seconds

644
01:08:44,384 --> 01:08:46,784
will receive an automatic zero
on their exam

645
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:48,384
and will not be graduating.

646
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:49,784
If you think I'm bluffing
I encourage you

647
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:51,684
to test that theory.

648
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:07,751
All right, you will have
60 minutes beginning...

649
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:10,083
now.

650
01:09:11,684 --> 01:09:14,517
...that specialize in
a multitude of areas of business

651
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:16,217
so you can be
absolutely sure that...

652
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,517
Fred Fitzell!

653
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,284
Yeah?

654
01:09:19,317 --> 01:09:21,317
Could you present your Q2 report

655
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,050
to the board, please?

656
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,150
Now?

657
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:35,317
So, we can see from...

658
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:38,217
from the previous six quarters

659
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,784
we can estimate that this...

660
01:09:40,617 --> 01:09:42,050
Q2 numbers...

661
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:45,217
The Q2 numbers, uh...

662
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:18,117
An invasive life-form
that is trying to force you

663
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:21,817
to perceive information
in the same manner as itself:

664
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,384
in a linear fashion.

665
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,717
<i>Mr. Fitzell!</i>

666
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:35,817
Fred!

667
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:44,384
I can see it.

668
01:10:49,384 --> 01:10:52,350
Why are you even here right now?

669
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:54,217
You've always been here,
huh, haven't you?

670
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,284
Where, where, where?

671
01:10:56,317 --> 01:10:59,217
I can feel you.

672
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:03,217
I'm in your prison
right now, huh?!

673
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,384
Aren't I?! I can feel it!

674
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:17,417
Now.

675
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:20,417
Now!

676
01:11:24,384 --> 01:11:25,751
None of this fucking matters!

677
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:27,584
I didn't choose
this fucking life.

678
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,217
None of you fucking move!

679
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,617
Get him out of here now.
Get him out!

680
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:33,417
I'll get my fucking self
out of here!

681
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,117
I'm not even here!
I'm not even here right now!

682
01:11:38,517 --> 01:11:39,684
I'm not even here right...

683
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:41,083
now.

684
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:00,250
Be right there.

685
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:04,551
Be right there.

686
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:17,484
<i>Hello?</i>

687
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:19,484
Hi, Mrs. Bellamy,
is Sebastian there?

688
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:21,551
<i>He can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

689
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:23,450
Okay, okay, when do you think
he'll be able to, uh...

690
01:12:23,484 --> 01:12:25,317
<i>He can't come
to the phone ever.</i>

691
01:12:26,751 --> 01:12:27,617
What? What do you mean?

692
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:29,684
<i>I don't want you
around my boy anymore.</i>

693
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:31,551
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- Fred! Fred!

694
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:35,183
What is going on?
The entire board is waiting inside.

695
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:43,551
Now.

696
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,484
- Yo.
- What's up?

697
01:13:01,517 --> 01:13:03,284
- Have you seen Cindy?
- No.

698
01:13:03,317 --> 01:13:06,217
Do you know if she
left with us last night?

699
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,083
Dude, did she leave the
fucking party with us or not?

700
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,350
I don't fucking know!
All right?

701
01:13:10,384 --> 01:13:12,350
You gentlemen
have somewhere to be?

702
01:13:12,384 --> 01:13:13,551
Where does she live?

703
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:15,784
What?

704
01:13:15,817 --> 01:13:17,517
I said "Do you know
where she fucking lives?"

705
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:22,284
Why are you asking that?

706
01:13:23,784 --> 01:13:26,350
Why do you...
Why do you care so much?

707
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:32,450
Let's go!

708
01:13:42,817 --> 01:13:44,050
Now.

709
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:48,217
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

710
01:13:52,717 --> 01:13:53,717
Now.

711
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:56,617
Freddie!

712
01:14:00,717 --> 01:14:02,551
Freddie!

713
01:14:02,584 --> 01:14:04,384
Freddie, come back!

714
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:07,150
Freddie!

715
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:37,517
Stop!

716
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:03,117
<i>Fred.</i>

717
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,083
I'm still here.

718
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:17,050
You'll always be here.

719
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,250
I thought you
needed me to save you.

720
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,551
But it was you
trying to save me.

721
01:15:44,183 --> 01:15:45,183
Now.

722
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:39,384
Where do you want to go?

723
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,651
Everywhere.

724
01:18:13,817 --> 01:18:15,517
You finished another one.

725
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:37,050
<i>You hear what I said?</i>

726
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:44,083
We're almost out.

727
01:19:47,117 --> 01:19:48,484
I'll go out soon.

728
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,784
I got you something today.

729
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,417
What is it?

730
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,083
It made me think of you.

731
01:21:57,784 --> 01:22:00,284
Now it'll make me
think of you too.

732
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:20,284
It's okay.

733
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:23,417
I'll find it again.

734
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:01,150
Hi, Mom.

735
01:24:09,317 --> 01:24:11,751
I know you don't
remember me but, uh...

736
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:14,417
I'm your son.

737
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:08,050
It's you...

738
01:25:10,617 --> 01:25:11,684
It's you.

739
01:25:48,684 --> 01:25:50,517
Freddie! No!

740
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:51,851
No!

Freddie?

744
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:22,217
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

745

This is you here?

746
01:26:23,784 --> 01:26:26,417
This is you.

747
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,183
Yeah...

748
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:31,317
- It's you?
- Yeah, it's me. It's me.

749
01:26:38,784 --> 01:26:40,617
It's me, it's me.

I can't.

754
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:26,617
I can't follow you anymore.

755
01:27:29,517 --> 01:27:30,684
I know.

756
01:28:24,517 --> 01:28:26,150
How do you think you did?

757
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:30,617
I think I gave them
what they wanted.

758

01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,183
Remember what
