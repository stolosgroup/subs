3
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,569
I look good, baby.

4
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,934
Yeah, you do, baby.

5
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,303
Hm.

6
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,838
Baby.

7
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,315
Let's go cause some trouble.

8
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,654
This might go south. We need backup.

9
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,735
What if somebody gets killed
because of the product they're selling?

10
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,264
What if you die?

11
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,805
- It doesn't matter.
- Look.

12
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,143
I've been chasing their boss forever.

13
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,115
Yeah, so maybe it's time to do
something different for once.

14
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,709
- You with me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,516
I'm gonna go in after these guys.
I'm not letting these guys go.

16
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,489
- I'm with you! I'm with you.
- All right, let's go! Come on!

17
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,236
Don't make Mama Bear
get fucking pissed off...

18
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,501
Yeah, this whole deal
is bullshit. Bullshit!

19
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,011
Gotta get out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

20
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,967
- <i>I'm not leaving you!</i>
- <i>Go!</i>

21
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,377
- <i>They're not gonna get away with this.</i>
- <i>Run!</i>

22
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,290
Goddamn!

23
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,769
A flesh wound's not
supposed to hurt this bad! Is it? Ah!

24
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,532
Hold on, baby!

25
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,824
Motherfucker.

26
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,128
- He's right behind us!
- Shit!

27
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,350
You and me
against the world.

28
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,448
It's you and me against
the world, baby!

29
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,706
<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

30
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,712
<i>If you're listening to this...</i>

31
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,013
<i>Look, man, I...</i>

32
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,746
<i>I know it's a tough time.</i>

33
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,190
<i>With Hannah's funeral over
with, I...</i>

34
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,384
<i>I'm gonna
come up later to talk.</i>

35
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,255
<i>Make sure you're doing okay.</i>

36
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,028
<i>All right. I'll see you then.</i>

37
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,374
You can't drop me!
I'm a bunny!

38
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,750
I'm a good bunny too!

39
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,653
I'm your best friend!

40
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,489
You just dropped me on the ground!

41
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,260
- Eric, be careful.
- Hold up!

42
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,826
I got this, I got it, I got it.
Oh, there we go now.

43
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,627
- I love you.
- I love you.

44
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,800
Eric, look out!

45
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,889
All right, go! Go, go, go!

46
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,330
I can't get the call through!

47
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,028
Damn it!

48
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,604
Hello? Is anybody in there?

49
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,335
Help! Hello!

50
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,551
- He's coming.
- Fuck!

51
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,748
Ah! Goddamn it!

52
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,420
Get the door!

53
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,693
Oh, shit!

54
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,264
Oh!

55
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,052
I'll kill you!

56
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,397
Ah!

57
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,326
Come on, big boy! Come on, big boy!

58
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,464
Come on, you wanna fucking dance? Huh?

59
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,234
No! No, no, no!

60
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,813
No! You let her go!

61
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,906
No, you let her go! You let her go, pig!

62
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,245
Don't you touch my baby.

63
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,851
Get down here, Mickey, it's over!

64
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,723
You all need to leave.

65
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,452
Please, mister, he got a knife.

66
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,996
He's got my girl. He got me in the arm...

67
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,629
Stupid ass.

68
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,726
That was nice.

69
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,361
You'd be doing me a favor.

70
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,133
Seriously?

71
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,409
You're an interesting fella.

72
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,642
We got ourselves an odd duck
in our pond, baby girl!

73
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,618
- Let him go!
- You move, big boy,

74
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,782
and he dies all over you.
Wet and red!

75
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,281
What are you people doing here?

76
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,361
Oh. Me and Violet,

77
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,092
we just a couple of lovebirds
looking for a nest.

78
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,861
Location, location, location.

79
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,638
Now, I'm gonna need you
to do me a straight solid.

80
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,607
Reach into my pocket, get the cell phone.

81
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,108
You watch that trigger, Mickey!

82
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,372
Shut up!

83
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,876
Come on, Mr. Quackers.
Get my cell phone.

84
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,442
- I told you, let him go!
- Who are you?

85
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,578
- I'm a cop. It's fine.
- Get my goddamn cell phone!

86
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,556
- Where is it?
- Front left pocket.

87
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,753
There you go. Oh! There you go.

88
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,456
Easy, boy.

89
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,727
Don't get any ideas. He's not your type.

90
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,598
You and me against the world, baby.

91
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,696
You and me against the world, baby!

92
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,106
- I love you.
- Just do it.

93
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,440
All right now.

94
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,571
Just push... push my last text.

95
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,912
Yeah. There you go.

96
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,078
Now, uh, send the location.

97
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,615
I use a home phone. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

98
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,956
The thing that looks like a paperclip!

99
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,759
A little round fucking paperclip.

100
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,094
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

101
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,964
The second you pull that trigger,

102
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,503
I'm putting this knife right
into your girlfriend's throat.

103
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,937
Okay.

104
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,533
Pass it back, Mr. Quackers.
Come on. Pass it back.

105
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,042
Pass it back!

106
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,283
Yeah, no, no. We don't want anybody to see
what we're gonna do to him.

107
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,318
It's nothing compared
to what we did to your partner.

108
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,682
- Mm!
- Fuck you!

109
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,312
Yeah.

110
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,446
Stop!

111
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,756
You let him walk down those stairs
and out the front door,

112
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,421
- and I'll follow with Violet.
- Don't listen to him!

113
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,828
Don't make me fucking hurt you!
All right?

114
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,163
Let him walk down the stairs, and when we
get to the door, we all release.

115
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,293
Why would I do that, big boy,

116
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,602
when we can just sit back
and chillax, huh?

117
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,869
You think they'll be here quick enough?

118
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,875
Quick enough? No.

119
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,414
They've been tracking us since we...
since we split the warehouse.

120
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,213
Friends and family plan, son.
Ooh, it's good for the kids.

121
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,311
Gave them the final destination.
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

122
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,689
Let him walk down the stairs,
and we'll finish this later.

123
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,724
Come on.

124
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,422
Just shoot him!

125
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,434
I'm not gonna let him hurt you, baby.

126
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,526
Walk down the stairs.

127
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,581
Yeah!

128
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,352
Move, ducky!

129
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,561
See you soon.

130
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,428
You okay?

131
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,777
- You get him?
- Not enough!

132
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,080
Oh, my God!

133
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,320
Find him! Where is he?

134
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,157
Come on, big boy!

135
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,131
Goddamn it!

136
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,897
Check his house for ammo.
I'm gonna check his car.

137
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,769
- What the fuck?
- Dude! Shut up!

138
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,108
They're gonna hear you, all right?

139
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,444
I need you to get to safety. Now.

140
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,211
Look, this is my farm.
They don't belong here.

141
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,483
Shit, you don't belong here.
Why would I be the one...

142
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,115
You need to get the hell out of here.

143
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,561
These people will kill you.

144
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,998
I think I did a pretty good job
taking care of myself back there.

145
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,125
Almost got us both killed.

146
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,765
Is there anybody else here?

147
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,142
Anybody else that might come here?
A wife, maybe kids?

148
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,445
Just me.

149
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,151
You really don't have a cell?

150
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,024
No need.

151
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,689
No one to call.

152
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,862
Who needs to be quiet now?

153
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,007
Comes in handy, don't it?

154
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,807
Listen.

155
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,509
Is there only one road on the farm?

156
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,381
No, I got a back road
down there through the brush.

157
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,011
Takes you to the main drag.

158
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,456
Good. I need you
to head through the brush,

159
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,220
and back to town.

160
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,954
Understand?

161
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,498
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I don't have time for this.

162
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,331
It seems to me
you might be able to use a little backup

163
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,336
until your police friends get here.

164
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,601
No one else is coming.
Not to help, at least.

165
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,201
You need to run.
This is my fight, not yours.

166
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,046
Run? This is my farm. Not yours.

167
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,586
You heard them mention my partner?

168
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,618
He was a cop for 30 years.

169
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,257
He knew what he was doing
when they killed him.

170
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,230
I'm sorry. I may not get
another chance like this.

171
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,995
Go to the road, and head to town. Now!

172
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,077
Sounds about right.

173
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,219
Yeah, he ain't
calling the cavalry anytime soon.

174
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,766
- Angel!
- Yeah?

175
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,167
- How do you load one of these things?
- I'll show you, sugar plum.

176
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,332
You... you just...
you get it on her back.

177
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,843
And then you just put it in.
Nice and easy.

178
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,108
Hold that. Ow!

179
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,614
Man, I...

180
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,744
Frank.

181
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,755
- Yeah, Frank?
- <i>Three minutes.</i>

182
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,291
Get ready.

183
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,619
You telling me what to do?

184
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,631
Uh, "yeah, get ready."

185
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,661
Well, if he thinks that he's gonna be
using this...

186
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,467
he better think again.

187
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,304
- Pew! Hal
- Looks good on you.

188
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,477
Get some practice shots!

189
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,343
Make them count, baby girl.

190
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,177
Bang!

191
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,823
Bang. Mickey, I think
I'm getting the hang of this thing!

192
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,457
Come on. Move!

193
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,692
Shit!

194
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,243
Leave my farm.

195
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,705
All right.

196
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,352
- Yo, boss, do you see that?
- Park here.

197
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,185
This is my farm.

198
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,917
Do you see something, sir?

199
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,593
Do you need me to flush out the area?
Because I...

200
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,203
Bang! Bang!

201
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,649
Bang!

202
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,683
Look, all's I'm saying is this.
It's the 21st century,

203
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,249
and y'all living under a monarchy
like it's the Middle Ages.

204
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,384
Excuse me, mate, we're very lucky
to have a monarch.

205
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,259
Closest you guys ever came
to a monarch is Elvis,

206
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,853
and you know what they said
about Elvis, right?

207
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,764
Okay, fish sticks, you hold
your horses right there.

208
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,164
Don't you blaspheme about the King.

209
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,964
Well, maybe you don't say
anything about the Queen.

210
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,066
- Fine. Deal.
- Deal?

211
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,770
Now, we're all gonna shut the fuck up.

212
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,073
You do realize that we have the guns?

213
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,443
- Yes.
- Okay.

214
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,916
Sir, we're wasting time.
It was probably a bird.

215
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,893
What? Oh, shit!

216
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,362
Goddamn, woman!

217
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,132
You make me hard with a gun
in your hand, girl.

218
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:49,901
He's down there, baby.
We're gonna get him!

219
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,137
Let's go get the bad man.

220
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,451
Cal, run!

221
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,392
It's no bird.

222
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,962
Get in there.

223
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,168
I don't mean to be a burr
under your saddle, boss,

224
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,040
but are we fixing to get out of here
any time soon...?

225
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,271
All of you.

226
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,780
Get in there.

227
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,046
Fuck, it's hot.

228
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,099
You good?

229
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,968
- You got this, baby.
- I got this.

230
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,803
What the fuck? Pussy. Come on, let's go.

231
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,342
Guns up, guys, come on!

232
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,329
- Where the hell is he?
- Oh, he's close.

233
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,543
- Frank.
- Frank.

234
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:37,775
Goddamn it.

235
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,739
All right. All right.

236
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,272
David?

237
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,377
Get the fuck off me!

238
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,323
You think I'm gonna run?

239
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,051
Put that fucking gun down!

240
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,395
Why are you wasting my time?

241
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,727
Just kill me.

242
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,734
I'm not gonna devolve myself
to such behavior.

243
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,499
You're my prisoner till my boss gets here.

244
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,403
Perhaps he will allow you the luxury.

245
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,675
I hear you two have quite a history.

246
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,903
Yes.

247
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,680
Take him in there. See to his wound.

248
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,478
We may need him ready
to move at any point.

249
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,279
Yes, sir. All right.

250
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,816
Tyson, Lisa.

251
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,449
Move these cars
and hide them somewhere.

252
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,617
We don't wanna show anybody

253
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,219
who might happen to stumble
upon this shithole that we're here.

254
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,923
- Would we?
- Got you, boss.

255
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,931
Copy.

256
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,573
How the fuck are we supposed
to see to his wound?

257
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,739
I'm not a doctor, Ed. I'm not a nurse.
I haven't got medical training, have 1?

258
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,680
You remind me more of a candy striper.

259
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,272
What the fuck's that mean?

260
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,512
Well, it's like a nurse
without medical training.

261
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,553
Why are you being such a hillbilly today?

262
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,851
I'm not a hillbilly. I'm a redneck.

263
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,288
What's the difference?

264
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,292
Generally speaking,
we don't sleep with our sisters.

265
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,955
- Busy searching the area, I see.
- Been there, done that.

266
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,126
Got the bloody t-shirt for it. I'm good.

267
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,363
- Mickey?
- Hm?

268
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,733
Tell me, where's the other cop?

269
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,399
- Oh, he's close. Mm-hmm.
- Close. With the farmer.

270
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,669
- Mm, maybe.
- Maybe.

271
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,675
Shut up.

272
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,308
- He might be with a farmer?
- Mm.

273
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,180
So what you're saying is
that a man is running around,

274
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,015
someone who might be with a cop,

275
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,145
but you have no idea. Either of you.

276
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,217
- Are they injured?
- Yeah.

277
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,194
No. They're not seriously injured.

278
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,664
- Are they armed?
- No. They're not armed.

279
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,462
- Mm-mm.
- Spoke to your brother, Mickey.

280
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,630
- He's on his way.
- Step-brother.

281
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,174
Step-brother.
Why is he on his way here?

282
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,135
He's curious as to how
this happened, as am I.

283
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,747
See? But you were there, Francis.

284
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,407
You saw the whole thing go down.

285
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,416
Remember?
Boom boom? Bang bang?

286
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,111
You were shooting at the guy.

287
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,547
That was you! It was him!

288
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,559
It... it was me.

289
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,688
And I know I wasn't followed
to the warehouse.

290
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,925
I know I wasn't followed here.

291
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:45,026
And I know I have the cop I was left with
under control.

292
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,605
- Hmm.
- So I'm gonna wait for an answer.

293
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,372
You both can tell me. Where's yours?

294
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,710
- We'll handle it.
- He's around here somewhere.

295
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:01,218
- Sneaky. Sneaky.
- Sneaky.

296
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,187
- You should get on it, then.
- I'll get on that.

297
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,353
Do you think he wears lifts?

298
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,454
He looks like he wears lifts.

299
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,124
Bye, buddy.

300
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,668
In there!

301
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:36,647
Pretty sure
they're gonna come in here.

302
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,518
Yeah, they will.

303
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,354
Please tell me you have more guns?

304
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,160
Uh, my wife isn't, uh...

305
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,132
wasn't a fan.

306
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,095
I'm sure we can make something work.

307
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,642
Go hide in the comer,
I'll take care of them if they come in.

308
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,336
- Go.
- Fuck that.

309
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,935
You go hide in the corner.

310
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,779
- What?
- You wanna die?

311
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,121
I've looked death in the face
more times than I can count.

312
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,522
At this point, we're old friends.

313
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,322
Never need an excuse
to see an old friend, now do 1?

314
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,405
- Where's your gun?
- I didn't bring one.

315
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,304
Oh, my God.

316
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,139
What the fuck were you thinking?

317
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,579
Can one of you guys
loan him one of your guns?

318
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,548
Fuck that, this is mine.

319
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,312
Okay, check the area
and make sure he didn't get away. Fuck.

320
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,049
- I'm fine.
- Just stay behind me.

321
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,151
Fuck! Come on!

322
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,274
Jesus!

323
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,047
Fuck!

324
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,353
Who the fuck was that other guy?

325
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,451
They killed Rob!

326
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,706
- Frank.
- What?

327
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,371
What are you doing?
Having a senior moment?

328
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,815
I have to know this place
because you can bet your ass he does.

329
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,449
Who?

330
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,114
The farmer, you morons.

331
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,991
You know, Frank,
I know you think you're in charge,

332
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:40,520
- but we're just as important.
- As what?

333
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,930
Do you both think
you're as integral as me?

334
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,332
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

335
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,667
We're gonna get one thing straight.

336
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,264
We are colleagues, not friends.

337
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:55,278
Coming here to help your sorry asses
was nothing more than a business decision.

338
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,074
And like you said...

339
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,082
the boss is only your stepbrother.

340
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,622
And don't you think for one second
that I am not fully aware

341
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:11,093
of just how frayed and fragile
that relationship truly is.

342
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,064
Rethink your importance, my friend.

343
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,725
Or I sure as well will.

344
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,727
Frank!

345
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,402
- Yes?
- It's Rob.

346
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,203
What about Rob?

347
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,773
He's dead.

348
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,553
He's a dick.

349
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,959
I'm gonna kill every one of those fuckers.

350
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,825
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me, all right?

351
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,920
They have my partner.

352
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,989
Who the fuck are these guys?

353
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,395
They're drug dealers. Scumbags.

354
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,597
My partner and I have been
chasing them for years.

355
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,166
Finally got close enough this morning.

356
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,109
I know what they're capable of.

357
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,806
I know what their product
does to normal people.

358
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,417
Went into that warehouse,
and, well, shit hit the fan.

359
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,387
Here we are.

360
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,457
Is there really nobody else here?

361
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,153
No, it's, uh...

362
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,125
Hannah... My wife.

363
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,459
<i>She and I used to run
the place together, and, uh...</i>

364
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,335
I did a tour in Iraq.

365
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,310
Grenade went off next to me,
and put me in a body cast for a year.

366
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:38,144
And, uh, I had a nurse.

367
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,451
She brought me back, you know.

368
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,453
She nursed me back to health,
took care of me.

369
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,886
She was my angel.

370
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,289
That was Hannah.

371
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,559
I remember, uh, I was laying in that bed

372
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,863
and, uh, I made a promise to God.

373
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,807
I said, uh,

374
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,241
"Man, if I ever get out of this cast,

375
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,335
I'm gonna marry that woman.

376
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,812
I'm never gonna kill again."

377
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,817
I mean, before that,
I was a shell of the man I used to be.

378
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,185
I was a fucking disaster,

379
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,189
and, uh...

380
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,226
And then she came into my life.

381
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,793
She filled me up.

382
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,902
She made me feel alive.

383
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,835
<i>Gave me a daughter.</i>

384
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,780
She died two weeks ago.

385
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,183
Eric, look out!

386
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,424
My daughter too.

387
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,961
And I just quit, you know.

388
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,799
On life, on, uh... On everything.

389
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,242
I mean, what's the fucking point, right?

390
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,036
Hence, the, uh...

391
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,281
I'm sorry, man.

392
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,384
I really am.

393
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,122
I gotta finish this.

394
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,095
You have a house phone?

395
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,229
In the kitchen.

396
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,238
Good.

397
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,773
I'm gonna go to the house,

398
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,244
get to the phone and get David, all right?

399
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,609
I'm going with you.

400
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,249
I'm finishing this alone.

401
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:59,017
I've been in this situation enough times
to know that you need my help.

402
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,650
Even if you're too damn
stubborn to know it.

403
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,299
And that's the house
that I shared with my wife.

404
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,362
It's my house.

405
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,940
And it's all I've got left.

406
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,335
And fuck, I ain't got
nothing to live for anyway.

407
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,445
All right.

408
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,504
Well, this is certainly a development.

409
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,807
A development? That's Rob.

410
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,178
No, it was Rob.

411
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,842
It would still be if any of you knew

412
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,648
how to handle your jobs
for a good goddamn minute.

413
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,714
Frank, we didn't know we'd die doing this.

414
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,350
We came here to kill.

415
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,059
Or did any of you not
get the memo on that?

416
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,222
Because evidently, this cop did.

417
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,960
We're wasting fucking time, man.

418
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,060
No, we're wasting fucking friends, Mickey.

419
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,332
Oh, you're killing me, Smalls.

420
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,807
- Mickey.
- Yeah?

421
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,207
For once, I agree.

422
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,077
Lisa...

423
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,345
come here.

424
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,081
I can't, Frank.

425
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,158
Lisa, if you would...

426
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,028
Now.

427
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,278
Sorry for the mess.

428
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,049
Do you fancy leaving here
with Liam and the gang, Lisa?

429
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,714
No. I want him dead.

430
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,917
You want him dead.

431
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,482
Yes.

432
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,494
Of course you do.

433
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,022
Well, then it's settled.

434
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,034
We kill or be killed. Is that clear?

435
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,467
Boo-yah!

436
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,633
Get your asses out of here.

437
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,613
Let's move.

438
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,151
On your six.

439
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,413
I want nobody
going off on their own.

440
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,888
We'll stay together
with somebody at all times.

441
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,288
Liam, that's you and me...

442
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,724
Go to the phone, call for backup. Go.

443
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,286
...that way. He's up there! Get him!

444
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,957
Fuck, get him!

445
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,836
Shouldn't we be going after him?

446
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,098
Listen to me. Get him back.

447
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,935
I don't give a shit what you
have to do with the farmer.

448
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,135
Both of those cops need to be
in that house when Michael arrives.

449
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,837
- You mean the cop you shot.
- Yes.

450
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,504
The one we now have in custody.

451
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:13,311
The one that you went after is now giving
us chase around the fucking farm.

452
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,149
They followed you here, Mickey.
Don't you ever forget that.

453
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,984
So what are you gonna be doing?

454
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,386
Finding out what the other one knows.

455
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,323
The more people get killed,
the more all of us look bad.

456
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,988
Oh, one more thing, Mickey.

457
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,027
Your stepbrother is not someone
any of us wanna look bad to.

458
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,362
Got it?

459
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,775
Are you sure you tied him up good?

460
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,441
- Yes, Ed, I'm sure.
- I'm sorry.

461
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,950
You don't remember that jockey in Fresno

462
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,282
that weaseled out of them ropes you tied,
goes running down the street?

463
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,551
That was partially my fault.
That was partially your fault.

464
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,491
- All right, fair.
- You two suck.

465
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,659
- Officer.
- It's Detective.

466
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,499
You two don't seem
to be having much fun here.

467
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,768
They suck.

468
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,502
Thank you.

469
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,045
Ah, yes, of course.

470
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,050
Detective Watson.

471
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,883
So nice to finally make
your acquaintance, indeed.

472
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,286
I've been told a lot about you before.

473
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,657
Ed...

474
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,822
Move the cop's and Violet's cars.

475
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,625
We don't want anything
looking out of place, do we?

476
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,291
Yes, sir.

477
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,002
And do it quietly, Ed.

478
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,595
They'll hear the gunshots.

479
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,801
You mean the gunshots on a private farm
in the middle of nowhere?

480
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,940
I think there is a certain word for that.

481
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,344
Right, Detective?

482
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,079
"Legal."

483
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,814
Now, my boss is on his way.

484
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,757
So rather than all this bullshit,
let's see what he has to say. Shall we?

485
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,134
- Michael, hello.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

486
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,434
I'm sitting here with our good friend,
David Watson.

487
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,137
<i>Watson. Put me on loudspeaker.</i>

488
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,206
Well, hello. Is that you, Detective?

489
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,215
It's been a while.

490
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,048
<i>I see you've taken over for Daddy.</i>

491
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,680
Oh, yeah, and what
a glorious day to do it.

492
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,693
<i>Oh, my God!
I missed you, buddy.</i>

493
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:15,288
I can't wait to see your face
in this helpless position.

494
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:19,461
After all these years
terrorizing my family,

495
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,834
chasing us and chasing us.

496
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,341
<i>And here you are. Oops!</i>

497
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,003
<i>You belong to me now, cupcake.</i>

498
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,609
- Crazy old world.
- <i>Indeed.</i>

499
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,119
Hey, I'll make sure Frank
takes good care of you until I arrive.

500
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,881
<i>We'll hang out, we'll chitchat.</i>

501
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,285
<i>Prepare yourself,</i>

502
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,350
because I'm gonna pick your brain.

503
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,884
Bite me!

504
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,529
Well, this sure as shit isn't
how I figured life would work out.

505
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,055
Damn it, I gotta be dumber
than a bag of hammers.

506
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,568
Mama wanted me to go to law school,
but no, I just had to do this, didn't I?

507
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,697
I don't know what the hell this is.
Here I am, moving cars.

508
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,208
Obviously, I'm a valet.
I'll give myself some tips.

509
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,244
Talking to myself...

510
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,675
get myself some therapy while I'm at.

511
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,942
Come on now, Ed,
get your head in the game, boy.

512
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:41,541
What a fucking idiot.

513
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,177
Shit.

514
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,448
Fuck!

515
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,081
"Ed, go shoot this guy!
Then go bury his body."

516
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,119
Hold on, Michael.

517
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,071
Damn it. God!

518
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,973
Stupid car.

519
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,107
What the hell are you doing?

520
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,170
Oh, hey, Frank.

521
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,806
Uh, well, let's see.

522
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,975
First, the car is a piece of shit.

523
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,610
And second, thank you.

524
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,678
I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm good.

525
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,680
Just shut up, Ed!

526
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:28,965
- Only the best for your team.
- Michael. What was that?

527
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:32,366
I don't care how much
you have to hurt the asshole.

528
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,803
Just make him talk.

529
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,068
All right. Copy.

530
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,607
English, hurt him...

531
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,444
while I get my tools, please?

532
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,315
Well...

533
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,448
Now, let's try this again, shall we?

534
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,621
Shit! Owl Damn it.

535
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,495
You know, I'm done!
I'm done with this bullshit!

536
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,294
This is ridiculous!

537
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,531
I'm a grown-ass man
crawling over damn cars.

538
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,230
Shit! I could've been a lawyer.

539
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,412
- Mickey.
- Violet?

540
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,816
That law dog.

541
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:25,321
He ain't gunning for justice.
He's gunning for blood.

542
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,654
It ain't our first rodeo, baby.

543
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,591
Yeah.

544
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,560
Tell that to your bullet holes.

545
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,824
Yeah, he took his pound of flesh.

546
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,832
I'm still raring to cha-cha.

547
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,632
Come on, let's go put some silver
on his eyes and send him downriver.

548
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,072
You and me forever, baby.
Against the world.

549
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,166
You and me against the world.

550
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,678
Hey, hey.

551
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,741
Where's Tyson?

552
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,016
Tyson, where you at, man?

553
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,915
Get up here, all of you.

554
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,884
Wait, there's something over there.

555
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,055
Everyone stop. Stop.

556
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,526
Paul, Lisa, get up here.

557
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,257
I want you two to look up there.

558
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,028
Split up. You go left, Lisa. You go right.

559
00:53:59,102 --> 00:53:59,933
Copy.

560
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,027
Don't waste time. Get up there. Now.

561
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,237
- Liam.
- Yeah?

562
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,538
You remember that turn back there
that goes to the right?

563
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,170
- Yes.
- We're gonna double back,

564
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,010
you're gonna go to the left,
I'm gonna go to the right.

565
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,571
- You ready? Now.
- Copy that.

566
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:13,843
Now. Go.

567
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,125
Ed, English.
Hit him in the stomach.

568
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,431
His face is mine.

569
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,315
I really have to hand it to you,
Detective.

570
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,915
You are one tough son of a bitch,
I must say.

571
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,324
Mind that. Mind the wrinkles, please.

572
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,759
- Couch.
- Sure.

573
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,764
And pushing retirement, I imagine.

574
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:06,598
What the hell are you doing, getting
yourself into situations like that?

575
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,005
I'm not old. But my partner
is a little young.

576
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,099
Ah. Where fools rush in.

577
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,313
I certainly know a few people
like that myself.

578
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,214
I'm more of the, um...

579
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,014
How would you call it?

580
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,986
The calculating one.

581
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,825
What about Violet and Mickey?

582
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,830
Don't worry about that, Detective.

583
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,334
Yes, those two imbeciles
are quite foolish.

584
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,630
I expect you and I
aren't so different, however.

585
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,506
Similar levels
and not so dissimilar organizations.

586
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,102
I'm nothing like you. Nothing!

587
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,842
I'm just doing my job, Detective.

588
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:57,318
The passionate ones are out there,
running around, waving guns at each other.

589
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,822
It's... unbecoming.

590
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,066
You think you're like me?

591
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,402
You think you're better than me?

592
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,040
You need guys like me.

593
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,742
And I suppose...

594
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,342
in some ways...

595
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,282
I need guys like you.

596
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,700
Crime pays for us both, Detective.

597
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,035
You see,

598
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:56,103
we are a dying breed.

599
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,408
Unfortunately for you...

600
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,349
Ah...

601
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,745
...sooner rather than later, I'm afraid.

602
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,192
Hey, asshole.

603
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,934
Who are these two idiots?

604
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,507
I got shot today.

605
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,607
And I'm tied up.

606
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,973
And you still hit like a bitch.

607
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,622
Do you think that I'm that stupid
to sit here with you alone?

608
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,096
I just think you're a coward.

609
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,130
You know, not many know this.

610
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,461
But I am an artist.

611
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:00,236
And I'm going to make you
my finest work.

612
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,005
Yeah.

613
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,274
The screams alone
will bring your partner to me.

614
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,443
- You think he's that stupid?
- Shall we begin?

615
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,287
Shit.

616
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,488
Hey, jackass.

617
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,655
Don't walk away from me.

618
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:22,788
Watch him.

619
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,663
Does this mean we're not
fucking up his face?

620
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,570
Put the phone down.

621
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,667
You're in my house.

622
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,339
- <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Ed?

623
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,017
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

624
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,714
Put your hands up, boss,
real slow. Come on, now.

625
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,525
Andrew.

626
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,296
Get rid of him.

627
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,676
Goddamn it.

628
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,026
You got company?

629
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,870
Get rid of him.

630
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:02,511
Uh... neighbor's car.

631
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:05,486
Letting him park here overnight.

632
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,852
How you been?

633
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,716
I'm busy.

634
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:10,816
Right.

635
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,323
Uh... you know, Andrew, it's, uh...

636
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,731
it's really not a good time right now.

637
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,830
Yeah, lately it never is.

638
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,501
You get my message?

639
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,577
What do you say I, uh, come up here
for a little while,

640
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,880
help you finish fixing the place up?

641
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,648
Might do you some good.

642
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,247
I won't even charge you.

643
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:45,992
Hey, hey, hey!

644
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,291
Knock it off.

645
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,389
Andrew, I can't have this today.

646
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,562
Okay? It's not the time.
I need you to leave.

647
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,109
Look, I know how you feel.

648
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,745
Really, I do.

649
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:15,086
You have no idea how I feel.

650
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:20,624
I'm just saying that being here alone
all the time ain't good for you.

651
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,556
You still got friends who care about you.

652
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,442
I'm gonna be the guy
that's gonna kill you.

653
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,114
Yeah, I wanna be
that guy right now, Andrew.

654
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:52,792
But I need you to get
the fuck off my land.

655
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,193
You hear me?

656
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,627
Go.

657
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,670
Andrew, just go. Please.

658
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,805
Not today.

659
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,139
All right.

660
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,117
Try it again next week.

661
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,104
Wait!

662
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,247
- What the hell?
- Run. Run! Run!

663
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,384
Sorry. Wrong place, wrong time.

664
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:55,923
Shit!

665
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,689
Andrew!

666
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,192
Shit.

667
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:04,965
Ed!

668
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,373
Hey, hey!

669
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,626
Shit!

670
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,754
Son of a bitch!

671
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,066
Hey! Let it go! Let it go! Let go!

672
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:42,468
- Put it down.
- I'm gonna shoot you.

673
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,834
- Put it on the floor.
- No.

674
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,738
And I'll let you go.

675
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:48,470
Jesus Christ, what the hell's going on?

676
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,807
Get off!

677
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,179
Christ!

678
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,250
You think you're gonna get away? Huh?

679
01:05:58,654 --> 01:05:59,951
Maybe not.

680
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,288
But he might.

681
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,487
You keep your eyes on him.

682
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,688
Step aside, Lisa. I got this.

683
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,494
- He's over there.
- I see him.

684
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,397
I think I got him!

685
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,845
You stupid fucking idiot.
What the hell's the matter with you?

686
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,973
Frank, we discussed this, all right? It's
hurtful when you talk to me like that.

687
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,175
I tried my best. Hell...

688
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,218
Where is your head?

689
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:06,345
- Where is your head?!
- Okay, you need to take a yoga class.

690
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,981
I don't need to do a fucking thing!

691
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,491
You're gonna listen to me.
Get in that car.

692
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,686
Get your ass in that fucking...
Get in the car!

693
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,889
- Get in the car and shut your mouth!
- Decaf.

694
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,021
- Shut... you... what?
- I'm just saying.

695
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,896
- What? Shut up!
- Sleep better.

696
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,574
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

697
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:39,916
Piggy, piggy.

698
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,780
We've got you now, pig!

699
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,480
What are you gonna do now, cop?

700
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,609
Can't let you guys go!

701
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,948
Let us go?

702
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:15,581
Three of us, one of you!
What do you mean by "let us go"?

703
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:19,458
Second one of you guys misses,
the other one dies. I promise you that!

704
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,621
- Fuck you!
- No, baby!

705
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,566
Got you now, you bastard!

706
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,804
Hey...

707
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,945
You and me... you and me.

708
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:46,715
- Hey...
- You and me against the world, baby.

709
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:49,988
Baby?

710
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,586
Baby!

711
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,093
Baby?

712
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,090
Baby?

713
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,099
I got you now!

714
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:12,538
Stop!

715
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:38,597
Frank?

716
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,592
Get in!

717
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,203
Go, man, go!

718
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,051
- Thanks for saving my ass.
- No problem.

719
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,986
That was some driving back there.

720
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,320
- I used to drive a Jeep.
- Yeah, where's that?

721
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,484
- I don't have it anymore.
- Let's go save David.

722
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,434
Drivel

723
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:22,936
Where's Mickey?

724
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,406
Don't.

725
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,388
Right, he's going for the house.

726
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,894
What about the other cop?

727
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,223
Shit!

728
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,277
Damn, they're right on us.

729
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,290
Jesus Christ! Try and shoot him!

730
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,037
Come on! Ah!

731
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:22,864
Ah! Come on! Goddamn it!

732
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,839
Fuck! Come on!

733
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,304
Seatbelt!

734
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,271
Come on!

735
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,677
All right, get ready.

736
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,157
I got it, I got it! I got it!

737
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,994
What the fuck was that?

738
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,138
Sounds like a crash.

739
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,477
- You shut up.
- Calm down.

740
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,242
Shut up.

741
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,843
I think somebody should help.

742
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,948
No, I'm not leaving you here on your own!

743
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,255
You can carry me.

744
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,427
No, I'm not gonna fucking carry you!

745
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,863
We're just gonna stay here,
and Frank, or Ed,

746
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,491
or someone's gonna be back in a minute
and tell us what to do!

747
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,335
Frank? Somebody talk to me!

748
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:12,635
You know what? Fuck you.

749
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,315
Eric. Eric, wake up.

750
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,582
<i>Wake up.</i>

751
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,195
This is for Mickey!

752
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,131
Hey. Snap out of it.

753
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,248
<i>It's not your time.</i>

754
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,120
<i>I love you.</i>

755
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,778
I'm in charge, okay? I'll say... I put
my foot down! I'm saying what's happening!

756
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,418
What you're gonna do is put that gun down.

757
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:12,983
Oh, yeah?

758
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,460
Why don't you come make me put it down?

759
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,928
Hm?

760
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,868
I'm gonna have to kill you.

761
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,769
Stop saying that. Stop saying that. Hey.

762
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,173
Hey, no. No.

763
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,940
I was joking. So sit your...
sit your ass down on the chair.

764
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,977
Come on, now, come on.

765
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,110
We've done this. We've done this.

766
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,614
Just give me the gun.

767
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,119
Now, listen. Until Frank gets back,
I'm in charge.

768
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,888
That's the deal, okay?

769
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,829
So you park your ass on that chair
and then we're all gonna be mates.

770
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,663
- You wanna sit down?
- I do wanna sit down. Yeah.

771
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,203
Have a cup of tea?

772
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,829
Just give me the pacifier.

773
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,641
I'm only sitting down if you sit down.

774
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,142
I'll be happy to sit down.

775
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,888
I'm just gonna...
I'm probably just gonna...

776
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,657
like a squat, sort of...

777
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,291
So that I'm ready, you know, for anything.

778
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,495
Like a... like a panther.

779
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,877
Let's go, man. Come on.

780
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,496
Frank, I could really do
with some help in here!

781
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:01,898
You see this chair right here?

782
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,565
- You see this chair?
- Yeah?

783
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,540
- All right.
- Hey, hey.

784
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,643
I want you to get the fuck out of here!

785
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,246
- And put that gun down.
- Put the chair down.

786
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,156
Sit the fuck down!

787
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,996
Sit down!

788
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,948
Fucking... Get off me!

789
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,158
I got a charity to be at.
Let's make this quick.

790
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,911
The fuck!

791
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:34,857
I told you I was gonna kill you.

792
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,355
Just do it, you fucking cunt!

793
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,980
You're under arrest.

794
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,357
I'm not too sure about that.

795
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,833
Well, well, well.

796
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:18,566
Isn't it nice to see
the likes of you again?

797
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:19,765
You're looking nice and dapper.

798
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,837
All right.

799
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:27,777
I'm in a hurry.

800
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,784
So if you want this to go smooth,

801
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,718
please enlighten me.

802
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,380
Where are the other two?

803
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,938
You hurt?

804
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:07,316
Oh, no. I'm just peachy.

805
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,230
I gotta go.

806
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,787
I gotta save David.

807
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,561
I know.

808
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,636
I got your back.

809
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,399
You're not going alone.

810
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,076
Let's go get David.

811
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,582
Let's go save him.

812
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,616
No man left behind.

813
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,617
You left me in the car back there.

814
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,761
- You might need this.
- Oh! Yep.

815
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:54,961
Ah!

816
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,934
Well, I've gotta say,

817
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:05,975
I didn't expect a shit show
quite like this.

818
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,610
I thought we could contain it, Michael.

819
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:14,019
You thought? But evidently
you don't think nearly enough.

820
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,518
Where's Mickey?

821
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,355
That other fucking cop killed him.

822
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,021
He shot him dead.

823
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,025
Calm yourself.

824
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,727
But he was your brother.

825
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,996
He was my stepbrother. Distant.

826
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:34,974
And I'm sure he made that
abundantly clear to you.

827
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,806
Nonetheless,
it's a terrible thing.

828
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,474
Someone needs
to be severely punished.

829
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:47,584
It's a miracle
we aren't inundated with cops.

830
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,851
You sloppy fucks!

831
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:57,832
Get the fuck off me!

832
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,612
I'm sorry.

833
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:23,582
You work for this guy?

834
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,560
You trust him?

835
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,493
This guy?

836
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,429
Turn on him!

837
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,227
I'll protect you.

838
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,905
Oh, good one.

839
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,856
And you, Frank. My goodness.

840
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,553
All these years.

841
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:05,595
I counted on you. I trusted you.
I gave you a chance.

842
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:11,034
And this is
what I walk into today.

843
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,403
Really?

844
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:15,774
These guys made you
look like a fucking joke.

845
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:18,869
I said I was sorry, Michael.

846
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,142
Excuse me?

847
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:27,654
You might not live to give another apology
in your fucking life!

848
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:32,487
Do what you're told, take my orders,

849
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,029
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

850
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,929
- Understand?
- Yes.

851
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,627
Do I need to ask you
to fucking bark for me?

852
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,170
Run, Cal, you idiot!

853
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:59,715
Well,
that didn't take very long.

854
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,313
This ends... now.

855
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,026
No.

856
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,487
Leave the kid.

857
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:14,793
Take me!

858
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:20,136
What would my mother say

859
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:24,338
if I didn't at least try
to avenge my stepbrother?

860
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,641
Hmm?

861
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,454
This is my farm, bitches.

862
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:35,622
Cal!

863
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:49,202
Shit!

864
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,679
Kill them! After them!

865
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,547
I've got personal business with him!

866
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,523
Get up. Lisa, Frank, to the right! Move!

867
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,691
Thomas, get your ass to the left, go!

868
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:25,330
- Holy shit, that worked.
- Nice shot.

869
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,272
- Upstairs.
- Let's go. Yeah.

870
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,200
Oh, shit!

871
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,144
So much for no killing.

872
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,159
Oh, David.

873
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,000
Don't be afraid.

874
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,339
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

875
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,476
You rock that pathetic,
shiny, little badge?

876
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,914
False righteousness.

877
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,248
You know nothing of real honor.

878
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,790
What you did to my family...

879
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,623
Hoo-hoo-hoo...

880
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,662
You're in my custody now.

881
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,128
Hey, Michael.

882
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,099
Keep those bullets, buddy.

883
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:31,799
Well, guess what? This last one
has your name on it.

884
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,629
You know I'll be out in a week.

885
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,326
Say good night.

886
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,011
Shit.

887
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,223
Hey.

888
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,063
Drop it!

889
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,634
Run, you idiot!

890
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,440
Go. Go, go, go!

891
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,920
Fucking piece of shit!

892
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,397
Ah!

893
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,183
You ready to see your wife?

894
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:41,627
She'd rather wait.

895
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
Ah!

896
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,237
You okay?

897
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:06,815
I'm gonna take the stairs.

898
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:19,365
There you are! Shit.

899
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,267
Looks like you're out.

900
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,840
Not today, sweetheart. Come here.

901
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:45,819
Oh! Oh, well...

902
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,225
looks like I might
have to do another remodel.

903
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,728
Yeah. Sorry about that.

904
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:57,326
Eh, it's okay.

905
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,567
I didn't really care
for that wallpaper anyway.

906
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,008
Thanks for the help.

907
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,404
Name's Eric, by the way.

908
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:09,609
- Nice to meet you.
- Cal.

909
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:12,516
- Stop talking. I didn't do anything.
- Shut up.

910
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,681
Tell it to the judge.

911
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,291
I'm calling my lawyer.

912
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:25,429
- What are you doing?
- Hell of a day, isn't it, partner?

913
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:29,802
You got insurance?

914
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,908
Because your house is shot to shit.

915
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:37,268
Yeah.

916
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,013
- I got shot today.
- So did I.

917
01:33:59,189 --> 01:34:04,189
