"Enchanter, Mobile."

9
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:48,367
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake 'em up!

10
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,711
It's the Navy!

11
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,673
Quick, put out the flag!

12
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:14,851
Enchanter!

13
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:18,063
This is the United States
Coast Guard.

14
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,650
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

15
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:39,501
Enchanter, you are a US-flag ship,
and we are going to board you.

16
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,129
Heave to now.

17
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:56,810
Muster your crew on the bow.

18
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,661
You two, go forward.

19
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,332
Randall, come with me.

20
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,090
- Stay where you are.
- Kneel down.

21
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,555
Captain. Captain?

22
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,350
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

23
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:42,230
It's a bad one. I think you'd better
send over the video camera.

24
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,792
Jack, come on in.

25
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:07,923
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

26
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,467
- Now it's this high.
- What have you got?

27
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:15,639
You heard about that business in the
South Caribbean? I need the details.

28
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:19,518
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

29
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:23,230
- OK.
- Jack? Be discreet.

30
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:28,819
- What do you mean?
- You'll find out.

31
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,656
Mysterious...

32
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,119
I love a mystery.

33
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,710
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

34
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,506
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:53,010
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

36
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,014
- Where do I park?
- Right over there.

37
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,819
Main passageway, going forward.

38
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,697
Master stateroom,
blood on the deck...

39
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:17,659
19 cartridges were recovered,

40
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:23,373
as well as the two weapons
that fired them.

41
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,339
Blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin

42
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:34,468
and his wife
and his son and daughter.

43
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:38,555
I got blood on the sheets and pillow

44
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,224
on both starboard and portside racks.

45
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,393
There's blood there, too.

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,231
They were killed in their staterooms
apparently as they slept.

47
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:51,360
Dragged topside
and thrown overboard.

48
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:57,407
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

49
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:01,286
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

50
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:07,459
Half a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

51
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,045
Drugs.

52
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:15,467
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

53
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:19,137
- You alright, James?
...according to DEA.

54
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,015
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

55
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:25,727
Straight piracy and murder.
It's not the first time.

56
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:31,024
It's the first time
it was a friend of mine.

57
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,736
Yes, sir.

58
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,496
- What was that? You alright?
- Yeah.

59
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:47,457
I haven't slept in 36 hours.
Did I make any sense?

60
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:50,377
What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

61
00:07:54,673 --> 00:08:00,012
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as I see it is myjob.

62
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:03,140
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

63
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,771
Shut the door.

64
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:18,113
I promised the American people I'd
do something about the drug problem.

65
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,407
You are.

66
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:24,578
You support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

67
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:30,375
And accomplish nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

68
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:36,465
That they can keep doing this kind of
thing, and there's no response ever?

69
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:41,386
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

70
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:47,434
The course of action I'd suggest is
a course of action I can't suggest.

71
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:05,535
I'm... not sure
where that leaves us.

72
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:13,251
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger

73
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:17,255
to the national security
of the United States.

74
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,891
Do you know what you've done?

75
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,893
I killed a thief,

76
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,396
a thief who was stealing...

77
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,358
...from me!

78
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:22,529
And his wife, and his son,
and his daughter,

79
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,240
apparently with no thought
of the consequences.

80
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:33,623
Should I let his children avenge their
father's death when I least expect it?

81
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:36,126
He was a good friend

82
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:39,880
and a political ally
of the President of the United States.

83
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,807
That doesn't surprise me.

84
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:55,062
- It should concern you.
- What can they do?

85
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:58,482
Come after me? Arrest me?

86
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:01,026
You're scaring me.

87
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:07,240
Will you stop long enough for me
to tell you something important?

88
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:11,703
Thank you.

89
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:20,921
Listen. You pay me to counsel you,
and I am counselling you.

90
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,841
I'm keeping you alive
with information.

91
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:27,386
If you disregard my counsel

92
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:30,931
and keep running your business
the way you have been,

93
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:35,769
with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

94
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:39,564
I'll quit, and you'll get killed.

95
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:54,830
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

96
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:59,251
- No, I didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

97
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,629
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

98
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:08,427
- I always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what I pay.

99
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:11,722
This one will cost you nothing.

100
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,225
Awoman.

101
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:18,020
You're using a woman.

102
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,029
It won't float.

103
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,825
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

104
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:35,537
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

105
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,582
Either on the front hall table
or in your pocket.

106
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:41,543
- Where aremykeys?
- Pancakes!

107
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,046
- Toast, please.
- Thank you.

108
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:45,380
Bye, Dad.

109
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:48,675
- Bye, pal.
- It won't float!

110
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:53,096
It's not supposed to float, it's
a submarine. It goes under water.

111
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:54,931
Jack.

112
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,394
Hello?

113
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,856
When?

114
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,736
I thought I had the flu.

115
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:11,907
I'd still think so if they weren't
telling me otherwise.

116
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,328
What are they telling you?

117
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:23,335
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if I heard them right.

118
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,713
Well, what does it mean?

119
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,550
I guess it means I'm in big trouble.

120
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:35,347
- I mean, can they operate, or?
- Maybe.

121
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:40,936
That's what they said, "maybe", which
sounds suspiciously like "no" to me.

122
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,814
There's one of them now.

123
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,236
I'm not dead yet.

124
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:55,325
I am in a hospital, which means
that I'm not in my office,

125
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,869
which means
I don't know what's going on.

126
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:01,039
- I need you there.
- Where?

127
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:05,043
- In my office, doing my job.
- Wait a minute...

128
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,547
I hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

129
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,717
I wouldn't know
how to do your job, sir.

130
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:16,179
You've been around.
You've been to the White House.

131
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:20,183
- Once. I hated it.
- No, you didn't.

132
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:25,313
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words.

133
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,316
"Watch your back, Jack."

134
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:38,660
Bobby, you should be the first
to know, or the third or fourth.

135
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:42,331
Ryan is to be
Acting Deputy Director, Intelligence.

136
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:47,836
It will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

137
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,631
Get him up to speed
on our aid programme to Colombia.

138
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:56,595
He must talk the Oversight Committee
out of another $75 million.

139
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,349
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

140
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,394
What about the Hardin murders?

141
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,315
I'm on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

142
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:13,528
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

143
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,907
That's great.

144
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:36,093
Margaret, why don't we
leave all his things?

145
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,844
OK, yeah.

146
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,360
Ryan. I can't believe itl

147
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:57,197
He's not a team player,
is thatwhat you're saying?

148
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,408
He's a Boy Scout.

149
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:05,831
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

150
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,083
So leave him out of it.

151
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,295
He's the Deputy Director of
Intelligence. That will be tricky.

152
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:14,923
What does he need to know?

153
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:21,513
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

154
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,516
I want a copy
of the President's authorisation

155
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,602
of this new action
against the cartels.

156
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:32,149
- You want what?
- You heard me.

157
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,277
He doesn't know about it.

158
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:43,410
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal, not mine.

159
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:48,665
Unless I have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

160
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:53,920
I'm not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

161
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:38,006
"Reciprocity."
That's a clever name for it.

162
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:42,636
Revenge is a very, very, very
dangerous motivation.

163
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:50,394
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? I'm looking for a yes or no.

164
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,480
You're looking for a political mess.

165
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,483
- Yes or no?
- Is that what they want?

166
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,196
They want what every first-term
administration wants. A second term.

167
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,909
I don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

168
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,667
Have they?

169
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,380
Is that a "no"?

170
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,345
Shit.

171
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:31,393
I want the money in my account
before I move an inch.

172
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,103
You got it.

173
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,522
- I need a Comsat link.
- You got it.

174
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:39,026
- An insertion team.
- You can have a brigade.

175
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,487
Just 12 men who understand
discretionary warfare.

176
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,824
Special Ops. Spanish speaking.

177
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,209
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

178
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,463
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

179
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:02,549
- What business are you in?
- I sell tractors.

180
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,927
Well, I build them, then I sell them.

181
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:10,098
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

182
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,713
I know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

183
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,176
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

184
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,638
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

185
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:53,016
- What is her name?
- I'm trying to have lunch.

186
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:57,688
Listen... Hungry?

187
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,733
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

188
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,364
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do I remember? Do you?

189
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:12,494
- Vaguely.
- Maybe I should refresh your memory.

190
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,874
- Maybe you should.
- Yourtable is ready now.

191
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,086
- We don't need it. I'll get a cab.
- Moira?

192
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:26,758
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

193
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,928
- You still with the FBI?
- The Director's office.

194
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,597
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

195
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,684
Seסor Roberto Landa.

196
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,896
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? I can't quite see.

197
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,818
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This I have to see.

198
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,196
I have to go. Bye.

199
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,703
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

200
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,666
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning afterthe killings.

201
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,501
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

202
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,130
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, Bureau.

203
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,175
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

204
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:12,721
- Yeah. "We're innocent."
- Till the DA offers them a deal.

205
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:16,308
He already has.
Regular or extra crispy?

206
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,062
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

207
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,773
Are you picturing a hit?

208
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:27,069
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

209
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,073
You're assuming he's respectable.

210
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,212
We have memos, letters,
credit card statements,

211
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:50,801
phone bills, everything
you could need to break his code.

212
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:54,012
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

213
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,058
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

214
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:03,105
- I don't know.
- OK, let's see what we've got.

215
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,358
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

216
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,320
Let's startwith birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

217
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,156
- Close.
- In reverse?

218
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,911
Alright, his birthday is...

219
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:24,292
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Let's try it in reverse.

220
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,212
No. His wife's?

221
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,048
No. His son's?

222
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,551
- This could take...
- Months.

223
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,678
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

224
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,100
No. Wife's in reverse.

225
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:42,477
No. Daughter's in reverse.

226
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,689
You've got to change your ATM code.

227
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,861
No. Wife, daughter. Nothing.

228
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:54,698
Got it.

229
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,908
I got it!

230
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:11,298
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

231
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:14,217
But not in reverse. Sorry.

232
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,686
Print me out that one.

233
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:26,772
Good boy.

234
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,943
Three years ago, Hardin received
an infusion of foreign capital

235
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,032
which he invested in 20 major
shopping centres in the US.

236
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:41,828
In the middle of the recession,
he posted record profits,

237
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:46,500
at least to the IRS, who he feared
more than his own partners.

238
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,962
To them, according to the stockholder
statements he was giving them,

239
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,299
the shopping centres
weren't doing nearly as well.

240
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,804
But he wasjust skimming
most of the profits, $650 million,

241
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,474
and putting it in accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama

242
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,726
and the Cayman Islands.

243
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,230
They killed him for it.

244
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,315
Who?

245
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,694
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

246
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:20,242
It seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

247
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:26,248
Jesus! I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

248
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,668
We almostwent
into business together.

249
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,462
That would have been good.

250
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:37,050
The press is going to
have a field day with this.

251
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:41,847
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

252
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:45,892
It will come up, you're right
about that. When it does,

253
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:51,565
we'll downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

254
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,902
- What?
- What?

255
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,781
- We'll defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

256
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,450
No.

257
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:06,413
Well, actually, yes. I would go
in the other direction.

258
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,960
If a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, I'd say "good friends".

259
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,840
If they asked if you were good
friends, I'd say"lifelong friends".

260
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:22,721
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

261
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:29,728
I mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

262
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,565
...it's already gone off.

263
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,632
- Damn!
- Shit!

264
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,052
Do you see him?

265
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,099
Alright. Move your team
two metres to the left.

266
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,271
That's it. Stop.

267
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:18,026
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

268
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,737
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

269
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:24,199
- Damn!
- He is good.

270
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,094
Thatwas close.
How's he moving so fast?

271
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,979
I see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

272
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,316
Keep coming.

273
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,613
Stop. To your left. To your left.

274
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:08,493
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

275
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,581
What is it?

276
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,085
He had lunch here.

277
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,921
McDonald's quarter-pounder.

278
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,007
With cheese.

279
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,093
Damn.

280
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,769
- Damn!
- That's four.

281
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:38,899
Alright, you won this one.
Come on out!

282
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,862
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

283
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:49,409
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

284
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:53,664
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

285
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,291
Yes, sir!

286
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,422
I saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

287
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:06,259
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

288
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:10,389
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

289
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:15,185
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

290
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:22,651
You don't call anybody often, you
don't write or receive many letters.

291
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,990
Who are you, sir, if I may ask?

292
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:32,744
Mr Clark and I are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

293
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:37,666
You'd be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead,

294
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:41,336
you'd have your choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

295
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,483
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal.

296
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,904
"The New York Times"reports that
you and Hardin were good friends.

297
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:12,200
No, not good friends.
We were lifelong friends.

298
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:16,246
I said that. I said that.

299
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,459
I told him to say that.

300
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,338
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

301
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:28,258
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

302
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:33,388
I was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

303
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:39,144
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

304
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:43,106
- Who told who to say what?
- It's not important.

305
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,860
- The President?
- Yeah.

306
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:51,490
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

307
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,993
She's probably right. Bye.

308
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,547
Thank you, Dr Ryan, for the
information you've shared with us.

309
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,968
- Thank you, Senator.
- We have to help the Colombians

310
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:16,598
in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

311
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:22,270
However, I'm confused.
How do you see additional funds

312
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:25,983
advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

313
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:30,487
- You see what I'm getting at?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

314
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:34,157
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

315
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:38,870
Our assistance is limited
to supply and advice only.

316
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,789
I've read that.

317
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:45,127
I've also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago

318
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:49,798
regarding a little-thought-of
sliver ofjungle in Southeast Asia.

319
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:56,096
You're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

320
00:30:56,263 --> 00:31:00,434
I'm comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked

321
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,147
to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

322
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,069
I'm afraid I don't know
what to say to that.

323
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,448
You can assure us
that we have all the facts.

324
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,158
I thought I had.

325
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:21,913
You can further assure us then
that this increase in funds

326
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,584
will not be used for
any covert military action.

327
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,962
I don't know how
you're getting to this.

328
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:32,549
Long experience, sir.

329
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,843
No troops then?

330
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,766
I enunciate that clearly because I
don't want there to be any mistake.

331
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,642
No troops.

332
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,563
You could say
I have your word on that?

333
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,941
You could indeed, because you do.

334
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:11,421
Listen up! Dog tags.
Take 'em off, pass 'em forward.

335
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:17,344
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

336
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:26,645
We're feet dry.

337
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,662
LZ in sight. Get ready.

338
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,915
Good luck, boys. Go get 'em.

339
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,005
OK, let's take her down now.

340
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,690
Go, go, go!

341
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,530
Hey, Bob.

342
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,159
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

343
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,287
Good to see you.

344
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,714
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

345
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,758
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

346
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:06,096
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black.

347
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:09,349
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

348
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:13,186
- When do I meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

349
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:15,480
Good, good. Sit down.

350
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,651
Thank you.

351
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:22,029
So.

352
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:26,325
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

353
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,746
- In Hardin's offshore accounts.
- $650 million.

354
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,998
- And change.
- And change.

355
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:36,710
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:40,839
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

357
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,884
- Let's get it?
- Let's turn this thing around.

358
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:46,219
$650 million and change.

359
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:51,308
It's worth ten times that
in political capital.

360
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,062
What?

361
00:35:55,228 --> 00:36:02,903
Well, this connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

362
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,489
- Theory?
- Atheory of mine.

363
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:09,326
- It's a theory?
- Well, I know the money is there.

364
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:14,289
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, I don't know.

365
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:20,170
I think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

366
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:26,218
So go down there. Establish it.

367
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,054
- Go where?
- Colombia.

368
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:33,350
Who, me?

369
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:41,525
I leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

370
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:43,735
What was I thinking?

371
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:50,283
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

372
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,787
- November.
- January.

373
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,747
Of last year.

374
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:03,422
There's a guy down there,
at least he used to be... Clark.

375
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,800
We go way back. Good man.

376
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,928
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

377
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,348
Admiral Greer?

378
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:16,935
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

379
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:19,938
Here we go again.

380
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:23,567
How's Ritter behaving?

381
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:27,446
Ritter's Ritter.
He's leaving me alone.

382
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,783
Are you sure?
Watch him like a hawk.

383
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,202
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

384
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:40,042
We'll get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

385
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,837
Then we'll get you back
to your room and comfortable.

386
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:41,645
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

387
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:47,776
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

388
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:52,030
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

389
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,327
Clear.

390
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,270
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

391
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:28,066
- Cook it.
- Roger that.

392
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,794
Honey? I'm late.

393
00:39:48,712 --> 00:39:52,049
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

394
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:56,011
I'm not gonna say it.

395
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,013
Don't.

396
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,265
Be careful.

397
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:34,633
Local time is, well, actually, it's
the same as Washington, 11:16am.

398
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,303
Temperature
is 69 degrees Fahrenheit...

399
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:47,062
Dr Ryan!

400
00:40:56,822 --> 00:41:00,117
DEASpecial Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

401
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,494
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

402
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:07,082
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

403
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:09,209
Come on, sir, let's go.

404
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:27,269
- And these two are?
- They're brothers.

405
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,276
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

406
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:36,528
Bulletproof.

407
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:47,706
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

408
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:51,001
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

409
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,880
The invisible man?

410
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,300
Gently, gently, with your hands.

411
00:41:58,467 --> 00:42:01,720
Luis, put your hands together.

412
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:05,349
No, your hands together!

413
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:10,854
Luis, watch the canter.

414
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:15,108
Yes, very good.

415
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,489
Yes?

416
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:24,951
We lost another plane.

417
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:29,873
OK.

418
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,922
- Who is doing this?
- If I had to guess...

419
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:40,676
No, I did not ask you to guess.
I can guess.

420
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:44,262
Someone has been talking
to the drug police.

421
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:49,601
Impossible. If anyone spoke to
the police, I'd be the first to know.

422
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,853
Ernesto?

423
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:58,402
Is one of the others trying to ruin
me after what I did to the American?

424
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:04,032
I guess that wasn't quite the
deterrent you thought itwould be.

425
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,785
Find out who it is.

426
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:18,088
What do you make of this, Colonel?

427
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:20,340
An opportunity.

428
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,886
An opportunity, Sipo.

429
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:42,863
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

430
00:43:44,197 --> 00:43:48,785
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry I'm late.

431
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:51,496
I've got ten minutes.

432
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:57,794
I'm positive Hardin was tied
into the cartels. It's drug money.

433
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:01,882
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

434
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,678
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

435
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:12,851
Why are you telling me all this? I've
been out of the game for a long time.

436
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:20,484
I was told that you were wired, and
that you knew the town and people.

437
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:24,154
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

438
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:27,866
Jim Greer.

439
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,328
How's he doing?

440
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:37,250
He's not good.

441
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,295
He has cancer.

442
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:42,798
Terminal.

443
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:48,804
- He's a good man.
- The best.

444
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,521
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

445
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:04,569
- Yeah, I like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

446
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:08,240
- Lindo?
- I think you'll like it.

447
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:17,791
Mr President,
I've got some good news.

448
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:22,838
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

449
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:28,385
- Escobedo? It figures.
- Is this another of your theories?

450
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:34,599
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

451
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:40,439
also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with these.

452
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:45,902
Importing, among other things,
coffee, which means nothing,

453
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:52,576
but he was paying too much
for this coffee. $6,200 a pound.

454
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:56,288
- That's expensive coffee.
- I'd have to agree.

455
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:59,291
This is good news.
I think this does it.

456
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:03,420
Sir, I also have some other news
which is not so good.

457
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,964
Oh, God.

458
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:12,095
The DEAfeels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

459
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:17,142
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

460
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:21,104
- We found it.
- We can try telling them that.

461
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:24,691
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, I don't care.

462
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:29,571
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that.

463
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:34,826
I wouldn't know what to say or
where to start. I'm not a negotiator.

464
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,245
You know someone
in their government?

465
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,082
I went to school
with their Attorney General.

466
00:46:40,248 --> 00:46:46,046
Jacobs will come down.
He'll negotiate. This is our money.

467
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,255
Thank...

468
00:46:48,924 --> 00:46:51,009
Thank you.

469
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:55,973
I hate this job.

470
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:16,303
Eyes up!

471
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,641
Demo team, up!

472
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:29,983
Fire in the hole!

473
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:37,908
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

474
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,703
Down! Down!

475
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:01,890
Whoever did this is dead.

476
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:07,854
Whoever did this to me is dead!

477
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:12,943
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

478
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:31,294
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

479
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:38,010
Moira, why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

480
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:41,555
And the next day.
I won't tell anybody.

481
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:45,183
Even when you're not here
there's plenty to do.

482
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:49,688
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

483
00:49:49,855 --> 00:49:53,525
You work too hard. Adiףs.

484
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:35,484
- LandayLanda.
- Roberto Landa, please.

485
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:40,113
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

486
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,117
I think he's on the factory floor.
Hold on.

487
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:53,293
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

488
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:59,216
I told her you were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

489
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:02,594
- Moira!
- Hi.

490
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,930
You free the next couple of days?

491
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:08,058
- Next couple of days?
- I am.

492
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:11,436
My boss is leaving the country.

493
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:18,318
- Can I call you later?
- Alright, call me at home. Bye.

494
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:33,208
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

495
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:37,170
An investigation
by the Department of Justice

496
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:42,009
has identified several
bank accounts from Luxembourg

497
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:46,221
to the Cayman Islands,
used for laundering drug money

498
00:51:46,388 --> 00:51:51,810
on an unprecedented scale.
With five foreign governments

499
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:55,355
we have taken steps
to seize those funds

500
00:51:55,522 --> 00:52:00,485
- which amount to over $650 million.
- Shit.

501
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:05,824
Also to seize 20 real estate
joint-venture investments in the US

502
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:11,872
which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

503
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,792
You did say $650 million?

504
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:19,755
That's right.
$650 million. And change.

505
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:22,299
They're stealing my money!

506
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:27,471
- What's our take?
- It's hard to say at the moment.

507
00:52:27,638 --> 00:52:32,601
No, it isn't. You're stealing my
money. I made it, you're stealing it!

508
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:39,024
Mr President, can we speak with
FBI Director Jacobs about this?

509
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:43,070
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

510
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:48,283
He's personally involved in the
investigation and is pretty busy.

511
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,091
This avenue has to be avoided.
They'll be coming from the airport.

512
00:53:04,257 --> 00:53:08,303
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

513
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:13,392
Santa Fe's our spot. As much as
I'd love to be here for this,

514
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:19,648
I have to take care of business in
Washington, tying up loose ends.

515
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:31,952
Hello?
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

516
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:38,125
- Hello?
- The machine is still on, Moira.

517
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:14,578
- Emil, good to see you.
- Andy, good to see you.

518
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:19,458
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

519
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:24,713
- This will bring you up to date.
- Alright, let's go.

520
00:54:37,434 --> 00:54:42,147
- How's the food?
- It's like Mexican food.

521
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:45,776
- You hate Mexican food.
- I hate Mexican food.

522
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:24,022
- Hi.
- Hello.

523
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:29,111
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads inPeoplemagazine.

524
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:32,864
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

525
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:43,834
It's awful.

526
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:48,046
Isn't it?

527
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,572
So I take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

528
00:56:15,282 --> 00:56:20,162
They put water in your room,
but I'd stick to the bottled stuff.

529
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:12,631
So what do you brush your teeth with?

530
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:17,386
You use the bottled water, or you'll
be in the can all yourtime here.

531
00:57:25,018 --> 00:57:27,521
The hold-up
was a government connection?

532
00:57:27,688 --> 00:57:29,690
Yeah, that's the connection.

533
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,994
Back up! Back up!

534
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,586
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

535
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:49,227
Damn it! Back up!

536
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:55,901
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

537
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:59,988
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

538
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:18,632
Incoming!

539
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:58,672
Dan!

540
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,331
Dan! Dan!

541
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:45,886
We can't stay here!

542
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:50,182
The car! Is it running?

543
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:52,351
It's running!

544
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:57,522
The smoke will give us cover.
It's our only chance. I got him.

545
01:00:57,689 --> 01:01:00,609
Make for the driver's side.
Ready? Go!

546
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:14,623
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

547
01:02:17,936 --> 01:02:20,439
Housekeeping.

548
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,701
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

549
01:02:41,877 --> 01:02:45,380
- Do you have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

550
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:47,299
...in Bogota today.

551
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:52,346
Ten members of the escort party
were also killed and eight wounded.

552
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:56,224
Five of the dead
were security personnel...

553
01:02:56,391 --> 01:03:01,229
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

554
01:03:01,396 --> 01:03:05,317
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

555
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:07,694
Dan Murray.

556
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:14,451
He was ten feet away.
There was nothing I could do.

557
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:19,665
- I'm coming home.
- Thank God.

558
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:22,417
I love you.

559
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:30,467
- Wasn't his going there a secret?
- It was.

560
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:35,180
- Then I don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

561
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:39,768
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

562
01:03:39,935 --> 01:03:43,105
You know what? They're wrong.

563
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,899
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

564
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:52,739
They've directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

565
01:03:53,448 --> 01:03:56,076
No more sending messages.

566
01:03:56,243 --> 01:04:00,372
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

567
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:05,377
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

568
01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:10,048
He can't be clear when clarity
is what he wants to avoid.

569
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:13,760
What he means is the gloves come off.

570
01:04:30,819 --> 01:04:34,406
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with it.

571
01:04:34,573 --> 01:04:39,328
I didn't. I wish I had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

572
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:41,621
Who did then?

573
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:46,626
You know, you have no answers.

574
01:04:48,545 --> 01:04:51,798
Is this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

575
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:55,177
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, I do.

576
01:04:57,638 --> 01:05:01,350
Itwas done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

577
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:05,729
As you suspected. It's always
a friend who hates you most.

578
01:05:05,896 --> 01:05:07,981
Give me the phone.

579
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,240
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

580
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:23,372
Did I do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if I did this thing?

581
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:27,459
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

582
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,547
And now you want me
to believe it wasn't you?

583
01:05:32,714 --> 01:05:34,508
It wasn't, Enrique.

584
01:05:34,675 --> 01:05:37,886
The Americans will retaliate
against all of us.

585
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:41,306
I swear I had
nothing to do with it.

586
01:05:41,473 --> 01:05:45,560
Why do you expect me
to listen to you when you lie?

587
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,271
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

588
01:05:48,438 --> 01:05:51,566
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

589
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:54,611
- When?
- As soon as possible.

590
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:03,161
Tomorrow night. I am not
telling you, I am asking you!

591
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:05,163
May we meet tomorrow night?

592
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:08,375
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Thank you.

593
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:40,490
- He's scared.
- He should be.

594
01:06:40,657 --> 01:06:43,618
I don't know what you said to him,
but it was right.

595
01:08:16,586 --> 01:08:18,297
Strange, don't you think?

596
01:08:18,463 --> 01:08:23,218
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

597
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:28,682
He wasn't his secretary. He was
a member of the security detail.

598
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:30,934
Who?

599
01:08:32,185 --> 01:08:36,064
- I don't remember his name.
- I'm talking about Moira.

600
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,524
What?

601
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:40,027
Moira, remember?
Jacobs's secretary.

602
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:44,323
I know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

603
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:53,206
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

604
01:08:53,373 --> 01:08:57,544
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

605
01:08:57,711 --> 01:09:00,047
Which connects her death and Jacobs's

606
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:03,008
beyond the fact
that they worked together.

607
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:06,803
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

608
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

609
01:09:10,474 --> 01:09:12,184
She did.

610
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,312
She did.

611
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:25,947
I saw him from a distance.
From behind.

612
01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:31,036
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if I look at these?

613
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:33,955
Is that what the people
from the cabin said?

614
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:35,082
Yeah.

615
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:41,380
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

616
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:43,882
Disconnected.

617
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:49,805
- So you have no leads?
- I have a lot.

618
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:55,060
Afictitious name on a register. A
stolen phoned-in credit card number.

619
01:09:55,227 --> 01:10:00,440
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy but really didn't see him.

620
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:03,527
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

621
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,028
Yes, sir.

622
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:08,031
The machine is still on, Moira.

623
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:11,243
You have a recording
of the killer's voice.

624
01:10:12,327 --> 01:10:14,496
Maybe.

625
01:10:17,374 --> 01:10:22,713
Jack. I think we've got something.
This is from the answering machine.

626
01:10:22,879 --> 01:10:27,426
And this was recorded yesterday.
I'll play it for you.

627
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:34,599
The machine is still on, Moira.

628
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,144
And...

629
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:41,940
He's scared. I don't know what
you said to him, but it was right.

630
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:45,193
Run a match on that.

631
01:10:47,904 --> 01:10:50,449
He's Cuban.

632
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:53,869
35 to 45.

633
01:10:54,036 --> 01:10:58,623
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

634
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:02,336
- It's the same voice.
- You're sure?

635
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:04,796
- Yeah.
- How sure?

636
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:11,803
90 percent.

637
01:11:13,013 --> 01:11:16,224
- I need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

638
01:11:16,391 --> 01:11:20,103
I know. I need a name,
and I need it quick.

639
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:41,333
300 is topside.

640
01:12:25,252 --> 01:12:27,629
Target is set.

641
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,551
- Hector!
- Enrique!

642
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:36,263
Good to see you!

643
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:39,099
- It was not easy for us.
- How are you?

644
01:12:39,599 --> 01:12:43,603
Rojas, Diaz...

645
01:12:46,398 --> 01:12:48,442
What the hell is this?

646
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:51,278
What the hell is this?

647
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:55,782
My new toy. Like it?

648
01:12:56,867 --> 01:12:58,827
You see this?

649
01:12:58,994 --> 01:13:03,957
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

650
01:13:09,004 --> 01:13:12,424
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

651
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:15,510
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

652
01:13:15,677 --> 01:13:19,681
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a Rog.

653
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,398
Target is lit.

654
01:13:28,565 --> 01:13:30,359
Start the music.

655
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:33,320
Into attack.

656
01:13:34,404 --> 01:13:39,534
Pickle's hot. Target is acquired
and lit. Coming down.

657
01:13:44,122 --> 01:13:51,046
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

658
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:03,016
Damn it!
Why doesn't he fix this road?

659
01:14:03,976 --> 01:14:07,354
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

660
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:10,482
Keep the target painted.

661
01:14:39,136 --> 01:14:40,762
Sir?

662
01:14:46,059 --> 01:14:47,102
Boom.

663
01:14:56,486 --> 01:14:58,030
Mother of God!

664
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:04,870
Circular error probability zero.

665
01:15:05,037 --> 01:15:09,708
Impact with high-order detonation.
Have a nice day.

666
01:15:15,255 --> 01:15:18,592
The man's completely out of control.
He has no...

667
01:15:27,768 --> 01:15:31,229
His name is Cortez, Felix Cortez.

668
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:33,774
A colonel
in Cuba's intelligence service

669
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,026
until a few years ago. Disappeared.

670
01:15:36,234 --> 01:15:41,114
Turned up working for the Macheteros,
a terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

671
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:42,699
Disappeared again.

672
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:47,287
Yesterday, we taped him
talking to a Cali cartel subject.

673
01:15:47,454 --> 01:15:52,000
I'll fax what I have on him.
If he shows, pick him up, OK?

674
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:56,046
- You know I can't do that.
- I mean the police, the Colombians.

675
01:15:56,213 --> 01:16:00,300
The Colombian police
do not pick up members of the cartel.

676
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:04,221
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

677
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:07,099
Wait a minute.

678
01:16:07,265 --> 01:16:12,270
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, something's happened here.

679
01:16:24,157 --> 01:16:28,704
At least 30 people were killed,
including women and children.

680
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:33,333
The bomb exploded in a car
belongingto a Rojas associate.

681
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,296
- Jack?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

682
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,674
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

683
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:48,056
Send me all the stuff, and we'll
put a tail on him if we spot him.

684
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:51,518
If he's still alive. I've got to go.

685
01:16:51,685 --> 01:16:55,856
...a series of explosions.
- Cops claim the violence...

686
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:59,484
- A surgical strike, you said.
- It was perfect.

687
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:03,739
- They brought out a kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

688
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:07,534
- I know what I said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

689
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:10,078
I'm not changing my mind.

690
01:17:10,245 --> 01:17:14,624
I hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

691
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:19,046
- Neither had he.
- It will be interpreted as I said.

692
01:17:19,212 --> 01:17:23,300
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

693
01:17:23,467 --> 01:17:24,509
Goodnight.

694
01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:43,070
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

695
01:17:43,236 --> 01:17:44,655
Thanks.

696
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,911
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

697
01:17:51,078 --> 01:17:55,791
No. All IDs have been confirmed.
Who were you hoping for?

698
01:17:55,957 --> 01:17:59,836
If he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

699
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:06,301
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

700
01:18:07,386 --> 01:18:10,472
Ritter? You look very nice today.

701
01:18:11,431 --> 01:18:13,517
Thank you.

702
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:28,782
Car bomb.

703
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:41,044
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

704
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:45,173
- It explodes.
- It blows up and out?

705
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,843
And a missile?

706
01:18:50,929 --> 01:18:53,724
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

707
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:56,143
Bring up the satellite photo.

708
01:19:02,441 --> 01:19:05,694
HMX and TNT.

709
01:19:05,861 --> 01:19:09,531
When you mix it 70-30,
you get a compound called Octol.

710
01:19:09,698 --> 01:19:12,993
Put enough explosives in a car,
you get a crater that big.

711
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:17,456
- It's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

712
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:21,209
- Very violent.
- There would be pieces all around.

713
01:19:21,793 --> 01:19:28,634
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The US.

714
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,639
But nobody uses it. Nobody can
afford it except the military.

715
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:39,061
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

716
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:40,604
- It's not?
- No.

717
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:44,399
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

718
01:19:44,566 --> 01:19:47,736
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

719
01:19:47,903 --> 01:19:51,657
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

720
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:39,830
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb."

721
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:43,583
Paper.

722
01:20:48,005 --> 01:20:49,589
The Americans are here.

723
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:24,791
"We have something in common.
We cannot implement policy

724
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:28,920
without tacit authorisation
from our employer."

725
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:34,051
"We also both know that there are
American troops in Colombia

726
01:21:34,217 --> 01:21:37,179
fighting an illegal war."

727
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:43,143
"I will be at Hotel Paloma de Oro
in Panama City on Wednesday."

728
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:45,228
"I suggest we meet."

729
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:41,618
- Six, this is Point. Over.
- Six here.

730
01:22:42,953 --> 01:22:45,247
The stuffs here, a lot of it.

731
01:22:45,414 --> 01:22:50,335
I'm also looking
at 100 to 150 men, armed,

732
01:22:50,502 --> 01:22:53,380
waiting around for something. Over.

733
01:22:53,547 --> 01:22:56,133
Colombian Army? Over.

734
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:02,014
Negative.
They look like mercenaries.

735
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:05,767
- Over.
- Alright. Get back here.

736
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:09,980
Abort mission.
I say again, abort mission. Out.

737
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:14,192
150 armed men?

738
01:23:34,921 --> 01:23:36,882
Raise your arms, please.

739
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:57,277
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

740
01:23:57,444 --> 01:24:01,323
I had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

741
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:06,078
It was an act of madness.
But typical of the men I work for.

742
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:11,750
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

743
01:24:12,626 --> 01:24:17,506
You agree that as long as Americans
want drugs, someone will supply them?

744
01:24:17,673 --> 01:24:20,676
I don't want to be here
any longer than I have to.

745
01:24:20,842 --> 01:24:24,137
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

746
01:24:24,304 --> 01:24:28,850
- That we want the same thing.
- Same thing? Really?

747
01:24:29,017 --> 01:24:31,603
Only, so far,
you've done all the work.

748
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:34,022
You took care of the little fish.

749
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:36,900
I will take care of
the one that got away.

750
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:41,863
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

751
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:46,284
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

752
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:48,996
By restructuring the drug trade.

753
01:24:49,162 --> 01:24:53,208
By regulating it. What would you say

754
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:58,171
if I promised to halve the cocaine
shipments to the US?

755
01:24:59,631 --> 01:25:03,760
I'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

756
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:07,764
I can also promise you
regular quotas on major arrests

757
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:11,018
that your police
can take credit for.

758
01:25:11,184 --> 01:25:14,896
Imagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

759
01:25:15,063 --> 01:25:19,985
No more senseless violence.
You'll have your victory.

760
01:25:24,156 --> 01:25:25,991
In return for what?

761
01:25:27,242 --> 01:25:30,996
I also need a victory,
to establish my position

762
01:25:31,163 --> 01:25:36,043
with what is left of the cartel,
so I can help you.

763
01:25:36,585 --> 01:25:41,465
I need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

764
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:47,804
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

765
01:25:54,353 --> 01:26:00,317
DEA's sending the audio surveillance
tape. They haven't got it yet.

766
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:07,824
You know what you think about
when you're lying here?

767
01:26:09,618 --> 01:26:13,455
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

768
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:18,919
...that's alright.
You lived a long time.

769
01:26:19,544 --> 01:26:21,713
You had a family that loved you.

770
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,551
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

771
01:26:27,177 --> 01:26:30,263
That you thought was honourable.

772
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:33,892
And then you see this.

773
01:26:37,896 --> 01:26:40,899
I'm afraid if I dig any deeper...

774
01:26:42,025 --> 01:26:45,278
...no one's gonna like what I find.

775
01:26:50,283 --> 01:26:52,369
You took an oath...

776
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:56,623
...if you recall...

777
01:26:58,959 --> 01:27:02,379
...when you first came
to work for me.

778
01:27:02,546 --> 01:27:08,385
And I don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the US.

779
01:27:09,303 --> 01:27:11,763
I mean to his boss.

780
01:27:12,764 --> 01:27:15,642
And I don't mean the President.

781
01:27:17,102 --> 01:27:20,605
You gave your word to...

782
01:27:21,982 --> 01:27:24,276
...his boss.

783
01:27:24,443 --> 01:27:26,361
You gave your word...

784
01:27:27,446 --> 01:27:32,075
...to the people
of the United States.

785
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,079
Your word is who you are.

786
01:27:41,251 --> 01:27:44,171
What else have you got there?

787
01:27:49,134 --> 01:27:52,137
I brought you some new magazines.

788
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:05,776
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

789
01:28:05,942 --> 01:28:07,444
Good.

790
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:11,823
- Is that it?
- Except for the other thing.

791
01:28:12,282 --> 01:28:15,577
We've accomplished a lot.
We're seeing results.

792
01:28:15,744 --> 01:28:19,831
Drug shipments are down.
Price on the street is rising.

793
01:28:19,998 --> 01:28:24,628
The perception is the administration
is doing something right.

794
01:28:24,795 --> 01:28:27,422
What's the bad news?

795
01:28:29,508 --> 01:28:35,222
I'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs's assassination.

796
01:28:36,765 --> 01:28:39,810
Just the kind of thing
reporters live for.

797
01:28:39,977 --> 01:28:44,106
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

798
01:28:45,357 --> 01:28:49,486
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

799
01:28:49,653 --> 01:28:53,281
- If that's what you think.
- I think so.

800
01:28:55,117 --> 01:28:59,871
Then it should go away.
It never happened.

801
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:08,380
Well, it's possible.

802
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:13,802
It would be easier if you told me
whose system you want to break into.

803
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:15,971
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

804
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:39,411
Well, we're way beyond birthdays now.

805
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:45,751
I'm gonna have to write
a special program here.

806
01:29:48,128 --> 01:29:49,963
Right.

807
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:59,931
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

808
01:30:01,391 --> 01:30:03,477
Fine, good.

809
01:30:04,519 --> 01:30:07,689
Yes. Here we go.

810
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:46,311
Jesus!

811
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,792
Reciprocity. What's that?

812
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:22,681
- Yeah?
- I forgot to tell you,

813
01:31:22,848 --> 01:31:24,349
after you get the code,

814
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:28,061
wait until he's off his system
before you log on.

815
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:31,982
- He will know it when you do.
- Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

816
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:34,693
Oh, my God!

817
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:07,225
Cutter.

818
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:21,907
Yeah?

819
01:32:22,074 --> 01:32:25,911
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

820
01:32:26,078 --> 01:32:30,415
Listen, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

821
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:35,671
We're going to work together.
We should get to know each other.

822
01:32:35,837 --> 01:32:40,133
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

823
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:44,638
- Yeah, I play tennis.
- How about we get together?

824
01:32:44,805 --> 01:32:48,100
Next week?
Hour before we startwork?

825
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:57,401
- Jack?
- Yeah.

826
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:01,780
Computer theft is a serious crime.

827
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:09,121
So are crimes
against the Constitution.

828
01:33:10,622 --> 01:33:12,708
Son of a bitch!

829
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:26,638
Son of a bitch!

830
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:33,145
Come on, come on.

831
01:33:35,564 --> 01:33:37,649
Clark.

832
01:33:49,703 --> 01:33:51,204
Yeah.

833
01:34:13,393 --> 01:34:16,563
You'll go to jail, pal.

834
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:20,275
What is that? What do you think
you have there?

835
01:34:20,442 --> 01:34:22,110
You broke the law.

836
01:34:23,153 --> 01:34:27,240
You are such a Boy Scout.

837
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:30,786
Look at you. You see everything
in black and white.

838
01:34:30,953 --> 01:34:34,915
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

839
01:34:35,082 --> 01:34:39,336
- You see? There you go again.
- Why was I kept out of it?

840
01:34:39,503 --> 01:34:43,131
You're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

841
01:34:43,298 --> 01:34:46,301
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

842
01:34:46,468 --> 01:34:50,931
- I never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

843
01:34:51,098 --> 01:34:54,685
- There are troops!
- You know I didn't know that.

844
01:34:54,851 --> 01:35:00,524
No. I have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

845
01:35:00,691 --> 01:35:04,653
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

846
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:09,700
- Who authorised this?
- I have no recollection, Senator.

847
01:35:14,621 --> 01:35:19,084
I did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

848
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:23,171
Who authorised this? Cutter?

849
01:35:23,338 --> 01:35:27,009
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

850
01:35:31,305 --> 01:35:34,683
- If I go down, you're going with me.
- Wrong again.

851
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:39,062
I have an autographed
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

852
01:35:40,314 --> 01:35:44,901
"The President authorises the Deputy
Director CIA, Robert Ritter,

853
01:35:45,068 --> 01:35:50,449
to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary."

854
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:55,412
"This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the US."

855
01:35:55,579 --> 01:35:57,247
Etc, etc, etc.

856
01:35:59,124 --> 01:36:03,795
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

857
01:36:12,763 --> 01:36:17,643
Grey! The world is grey, Jack.

858
01:36:50,217 --> 01:36:55,305
Got any idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess?

859
01:36:55,472 --> 01:36:58,266
Absolutely none.

860
01:37:07,192 --> 01:37:10,779
Yeah. This is he.

861
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:17,327
When?

862
01:37:21,498 --> 01:37:23,583
James?

863
01:37:25,252 --> 01:37:27,170
Thank you.

864
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:35,178
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family,

865
01:37:35,345 --> 01:37:39,641
giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

866
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:44,563
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

867
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:49,901
Enlisting in the Navy at 17.
Graduating from the Academy.

868
01:37:50,068 --> 01:37:53,697
Achieving three stars for his flag.

869
01:37:53,864 --> 01:37:57,743
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

870
01:37:57,909 --> 01:38:02,039
He participated in them. He made
them clearer to the rest of us,

871
01:38:02,205 --> 01:38:08,462
with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

872
01:38:17,888 --> 01:38:20,390
I can't see them,
but I know they're there.

873
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:24,186
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

874
01:38:28,774 --> 01:38:32,110
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.

875
01:38:32,277 --> 01:38:35,781
Never, though, was he deluded
into thinking that one man

876
01:38:35,947 --> 01:38:38,867
could solve the ills of the world.

877
01:38:39,493 --> 01:38:43,664
Always the soldier, on the
battlefields of the South Pacific,

878
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:48,919
Korea, Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit

879
01:38:49,086 --> 01:38:51,421
to preserve the ideals...

880
01:38:51,588 --> 01:38:55,050
- Knife, this is Variable, over.
...of his nation.

881
01:38:55,217 --> 01:38:57,678
Knife! This is Variable, over.

882
01:38:59,054 --> 01:39:03,266
To the refuge of the earth,
we entrust our friend's body.

883
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:08,188
To the protection of our God
in Heaven, we entrust his soul.

884
01:39:08,355 --> 01:39:12,693
To ourselves, we entrust his spirit

885
01:39:12,859 --> 01:39:15,946
and the principles he lived by.

886
01:39:16,947 --> 01:39:18,949
We're gonna miss you, James.

887
01:39:41,638 --> 01:39:44,599
Variable, this is Knife, over.

888
01:39:44,766 --> 01:39:47,769
Variable, this is Knife, over.

889
01:39:47,936 --> 01:39:51,440
Variable, I am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

890
01:39:51,606 --> 01:39:54,985
- Need air support, over.
- Go, go, go!

891
01:40:16,173 --> 01:40:20,010
Variable, this is Knife, over!
Switch!

892
01:40:52,376 --> 01:40:56,380
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?

893
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:15,107
Present arms.

894
01:41:17,943 --> 01:41:22,447
On behalf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

895
01:41:22,614 --> 01:41:26,368
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

896
01:41:34,876 --> 01:41:37,004
All aim.

897
01:42:04,364 --> 01:42:06,908
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

898
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:08,785
This is he.

899
01:42:08,952 --> 01:42:12,331
Jack? You've got to hear this.

900
01:42:12,497 --> 01:42:15,083
Picked it up this morning.

901
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:21,173
Variable, this is Knife. We are
under attack, need air support.

902
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:24,635
Variable, this is Knife,
where the hell are you?

903
01:42:25,427 --> 01:42:28,347
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

904
01:42:29,431 --> 01:42:33,810
Make a copy, Jean.
Make ten copies.

905
01:42:33,977 --> 01:42:37,064
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

906
01:42:39,566 --> 01:42:44,738
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

907
01:43:27,322 --> 01:43:33,412
He's on American 915.
He'll be in Bogota 7:50pm.

908
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:47,342
- Yeah?
- It's Ritter.

909
01:43:47,509 --> 01:43:51,221
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

910
01:43:51,388 --> 01:43:54,308
We've got a disaster!
I can't get through to my men.

911
01:43:55,017 --> 01:43:58,520
We had to shut down
the satellite link.

912
01:43:59,938 --> 01:44:02,941
- Clark?
- You had to what?

913
01:44:04,276 --> 01:44:10,198
It's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to walk up the Hill

914
01:44:10,365 --> 01:44:13,285
if we didn't
shut down the operation.

915
01:44:13,452 --> 01:44:19,207
OK. It's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

916
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:26,923
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

917
01:44:28,675 --> 01:44:32,095
I'm on a plane.
I'm gonna kill him.

918
01:44:33,472 --> 01:44:35,557
Ritter?

919
01:44:37,309 --> 01:44:39,853
Don't get on a plane.
He's coming to you.

920
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:44,024
American Airlines at 1950 hours
with no security.

921
01:44:44,191 --> 01:44:48,445
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

922
01:44:48,612 --> 01:44:51,615
Once Ryan's gone, we're back on line.

923
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:54,284
You understand?

924
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:57,746
Yes, sir.

925
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,786
Clark.

926
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:21,788
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

927
01:46:21,955 --> 01:46:24,291
Don't be an asshole,
I came to find you.

928
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,793
You found me. Get in.

929
01:46:28,086 --> 01:46:29,588
Alright.

930
01:46:30,922 --> 01:46:32,633
Behind the wheel.

931
01:46:34,134 --> 01:46:36,094
Clark.

932
01:46:37,012 --> 01:46:39,514
Drive.

933
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:09,336
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

934
01:47:11,254 --> 01:47:12,464
How?

935
01:47:13,674 --> 01:47:16,843
I killed him. Turn the op back on.

936
01:47:20,013 --> 01:47:25,143
You said get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

937
01:47:50,168 --> 01:47:52,337
What the hell are you doing here?

938
01:47:54,715 --> 01:47:57,926
I came to help you
get those guys out.

939
01:47:59,469 --> 01:48:02,180
What can you do to help me?

940
01:48:07,728 --> 01:48:10,605
What do you need?

941
01:48:10,772 --> 01:48:12,357
A helicopter.

942
01:48:14,735 --> 01:48:17,529
A helicopter.

943
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:26,955
No, thank you.

944
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:33,170
- Is this happy hour?
- It's always happy hour.

945
01:48:33,337 --> 01:48:37,132
- Your pilot owns thisjoint?
- He lives here.

946
01:48:42,638 --> 01:48:44,097
Here he is.

947
01:48:55,192 --> 01:48:57,110
- Morning.
- Morning.

948
01:48:57,277 --> 01:49:00,113
Morning. I'm here to rent the Huey.

949
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:04,868
Sorry, we don't rent it any more.
But it is for sale.

950
01:49:05,911 --> 01:49:07,955
How much is it?

951
01:49:09,247 --> 01:49:11,917
Two million dollars.

952
01:49:16,421 --> 01:49:20,008
My pilot and I would
have to do a test flight.

953
01:49:20,175 --> 01:49:23,387
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

954
01:49:25,055 --> 01:49:26,974
How much is that?

955
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,767
Two million dollars.

956
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:37,776
Would you take a company cheque?

957
01:49:44,283 --> 01:49:45,909
Yes.

958
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:58,005
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

959
01:49:59,631 --> 01:50:04,094
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

960
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:19,943
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. Mychopper. Let's go.

961
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:43,925
Their last communication
put them here.

962
01:50:45,135 --> 01:50:50,265
The closest extraction point is here,
in this gorge.

963
01:50:51,266 --> 01:50:52,893
I got it.

964
01:51:12,496 --> 01:51:16,208
- Is that a body down there?
- Yeah.

965
01:51:18,085 --> 01:51:21,797
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

966
01:51:25,175 --> 01:51:29,972
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

967
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:17,853
Nowhere to run to.
No place to hide.

968
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:23,275
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

969
01:52:36,496 --> 01:52:40,626
These are the falls
we saw from the air.

970
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:44,546
The bodies should be
about 50 metres down.

971
01:52:56,350 --> 01:53:01,438
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

972
01:53:01,605 --> 01:53:03,899
Fuck, you left us out to dry!

973
01:53:04,066 --> 01:53:06,151
- You son of a bitch!
- Easy! Easy!

974
01:53:09,112 --> 01:53:12,407
- It's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it?

975
01:53:14,284 --> 01:53:16,662
It's my fault.

976
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:23,543
It's my fault.

977
01:53:35,222 --> 01:53:39,309
I was on point
when the last attack came.

978
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:42,688
Over a mile away.

979
01:53:43,772 --> 01:53:46,066
By the time I got back, it was over.

980
01:53:47,526 --> 01:53:50,737
They were taking the Captain and Oso.

981
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,906
The others?

982
01:53:54,616 --> 01:53:56,368
I buried them.

983
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:07,379
Road to the town.

984
01:54:07,546 --> 01:54:10,882
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

985
01:54:11,049 --> 01:54:14,845
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

986
01:54:15,012 --> 01:54:18,307
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

987
01:54:24,938 --> 01:54:29,985
Morning. I'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. I have no appointment.

988
01:54:31,403 --> 01:54:33,614
Gracias.

989
01:54:43,457 --> 01:54:45,626
OK.

990
01:54:47,419 --> 01:54:49,379
Hands up.

991
01:54:50,005 --> 01:54:51,965
Hands up!

992
01:54:53,508 --> 01:54:55,844
Wallet.

993
01:55:00,223 --> 01:55:03,018
It's a tape recorder.

994
01:55:06,563 --> 01:55:09,149
He's in.

995
01:55:11,693 --> 01:55:14,696
Bird, this is Variable, over.

996
01:55:16,615 --> 01:55:20,535
Bird, this is Variable, over.

997
01:55:36,468 --> 01:55:40,389
Dr Ryan. Come in.

998
01:55:54,027 --> 01:55:58,115
Sit down. What can I do for you?

999
01:55:59,366 --> 01:56:05,080
I didn't know who else to turn to.
I have a problem.

1000
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:10,002
An associate of mine,
a coffee buyer and his assistant,

1001
01:56:10,168 --> 01:56:13,088
were on a business trip
in this area.

1002
01:56:13,255 --> 01:56:17,050
They unexpectedly disappeared
yesterday. I'm very concerned.

1003
01:56:17,217 --> 01:56:19,428
Coffee buyer?

1004
01:56:19,594 --> 01:56:22,347
It's very important to me
to find them.

1005
01:56:22,514 --> 01:56:25,767
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

1006
01:56:26,935 --> 01:56:31,732
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

1007
01:56:34,693 --> 01:56:38,238
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

1008
01:56:38,405 --> 01:56:43,201
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

1009
01:56:43,368 --> 01:56:47,205
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

1010
01:56:47,372 --> 01:56:51,376
Well, I'll have to talk to accounting
about that.

1011
01:56:52,753 --> 01:56:55,255
$650 million.

1012
01:56:58,342 --> 01:57:00,594
And change.

1013
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:07,059
Are you offering to help me with
the collection of an unpaid debt?

1014
01:57:07,225 --> 01:57:10,354
- No.
- What are you offering?

1015
01:57:11,647 --> 01:57:16,318
Atrade.
Felix Cortez has sold you out.

1016
01:57:16,485 --> 01:57:19,112
His next move is to murder you,
your family,

1017
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:20,948
and take over the cartel.

1018
01:57:21,114 --> 01:57:23,075
Where's my tape recorder?

1019
01:57:29,539 --> 01:57:31,500
Play the tape.

1020
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:07,494
Let's move.

1021
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:40,319
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

1022
01:58:40,485 --> 01:58:43,780
Doctor? Why? Is somebody sick?

1023
01:58:57,169 --> 01:58:58,879
What does he want?

1024
01:59:00,922 --> 01:59:04,384
The safe return of his associates.

1025
01:59:04,551 --> 01:59:08,805
And what does he offer us in return?

1026
01:59:08,972 --> 01:59:11,475
You.

1027
01:59:17,147 --> 01:59:21,526
Whatever this man has told you
is a lie. He lies for a living.

1028
01:59:21,693 --> 01:59:26,323
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

1029
01:59:32,704 --> 01:59:35,666
You've taken care of the little fish.

1030
01:59:35,832 --> 01:59:38,543
I will take care
of the one that got away.

1031
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:43,423
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

1032
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:47,803
So, the question is...

1033
01:59:49,137 --> 01:59:51,640
...what am I supposed to do with you?

1034
01:59:54,726 --> 01:59:57,771
Well? I guess I'm supposed
to kill you with this bat!

1035
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:08,699
Get up.

1036
02:00:13,245 --> 02:00:17,582
Dramatic seizures. Drastic
reductions, no more violence...

1037
02:00:17,749 --> 02:00:21,128
You'll have your victory.

1038
02:00:21,795 --> 02:00:23,505
In return for what?

1039
02:01:03,712 --> 02:01:05,797
- Where are they?
- They're here.

1040
02:01:07,716 --> 02:01:12,763
Kill the plant. The American
killed Ernesto! Let's go!

1041
02:02:00,519 --> 02:02:02,938
Bird to Variable, over.

1042
02:02:16,034 --> 02:02:17,619
Bird, this is Variable.

1043
02:02:17,786 --> 02:02:20,122
Where the hell are you?

1044
02:02:20,289 --> 02:02:25,043
I'm cruising about five clicks
south of the village.

1045
02:02:25,961 --> 02:02:30,048
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.
- Roger that.

1046
02:02:41,893 --> 02:02:44,730
- No one.
- The prisoners!

1047
02:03:31,234 --> 02:03:34,529
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

1048
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:38,325
We're going home, boys.

1049
02:04:51,315 --> 02:04:54,067
Pick us up
at the Lindo Coffee factory.

1050
02:06:30,497 --> 02:06:34,459
Not only can I expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

1051
02:06:34,626 --> 02:06:41,341
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

1052
02:06:41,508 --> 02:06:46,179
Do you want to end the career
of your commander in chief?

1053
02:07:30,182 --> 02:07:32,517
Let's go!

1054
02:07:59,586 --> 02:08:03,090
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

1055
02:08:06,093 --> 02:08:08,345
Come on!

1056
02:08:15,018 --> 02:08:17,354
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1057
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:19,564
Yeah? We're out of here!

1058
02:08:26,822 --> 02:08:29,950
Set it down! He's down there!

1059
02:08:42,045 --> 02:08:43,714
Come on!

1060
02:09:03,025 --> 02:09:04,860
I've got you!

1061
02:09:11,742 --> 02:09:14,286
Chavez, cover me!

1062
02:09:23,128 --> 02:09:26,506
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1063
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:35,158
The President will see you now, sir.

1064
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:50,757
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

1065
02:10:51,925 --> 02:10:56,054
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?

1066
02:10:56,221 --> 02:10:58,557
No.

1067
02:10:58,724 --> 02:11:03,020
- Come on, sit down.
- I would prefer to stand, sir.

1068
02:11:05,105 --> 02:11:11,612
Some things have gone on here
that I'm just becoming aware of.

1069
02:11:11,778 --> 02:11:16,033
I was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

1070
02:11:16,199 --> 02:11:19,453
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

1071
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:23,957
Now we have to sort them out, figure
out who is responsible for what

1072
02:11:24,124 --> 02:11:27,878
and what to do about it.
We have to do this very delicately,

1073
02:11:28,045 --> 02:11:31,965
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

1074
02:11:32,132 --> 02:11:34,343
We have to lie.

1075
02:11:35,427 --> 02:11:40,098
- Did I say that?
- No, you didn't.

1076
02:11:40,265 --> 02:11:43,935
- You're upset.
- I'm upset.

1077
02:11:44,102 --> 02:11:49,650
It's understandable. Do you mind
if I give you a bit of advice?

1078
02:11:49,816 --> 02:11:52,110
You know this because you're smart.

1079
02:11:52,277 --> 02:11:56,323
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1080
02:11:56,490 --> 02:12:02,037
You did. American soldiers and
civilians are dead because of it.

1081
02:12:02,204 --> 02:12:06,124
- I never ordered any...
- No. Don't play that game with me!

1082
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:10,462
You won't dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1083
02:12:10,629 --> 02:12:14,424
- How dare you lecture...
- How dare you, sir?

1084
02:12:14,591 --> 02:12:18,470
How dare you come here
and bark at me like a junkyard dog!

1085
02:12:18,637 --> 02:12:21,974
I am the President
of the United States!

1086
02:12:25,936 --> 02:12:29,481
It gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.

1087
02:12:29,648 --> 02:12:32,901
As Acting Deputy Director
of Intelligence it is my duty

1088
02:12:33,068 --> 02:12:37,072
to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1089
02:12:41,994 --> 02:12:44,162
You're not going to do that.

1090
02:12:45,914 --> 02:12:47,874
- I'm not?
- No, no.

1091
02:12:50,127 --> 02:12:54,089
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1092
02:12:55,382 --> 02:12:57,592
You're going to tuck that away,

1093
02:12:57,759 --> 02:13:01,346
save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1094
02:13:01,513 --> 02:13:04,599
And then you're going to pull it out.

1095
02:13:04,766 --> 02:13:09,229
And I'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1096
02:13:11,023 --> 02:13:14,568
I don't think I have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1097
02:13:15,861 --> 02:13:21,325
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

1098
02:13:21,491 --> 02:13:26,997
it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1099
02:13:27,164 --> 02:13:31,043
You'll take the blame. Cutter
and Ritter will take some, too,

1100
02:13:31,209 --> 02:13:34,713
but it won't amount to much,
a slap on the wrist.

1101
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:40,010
Then $20,000 an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1102
02:13:40,177 --> 02:13:43,972
The rest of the blame
will fall on Greer.

1103
02:13:44,139 --> 02:13:48,101
Yeah, you'll take him down with you.

1104
02:13:48,268 --> 02:13:50,979
You'll destroy his reputation.

1105
02:13:51,146 --> 02:13:56,652
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1106
02:13:59,488 --> 02:14:03,325
I'm sorry, Mr President,
I don't dance.

1107
02:14:26,348 --> 02:14:28,934
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1108
02:14:29,101 --> 02:14:31,603
No.

1109
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:34,439
We need to talk!

1110
02:14:34,606 --> 02:14:36,692
Ryan!

1111
02:15:01,008 --> 02:15:06,722
The Committee will come to order.
The Chair will now call Dr Ryan.

1112
02:15:27,659 --> 02:15:31,663
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1113
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,540
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

1114
02:15:34,082 --> 02:15:37,544
Please stand
and raise your right hand.

1115
02:15:40,505 --> 02:15:44,468
Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you're about to give

1116
02:15:44,635 --> 02:15:46,428
is the truth, the whole truth

1117
02:15:46,595 --> 02:15:49,348
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1118
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:54,019
I do.

1119
02:15:55,604 --> 02:16:00,984
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.

1120
02:16:01,305 --> 02:17:01,910
