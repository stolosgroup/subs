Only thing you got in common with the King

3
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,684
is a liking for peanut butter sandwiches.

4
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,602
Yeah.

5
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,146
That kind of combo clogs up the plumbing.

6
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,772
Can't crap.

7
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,401
Shit backs up to your eyeballs,
turns them brown.

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,694
And then you drown.

9
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,529
Now, there's a song for you.

10
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,449
Eat your fucking vegetables.

11

{\an8}<i>Holding a record

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Stuart Long.</i>

15
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:01,974
Got a future, brother.

16
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,773
You have to do better than that.

17
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,277
We love you, Stu.

18
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,153
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

19
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,947
You like blonds now, huh?

20
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,949
- She's sweet. She's sweet.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,117
Enjoy it now, kid.

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,661
You're almost past your prime. It happens.

23
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,204
You're lucky I don't punch you.

24
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,081
Take that, and give it to him.

25
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,708
I'm gonna punch you in the mouth.

26
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,750
All right, good.

27
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,002
Come on, come on.

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,049
Will you come on?

29
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,467
Keep your hands up.

30
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,846
Keep your guard up.

31
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,472
I don't care he's the better boxer.

32
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,433
You gotta be the better actor.

33
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,350
I know.

34
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,146
I love this, man.

35
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,106
It's what I do.

36
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,163
Hey.

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,042
Well, that's just great.

38
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,504
I won. I got some dough. What you want?

39
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,214
A toaster.

40
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,673
I'll get you a toaster.

41
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,433
If you put half the effort
into a regular job

42
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,560
that you put into beating ass,

43
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,687
you'd be a manager one day.

44
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,773
Why dress us as astronauts for Halloween

45
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,691
if you didn't want us
to shoot for the moon?

46
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,319
That's when I had two of you to bet on.

47
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,948
Where is this clown?

48
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,200
Hey, tell her it's nothing.

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,284
Not quite.

50
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,454
You have a serious infection
of the bone in your jaw,

51
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,707
as well as extremely high
inflammation markers in your blood.

52
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,377
Same thing as last time.
Your colleague gave me antibiotics.

53
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,378
Did the trick, right?

54
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,381
After your last three fights,
you've developed fevers and infections.

55
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,258
That's not a normal response to injury.

56
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,592
What does that mean?

57
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,845
Medically speaking,
we'd need further testing

58
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,013
to determine the source of the problem,

59
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,308
but metaphorically, seems like
your body is telling you not to fight.

60
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,686
Meta... Fuck that. What?

61
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,399
The decision is yours,
but I must make you aware

62
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,318
that the complications
could be life-threatening.

63
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,658
You set this up, didn't you?

64
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,077
She tell you to say that?

65
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,081
- Could you give us a minute?
- We got the Keystone Kops here.

66
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,875
Don't listen to this loser.

67
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,794
Shit, he trying
to run up the bill on you, Mama.

68
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,630
Damn you
for being so careless with your life.

69
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,341
Careless?
I'm fighting for it. And yours too.

70
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,261
I put food on the table.
Your deadbeat husband don't.

71
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,555
Grief ain't a disability. I looked it up.

72
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,433
What you think, you'll get to be a pro?

73
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,395
Honey, you're the age
most guys are when they pack it in.

74
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,689
You're still scrapping for a sponsor.

75
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,274
Look me in the eyes and tell me

76
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,652
that some plastic trophy
is worth more than your life.

77
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,446
You only got yourself to blame.

78
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,741
Making a fuss over
all them damn participation ribbons.

79
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,327
You set a low bar.
What you expect from your son?

80
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,537
That this one don't fucking die.

81
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,793
I ain't that lucky.

82
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,724
I heard them oil rigs went up pay good.

83
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,102
I ain't doing no blue-collar bullshit.

84
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,357
Well, honey, what else is there?

85
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>Dad caught me playing in your room.</i>

86
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,886
Got a heck of a hiding for it.

87
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,900
Sometimes I thought
I hated you for being so good.

88
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,236
Making me look bad.

89
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,825
<i>Dad probably wonders why
he gotta keep a piece of shit like me.</i>

90
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:40,878
You want it?

91
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:45,799
Come get it.

92
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,120
What, you think I missed?

93
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,511
I never miss.

94
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,525
Oh, shit.

95
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,114
Evening, officers.

96
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,700
Everything all right here?

97
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,911
Just paying my respects.

98
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
You Bill's son?

99
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,418
Wow, all these years gone,
he's still making me look bad, huh?

100
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,884
Chip off the old block, huh?

101
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,988
Good to see you, Stu.

102
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,283
Until we meet again, prick.

103
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:38,871
Hey, Mama.

104
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,125
Resisting arrest?

105
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,128
I challenged the officer's judgment.
It was a stimulating exchange.

106
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,754
I made him a better cop.

107
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,299
- Get in the car.
- If they told you why, you'd pat my back.

108
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,010
Ain't that the story of your life?
Being out of context.

109
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,845
I got some good news for you.

110
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,020
- I figured it out.
- Yeah?

111
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,688
Seventh time's a charm?

112
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,149
No, I figured out what I'm gonna do.

113
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,651
- I'm gonna be an actor.
- Oh, God.

114
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,904
Think about it.
Nothing ever made more sense.

115
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,780
I mean, I was born to perform.

116
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,824
It just took some time to find my stage.

117
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,784
Yeah? Where's that at?

118
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,785
Hollywood.

119
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,872
You ain't been west of Missoula.

120
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,874
You got a map, I'm gonna make it there.

121
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,669
You don't belong with L.A. folks.

122
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,715
They're a bunch of carpetbaggers.
Communist fucking fascist hippies.

123
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,801
I ain't trying to belong.
I'm trying to stand out.

124
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,678
Wait till you see me saving the world,

125
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,764
shooting bad guys,
kissing them girls in pearls.

126
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,516
Probably all three at once.

127
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,604
Isn't it a little late
to, you know, try that?

128
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,398
They gonna say "late,"
they gonna say "great."

129
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,983
And I ain't even gonna be dead yet.

130
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,947
Well?

131
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,573
You gonna look your father up?

132
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,784
- Am I gonna look my father up?
- Yeah.

133
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,701
Fuck Bill.

134
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,038
Come on, let's go.

135
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,629
Yeah, fuck Bill.

136
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,102
You throwback mother...

137
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,652
I'm trying to do
a public service, asshole.

138
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,238
Learn how to drive, idiot.

139
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,994
<i>Hello. Can I get the vehicle number?</i>

140
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:46,957
Yeah, vehicle number,
jerk-off-kilo-limp-dick-ten.

141
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,916
<i>How's his driving?</i>

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,751
I'll tell you how's his fucking driving.

143
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,880
His parents must be cousins.
He's driving like a fucking half-wit.

144
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,715
Be ahead hiring a crash test dummy...

145
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,884
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

146
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,093
Son of a bitch.

147
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,188
Somebody gotta find a better way
to rat these retards out, you know?

148
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,401
Make a decent driver crash
just for trying to do the right thing.

149
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,350
<i>Let's just start with a week.</i>

150
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,187
That's $182. If you book a month out,
you save 20 percent.

151
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,730
I don't need a month to make it.

152
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,524
You and everybody else in this town.

153
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,858
You got some advice?

154
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,944
I'm still trying to be discovered.

155
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,488
I hit it big, I'll take you with me.

156
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,948
All the way to the top.

157
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,575
Payment's due Monday.

158
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,663
- Don't sell yourself short.
- Oh, I won't.

159
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,374
I'll see you Monday.

160
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,753
Oh, shit.

161
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:16,922
Oh, yeah.

162
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,634
Hello? Yeah, this is Mr. Long.
Hold all my calls.

163
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,635
Really?

164
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,429
I'll have to think about that.

165
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,723
Hollywood, baby. Hollywood.

166
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,725
Hot damn, you in Hollywood, kid.

167
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,854
What did he say?

168
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:32,938
I made it.

169
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,606
Oh, shit.

170
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,484
See what channel
I'm gonna be on every night.

171
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,111
Every night.

172
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,279
Oh, yeah.

173
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,280
The fuck?

174
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:48,120
Ain't no antenna on here.
$182 for this shit. It better be working.

175
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,080
Yeah, I got a problem.
The TV ain't working.

176
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,208
Tomorrow? I paid $182.
I need a goddamn TV.

177
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,587
Shit. You gotta be kidding me.

178
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,465
Better get her big ass up here
and fix this shit.

179
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,223
I made it.

180
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,870
"Gas station attendant.
Christmas tree lot."

181
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,581
I was voted Santa's favorite elf.

182
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,832
Nice.

183
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,668
"Amateur boxer. Record 15 and two.

184
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,631
1985 Gold Gloves Middleweight
titleholder for the state."

185
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,341
I won that one by knockout.

186
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,967
So...

187
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,428
what brings you here?

188
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:51,600
Hung up the gloves. I thought I'd cash in
on my face, instead of my fists.

189
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,435
Get more mileage out of that.

190
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,355
No better place
to be discovered than the supermarket.

191
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,482
Even Hollywood big shots gotta buy beans.

192
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,608
Yeah.

193
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,360
You wanna be an actor.

194
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,571
It's not like anyone aspires
to work at a supermarket.

195
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,198
Unless they do, and that's cool.

196
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,408
They're probably happier in the long run.

197
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,118
Yeah.

198
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,413
What skills do you possess
that would make you suited for this job?

199
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm real charming. Ask my mama.

200
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,668
I'll bet.

201
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,838
- I might have something for you.
- Yeah.

202
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,477
Here you go.
Hey, did I see you in a television series?

203
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,400
- You got any family in the film industry?
- No, I don't.

204
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,237
- You do movies?
- No.

205
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,576
You don't work
in the entertainment industry?

206
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,493
No, man.

207
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,790
Sir. Let me wrap it up for you.

208
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,459
Wanna get right to it, huh?

209
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,464
- You got friends in the film industry?
- Nah.

210
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,936
You're not exactly what we're looking for.

211
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,146
I've heard that before.

212
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,898
Trying to be a human billboard.

213
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,066
Sign spinner. You know the gig.

214
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,527
Gave the job to some other little punk.

215
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,864
I set up on the other side of the city.
I got ten times the customers he did.

216
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,412
All right, well...

217
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,542
If you're willing to prove yourself,
I'm open to persuasion.

218
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,169
Yeah. What do I got to do?

219
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,635
How badly you want it?

220
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,477
Okay.

221
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,192
- How about I put your lights out?
- Okay...

222
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,069
Then you tell me
if you see a fucking star.

223
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,238
Okay, not necessary. Not necessary.

224
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,366
Okay.

225
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,535
- I'm taking my picture.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,082
Send in the next person, please?

227
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,464
Jesus...

228
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,592
Claire, we need a new camera.

229
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,446
Best kind of date, huh?

230
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:55,617
Big bedroom eyes, keeps her mouth shut.

231
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,745
I like a woman
who ain't afraid to say who she is.

232
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,165
Who do you want me to be?

233
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,086
I want a menu, I go to the restaurant.

234
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:14,386
Sometimes I need help
getting out of character.

235
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,598
Be right back.

236
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,729
Hell, she'd fuck that elk
if it had a dick and a dollar.

237
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:35,616
This town wants me to think that my job's
at the mercy of some scumbag,

238
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,952
and my dick's at the mercy
of some slut's low standards?

239
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,961
A real man earns a win
on his own damn merits.

240
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,756
Shit.

241
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,924
Shit.

242
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:52,841
All right.

243
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,808
- Tell me about the pork.
- That pork's on sale.

244
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,685
Why's that now?

245
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,103
Why you think?

246
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,272
Pig was ugly, or the meat gone old.

247
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,484
They don't tell me this shit, sir.
My job is to sell what's on the sign.

248
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,988
I'll take two racks of lamb.

249
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,658
Yeah.

250
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,548
What can I get for you, miss?

251
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,425
Nothing, thank you.

252
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,593
I got beef.

253
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,720
I can see that.

254
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,014
I'll have fish tonight.

255
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,892
- Don't let me change your mind.
- You didn't.

256
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,896
You can find a fish in a can,
or you can let me take you to dinner.

257
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,357
I don't like being told my choices.

258
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,359
How about I take you fishing,
we compromise?

259
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:53,902
No, thanks.

260
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,153
I didn't catch your name.

261
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,489
Not much of a fisherman then, are you?

262
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:00,868
Hey.

263
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,288
- Stuart, a word.
- I gotta go help a lady out.

264
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,623
People don't run from help
if they want it.

265
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,251
Stalking customers is a fire able offense.

266
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,794
They used to call it romance.

267
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,713
Meat sales are down 20 percent.

268
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,798
You come in here with your face fucked up.

269
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,301
Looks like you done battle
with the cow trying to kill it.

270
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,637
- They might prefer that to the truth.
- Meat room. Till this shit clears up.

271
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,639
Get a Fish Department in here.

272
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,858
- Shit.
- Life is short, Stu.

274
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,777
Too short to be a dick or deal with one.
What you trying to say?

275
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,113
I'm not trying, I'm saying.

276
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,741
If you watched the love of your life
slip through your hands

277
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,702
because there ain't a Fish Department,
you'd be in a dick mood too.

278
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:48,582
If she's the dime piece
I suspect you're after,

279
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,459
I saw her leave this here.

280
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,377
I bet my bonus she'll be there.

281
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,677
You don't get that bonus, you let me know.

282
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,095
I'll take care of it.

283
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,598
- Come here. Come here.
- Oh, no, no, no.

284
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,766
Come here.

285
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,184
Come here.

286
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,485
Oh, yeah. Shit.

287
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,375
Hey. Hey.

288
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,085
Remember me?

289
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,046
Oh, fuck off, Father.

290
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:49,977
Brethren.

291
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,064
Let us acknowledge our sins,

292
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,610
and so prepare ourselves
to celebrate the sacred mysteries.

293
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:02,489
I confess to Almighty God,
and to you, my brothers and sisters,

294
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,825
that I have greatly sinned.

295
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,743
In my thoughts and in my words.

296
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,203
In what I have done.

297
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,330
- In what I have failed to do.
- ...failed to do.

298
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,957
I don't know about this one.

299
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,713
Through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

300
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,423
That's a bit dramatic.

301
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,175
- Therefore...
- Jesus.

302
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,928
May Almighty God have mercy on us,

303
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,180
forgive us our sins

304
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,891
and bring us to everlasting life.

305
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,601
Amen.

306
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,275
Want help, you should've thought of that.

307
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,445
Son.

308
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,114
You can't fool God.

309
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,283
Maybe no one's done it good enough.

310
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,410
Let us pray.

311
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,206
Cool to sit here?

312
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,123
Yeah.

313
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:58,921
Ham.

314
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,381
Oh, that's beef. I'd know.

315
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,385
No, my name. My name's Ham.

316
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:06,929
Like a pig?

317
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,640
Yeah, nigga, like a pig.

318
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,892
That's your real name?

319
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,393
Yeah.

320
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,772
That's a biblical name. That's Noah's kid.

321
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,066
You'd think
he'd have enough pork on board that ship.

322
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,318
You must be new here.

323
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,907
Why, I look out of place?
You look in the mirror lately?

324
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,244
I thought your people
was the God-fearing folk, brother.

325
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,956
Ain't a lot of them Catholic,
but there's just different denominations.

326
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,042
A brother was one of the greats.
Augustine of Hippo.

327
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,671
Well, let me guess. He was on board too.

328
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,132
I...

329
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:47,845
I need your help.

330
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,392
I'm looking for the girl who left this.
Know her?

331
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:54,935
Of course you are.

332
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,479
- Why you say that?
- She real good at spreading the word.

333
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,524
Puts all us priest prospects to shame.
Carmen's her name.

334
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,485
She's about as Catholic
as the cross itself.

335
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,113
We're taking sign-ups
for volunteer positions.

336
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,365
No better way to assimilate.

337
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,616
God ain't got time for me,

338
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,994
I ain't got time for him,
especially between auditions.

339
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,371
Put me down for hospital visits.

340
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,373
Shame we can't all be as generous as Ham.

341
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,420
Hey.

342
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,464
Sudden change of heart, huh?

343
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,049
Hell, yeah.

344
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,760
We don't need security.

345
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,930
We don't know what we need till
it hits us in the face or steals our shit.

346
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:32,973
Hey.

347
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,683
- Hi, Ham. Jacob.
- Hey.

348
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,809
Stuart.

349
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,436
Hi.

350
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,605
You wanna do this with an audience?

351
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,316
How'd you know my name?

352
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,319
You wear a name tag at work.
How did you find me?

353
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,279
I asked God to show me the way.

354
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,991
He took me down Santa Monica,
left at the light into this lot.

355
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:51,909
What do you know?

356
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,493
What are you hoping to accomplish?

357
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:57,539
Hope ain't a tactic. I come
to find the light. I'm looking at it.

358
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,166
This tactic work for you?

359
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,835
Stalking your prey
and smothering them with cheese?

360
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,630
Most things taste good like that.
You like nachos?

361
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,841
- Because I'm Mexican?
- Is that right? I wouldn't know.

362
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,635
I can't see, you're so bright.

363
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,930
You like that one, huh?

364
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,141
- I have to teach.
- I got a lot to learn.

365
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,060
At Sunday School. For kids.

366
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:21,063
I'm an actor. I can be whatever you need.

367
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,525
You don't take "no" for an answer.

368
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,318
I don't need a "yes" to know I'm right.

369
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,028
What do you think you're right about?

370
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,616
You wanna let me take you fishing,
but you're scared.

371
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,911
I made a living reading fear
in people's eyes. I was a boxer.

372
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:40,082
- What am I scared of?
- Getting knocked off your feet.

373
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,876
Might take 12 rounds to get them
on their back, but I'm patient.

374
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,253
Get me on my back?

375
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,714
I'm a Catholic. No sex before marriage.

376
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,843
Ain't that what confession's for?

377
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,638
I thought that'd be the case.
Let's not waste either of our times.

378
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,099
I'd wait 40 years in the desert for you.

379
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,729
You can start with an hour in church.

380
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,523
I'll be there.

381
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,486
I'll be there.

382
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,491
Hey, Mama.

383
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,784
I got my break.

384
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,328
<i>Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.</i>

385
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,747
Watch your soap and you'll see me.

386
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,958
I can't wait to tell the girls.

387
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:25,711
Love you.

388
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,046
<i>I'll remember that.</i>

389
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,592
<i>Oh, Jack.</i>

390
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,804
<i>I will get you for this
if it's the last thing I ever do.</i>

391
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,393
<i>Are you using paper towels?</i>

392
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,604
<i>No, no, no.</i>

393
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,858
<i>Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Stop throwing cash in the trash.</i>

394
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,944
<i>And get yourself a Marvelous Mop.</i>

395
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,364
<i>These things are so cool.
They're double-action.</i>

396
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,241
<i>Quick retracting.</i>

397
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,329
<i>Clean up the mess so fast,</i>

398
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,247
<i>your missus will never know what happened.</i>

399
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:05,000
<i>Get yourself a Marvelous Mop.</i>

400
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,755
I miss you, little buddy.

401
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,091
Happy birthday.

402
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,596
Look at you now.

403
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,515
Look at me now.

404
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,268
Both amongst the stars, huh?

405
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,243
<i>Pull over.</i>

406
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,371
- Oh, shit.
<i>- Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

407
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,177
Step out, hands where I can see them.

408
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,349
That what it feels like to be God,
knowing you hold all cards,

409
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,977
it don't matter if it's fair
how you decide to play them?

410
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,606
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands where I can see them.

411
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:55,360
What the fuck happens to a kid,
make him wanna be a cop?

412
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:57,779
Hey, hands.

413
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:58,989
Hands!

414
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,949
I'm trying to...

415
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,034
Wallet, my ass.

416
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,243
Get out of the car.

417
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,505
Hi.

418
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:15,422
Good morning.

419
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,306
Oh, fuck.

420
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,351
You're late.

421
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:33,148
And you overstayed your welcome.
I bet even God don't like a kiss-ass.

422
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,137
Excuse me, sir.

423
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:05,973
Yeah?

424
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,517
Does Bill know
you're fussing with his truck?

425
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,602
I'm his son. Just borrowing it.

426
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,317
<i>Bill, do you copy?</i>

427
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,823
- This is Bill.
- <i>There's a guy in your truck with a knife.</i>

428
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,742
<i>Think I need a knife to fuck you up?</i>

429
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:30,873
Bill can't find his crack in his ass,
much less keep track of his shit.

430
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,166
I'm doing him a service,
teaching him a lesson.

431
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,087
I'm sorry, John.
My son has issues with boundaries.

432
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,048
That's the new way to say "handicapped."
He means "retard."

433
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,593
He's playing with a full deck,
just a bad one.

434
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,594
Bill knows his cards.

435
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,971
- He got the gambling bug.
- I'll take it from here.

436
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:49,224
He's not out in five minutes,
I'm calling the cops on both of you.

437
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:53,103
- Hi, how you been?
- Give me the keys. I got an audition.

438
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,397
- I'm gonna be late.
- Audition?

439
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,858
- For what?
- Movie. None of your business.

440
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,152
You're trying to steal my truck
to get there.

441
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,655
Once I get my check from the supermarket,
I'll spring my ride and give yours back.

442
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,534
It's a few months' worth of cleanups
on Aisle 4 to pay off a DUI impound.

443
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,535
That is the offense?

444
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,495
If you sent half
of what you spend on whiskey

445
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,289
to your wife, you might have a marriage.

446
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:17,544
I appreciate your concern,
but this is not my moment, son.

447
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,716
You know, I could've got you in here.
Good pay, benefits, a little dignity.

448
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,010
They hire inbreds.
I could run this shit, I want to.

449
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,346
Think you gonna be the next John Wayne?

450
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,016
Damn right. You had a chance
to make something of yourself out west.

451
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,185
All you got is a bigger gut,
beard, and bald spot.

452
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,688
This is not the fucking gold rush.
Some of us just trying to survive.

453
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,107
Yeah, every man, woman,
and child for themselves, right?

454
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,735
Right. End of the day, that's all you got.

455
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,154
Everyone else is just a disappointment.

456
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,741
Wrap it up.

457
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,578
I'm trying to be an exception.

458
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,498
We need more of those here.

459
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:01,755
All right, call the boys. Stuart here
is gonna reinvent the "Jailhouse Rock."

460
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,389
Good to see you, Bill.

461
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,598
You look like shit.

462
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,989
That's it for this Sunday. God bless.

463
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,366
- Bye, Miss Carmen.
- Bye.

464
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:32,369
Hey.

465
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,373
How's the other guy?

466
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,292
Wasn't working
with as good a deck to start.

467
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,296
There's no future for you here.
Or us. I...

468
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,964
Your boss would beg to differ.

469
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,508
You sniffing around my immigration status?

470
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,886
I mean Jesus.
He asked for the most fucked up.

471
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:49,887
You're looking at it.

472
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,849
- He asked for the tired and the poor.
- I'm an out-of-work actor.

473
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,351
Cheap cologne cannot cleanse you
from the ugliness of sin.

474
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,269
Look.

475
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,189
I know I'm not what you're used to.

476
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:02,566
Not what you deserve either.

477
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,985
I'm gonna be better than both.

478
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:12,075
I'm all my parents have to be proud of.
I can't date someone who isn't...

479
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:14,870
baptized.

480
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:18,457
I thought you was gonna say Hispanic.
Where's the water? I'll do it now.

481
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,250
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

482
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,253
I'll do it right now.

483
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,471
The church joyfully welcomes
those who will be received

484
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,348
into the Order of Catechumens.

485
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,141
In the months to come,

486
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:39,728
they will be preparing their initiation
into Christian faith

487
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,730
by baptism, confirmation,

488
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,106
and Eucharist.

489
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,777
Stuart Long, what does
this period of formation offer you?

490
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,238
Hard to say, Father.

491
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,823
If I had to guess,
something beyond my wildest dreams.

492
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:55,410
Let us all pray that in due time,
Stuart may be found worthy

493
00:33:55,494 --> 00:34:00,332
to receive the baptism of new birth,
the renewal in the Holy Spirit,

494
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,209
and to complete his initiation

495
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,838
through the sacraments
of confirmation and Eucharist.

496
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,215
Hallelujah.

497
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,554
I'd like to invite a friend
to sing with me.

498
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,518
God gave you the talent.
It's a sin not to use it.

499
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,812
- Give her a round of applause.
- Go.

500
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:22,813
- Come on.
- Yeah.

501
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,985
- Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.
- What song?

502
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,864
Damn, you smell good.
Hey, Johnny Cash, "Jackson."

503
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,909
Read the words off the television.

504
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:25,918
Oh, yeah.

505
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,054
Yeah.

506
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:45,312
For example, I am gonna give up chocolate.

507
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,940
You should protest. She needs sweetening.

508
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,150
Yeah, pick something else.

509
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,987
- Well, what are you gonna give up, Stu?
- Me?

510
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,369
Maybe you guys,
so I can sleep in on Sundays.

511
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,286
No.

512
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,080
All right, all right.

513
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,291
Alcohol.

514
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,502
Hey, that's not fair.

515
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:11,046
You pick something good
that you'll miss, to make it count.

516
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,422
I like this kid.

517
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,718
Like porn. That's what my dad gave up.

518
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,391
Well, you tell him,
if he wants to make it count,

519
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,309
tell your mama to give up sex.

520
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,562
- He said S-E-X.
- That's what porn is.

521
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,438
- Stu.
- Well, he said "porn."

522
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,566
Kids, do you wanna read from...?

523
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,150
- It's the same thing.
- No.

524
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:33,902
Get your Bibles out, please.

525
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:39,449
God wants us to give things up,
he ought to stop taking from us too.

526
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,910
He killed my little brother Stephen
when he was 6.

527
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,121
Took a nap, never woke up.

528
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,873
How you square that one, huh?

529
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,959
We can't understand
why God does what he does.

530
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,212
That's why I liked to box.
How it went was up to me.

531
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,631
I can't accept
when I ain't got no say in shit.

532
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,845
Our world teaches us that there's comfort
in knowledge and fear in the unknown.

533
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,515
What if the unknown was greater
than we could imagine?

534
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,726
I bet it could be.

535
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:11,815
I believe in you.

536
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,779
<i>Confession.</i>

537
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:22,117
Acknowledging our sins
in word, action, and omission,

538
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,661
and resolving to not sin again.

539
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:28,665
For this, we do penance,
and are granted forgiveness.

540
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,502
Like doing laundry.
That's a Sunday thing too.

541
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,880
Here I thought it'd be complicated.

542
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,466
Well... I'm afraid it's not that simple.

543
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,761
The essential part of penance

544
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,055
is a firm and true repentance,

545
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,806
motivated by faith,

546
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,600
and the love of God.

547
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,019
This is called perfect contrition.

548
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,606
Imperfect contrition arises
from a less pure motive,

549
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,525
such as common decency,

550
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:55,859
or fear of hell.

551
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,403
Our whole lives,
we're taught to be good, avoid bad.

552
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:02,366
Eat your dinner, or you don't get dessert.
Share your toys, or you get timeout.

553
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,785
You're trying to undo years of wiring.

554
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,788
That's a good observation, Stuart.

555
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,373
Take heart.

556
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,751
God is the ultimate programmer.

557
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,922
I leave you with this task:

558
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,550
Consider the changes you need to make

559
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:23,428
in order to receive
more abundant graces to sin no more.

560
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,434
Cool.

561
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:33,856
<i>Hello?</i>

562
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,400
How come
you ain't teach me how to tie a tie?

563
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:38,944
Where'd you get a tie?

564
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,320
My court appearance.

565
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,823
<i>Your dad never did like dressing up.</i>

566
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,450
Always said he wanted me to shine.

567
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:49,079
Like a dirt bag on my arm
was the only way to make me pretty.

568
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,998
Well, Dad is a fucking asshole.

569
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,709
<i>What you putting on a tie for?</i>

570
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:54,626
Church.

571
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,253
<i>What?</i>

572
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,213
I'm getting baptized.

573
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:00,799
Why would you do that?

574
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,593
It means something to my girl.

575
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,930
I remember feeling like that
about your dad.

576
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,975
Why? You wanna be reborn,
because you fucked up so bad marrying him?

577
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,477
Like I'd do anything to please him,

578
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,771
when he could be pleased.

579
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,149
Gonna help me with this thing or what?

580
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,610
I keep tying the damn thing into a knot.

581
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,653
Mama, I need your help.

582
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:23,799
Hey.

583
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,561
What's everybody waiting for?

584
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,105
Let's pray.

585
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,982
I'll do it.

586
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,275
It'd be my pleasure.

587
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:43,902
I've been practicing.

588
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,335
Amen.

589
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:04,548
You know, Stuart,

590
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:06,717
in my country,

591
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,595
men crawl on their hands and knees

592
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:13,182
to the statue <i>a la santísima Virgen María.</i>

593
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,728
I expect no less devotion to my daughter.

594
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,819
It's a good thing I got a carpet, huh?

595
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,286
You like that one?

596
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,124
You want <i>cerveza?</i>

597
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:44,546
No, I don't drink. I was just wondering...
If you drink, I can get it. But I don't...

598
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,131
I don't drink.

599
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:55,265
I've never done this before.
I just rattle off the ways I fucked up?

600
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,351
That is correct.

601
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,229
Easier to list the things I done right,
take up less of your time.

602
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,272
Take as long as you need.

603
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,858
There's a line out there.
They'll know how much I fucked up.

604
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,528
Unless you whisper,
they'll know regardless.

605
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:11,990
- You know who you're talking to?
- I have an inkling, yes.

606
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:15,494
Does hearing other folks' shit make you
feel less shitty about your own shit?

607
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:17,829
Don't pretend like you don't got some.

608
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,999
It is for God alone to judge.

609
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:25,087
I am merely a vessel
to assist man in unburdening himself

610
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,799
of all that may separate him
from the most direct path

611
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,300
to Almighty Father.

612
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,010
I'm keeping God in a job.

613
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,471
He cuts you a check,
your ass better thank me.

614
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:45,274
Last thing I need
is another father to fail for.

615
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:02,165
You're getting into the fine print
on this way of living, pal.

616
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,793
What you think you know?

617
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:09,298
I know you got a long,
weary road ahead, with the headlights dim.

618
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,092
You have to learn the hard way
how to live in light.

619
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:15,179
Why don't you find someone else
who wants to hear your shit?

620
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,388
No one wants to.

621
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,556
No shit.

622
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:19,057
Take a hint.

623
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:25,314
In my experience, the toughest fights
are the only ones worth walking into.

624
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,650
You bring a tough guy to his knees,

625
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,862
the first few times he feels shame.

626
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,448
Rage.

627
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,160
Eventually, relief.

628
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,080
Wanna have a big dick contest, bud?

629
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:44,833
I know how big your dick is, son.

630
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,422
I'd fuck you up
if you weren't fucked up already.

631
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:51,507
Yeah.

632
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,509
Someone beat you to it.

633
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,766
Life's gonna give you
a gutful of reasons to be angry, kid.

634
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,978
You only need one to be grateful.

635
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,733
That's the most fucked-up ratio

636
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:12,277
since the number
of marshmallows in Lucky Charms.

637
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,739
You ain't owed nothing.

638
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,117
But you're getting a chance.

639
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:23,956
Don't go driving now.

640
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,838
The fuck was he drinking?

641
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:32,673
Water.

642
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,074
Oh, shit.

643
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,685
Sir?

644
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,439
Can you hear me?

645
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,484
Can you hear me?

646
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,251
Behold thy mother.

647
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,097
You must listen to me.

648
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,934
You will not die for nothing.

649
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,106
Oh, you tell your son...

650
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:18,028
he wants to show me hell,
I ain't afraid of a little fire.

651
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,823
He died for you.

652
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:25,577
For Stephen.

653
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:20,424
There was significant trauma to the head,
and vital organs. He's in a coma.

654
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,426
If there's anyone
you'd like to see him again,

655
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,428
I suggest you arrange that now.

656
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,345
I...

657
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,390
already lost one kid.

658
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:32,895
They say lightning
don't strike the same place twice.

659
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:35,772
The nurse can recommend a grief counselor.

660
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,514
- God bless.
- Bye, Miss Carmen.

661
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:09,890
- Bye.
- See you next Sunday.

662
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:45,133
You got some kind of spell in there
gonna bring him back?

663
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,595
It's just a prayer
for Mary's intercession.

664
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:53,392
She don't give a good goddamn
about a real mother's son.

665
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,771
You should get some rest.

666
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,524
I could stay with him.

667
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:06,947
His eyes are moving.

668
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,366
What? Doctor!

669
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,578
Stuart, baby.

670
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,413
Can you hear me?

671
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:32,890
Can you squeeze my hand?

672
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,518
He's starting to come out of it.

673
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,624
Damn thing ate my dollar.

674
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:04,254
As if folks in here ain't paid enough,
you gotta bleed their pockets too.

675
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,634
- Ain't you brought your own beverage?
- Son of a...

676
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,428
- Where you going?
- What's it to you?

677
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:13,597
Your mother told me you were dying.
What the fuck?

678
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:15,807
You sound disappointed.

679
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:19,269
Well, I took off work to be here.
You seem all right.

680
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:21,063
Wait up, Stu.

681
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:24,733
I forgot to give you this.

682
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,362
St. Joseph. For the operation.

683
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:30,405
Who's this?

684
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:31,990
Who's asking?

685
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:32,908
Stu's dad.

686
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,995
I'm Carmen, Stuart's girlfriend.

687
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,540
She know you're an atheist?

688
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,377
He's baptized.

689
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:49,466
He ain't dead.
He can speak for himself. Is that true?

690
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:52,928
Yeah.

691
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,602
- You know St. Stephen?
- Of course.

692
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,938
Patron saint of coffin makers.

693
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,733
There's pictures of him
with a big pile of rocks on his head.

694
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,151
Who'd have thought,

695
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:10,696
you give your boy a nice Christian name,

696
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,615
in a world full of fruits and nuts,

697
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,993
you'd sentence him
to live right on up to it?

698
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:17,744
Or down, as it were.

699
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:19,746
Into the ground.

700
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,456
That ain't how names work.

701
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:27,212
Let me drive you home, Mr. Long.

702
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,673
Hey, you got yourself a worrier.

703
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:35,053
God will put me where he wants me to be.

704
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:37,181
What's it to you
if I'm in hell or Hermosillo?

705
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,098
"Sillo."

706
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:39,725
Can we go?

707
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:08,712
<i>You recall the guy who was drinking
by me, last time I was here?</i>

708
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:12,758
I haven't seen him before or since.
He was probably just passing through.

709
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,858
<i>You ain't owed nothing,
but you're getting a chance.</i>

710
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:33,862
<i>Don't go driving now.</i>

711
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,710
I thought I could help.

712
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:53,048
Answer your question, you know.

713
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:57,010
Yeah? What you think I'm wondering?

714
00:52:58,345 --> 00:52:59,179
"Why me?

715
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,725
Why did God make or allow this to happen?"

716
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,311
He doesn't promise
your stories will make sense,

717
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:09,648
but he does promise
they'll find their greater purpose.

718
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:10,858
If we're patient.

719
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:11,775
Patient?

720
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,069
You an expert on that.

721
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,954
What's going on with you?

722
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,582
Most things get squished on a road,
end up stuffed on a wall.

723
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:28,250
I'm doing pretty good, considering.

724
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,919
I know, but I'm concerned.

725
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:33,046
I got a lot on my mind, all right?

726
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,384
Let me help you take it off.

727
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,018
Don't do this.

728
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:49,521
I know what I'm doing.

729
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:00,199
<i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

730
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,660
It's been six weeks
since my last confession.

731
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:04,745
I can't...

732
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:08,874
I can't give you details on account
of there's a conflict of interest.

733
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,628
The sacrament of confession is inviolable.

734
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,088
I cannot, under pain of excommunication,

735
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,091
reveal or act on
whatever it is you confess to me.

736
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:23,055
I did something I ain't supposed to do.

737
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,018
Something I been thinking about,
praying I could get to happen for months.

738
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,480
Something I wanted
more than anything else in this world.

739
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:35,609
Then I had it, and all I could do
was think about disappointing God.

740
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:36,777
This is good news.

741
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:40,405
It is
in discovering the greatness of God's love

742
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:44,409
that our heart is shaken
by the horror and weight of sin.

743
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:48,413
No, this ain't about fucking up.
It's about being fucked with.

744
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,752
Another term for that is "grace."

745
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,212
God's grace.

746
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,548
It appears you are the recipient.

747
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,675
What's he expecting me
to do with his grace?

748
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,176
You could start by...

749
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,220
cleaning up your language.

750
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,098
Don't be a wise-ass, Father.
Answer the question.

751
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,310
He expects you
to spread his word,

752
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,687
advance his kingdom.

753
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,606
He ain't making house calls asking that.

754
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:20,779
He must have made a mistake.

755
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:21,697
No.

756
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,325
God doesn't make mistakes.

757
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:34,209
Father G thinks maybe I could serve God.
You believe that shit?

758
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:36,920
Like an altar boy?

759
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,798
I've been thinking that
since the day I met you.

760
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,216
- You have?
- No.

761
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:46,972
But I'm sure he had good reason.

762
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,477
My whole life,
I felt like I shouldn't be here.

763
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,897
That my brother Stephen should instead.

764
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,358
But after that night, I felt different.

765
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:01,570
Like I might be good
for something after all.

766
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,241
Perhaps the world needs
another Rhinestone Cowboy.

767
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,166
I think
God saw something in you worth saving.

768
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:18,003
But it's up to you
to decide what you've got to offer.

769
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,359
I thought it'd make sense
being back here to do this.

770
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,987
It's the place
you told me you believed in me.

771
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,205
I'm gonna be a priest.

772
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:41,670
What do you mean?

773
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:46,175
It's five words.
I've practiced them a hundred times.

774
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:47,509
What part is unclear?

775
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:50,053
Every part.

776
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,056
You're gonna be a priest?

777
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,725
Stop saying it like that.

778
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,602
Like what? Like it's insane?

779
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,937
So was the idea
of the man upstairs pulling strings,

780
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,148
but you bought that like a pair of shoes.

781
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:05,527
God saved me and forgave me
to show me that there's a reason I'm here.

782
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,738
We need to have your head examined.

783
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:08,989
Trust me, Carmen.

784
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:12,743
I tried every way to talk myself
out of it, but the truth is...

785
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:15,078
I ain't never been more clear.

786
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,250
Have you considered all this entails?

787
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,629
Abstaining from booze and beatings,
not to mention sex?

788
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:26,673
- You showed me I could do it.
- No, I showed you, you could wait.

789
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:29,343
A vow of celibacy means never again.
Then you die.

790
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,845
There's more to life than sex.
I can feel it.

791
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:33,263
Most people know that.

792
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:37,351
Only most people find
that other meaning in a passion,

793
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,727
or people,

794
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,103
or a family.

795
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,814
- You're setting yourself up for failure.
- No.

796
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,650
I been testing myself.

797
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:48,820
If God's willing to forgive me,
I got to be willing to forgive others.

798
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:51,281
Whoever hit me,
I wanted their dicks on a stick.

799
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:53,742
But with God's help, I've forgiven them.

800
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:56,411
And you think the absence
of the instinct to dismember someone

801
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,747
qualifies you for priesthood?

802
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,124
- You're delusional.
- Know what it takes to win a fight?

803
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:05,254
You gotta turn off the animal brain,
use logic, humility, good judgment.

804
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:08,632
That's the struggle of man.
I can do it. I can help.

805
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:13,095
You got near death and found God.

806
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,264
That's great, Stu, but...

807
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,684
this is a little extreme.

808
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,561
No, I didn't find him, Carmen.

809
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:21,979
I felt him.

810
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,315
I felt her. Mary.
Well, that don't sound...

811
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:28,944
Look, the feeling she gave me,
I can't even explain it.

812
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,781
For the first time in my life,
I knew I could stop fighting.

813
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,158
I knew I was safe and loved.

814
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,590
I disgraced myself before God,

815
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,759
so that
you could have another flight of fancy.

816
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:54,511
I know you're mad. Hit me if you want.

817
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,763
- It'll make you feel better.
- I don't wanna hit you.

818
00:59:58,348 --> 00:59:59,683
I wanna marry you.

819
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,395
I thought
that's what you brought me here for.

820
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:07,858
I can't do that.

821
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:10,736
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,447
Carmen.

823
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,489
Car...

824
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,450
Damn.

825
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,834
Your son is about to make a huge mistake.

826
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:27,920
He don't usually warn no one,

827
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,214
so I guess that's progress.

828
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:33,050
You talked him out of boxing, right?

829
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:33,967
Hey, Mama.

830
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,055
Is someone gonna tell me what's going on?

831
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,390
I was gonna find a better time.

832
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,393
- You're doing a porno?
- No, God, no.

833
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,020
No, I'm gonna be a priest.

834
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:49,399
- For Halloween?
- No, not for fucking Halloween. For real.

835
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,236
Oh, Stu.

836
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,446
You can't be serious.

837
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,073
This is your fault.

838
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:58,867
You'd think I said
I wanted to be a serial killer.

839
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,829
My son don't do half measures.
He's a dog with a goddamn bone.

840
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:06,834
If you're so fucking enlightened,
you should've seen that.

841
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:11,964
Had you been awake enough
to dignify his place in this world,

842
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,550
in spite of the loss of your other son,

843
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,177
he wouldn't be so desperate
to find himself.

844
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,220
Baby, don't...

845
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:28,564
I'm doing this.

846
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:39,575
"To whom it may concern,
consider this application to the seminary.

847
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:42,744
Enclosed you'll find my résumé,

848
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:45,831
and half the fee.

849
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,625
God will provide the rest cause."

850
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:49,543
Cause?

851
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:54,131
Oh, "'cause I'm praying for it."

852
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,009
'Cause.

853
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,350
Hey, Mama, I'm home.

854
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:08,353
Hey, Stuart.
I just been admiring your artwork.

855
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,192
- You invite him here?
- He came to check on you.

856
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:16,737
You look about as holy as a healthy deuce.

857
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:18,572
You had to tell him?

858
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,783
- It's a sin to lie.
- You ain't the Catholic here.

859
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:23,952
You've had some nutty ideas before,

860
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:28,040
but this is like Hitler
asking to join the ADL.

861
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:31,126
All these years, I was looking
for the wrong father's approval.

862
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,461
I never needed yours.

863
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,922
I always loved you
for the piece of shit you were.

864
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,340
That's unconditional.

865
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:37,883
It's obligation.

866
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:39,801
You're punishing yourself.

867
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,304
You've both been, since Stephen died.

868
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,640
It's not punishment, it's purpose.

869
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,059
Let me do one last thing as your dad.

870
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:50,938
- Give you something you always wanted.
- What the fuck?

871
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:53,732
You gonna disgrace me
and your brother like this,

872
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,609
you might as well bury me too.

873
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:01,990
I'm turning my life around.
There ain't shit you could do to stop me.

874
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:05,160
Unless you wanna shoot me.
Dine out on two dead kids.

875
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,954
Oh, to hell with both of you.

876
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:09,289
I trust we'll both find our way.

877
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,383
You both better be gone when I get back.

878
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:30,954
Excuse me, sir?

879
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,664
Do you have an appointment?

880
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,124
Yes.

881
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,545
Take care, Jeff. All the best.

882
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:40,339
Go on.

883
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:43,217
Hey.

884
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:50,766
- You're the IOU.
- You know something, Father?

885
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:53,560
There's a sign on the wall
of my gym back home.

886
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:56,772
"Hope is not a tactic."
I took that one to heart.

887
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,816
Fought for everything I earned.
This ain't no different.

888
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:04,988
I know what God's doing here.
Seeing how I respond, I don't get my way.

889
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:06,990
I'd be red-assed about it.

890
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,159
But I ain't giving up.

891
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:11,203
Not on him or me.

892
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:14,289
I want you to reconsider your rejection.

893
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:18,585
There's nothing on your résumé
or in your references

894
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:23,882
that speaks to behavioral conformity
with Catholic tradition.

895
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,553
You are a pugilist with a criminal record.

896
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:30,472
Look at St. Matthew,
St. Augustine, St. Francis.

897
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:32,057
Some of the most remarkable figures

898
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,518
in the history
of the Church are reformed men.

899
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:38,105
Yes, but I think
what the Church needs now,

900
01:05:38,188 --> 01:05:39,106
more than ever,

901
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,150
is to elevate the standard for a priest.

902
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,820
No, the Church needs somebody
who's gonna fight for God.

903
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:45,737
That's me.

904
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:50,284
Besides, if the Church's choices don't
celebrate a person's capacity for change,

905
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,327
then what else does it stand for?

906
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,497
This may sound contradictory,

907
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:59,293
but sometimes the best path to serving God

908
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:02,087
is to step out of the way.

909
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,048
With all due respect, monsignor,
you're getting in my way.

910
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:06,633
God wants me here.

911
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:15,100
Priests become the financial
responsibility of the Church.

912
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,352
Now, by admitting you,

913
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,981
we'd be agreeing to subsidize you

914
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,483
as the face of Catholicism.

915
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:27,863
Something our board
would be very reluctant to do.

916
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,741
First it's admitting
you're afraid I'll succeed.

917
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:35,913
If you so sure
I'll flame out, what you got to lose?

918
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,646
- My man.
- Hey.

919
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:02,314
Look at you. What?

920
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:06,693
- The first of many inappropriate displays.
- Outward sign of inward grace.

921
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:08,695
- And a hug from the heart.
- Hugs are healing.

922
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:11,281
Jesus hugged a cripple,
that mother-hugger would walk.

923
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:12,199
I need another one.

924
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:16,495
Entering these gates, you surrender
any personal means of purchase.

925
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:20,707
We rely on our sponsors for money.
You do have one of those, don't you?

926
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,042
Don't worry about me.

927
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,211
I been getting sponsorships
since I could swing.

928
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:28,715
By the time I leave,
I'll have Jesus' name on my trunks.

929
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:31,677
You can keep your driver's license
and insurance card.

930
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,971
They took my license,
canceled my insurance.

931
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,390
You doubted me, and I'm a step ahead.

932
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:37,474
God bless you.

933
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,397
It is my great privilege

934
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,900
to welcome you
to the stewardship of theology.

935
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:52,072
You are here to learn
that you will one day be a teacher.

936
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:53,323
An advisor.

937
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,200
A confessor.

938
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,203
Indeed, a Father.

939
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:01,415
- Hey.
- Hey.

940
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:10,632
I guess we're gonna be roommates.

941
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,221
Sixteen?

942
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:18,765
Sixteen.

943
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:24,104
They must've given me a faulty one.

944
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:27,191
It's user error.
And it's like 2 in the morning.

945
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,859
I ain't going down till I get this right.

946
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:32,112
There is no MVP of Consecration.

947
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:33,947
Of course there is. Jesus.

948
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:36,325
You wanna sleep, help a brother out.

949
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,493
And be complicit in your ruse?
Not over my dead body.

950
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,537
I'll ring your bell,
show you how that's done.

951
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,167
You're a fraud.

952
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,921
I found God. I ain't here for fellowship.
I'm here for worship.

953
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,923
That's a great bumper sticker.

954
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,434
"Take this, all of you, drink from it,

955
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,770
for this is the chalice of my blood,

956
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:08,023
the blood of the new
and eternal covenant."

957
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:09,608
<i>I been thinking.</i>

958
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,528
Probably wise to keep a vice on hand.

959
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:15,197
Somebody too perfect,
they a target for the devil.

960
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,658
"Better to be silent, be thought a fool,
than to talk and remove all doubt."

961
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,578
While we're bandying idioms.

962
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:24,540
If Jesus wasn't afraid to look a fool,
why should I be?

963
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:27,334
If you seek to be Christlike,
give us something worth repeating.

964
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:29,169
That is the duty of a priest.

965
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:31,671
One that you prove daily
you're incapable of performing.

966
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:35,425
Not just what he does that makes a man
a priest. It's also what he doesn't do.

967
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:38,636
- He ain't laid you out yet.
- Oh, that's charming.

968
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,555
Not yet.

969
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:42,307
Watch your man.

970
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,225
Oh, no, Stu.

971
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:44,725
Oh, no, Stu.

972
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,564
You look tired.

973
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:52,776
Give me a second.
I'm out of shape. And you're Black.

974
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,152
I thought you were an athlete.

975
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,029
- I'm gonna take five. Sub in for me.
- What?

976
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:57,781
Let me catch my breath, man.

977
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:58,699
Shit.

978
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:01,785
Hey.

979
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:04,079
You want in?

980
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:07,875
Does it look like I want in?

981
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:17,551
- Trying to rise above here, man.
- A priest is penitent, not playful.

982
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,429
How you think
Moses lasted in the desert 40 years?

983
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:21,597
He must've been in shape.

984
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,348
Priest got to be prepared.

985
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,642
I don't suppose
Jesus appreciates your mockery.

986
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:27,853
God gave us a sense of humor
so we'd use it.

987
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:30,314
I don't know how to play, all right?

988
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:32,608
My father didn't see the point
in teaching me sports.

989
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:34,026
I was always gonna be a priest.

990
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,069
It ain't never too late to learn.

991
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:40,115
Not everyone is as eager
to humiliate themselves as you are.

992
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:43,785
Through his own son's shame
was God's glory magnified.

993
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:45,537
Jesus set the bar, brother.

994
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:48,665
No one wants to hear the Gospel
from the mouth of a gangster.

995
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:52,753
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

996
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:54,671
I'm coming back.

997
01:10:56,882 --> 01:11:00,135
"For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only son,

998
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:02,346
so that everyone who believes in him

999
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,140
might not perish,
but might have eternal life."

1000
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:08,644
- The Gospel of the Lord.
- Praise to the Lord Jesus Christ.

1001
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:15,192
It is a great pleasure to introduce
a member of our parish family,

1002
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:16,568
now a seminarian,

1003
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:18,570
to deliver today's reflection.

1004
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:26,745
Hey.

1005
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,931
"Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do."

1006
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:51,311
That's what Jesus said on the cross.

1007
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:54,857
As a kid,

1008
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,859
I saw a dude in a diaper,

1009
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:59,862
getting it worse than me
with my daddy's belt when he was drunk.

1010
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:03,615
But I figured,
I could never screw up as bad as Jesus.

1011
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,617
Whatever he did to deserve that.

1012
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,456
And as a man, I thought,
"You know what? It serves him right.

1013
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,708
Trying to lie to the world,

1014
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:16,044
make us think we gotta kiss his feet
for a pat on the head."

1015
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:21,842
Look, now, we've all been wronged,
and we've all done some wronging.

1016
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,595
Some of us worse than others.

1017
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:27,181
But with them words I said up top,

1018
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,100
Jesus asked his father, God,

1019
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:33,395
to forgive the folks tacking him up.

1020
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:36,106
He ain't come to condemn the world,

1021
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,442
make us cower in shame for our sins.

1022
01:12:40,444 --> 01:12:41,778
He came to forgive us.

1023
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,364
Think about it.

1024
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:48,785
We ask Jesus to forgive us our trespasses

1025
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:52,122
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1026
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:58,587
God's forgiveness
is contingent upon us forgiving others.

1027
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,838
That's the deal.

1028
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,341
It ain't easy to do.

1029
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:04,218
Truth is,

1030
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,054
we ain't got no power to do it ourselves.

1031
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:08,931
None of us, not a one.

1032
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,642
It's all God's grace.

1033
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,811
That's the man, right there.

1034
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:18,315
You just gotta let him in.

1035
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:21,193
He'll do the heavy lifting.

1036
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,488
Amen.

1037
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,075
Hey.

1038
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,494
Hey, wait up. Hey.

1039
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,704
You're out of shape.

1040
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:34,665
I'm out of practice chasing after you.

1041
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,125
You're spiritually blackmailing me.

1042
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:38,126
What?

1043
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,379
Reminding me
God forgives those who forgive others,

1044
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:43,590
chasing me down to demand it,
all for you to make yourself feel better.

1045
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:45,008
It'll make you feel better too.

1046
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:48,011
There's nothing to forgive.
We serve the same God.

1047
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:50,973
You seeing someone?

1048
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,309
You really are a glutton for punishment.

1049
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:06,029
- You asked to see me, Father?
- Yes, yes.

1050
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:07,739
As a matter of fact, I did.

1051
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:13,078
It's come to my attention
that there was a woman in your life,

1052
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,789
prior to you entering the seminary.

1053
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,834
I was wondering,
are you still in contact with her?

1054
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:24,381
No, not really. I mean, she don't want
much to do with a man she can't marry.

1055
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,217
You know how Catholic girls are.
Or maybe you don't.

1056
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:32,639
You strike me as the kind of man for whom
rejection only strengthens resolve.

1057
01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:35,142
Oh, don't ask me where I got that notion.

1058
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:39,062
Do you still think about her?

1059
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:41,023
Of course I do.

1060
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:43,650
Sexuality's a gift from God.

1061
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:46,570
And denying it
is denying something he wanted us to have.

1062
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:48,780
It's what you do with it that matters.

1063
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,783
Well, I appreciate your candor.

1064
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:54,203
Anyway, I just want you to know,

1065
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:58,290
I'm always here,
if you need to talk, or you're struggling.

1066
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,209
Too kind, too kind.

1067
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,962
You know,
it ain't a giving up, it's a giving for.

1068
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:07,799
Like anything, it's the struggle
that brings you closer to God.

1069
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:09,843
I never shied away from no fight.

1070
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:13,138
Teaching priests to rat on suffering men,

1071
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,224
they're getting closer to Judas
than Jesus.

1072
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,726
We both know how that story ends.

1073
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:21,230
Don't we?

1074
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:07,901
<i>Hey.</i>

1075
01:16:07,985 --> 01:16:10,404
- Go, go, go.
- Right here, right here.

1076
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,490
- Hey.
- Come on, man, let's go.

1077
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:15,367
Shit.

1078
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,285
Hey.

1079
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,746
- Yo, I got you, I got you.
- Hey.

1080
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:21,915
- Wait, wait.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1081
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,959
Hey, you all right, man?

1082
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,838
I ain't playing possum,
if that's what you're asking.

1083
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,556
Let me try again. Help me up.

1084
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:40,851
Let's go slow. Go slow.

1085
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:43,562
All right, just take a sec.

1086
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:44,479
Guys, hey.

1087
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,109
Dude, you okay? You okay, man?

1088
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:50,944
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1089
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,322
Come on. There you go.

1090
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:04,541
Oh, shit.

1091
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:09,004
- You there, ten-four?
- <i>Yes, Stu.</i>

1092
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,172
<i>Still here.</i>

1093
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,049
Roger that.

1094
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,133
Oh, shit.

1095
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:22,351
Is that that nurse out there? You there?

1096
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:26,563
Hello?

1097
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,483
Anybody out there?

1098
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,362
Oh, my God.

1099
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,242
Oh, Stuart, I apologize for the delay.

1100
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,827
I had several specialists
conferring over your lab reports.

1101
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,330
No worries, doc.
I got the feeling back. I think I'm good.

1102
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:45,040
Okay, look.

1103
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,169
There's no easy way to deliver this news,

1104
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:52,965
but you don't strike me
as somebody who needs sugarcoating.

1105
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,509
All right?

1106
01:17:56,426 --> 01:17:59,471
You have a progressive muscle disorder.

1107
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:02,558
It's called inclusion body myositis.
It's very rare.

1108
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,936
Symptoms are like ALS,
Lou Gehrig's disease,

1109
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:10,148
where the muscles continue
to weaken until they cease to function.

1110
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:11,942
Yeah.

1111
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,112
Unfortunately, there is no cure.

1112
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,699
You could've put some sugar on that shit.

1113
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:22,828
I'm sorry. Listen, it's very rare
to see in somebody as young as you.

1114
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:27,958
- Then I got a better chance to beat it.
- Yeah, well, like I said, there's no cure.

1115
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:29,710
All right, Stuart?

1116
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:34,214
But the rate of progression,
it varies from person to person.

1117
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,257
How long?

1118
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,467
The first things
to atrophy will be the quadriceps,

1119
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,595
finger flexors, foot dorsiflexors.

1120
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,722
Later on, the facial muscles,

1121
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:44,725
especially those
that control eye closure, speech,

1122
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,810
and the muscles
that facilitate your swallowing.

1123
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:49,188
The good news is
you could have as long as a year

1124
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:52,900
before you'll need any assistance
with basic daily activities.

1125
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:56,695
Like what? Like taking a shit?

1126
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,823
Patients find that preparing for a future
with some home augmentations

1127
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,158
eases the transition.

1128
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:02,910
Take this shit out of my dick.

1129
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,244
I'm gonna send for a nurse.

1130
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:07,581
Can't cure my disease, can't take a tube
out of my dick, what can you do?

1131
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:11,168
I understand, Stuart, that you are angry.

1132
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:16,340
Oh, God.
Is there anything it doesn't fuck with?

1133
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:17,841
Yeah.

1134
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:19,718
Erectile function.

1135
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,638
Typically one of the last things to go.

1136
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:26,099
I'm trying to be a priest, pal.

1137
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,444
Let me know if you need anything.

1138
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,791
God is all about defying the odds.

1139
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:55,838
You know, showing people
what they didn't think was possible is.

1140
01:19:55,921 --> 01:20:00,133
I defied every odd to get where I'm at.
You'd think he'd give a brother a break.

1141
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:06,014
Maybe this is God giving you your break.

1142
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:11,728
You know, Hollywood's not
got too many handsome handicapped.

1143
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:17,734
You think Ali wanna be known
as the best Black boxer?

1144
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,404
Guys like us go for greatest of great.

1145
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:29,663
Stu...

1146
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:34,877
Only thing you and Ali got
in common is a wheelchair in your future.

1147
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:54,730
You all right, bro?

1148
01:20:57,149 --> 01:20:58,984
God don't make mistakes, right?

1149
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:12,789
You love me, but you don't want me.

1150
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:18,128
You're testing me, huh?

1151
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,548
You wanna test me to see how serious I am?

1152
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:25,260
Why?

1153
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:29,223
Why?

1154
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:31,350
Why?

1155
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:34,811
I wanna know why.

1156
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:38,774
I wanna know why. I wanna know now.

1157
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,234
Why?

1158
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:44,154
Why have you forsaken me here now?

1159
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:55,165
And I'm here, and I wanna do right,
and I wanna be good.

1160
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:59,211
I'm gonna be good.
I'm gonna do right, I'm wanna be good.

1161
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:00,921
Please, Lord...

1162
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:07,052
Goddamn.

1163
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:10,430
No, I didn't mean that.
You know I didn't mean that.

1164
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:11,849
All right.

1165
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:15,811
I need to know now. I need to know now.

1166
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:16,728
Why?

1167
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:22,109
What the fuck
you got me doing here like this on my...

1168
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:23,026
On my own?

1169
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:26,113
Make sure you put Stephen with me.

1170
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:50,971
I'll be here, Lord.

1171
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:53,223
For you.

1172
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,438
<i>You all right?</i>

1173
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,733
<i>That's a dumb question.</i>

1174
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:04,401
I'm sorry.

1175
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:07,779
I don't know what else to say.

1176
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:11,325
That's a first. You must be really sick.

1177
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:14,119
That's what they're saying.
I feel fine so far.

1178
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:15,871
<i>Baby.</i>

1179
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,789
You can beat this.

1180
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:20,709
They ain't seen it in a man so young.

1181
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,378
Means they don't know
it's possible to get it gone.

1182
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:26,423
<i>You gotta think that way.
Can't think nothing else.</i>

1183
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:28,425
Yeah.

1184
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,010
But in case you don't,

1185
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:32,888
you ought to move back home.

1186
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:35,432
<i>Spend what you got left
doing things you enjoy.</i>

1187
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:37,476
<i>Eat your favorite food, see your friends.</i>

1188
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:40,020
Hell, you might even box again.

1189
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:40,938
Ma.

1190
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,106
<i>Sorry, baby.</i>

1191
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,525
I'm just scared.

1192
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:45,734
<i>Well, look at Mary.</i>

1193
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,779
Watching her son getting whipped
and nailed. She looked good doing it.

1194
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:51,490
That's a fucking fairytale, Stu.

1195
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:52,658
And if it ain't?

1196
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:56,495
<i>This God of yours,
you've given up everything for him.</i>

1197
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,956
And what's he do? He punishes you.

1198
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,792
When God wounds us,
he calls us closer to him.

1199
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,210
You couldn't get any closer.

1200
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:05,879
You're already
in the goddamn bed with him.

1201
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:11,093
Couldn't you make some kind of deal?
He lets you stay around, you be his bitch?

1202
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:13,595
Otherwise, take your business elsewhere.

1203
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,515
I'm not gay, all right?
And God's not a gangster.

1204
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:19,476
He don't make deals,
he don't respond to ultimatums.

1205
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,603
<i>You can't talk me out of this one.</i>

1206
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:30,654
<i>I don't know
why I come out here every show</i>

1207
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:33,824
<i>and I keep saying,
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."</i>

1208
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,326
<i>I don't know what I'm thanking you for.</i>

1209
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,078
<i>You get in here for nothing.</i>

1210
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:41,999
<i>Bill's doing more important shit
right now. Leave word.</i>

1211
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:44,251
<i>And believe me, that wasn't my idea.</i>

1212
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:46,879
<i>Bill, it's me, Kathleen.</i>

1213
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:49,840
<i>I need to talk to you about Stu.</i>

1214
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,885
<i>It's amazing,
the things they have nowadays.</i>

1215
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:55,762
- <i>Shaving cream with diacetin in it.
</i>- What about him?

1216
01:24:57,181 --> 01:24:59,516
<i>Shaving cream with lanolin in it.</i>

1217
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:02,269
<i>Shaving cream with chlorophyll in it.</i>

1218
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:04,438
What's that mean?

1219
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:08,150
<i>Had to chase all over town
to find shaving cream with soap in it.</i>

1220
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:13,697
<i>There. A small shave...</i>

1221
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:17,576
Does he need a...?
Can he even get on the crapper by himself?

1222
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:19,828
<i>Nothing like a nice smooth...</i>

1223
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,666
<i>I forgot to put a blade in it.</i>

1224
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:32,466
A load of good you and me did,
climbing into bed together.

1225
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:34,843
Made two kids, own bodies don't want them.

1226
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:36,220
<i>Hello.</i>

1227
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:06,208
Hang on.

1228
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:09,837
Hold your horses.

1229
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:19,388
You're gonna wake the whole neighborhood.

1230
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:22,015
This ain't no neighborhood.
This is a trailer park.

1231
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:23,934
They ought to thank me
for the wake-up call.

1232
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:25,853
Get their asses up to find a job.

1233
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:27,688
Early bird gets the worm. You heard?

1234
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,941
- Some of them got jobs. Get in here.
- Thought you'd never ask.

1235
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:37,489
This is nice.

1236
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:40,284
You make Mama look like Martha Stew.

1237
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:46,498
Yeah, I was thinking of hiring
your girlfriend to tidy up for me.

1238
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:48,750
She'd appreciate the work, probably.

1239
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:51,044
Seeing as the church mouse
feeds on strangers' scraps

1240
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:54,673
and people these days
are just stingy assholes.

1241
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,343
You get back what you put out there.

1242
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,265
Is that why
God gave you an incurable disease?

1243
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,185
You called it.

1244
01:27:06,852 --> 01:27:08,937
You always said I was a degenerate.

1245
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,150
Drop in unannounced.

1246
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:16,862
Don't give a man time
to take a piss or get his shit together.

1247
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:18,614
I beg your pardon, Padre.

1248
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:56,610
You casing the joint,
gonna steal more of my shit?

1249
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:01,490
I come to see you ain't killed yourself.

1250
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:03,033
Left Mama high and dry.

1251
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:06,537
You think you're the only one
that can keep a vow?

1252
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,247
Don't get all high and mighty with me.

1253
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:10,541
I'm still your fucking father.
Don't you forget that.

1254
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:15,170
It's lucky
you ain't bet one dime on me, huh?

1255
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:23,637
I'm praying for you.

1256
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:25,681
Don't you dare.

1257
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,560
You're violating my rights as a man.

1258
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:31,520
As an American.

1259
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:03,260
<i>Look not on our sins,
but on the faith of your Church.</i>

1260
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:09,558
<i>And graciously grant her peace
and unity in accordance with your will.</i>

1261
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:14,271
<i>Who live and reign forever and ever.</i>

1262
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:16,648
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

1263
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:20,360
<i>The peace of the Lord be with you always.</i>

1264
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:23,113
And now let us offer each other

1265
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:25,407
a sign of peace.

1266
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:27,743
Peace be with you.

1267
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:29,870
Peace be with you.

1268
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:35,501
Peace be with you.

1269
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:44,176
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

1270
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:47,471
When I prayed away my pride.

1271
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:55,312
I'll marry you, you want me to.

1272
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:01,109
Aren't you gonna ask
what kind of guy he is?

1273
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:02,152
No.

1274
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:03,403
I'd beat him up.

1275
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:05,739
But I'm trying to be a priest.

1276
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:13,747
Well, for...

1277
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:19,002
For what it's worth, you have my support.

1278
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,589
In sickness and in health?

1279
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:24,591
In case I get a miracle?

1280
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:27,261
Until death do we part?

1281
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:39,731
If your mom asks,

1282
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:43,443
tell her I came
to convince you to abandon priesthood.

1283
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:45,237
She ain't gonna believe that.

1284
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:47,239
Not you.

1285
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:52,828
It's okay.

1286
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:51,678
Give me a hand here.

1287
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:05,567
It's our mission
to enter the darkest places,

1288
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:07,778
and to be the light of Christ.

1289
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:09,112
"Dark"?

1290
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,407
Because we Black, bad, or both?

1291
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,119
It...

1292
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:18,830
It's a metaphor.

1293
01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:24,211
If you gonna use big words like that,
might as well pass out dictionaries, bro.

1294
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:30,384
You guys get
one phone call a week in here?

1295
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,680
If you kiss the right ass.

1296
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:37,516
Who you gonna call, huh?

1297
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:39,101
Your mama?

1298
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:42,604
You gonna break her heart some more.

1299
01:32:43,564 --> 01:32:44,398
Your wife?

1300
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:48,652
Shit, let's be real,
she probably busy banging her new man.

1301
01:32:51,029 --> 01:32:51,864
And your kid?

1302
01:32:52,656 --> 01:32:55,909
He'd probably get more pity
in school if his daddy was dead.

1303
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:59,705
Don't need no phone to talk to God.

1304
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:02,708
Don't need a guard's permission, neither.

1305
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:06,837
When no one else gives a shit
what you got to say, God does.

1306
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,589
Because he made your ass.

1307
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:13,886
You damn right he's disappointed in it,
but he wants to help.

1308
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:20,726
No matter how hard you resist it,
no matter how many times you say no.

1309
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:23,270
He still wants to make you better.

1310
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:28,358
He ain't giving up on you.

1311
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:30,319
Never.

1312
01:33:31,028 --> 01:33:33,572
Don't you dare go giving up on yourself.

1313
01:33:40,037 --> 01:33:41,246
You wanna try again?

1314
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:54,468
Have a seat, Stuart.

1315
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,552
You know what?

1316
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:59,681
I'm trying to stay fit. I'll have a stand.

1317
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:07,731
There is concern amongst the diocese

1318
01:34:07,814 --> 01:34:10,776
that the state of your infirmity

1319
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:16,657
will render you unable
to properly perform the sacraments.

1320
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:24,122
It may even cause you to disgrace them.

1321
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:28,627
I spill the blood. Choke on the body.
Fall on my face trying to genuflect.

1322
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,838
You think I haven't thought of that?

1323
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:34,258
We're not human beings
having a spiritual experience,

1324
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:36,426
we are spiritual beings
having a human one.

1325
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:39,972
This body don't mean nothing to God.
Therefore nor should it to you.

1326
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:48,397
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

1327
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:52,693
The Church will
not endorse you for ordination.

1328
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:06,373
At first the Church couldn't afford
to subsidize me as a face of Catholicism.

1329
01:35:07,249 --> 01:35:09,293
Now it can't afford
to subsidize a cripple.

1330
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:13,630
This time it ain't a matter of reputation,
it's a matter of the money.

1331
01:35:13,714 --> 01:35:14,715
Isn't that right?

1332
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:19,428
God don't move the goalpost, Father.
Man does.

1333
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:28,020
It is my duty
to defend the sanctity of our Church.

1334
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,024
I'm sorry, Stuart.

1335
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:04,449
<i>Hello, Mr. Long.</i>

1336
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:07,578
<i>I'm sorry, my name is Ham.</i>

1337
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:10,497
<i>I'm a friend of your son, Stuart.</i>

1338
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:35,147
Nearly done there or what?

1339
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:41,653
She gonna help me up.

1340
01:37:44,156 --> 01:37:45,282
Oh, come on now.

1341
01:37:45,365 --> 01:37:47,451
This ain't the hill to die on.

1342
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:49,870
It's the only one.

1343
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:06,637
It's a solid build.

1344
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:21,401
I seen insects grope about for death

1345
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,820
with more dignity
than what you're displaying right now.

1346
01:38:23,904 --> 01:38:24,905
You here to help?

1347
01:38:26,448 --> 01:38:27,866
Play a hymn on the harp.

1348
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,619
Makes pathetic shit look poetic.

1349
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,456
The only hymn I know is Haggard.

1350
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,291
Ain't you got somewhere to be?

1351
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:37,334
Yeah, probably.

1352
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:44,424
I'm trying out this new thing
they got now called self-employment.

1353
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:46,134
All the kids are doing it.

1354
01:38:46,802 --> 01:38:48,178
I heard about that.

1355
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:51,098
Identical twin sister to unemployment.

1356
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:54,852
Except they swear
she's the better-looking one.

1357
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:07,281
I seen a couple of boxing bouts on the TV.

1358
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:10,742
Enough to know a man
don't lose when he gets knocked down,

1359
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:13,829
but when he won't get up.

1360
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:18,834
If there's one thing
I know about you, it's...

1361
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:21,128
you ain't afraid to get hit.

1362
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:33,515
You gonna watch or what?

1363
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:34,850
Yeah.

1364
01:40:27,611 --> 01:40:29,988
- Hey, Mama.
- Hi, baby.

1365
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:40,916
What you waiting on?

1366
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:42,960
Well, you.

1367
01:40:53,136 --> 01:40:54,555
What you doing in there?

1368
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:01,520
Praying for you to get some patience.

1369
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:04,022
You ought to try praying for my prostate.

1370
01:41:32,926 --> 01:41:33,760
You all right?

1371
01:41:34,303 --> 01:41:36,597
I ain't trying to close my curtains
in the shit box,

1372
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,931
if that's what you're asking.

1373
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:41,518
Well, you always did wanna be like Elvis.

1374
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:43,270
I didn't think you noticed.

1375
01:41:44,188 --> 01:41:46,273
How could I not? You never shut up.

1376
01:41:46,356 --> 01:41:48,442
Many hours of silence, gone.

1377
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:51,028
They say it's gold. We could've been rich.

1378
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,907
Too late now.
Ain't gonna get that time back.

1379
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,034
Yeah.

1380
01:41:57,618 --> 01:41:58,952
How do we tackle this?

1381
01:41:59,912 --> 01:42:01,580
Come on. Yeah.

1382
01:42:23,268 --> 01:42:24,478
We're gonna be late.

1383
01:42:29,358 --> 01:42:32,069
- The news ain't said hell froze over.
- That the best you got?

1384
01:42:32,152 --> 01:42:34,988
I'd clap if I could. I might slap myself.

1385
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:36,323
That's more like it.

1386
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:39,868
I never did like wearing these things.

1387
01:42:39,952 --> 01:42:42,371
Ain't done one of these
since your brother's funeral.

1388
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:44,164
Still got your mother's makeup on it.

1389
01:42:44,248 --> 01:42:45,874
You got another one coming up.

1390
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:47,417
Shut the fuck up with that.

1391
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:49,586
Meantime, take Mama somewhere nice.

1392
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,226
Can't say I never gave you nothing.

1393
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:09,064
I skipped over thanking you.
Went straight to the source.

1394
01:43:10,482 --> 01:43:12,317
This thing purrs like a kitten.

1395
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:17,364
Oh, no.

1396
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:20,284
You son of a...

1397
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:24,955
Son of a bitch. You piece of shit.
You couldn't wait till tomorrow.

1398
01:43:25,038 --> 01:43:27,499
Maybe that's God saying
you ought to share your shit.

1399
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:30,294
- Or else.
- Yeah, well, she's all yours now.

1400
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:32,254
We ain't that far. I could walk.

1401
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:34,006
Yeah, and I can fucking fly.

1402
01:43:35,257 --> 01:43:38,260
- Where you going?
- I gotta get your ass to church on time.

1403
01:43:56,445 --> 01:43:57,279
There you go.

1404
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,417
Breathing heavy already.

1405
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:13,420
- It's the bad air.
- You gonna have a heart attack.

1406
01:44:13,504 --> 01:44:16,965
Well, then it'll all be right.
I'd die before you.

1407
01:44:17,049 --> 01:44:18,675
Yeah, you ain't that lucky.

1408
01:44:18,759 --> 01:44:19,593
Shut up.

1409
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:30,896
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Mama.

1410
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:37,945
- Wanna tell me what's going on here?
- What you mean?

1411
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,113
Dad is in a tie.

1412
01:44:40,197 --> 01:44:41,782
He looks nice.

1413
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:52,167
Y'all think since I can't be a priest,
I'm gonna marry her?

1414
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:56,463
- Y'all bless this?
- You're in no state to protest.

1415
01:44:56,547 --> 01:44:59,341
- You called her a housekeeper.
- What's wrong with housekeepers?

1416
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:02,344
That's good for her.
In three months, I'll be in a diaper.

1417
01:45:02,427 --> 01:45:04,471
You're gonna need someone
to clean up your shit.

1418
01:45:04,555 --> 01:45:06,348
- That's your job.
- I'm gonna subcontract.

1419
01:45:06,431 --> 01:45:09,351
Oh, cut that shit out, you two.

1420
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:10,978
Here. Let's go.

1421
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:12,771
- Mind your back, Bill.
- Okay.

1422
01:45:29,997 --> 01:45:32,958
Our parish petitioned the diocese
to ordain you as a priest.

1423
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:35,752
Monsignor made sure it was heard.

1424
01:45:36,795 --> 01:45:40,007
Turns out,
I had one good fight left in me.

1425
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:47,806
We all believe in you, brother.

1426
01:45:50,225 --> 01:45:51,685
That's Father to you.

1427
01:47:16,895 --> 01:47:19,398
Someone once told me
I was bad advertising.

1428
01:47:20,274 --> 01:47:21,316
Imagine that.

1429
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:25,237
He was a boss of mine at the supermarket.

1430
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,949
I kept coming in with a face looked more
like raw meat than what I was selling.

1431
01:47:30,701 --> 01:47:32,035
Of course at the time,

1432
01:47:33,036 --> 01:47:34,746
I thought that man was wrong.

1433
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:38,292
Whole world was wrong when it came to me.

1434
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:43,338
Every brawl I had was beating back
at a world I thought had done me wrong.

1435
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:47,176
Yeah.

1436
01:47:48,635 --> 01:47:50,137
Every bruise on my face,

1437
01:47:51,513 --> 01:47:55,392
every drop of blood I shed was proof
of my war against God's injustice.

1438
01:47:58,103 --> 01:48:01,273
I look worse now
than I did then, that's for sure.

1439
01:48:01,356 --> 01:48:02,357
Difference is...

1440
01:48:04,484 --> 01:48:06,987
now I know my suffering's a gift from God.

1441
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:11,033
Now, I know it sounds like bull,

1442
01:48:11,116 --> 01:48:13,202
but it's coming
from a man in a wheelchair,

1443
01:48:13,285 --> 01:48:14,953
so you got to entertain it.

1444
01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:18,040
Hear me out.

1445
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:25,923
All our outer nature's wasting away.

1446
01:48:27,633 --> 01:48:30,469
But our inner nature
is being renewed every day.

1447
01:48:32,012 --> 01:48:35,933
This life, no matter how long it lasts,

1448
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:40,145
is a momentary affliction
preparing us for eternal glory.

1449
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:44,399
We shouldn't pray for an easy life,

1450
01:48:45,275 --> 01:48:47,778
but the strength
to endure a difficult one.

1451
01:48:48,737 --> 01:48:50,822
Because the experience of suffering

1452
01:48:51,448 --> 01:48:53,825
is the fullest expression of God's love.

1453
01:48:55,244 --> 01:48:57,496
It is a chance to be closer to Christ.

1454
01:49:05,087 --> 01:49:07,005
Now, no one suffers perfectly.

1455
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:08,257
For sure not me.

1456
01:49:09,591 --> 01:49:11,844
Even Christ had his moment of despair.

1457
01:49:13,595 --> 01:49:16,098
"My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?"

1458
01:49:17,766 --> 01:49:19,268
He asked from the cross.

1459
01:49:20,143 --> 01:49:21,395
Christ felt betrayed.

1460
01:49:23,313 --> 01:49:24,731
You see, in that moment,

1461
01:49:25,774 --> 01:49:27,109
he who was sinless...

1462
01:49:27,985 --> 01:49:30,863
took on all our sins,
and got judged by God.

1463
01:49:32,865 --> 01:49:36,076
He took what we deserve,
because he loves us.

1464
01:49:45,961 --> 01:49:46,920
And that love...

1465
01:49:48,839 --> 01:49:51,258
it could make the baddest man a believer.

1466
01:49:52,801 --> 01:49:56,180
Because that love
is a feeling like no other.

1467
01:49:59,349 --> 01:50:01,977
To lead you all
to find and feel that love...

1468
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:07,774
is why God is giving me
the scenic route to die.

1469
01:50:10,485 --> 01:50:12,613
And for that, I thank him every day.

1470
01:50:16,575 --> 01:50:17,743
Amen.

1471
01:50:17,826 --> 01:50:18,869
Amen.

1472
01:51:05,332 --> 01:51:06,750
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1473
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:07,668
Great.

1474
01:51:19,096 --> 01:51:22,015
- And who are you here to visit, sir?
- Father Stu.

1475
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:24,309
You and everybody else in this town.

1476
01:51:34,278 --> 01:51:35,654
Good morning.

1477
01:51:35,737 --> 01:51:37,865
Good one to be in sin, I suppose.

1478
01:51:44,496 --> 01:51:46,164
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1479
01:51:46,248 --> 01:51:49,042
It has been seven days
since my last confession.

1480
01:51:50,377 --> 01:51:51,670
But no matter how many I make,

1481
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:55,007
these hands that touch the troubled
are still themselves unclean.

1482
01:51:58,802 --> 01:51:59,970
You having doubts?

1483
01:52:05,142 --> 01:52:08,562
A doubt would imply that
I ever wanted this responsibility.

1484
01:52:10,647 --> 01:52:11,815
My father did.

1485
01:52:14,026 --> 01:52:15,402
It was expected of me.

1486
01:52:24,703 --> 01:52:26,788
I'm angry at God.

1487
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:33,045
For failing to make me man enough
to defy the expectations of me.

1488
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:38,509
And I'm envious of you
for having the balls to do just that.

1489
01:52:39,551 --> 01:52:43,514
All I ever prayed for
was a way out of this life.

1490
01:52:46,141 --> 01:52:48,727
And to watch you given an out by God,

1491
01:52:49,686 --> 01:52:50,771
and refuse it...

1492
01:52:52,856 --> 01:52:54,483
I can't understand it.

1493
01:52:58,028 --> 01:52:59,279
But I do admire it.

1494
01:53:01,448 --> 01:53:03,700
For these and all my sins, I am sorry.

1495
01:53:07,037 --> 01:53:10,123
I wasn't given no expectation,
except to stay alive.

1496
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,418
I ain't coming too good on that.

1497
01:53:15,712 --> 01:53:20,133
Whether by offering his son,
or for watching one die,

1498
01:53:21,301 --> 01:53:23,262
a father's just looking for love,

1499
01:53:24,388 --> 01:53:25,597
like the rest of us.

1500
01:53:51,248 --> 01:53:53,709
Imagine how it must've felt for Joseph...

1501
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,379
to be the less important father.

1502
01:53:59,715 --> 01:54:01,717
In his name, you pray for penance.

1503
01:54:21,028 --> 01:54:21,945
Goodbye, Stu.

1504
01:54:31,747 --> 01:54:33,498
Bill Long, alcoholic.

1505
01:54:33,582 --> 01:54:34,750
Hi, Bill.

1506
01:54:37,794 --> 01:54:40,214
I feel like
I'm putting my dick in a wood chip per.

1507
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:43,800
We've all been in your shoes.
Sometimes, too drunk to put them on.

1508
01:54:43,884 --> 01:54:46,929
You've made the first step,
admitting you can't do it alone.

1509
01:54:47,012 --> 01:54:48,013
Amen.

1510
01:54:49,056 --> 01:54:52,935
Yeah, well, I could've used
God's help for a lot of things,

1511
01:54:53,018 --> 01:54:55,229
but never could find him.

1512
01:54:56,772 --> 01:54:59,733
My son said,
that's because God wasn't lost.

1513
01:55:01,693 --> 01:55:02,694
Wise-ass.

1514
01:55:05,864 --> 01:55:08,534
Anyway, I sure as hell
ain't got the road map.

1515
01:55:09,868 --> 01:55:13,914
I'm here because
my son asked me to get baptized.

1516
01:55:19,127 --> 01:55:21,505
I killed every hero that boy ever had,

1517
01:55:22,297 --> 01:55:24,508
hoping one day that hero would be me.

1518
01:55:27,553 --> 01:55:30,180
Never gave him a single reason
why it should be.

1519
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:10,971
I guess we're both late bloomers.

1520
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:42,688
<i>It's a profound experience,</i>

1521
01:57:43,272 --> 01:57:44,189
<i>suffering.</i>

1522
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:49,236
<i>And the struggles of this disease</i>

1523
01:57:50,028 --> 01:57:52,281
<i>help me, and help others,</i>

1524
01:57:52,364 --> 01:57:55,993
<i>to learn the way that
we should have been living all along.</i>

1525
01:57:57,703 --> 01:57:59,746
<i>It's taught me a little humility.</i>

1526
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:02,666
<i>It's taught me dignity,
respect for others.</i>

1527
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:06,378
Sometimes people like me...
There's an extreme example.

1528
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:11,508
...We need things like this
to be able to make those changes,

1529
01:58:11,592 --> 01:58:15,179
and decisions in our life that
are gonna help us become better people.

1530
01:58:15,262 --> 01:58:19,266
Become the people that God has created us
to be when he sent us to this planet.

1531
02:01:20,322 --> 02:01:23,867
It's all about deception.
Make them think you're going right.

1532
02:01:23,951 --> 02:01:26,036
Then pow, hit them with that left.

1533
02:01:26,119 --> 02:01:28,997
Unpredictability.
It makes the audience the actor's bitch.

1534
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:32,167
The director says
we're supposed to disappear.

1535
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:34,586
No, honey,
that's why they call it stealing the show.

1536
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:36,630
Nobody gives you permission to entertain.

1537
02:01:36,713 --> 02:01:38,590
- I'm 7.
- I'm trying to help you, kid.

1538
02:01:38,674 --> 02:01:41,009
Impart some wisdom.
God smiles on that shit.

1539
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:42,094
Quiet all around.

1540
02:01:43,011 --> 02:01:45,389
I know what you're thinking.
You're free to fuck this up.

1541
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,266
Worst that happens,
you don't make the cut.

1542
02:01:47,349 --> 02:01:50,060
In the ring, you get one chance.
You better make it count.

1543
02:01:50,143 --> 02:01:52,771
That's the difference
between movies and real life.

1544
02:01:52,855 --> 02:01:54,815
Your choice how you wanna live.

1545
02:01:55,482 --> 02:01:56,316
Rolling.

1546
02:01:58,485 --> 02:01:59,486
A mark.

1547
02:02:00,737 --> 02:02:02,739
Wanna be a big star? Follow me.

1548
02:02:02,823 --> 02:02:04,992
Background. And action.

1549
02:02:05,075 --> 02:02:06,368
Hey, you.

1550
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,121
Maid.

1551
02:02:17,004 --> 02:02:18,547
Cut, cut. Oh, my...

1552
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,340
Cut. Are you crazy?

1553
02:02:20,424 --> 02:02:22,718
- I'm making it real. That was good.
- You're background.

1554
02:02:22,801 --> 02:02:24,845
Trying to help.
These guys ain't doing it right.

1555
02:02:25,429 --> 02:02:27,973
- Get him.
- Hey, don't talk to the king like that.

1556
02:02:28,056 --> 02:02:29,933
- What's wrong with you?
- You're wrapped.

1557
02:02:30,017 --> 02:02:31,518
- What?
- Congratulations.

1557
02:02:32,305 --> 02:03:32,439
