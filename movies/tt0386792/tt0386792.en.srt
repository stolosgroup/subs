2
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,535
Thank you.

3
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,348
All right, everybody, that's it for the day.

4
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:35,730
Be sure you get that drop cloth up
before you leave, all right?

5
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,324
- That's some nice work, young blood.
- Thank you, Mr. Roulette.

6
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,959
Yeah, your daddy taught you right.

7
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,533
You know, when all the construction
starts coming back...

8
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,801
you got skills
to make something of yourself.

9
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,570
Thank you, sir.

10
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,172
That's fine. I can wait until payday.

11
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:31,582
I'm sorry, all the others
have families to feed...

12
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:33,882
but you do good work.

13
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:37,482
- I like what you do, okay?
- Okay.

14
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,629
You got a funny way of telling me that.

15
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:51,997
Morning.

16
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:56,672
- Didn't I tell you I could pull some strings?
- Yes, you did, Charlie.

17
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,575
- Thank you, you're a good man.
- Yeah.

18
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,342
But tell me why.... Morning.

19
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:05,075
Why would a doctor
want to hire a carpenter?

20
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,182
Because it ain't nothing
but scud work anyway.

21
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,823
You ain't gonna like it.

22
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,854
- You say the pay is $12 a week?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,359
- I'm liking it already.
- All right, then.

24
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:25,072
Dr. Blalock, this is Vivien Thomas.

25
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:28,335
Vivien? That's a girl's name.

26
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,704
Yes, my mother was so sure
she was having a girl...

27
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,375
that she picked the name early, and kept it.

28
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,346
You don't say.

29
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,754
I'm pleased to meet you, sir.

30
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:45,189
Call me Doctor, and, Francis,
you can tell this good doctor...

31
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,694
that his theories are extremely interesting,
and I'll be praying for him.

32
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:49,855
Yes, Doctor.

33
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,865
Though it's his patients
I should be praying for.

34
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,696
Keep up, son.

35
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:02,500
- This is where my work is done.
- What is your work?

36
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,006
Medical research.

37
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,251
We push the limits of surgery...

38
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,718
using stray dogs
we get from the local dog catch.

39
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,552
They're darling, but don't get too attached.

40
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,420
They're a means to a great end.

41
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:24,096
The dog pens get cleaned up twice a day.

42
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,064
I need the lab swept every morning.

43
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:30,194
Simple tasks, but they proved
beyond the abilities of your predecessors.

44
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:32,703
Do you think you can handle it?

45
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,607
- So?
- So what?

46
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,245
Don't "so what" me. Did you get it?

47
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:19,418
You got it. You must have got it.

48
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:26,753
- It's working at a hospital, right?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,887
I'm so glad.
Everyone's gonna see how smart you are.

50
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:33,058
I don't know
how smart you have to be to shovel.

51
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:37,364
The guy I'm working for,
he seemed kind of eccentric...

52
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,300
but he is a doctor, yeah.

53
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:42,841
That's right, he is a doctor.
So you just keep your eyes open.

54
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,711
- We can get married now.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:50,314
Do everything just like we laid it out.

56
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:51,914
Doctor...

57
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,253
and Mrs. Thomas.

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,732
- Vivien.
- Good morning, sir.

59
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,505
- You said you were a carpenter?
- Yes.

60
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:32,050
- Did you go to high school?
- Yes, I did. Got my diploma.

61
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,413
Planning on going to Tennessee State
next year...

62
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,821
to study medicine, be a doctor.

63
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,224
Unusual ambition for a carpenter.

64
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,298
I always wanted to be one since I was a kid.

65
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,894
I almost saved up enough money
for college...

66
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,062
and then slowdown hit.

67
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,807
Those are Van Slyke
gas manometers over there.

68
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,341
So you can handle a saw?

69
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,901
- Yeah, since I was 12.
- Do tell.

70
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:02,680
For cutting the lines, my father
would measure on the lumber, sir.

71
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:05,412
Call me Doctor.
So your daddy's a carpenter, too?

72
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,355
- What does he think of your ambition?
- He's always known I had my mind set on it.

73
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,051
Those apparatus on the workbench,
what are they called?

74
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:18,496
Van Slyke gas manometers, sir, Doctor.

75
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,568
They are, indeed.

76
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:31,274
Vanderbilt may be a Podunk institution,
but I'm gonna put it on the medical map.

77
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,875
I'm working on traumatic shock.

78
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,049
Damn thing kills thousands of people
every year...

79
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:41,519
and doctors don't know
what the hell to do about it.

80
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,681
Let me see those hands.

81
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,108
Pick that up.

82
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,618
Now the left hand.

83
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,062
Good.

84
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:46,510
Excuse me, Vivien.
Dr. Blalock wanted you to have this.

85
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,322
- Thank you.
- Good night.

86
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,265
You know what my grandfather did?

87
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,062
It doesn't have anything to do
with me going out on strike.

88
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,865
I said, "Do you know
what my grandfather did?"

89
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,132
Yes.

90
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:43,107
He picked cotton in Mississippi,
you told me a hundred times.

91
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:46,078
My grandfather was a piece of property.

92
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,409
No better than that chair or table over there.

93
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,513
His son became a free man at the age of 15.

94
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:58,353
He raised me
with hardly an elementary school education.

95
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:02,327
Now I see my son graduate college
and go on to teach school.

96
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,797
So don't tell me
things don't get better over time.

97
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,561
Things don't just get better.

98
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,432
People got to change things, Pop,
make them better.

99
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,699
If I don't do something now,
I'll be a dead man...

100
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,775
before I get paid like white teachers do.

101
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:17,140
Vivien, you know I'm right about this.

102
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,903
All right, now, Harold, just hold your head.
I got reading to do.

103
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:26,246
To anesthetize Brutus,
first we have to calculate the weight.

104
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,686
He weighs 18.4 kilograms.

105
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:34,025
And it should take
552 milligrams of sodium barbital...

106
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:39,131
to anesthetize him for three hours
if the absorption rate is uniform.

107
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,235
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?

108
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,259
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?

109
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,969
When you practice on dogs,
and then you can help heal people.

110
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,473
- Gives me the willies.
- It's not that bad.

111
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:53,403
I mean, you look inside,
you see all the colors...

112
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:57,075
all the pinks and blues, reds.

113
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,551
It's beautiful, Clara.
That's where life comes from.

114
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:01,722
What's this?

115
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,051
What's this?

116
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,024
Open up.

117
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:09,392
Excuse me, sir. What's going on here?

118
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,029
The bank is closed.

119
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,024
- Closed?
- Yup.

120
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,593
Open up.

121
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,737
- Open this door!
- Somebody got to see somebody in there.

122
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:25,073
Open up, it's 10:00. I got to get to work.

123
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,340
Let's go, Vivien, we'll come back later.

124
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:30,212
No, Clara, something's wrong.
It can't be closed.

125
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,447
Excuse me.

126
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,146
Excuse me, sir. Hello.

127
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:41,862
Get away from that window, we're closed.

128
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,794
But I have my money in there.

129
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:47,197
- I need to get my money out.
- I can't get your money back for you.

130
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:51,496
- Why not? Tell me why not.
- Go on home, son. The bank has failed.

131
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,200
Sir, that's all my savings.

132
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,745
I had my money for school in there.
They got my money in there.

133
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,245
- Sir, that's my money for college.
- Your money's gone.

134
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,749
Gone?

135
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:08,519
- But what are they talking about?
- They talking about, it's gone, Ma.

136
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,216
We'll all just have to start over.

137
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:15,523
- Can't fight it now, it's done.
- It just feels so wrong.

138
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,629
Took me seven years to save that money.

139
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:22,202
You're not the only one
who had money in that bank.

140
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,964
It's done, it's over with!

141
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,735
We still got each other, Viv.

142
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,571
Yeah, we got each other.

143
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,108
That's all poor people ever have
is each other.

144
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,357
There's no cut down the cannula,
the femoral vein.

145
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,901
I showed you how to do it.

146
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,633
I figured out a way
to give it barbital intravenously.

147
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,842
- Where you putting it?
- In the forepaw.

148
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,671
The manometer.

149
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,913
It's all set up, Doctor.

150
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:15,850
Good.

151
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,327
- You can begin the incision.
- I'm not ready for that.

152
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,625
I say you're ready, you're ready.

153
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,468
I'll mark out the line. And you cut along it.

154
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,137
Just like you did for your old daddy.

155
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,307
Like this?

156
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,085
Just like that. Keep your hand taut.

157
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,586
Why are we making the incision here?

158
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:56,061
- To gain access to the pulmonary artery.
- And how will we find it, Vivien?

159
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,390
It's the artery leading to the lungs
from the right side of the heart.

160
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,495
Not bad.

161
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,229
Now the rib spreader.

162
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:14,938
And why are we gonna damage
poor Brutus' greater vessels?

163
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,944
To induce traumatic shock, to study it.

164
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,989
Watch this manometer.

165
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:31,295
And imagine that Brutus
is a 16-year-old boy...

166
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,992
just fell out of a tree saving his mom's cat.

167
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,598
He's broken four ribs, he's concussed.

168
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,905
Dad's rushed him to ER.

169
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,035
But he's gone into shock.
His blood pressure's way down.

170
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,239
His vital signs almost nonexistent.

171
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,875
Can we save him?

172
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:55,119
Not if I use present methods of treatment.

173
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,385
See, conventional wisdom says
I should constrict the vessels.

174
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:02,292
I beg to differ. Let's break their rules.

175
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,856
Use my rules.

176
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,761
Body needs blood.

177
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,300
Let's give it some.

178
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,479
How's that gauge?

179
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,953
Still falling.

180
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,226
Maybe the experts are right.
Maybe I'm wrong.

181
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:42,063
Maybe I'll kill this boy
and break his mother's heart.

182
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,305
It's rising.

183
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,108
That's life coming back.

184
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:57,012
- How's that make you feel?
- Good.

185
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,445
Very good, Doctor.

186
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,290
Let's look at the record of our work.

187
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,263
- Where's the smoke drum?
- I'm sorry?

188
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,071
The smoke drums.

189
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:25,004
- You didn't set the smoke drums?
- What is a smoke drum?

190
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:31,979
That's a smoke drum.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

191
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,918
I record all the information
I need for my research on a smoke drum.

192
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,590
I did not know that.

193
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,786
Is nobody listening to me?

194
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,057
God damn it!

195
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,835
I have to do everything myself.

196
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:54,901
A whole day's work goes down the toilet,
and I have to start all over again.

197
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,308
Do you have sawdust
or just plain shit for brains?

198
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,453
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.

199
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,011
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.

200
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,981
Vivien. Jesus.

201
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,649
- Hold on a minute, will you?
- I was not raised to take that type of talk.

202
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:51,060
My apologies. I'm sorry I lost my temper.

203
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:55,625
Normally it takes assistants months to learn
what you picked up in a matter of days.

204
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,403
It won't happen again.

205
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,942
Please.

206
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:09,937
Ladies and gentlemen.
Fellows, take the music down, will you?

207
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,870
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

208
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,049
I mentioned to Gen. Cunningham
the other day...

209
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:20,609
how proud we were that Al had chosen us...

210
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,019
over all the medical schools in the country.

211
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,717
John, why don't you tell everyone
what you said?

212
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,225
Be glad to, Walter.

213
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,459
I just got back from a month at the front.

214
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,661
There are thousands of our boys
in field hospitals...

215
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,862
all over North Africa and Italy...

216
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,969
who owe their lives to Dr. Blalock's work
in the treatment of shock.

217
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:47,137
I want everyone here to know
how grateful we are to him...

218
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,707
and how proud you all should be.

219
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,648
Hear, hear.

220
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,520
- Dr. Blalock, welcome.
- Thank you.

221
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,351
Thanks, General.
It's great to have you here, Al...

222
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,019
but truth be told, it's Mary we really want.

223
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,655
Our new Chairman
of the Department of Surgery...

224
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:09,429
my old and dear friend, Dr. Alfred Blalock.

225
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,500
Thank you, Walter.

226
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,243
Mary and I welcome you all to our home.

227
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,219
As do our dear children.

228
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,153
- Sadie, get them to bed, now.
- No!

229
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,890
Thank you, Johns Hopkins,
for my prodigal return...

230
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,660
after 15 years in the Tennessee backwoods.

231
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,628
To find myself back here.

232
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,128
Dreams do come true.

233
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,811
You're the best surgeons in the country
and I'm honored to lead you.

234
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,640
To use a timely reference:

235
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,084
"We'll storm the beaches together.
Shoulder to shoulder."

236
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,746
Lay siege to the mysteries of medicine.

237
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:05,916
We'll make the kind of progress
Hopkins used to be known for.

238
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,621
I know we will accomplish
great things together.

239
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:29,606
I'm looking
for my next watershed discovery...

240
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,116
not to put too modest a point on it.

241
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,847
It's not enough for us to be great surgeons.

242
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:38,686
We need to be outstanding researchers.
Any ideas? Anything innovative?

243
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,919
What about skin grafts?
Testing what skin grips might take.

244
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,192
- Isn't skin merely packaging?
- No, it keeps out infection.

245
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,426
Excuse me, Doctor,
may I suggest something?

246
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,298
Please do. I'm very suggestible.
Tell us your name again.

247
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:54,773
- I run the Harriet Lane Clinic for children.
- Dr. Taussig. Yes, of course.

248
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:59,002
Dr. Longmire, Dr. Kelven, Dr. Cooley.

249
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,841
I've read about your research.

250
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,973
- On congenitally malformed hearts.
- Yes.

251
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,812
Boy, women and their hearts.

252
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,853
Vivien, would you get Dr. Taussig a drink?

253
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:10,617
- What would you like?
- Champagne would be lovely.

254
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,420
Let's lubricate the vein of inspiration.

255
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,986
Go on, Dr.Taussig tell us more.

256
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:20,533
It's something that up to now
has been written off as untreatable.

257
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:24,570
But I don't believe it has to be.
I'm speaking of Tetralogy of Fallot.

258
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,863
Blue babies.

259
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,407
Yes, these children,
their hearts aren't failing...

260
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:32,239
they're suffocating due to a blockage
in the main artery to the lung.

261
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:34,177
Pulmonary stenosis.

262
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,879
The mortality rate is 100%.

263
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,546
I've watched
hundreds of cyanotic children die.

264
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:44,215
I admitted a baby tonight
who will certainly die...

265
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,815
simply because
no one has had the courage...

266
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:49,661
to attempt a surgical solution to this.

267
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,492
Maybe with good reason.

268
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,897
To put it mildly, you can't operate
on the heart. That's basic.

269
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,866
- We don't have clinical proof of that--
- My point exactly.

270
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,872
- It's possible for us--
- Denton, you have to stop the heart...

271
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,499
to perform a complicated correction
within three minutes.

272
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,010
By that time, they're dead.
These children are doomed.

273
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,650
There must be a way
to get more blood to the lungs.

274
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,011
I mean, I doubt we could
repair a defect in the heart walls--

275
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,213
Without causing ventricular fibrillation.

276
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:19,918
But maybe there's a way to avoid interfering
with the greater circulation....

277
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,188
If we focus on the pulmonary artery.

278
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,154
Who on this God's earth are you?

279
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:56,290
- Brought home some food from the party.
- I'm trying to get her down.

280
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:57,624
Hold on.

281
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,197
Okay, girl. Now go to sleep, baby.

282
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,535
The girls are just getting to bed?

283
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:13,807
2-ton neighbor upstairs
nearly burst through the boards.

284
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:17,945
- I'm gonna have to fix that.
- Are you gonna fix the fat man?

285
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,817
Get him to stop hollering his head off,
when the girls is trying to sleep?

286
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:25,587
Try a deviled egg. They're real good.

287
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:27,822
Seen better in Nashville.

288
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,323
I want to go home, Viv.

289
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,492
Clara, it's our first week.

290
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah, and you said
if we didn't like it, remember?

291
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:43,471
- Yes.
- Our family's in Nashville.

292
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,607
We had a nice home in a
good neighborhood. The schools were fine.

293
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,181
Not living in this....

294
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,945
I don't know how we're gonna make it
on that paycheck he's talking about...

295
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:56,750
and he got you serving drinks at his party
just to make ends meet. Come on.

296
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,325
Try to understand.
When I started at Vanderbilt...

297
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:00,620
- I was a janitor.
- I know.

298
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,992
Dr. Blalock saw what I could contribute,
and he gave me a chance.

299
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,622
And when they offered him
that big job in Detroit...

300
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,327
he didn't take it because they didn't take me.

301
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,001
Now I'm a lab assistant to a top surgeon...

302
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,801
at the number one medical school
in the country.

303
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,809
- It's a good position.
- What about you going to medical school?

304
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,778
You don't have to remind me of that.
We have a family now.

305
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,620
Sweetheart, it's important work.

306
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:36,188
And it's a real opportunity,
and I love what I'm doing.

307
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,999
So it doesn't really matter
how I feel, then, does it?

308
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,001
Clara, you know it matters.

309
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,918
See that man?

310
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,115
That's Johns Hopkins himself.

311
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,526
Sir William Osler...

312
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,891
the father of modern American medicine.

313
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,102
William Halstead, invented the mastectomy.

314
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,468
Let me show you some of the others.

315
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:34,244
Excuse me.
All workers punch in at the rear entrance.

316
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,825
- He's with me.
- That don't make any difference.

317
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,791
- Do you know who I am?
- No, sir.

318
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:47,131
Dr. Blalock, Chief Surgical Professor.

319
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:50,092
I'm sorry, Dr. Blalock, but that's the rules.

320
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,266
I'll meet you in the labs, Vivien.

321
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,215
Hey, you need to punch in first.

322
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,059
Thank you.

323
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,680
I can see we've arrived.

324
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,709
When was the last time
they used this place?

325
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:14,548
Have someone clean it up
before they put the equipment in.

326
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,986
I'll meet you in an hour
at the Harriet Lane wards.

327
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,491
Let's see if there's anything
in this idea of Dr. Taussig's.

328
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:52,520
Excuse me?

329
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,827
Good morning.

330
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,622
Where do you think I could find someone
to help us clean up the lab, Doctor?

331
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:02,896
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I'm not sure.

332
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:06,973
I'm Vivien Thomas,
I work for Dr. Blalock, running this lab.

333
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,507
I'm Dr. Edgar V. Hecker...

334
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:15,211
Director of Laboratories.
I'd like some coffee and a doughnut.

335
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,676
Doctor.

336
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,481
There must be a mix-up.

337
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,890
Listen, I don't stand for insolence.
We'll see about this.

338
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,227
- You know, Doctor, there aren't many--
- What?

339
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,034
You'll have to speak up,
I can't hear too well in this ear.

340
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:43,974
You're one of the few women doctors
I've seen here.

341
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,573
At least they let me in
through the front door.

342
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,244
This is where we keep
some of the older kids.

343
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:02,026
Doctor, why do they squat like that?

344
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:05,988
A little boy told me
that it helps him breathe better.

345
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:10,102
It cuts off the blood to the legs,
pushes it up into the lungs.

346
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,699
They both look very cyanotic.

347
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,340
Here he is now.

348
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,639
- Dr. Blalock. Welcome.
- Helen, sorry.

349
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,749
Here is the Saxon baby
I was telling you about last night.

350
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,418
Thank you.

351
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:48,066
She usually smiles
when someone does that.

352
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,641
Hello, Mrs. Saxon.

353
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:56,309
- What is that thing?
- It's an oximeter.

354
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,544
Reads how much oxygen
there is in the blood.

355
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:05,821
She looks cold in there. But I can't hold her.

356
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:10,088
They say it isn't good for her.
I'm not even supposed to let her cry.

357
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:13,962
How do you keep a baby from crying?
Especially if you can't hold her.

358
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:20,163
You can see the change
in the shape and the size of the vessels...

359
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,070
as these hearts grow larger.

360
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:26,209
I did necroscopies
on some of my patients' hearts.

361
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,413
To study the malformations in detail.

362
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:31,484
It's amazing they could live at all
with hearts like these.

363
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:34,314
Dr. Gross at Harvard
said only God could correct...

364
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,685
a narrowing indentation
of the left side of the aortic arch.

365
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,226
Perhaps that statement says
more about Harvard than it does about God.

366
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,127
That baby back there, how long?

367
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,135
Six months. A year at the very most.

368
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:52,602
- That's not right.
- Are you going to take this on, Doctor?

369
00:32:57,577 --> 00:33:00,546
I want to see all your diagnostic notes.

370
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,879
I'll get them right away.

371
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:08,251
Thank you.

372
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,999
Put away the books, Vivien.

373
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,874
Let's not waste any more time
on theoretical crap.

374
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:31,102
Let's start with experiments.

375
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:35,648
Four separate defects of the heart
working in combination.

376
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:41,742
The pulmonary artery is constricted...

377
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:47,016
in the main artery before the divide,
diminishing blood supply to both lungs.

378
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,826
And the hole in the septum...

379
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,333
causes the used blood
to flow back into the arterial system...

380
00:33:56,069 --> 00:34:00,267
instead of flowing through the lungs,
turning the babies blue.

381
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,539
A baby's heart is delicate.

382
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,837
It's a goddamn minefield.

383
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:15,045
The first step is to see if we can create
the "blue baby" condition in a dog...

384
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,588
and then come up with a plan to solve it.

385
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,855
You're drinking too much coffee.

386
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:26,261
Balzac drank 300 cups of coffee in one day.

387
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:32,028
Of course, he died of a perforated ulcer.

388
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:38,501
Odds are against us
reproducing this in the laboratory.

389
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,876
Are you sure this is the limb
you want to climb out on?

390
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,044
Back in '29, when I had TB...

391
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:54,917
the x-rays showed a big gaping hole
in my left lung.

392
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,821
I laid there on a freezing porch...

393
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:02,167
in a sanatorium in upstate New York...

394
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:05,067
with 18 blankets on me.

395
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,662
Nothing but my nose
exposed to the elements.

396
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,742
Death's a very humbling thing to live with
day in and day out.

397
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,712
I swore then...

398
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:24,254
if I got my life back,
I would do something important with it.

399
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:32,157
I know, in every fiber of my being...

400
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:36,099
that this is a limb I want to climb out on.

401
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,535
It's gonna be hell
trying to work with a child's vessels...

402
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,609
three or four millimeters thick.

403
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,406
Like sewing over cooked spaghetti noodles.

404
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,580
We'll need the smallest sutures.

405
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,009
We'll need to make our own tools.

406
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:57,245
- We could be in for trouble, Vivien.
- Big trouble.

407
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:03,323
- Dr. Alfred Blalock to OR, please.
- They're driving me crazy.

408
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:06,659
This goddamn war.

409
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,334
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.

410
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,700
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.

411
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:12,896
If I'm not operating, I'm teaching.

412
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,500
You're gonna have to do
most of this research.

413
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,399
What'll you need?

414
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:24,578
I need a bulldog clamp
small enough for the baby...

415
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:27,448
but strong enough
to stop the flow of blood.

416
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,453
What about a breathing device?

417
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:34,225
I'd love a Positive Pressure Respirator,
but with this war going on....

418
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:38,887
Yeah, how in hell can I do the experiments
if I can't even get the equipment?

419
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,500
Shut up.

420
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,662
You surely pissed off Ed Hecker.

421
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,639
You mean I disturbed his afternoon nap?

422
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:53,603
What is it with you
and that boy of yours? Thomas.

423
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,813
Why'd you bring him up here?

424
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:58,509
We've been together more than 12 years.

425
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:03,521
He's a really good worker.

426
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:09,889
How about a little wager?

427
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,656
$50?

428
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:21,464
- Give him a break, Dick.
- You're on.

429
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:25,973
There's a rumor going around
you're contemplating heart surgery.

430
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,740
That's an intriguing rumor, don't you think?

431
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:32,750
Wouldn't it be a feather in our cap
if we were the first ones to do it?

432
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:36,185
Indeed, it would.
But I hope you'll forgive my skepticism.

433
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,019
There is no reason for us
to think it's possible.

434
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,891
And every indicator says it can't be done.

435
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:46,160
Most of us agree, Al, the risks are huge.

436
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,397
There isn't even any incremental progress.

437
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,742
Where you see risks, I see opportunity.

438
00:38:06,052 --> 00:38:08,247
You gotta take care of that sink up in 4-B.

439
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:10,219
You said you were gonna fix these steps.

440
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:13,850
Yes, forgive me, I've been very busy at work.
But I will get to it.

441
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,225
The deal is $7 off for odd jobs every month.

442
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,293
You gotta pick up the pace.

443
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,820
With allied forces fighting at Cassino...

444
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:47,518
German Field Marshal Kesselring
has earned a reputation as one of our few....

445
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,352
This is good, sweetheart.
It's got some kick to it tonight.

446
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:55,560
The same as last night.
Just put it on a different side of the plate.

447
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:57,761
Sometimes it's better the next day.

448
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,638
I hope so, 'cause guess what?

449
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,373
Tomorrow it's hash a la king.

450
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,435
It's hash a la queen tonight.

451
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,216
I could get a job.

452
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,160
Who'll look after the girls?

453
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:37,067
I know it's not Nashville.

454
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,413
And I know...

455
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:45,348
I wouldn't be able to do
what I'm doing without you.

456
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,383
My father took care of us,
I'll take care of you.

457
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,823
And everything's gonna be just fine.
We'll be just fine here.

458
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:58,260
I know, you're right. We'll be fine here.

459
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,929
We're gonna run out of dogs
at this rate, Vivien.

460
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:07,972
It's been three months,
and all I'm closer to is retirement.

461
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:12,033
Things move slow sometimes.
No matter what you want.

462
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,779
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.

463
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:17,715
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.

464
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,444
That dog was faintly blue at best.

465
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:22,953
Until we get the dog in the same state
as the baby, we can't go forward.

466
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:27,014
- What is the problem?
- Every time I constrict, it kills the dogs.

467
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,626
I've tried nylon, ligature,
umbilical tape, ox facet.

468
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:34,157
We need a new approach.

469
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:38,034
Okay, forget constriction.

470
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:42,273
Try a partial lobectomy.
Remove both lobes of the right lung.

471
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:46,869
Do an arteries to veins fistula,
where the medial wall of the aorta...

472
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:48,970
and the pulmonary artery adhere.

473
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,211
I'll be in the OR.

474
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:59,522
That's a very good idea, Doctor. Thank you.

475
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:05,388
- God damn it!
- You did the best you could.

476
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,989
With the condition of his liver,
you never had a chance.

477
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,034
I always have a chance.

478
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:12,864
- Get me his autopsy.
- Yes.

479
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:19,466
Shit.

480
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:21,740
Damn.

481
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,776
- What's that?
- Our new respirator.

482
00:41:29,288 --> 00:41:31,552
I was rummaging around the machine shop.

483
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:35,058
It's not pretty, but it works.

484
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,388
It is pretty.

485
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:46,435
I knew I could count on you.
You're the only one I can trust around here.

486
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:49,667
I suspect others relish the thought
of seeing me fail.

487
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:03,853
Mary!

488
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:14,567
- There's an ambulance in the driveway.
- Good evening.

489
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,431
- There's an ambulance in the driveway.
- Good evening.

490
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,328
Gen. Cunningham needed help
carting wounded Gl's off the ship.

491
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:24,535
So I volunteered to be a driver on the base.

492
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:31,249
- That's wonderful.
- Not really.

493
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,118
I've a lot of time on my hands.

494
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,346
She wouldn't go to bed?

495
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,220
Not until you came home.

496
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:44,326
You know what she said today?

497
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:48,256
She said she wanted to be a patient
when she grows up.

498
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,434
So she can get to see her daddy.

499
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:02,739
I don't remember you wearing a tool belt
at your coming-out party.

500
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:08,050
Guess it has been...

501
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,588
a couple of weeks
since I made it home before 11:00.

502
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,089
No, it's 23 days.

503
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:18,091
Not as if I don't know
the lot of a doctor's wife...

504
00:43:19,532 --> 00:43:20,760
but I miss you.

505
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,805
It's gonna change.

506
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,108
It's probably gonna get worse.

507
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,814
- Vivien.
- Dr. Longmire.

508
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:41,648
- Is Dr. Blalock in?
- No, he's not.

509
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:44,917
I don't know where he is.
You should check his office.

510
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,370
That's an interesting procedure.
Never seen a clamp like that before.

511
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,068
- It is for small vascular work.
- Where'd you get it?

512
00:44:08,547 --> 00:44:11,539
I pieced it together
from some things lying around.

513
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:15,318
Now we're getting somewhere.

514
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:24,789
You're not even looking.

515
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:29,465
It's like when you come home
late at night, you know?

516
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,933
You know the feel of the room in the dark.

517
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,408
That looks impossible.

518
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,670
No, if I can do it, you can do it.

519
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,171
You see, this string here...

520
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:47,285
that's how you get traction on the suture...

521
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:51,083
'cause you need a lot of exposure
for the anastomosis.

522
00:44:54,927 --> 00:44:57,088
I'd like to work with you sometime.

523
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,923
Fine, Dr. Longmire, that'd be fine.

524
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:05,402
My emergency rotation starts in 10 minutes,
but I can come in on Thursday.

525
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:08,329
That'd be fine. You have a good day, Doctor.

526
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:52,409
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

527
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:54,920
Supreme Court, finally made it.

528
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,584
A long time. You been working
on this case for what, nine years?

529
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,488
- No, 12 years.
- 12 years?

530
00:46:03,462 --> 00:46:04,656
Time.

531
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:08,060
So, tell me, what was it like?

532
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:12,802
Nine white guys in big gowns
walked in first.

533
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:14,805
Then the school board lawyers.

534
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:19,071
Our lawyer, Thurgood Marshall,
he looked kind of lonely in there.

535
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:22,245
You know what them people
said in their brief?

536
00:46:22,348 --> 00:46:25,715
Said since colored teachers in Nashville
live so cheaply...

537
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:29,049
they should pay us
a whole lot less than white teachers.

538
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,684
But let me tell you...

539
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,759
Thurgood said he'd be goddamned
if they could get away with that.

540
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,819
So he gets up and says to that white lawyer,
"You're full of it.

541
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:42,527
"Have you ever read the Constitution?

542
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,899
"The damned 14th Amendment.
The equal protection clause says:

543
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:49,734
"'A government can't discriminate
based on race."'

544
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:53,741
Yes, Lord. I mean he was good, Viv.

545
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:57,109
I think we got the Board of Education
on the run.

546
00:46:57,216 --> 00:47:00,515
That's good news, Harold.
So when will they decide?

547
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,620
Could be months, longer.

548
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,688
I don't know, but I can wait.
After all these years.

549
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,123
All those calls I got
in the middle of the night.

550
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:11,719
White folk telling me they gonna kill me
if I don't drop this lawsuit.

551
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,822
No, you gotta show them
you won't take that treatment.

552
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:18,696
Wait. Listen to me when I tell you,
you need to leave this sorry-ass place...

553
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:20,203
and that dead-end job.

554
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:23,240
Harold, Dr. Blalock's
doing the best he can for me.

555
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:24,809
It's not enough.

556
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,540
He trusts me to carry out those experiments
on my own. I'm running the whole lab.

557
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:32,276
- Thank you.
- But does he compensate you extra for that?

558
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,944
Now, Harold, Vivien's doing
important research now.

559
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:37,045
But he's forgetting
what Granddaddy told us.

560
00:47:37,156 --> 00:47:40,125
He said he regretted
acting so grateful for being free...

561
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,591
for what really wasn't any freedom at all.

562
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,161
I know, I remember.

563
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,773
What you giving him extra for?
What's wrong with me?

564
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,639
Nothing minding your own business
wouldn't cure.

565
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:05,677
You got that white coat.

566
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:09,221
But you're just a class three worker,
same as me.

567
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:09,312
But you're just a class three worker,
same as me.

568
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:13,188
In fact, I got two years' seniority on you.

569
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:15,454
I'm making more than you.

570
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:18,329
Don't think you're
some kind of big shot around here.

571
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,729
Excuse me, buddy.
Class three, what does that mean?

572
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,158
It means salary grade.

573
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:27,662
And, ma'am, and this here? What's this?

574
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:30,097
Job classification.

575
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,536
What is class three?

576
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,742
Maintenance worker.

577
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,816
I'm a lab technician. That can't be.

578
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,584
"Vivien Thomas."

579
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:51,420
Okay. Here we go.

580
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,260
"Vivien Thomas, class three."

581
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:57,301
Thank you.

582
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,971
- How's it going?
- The vessel's tolerating ligation.

583
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,780
Any progress?

584
00:49:14,086 --> 00:49:17,613
If you kill that dog,
I swear I will take it out of your paycheck.

585
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:23,693
I'm finished up here.

586
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:27,094
Dr. Longmire, would you mind
closing up for me? Thank you.

587
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:31,665
Come on, Vivien.

588
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,351
I was kidding
about taking it out of your paycheck.

589
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:01,364
Good luck. 'Cause I only make $16 a week.

590
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:05,498
- For a 16-hour day.
- That's all they can pay.

591
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:08,471
That's all they can pay
class three workers around here.

592
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:10,337
What are you talking about?

593
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,879
That's my job classification.

594
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,242
Who cares what they call you?

595
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:22,582
You and I both know
how valuable the work is that you do.

596
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:27,250
If my work is so important,
then why am I class three?

597
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:31,321
Two grades below what I do.
In classification and pay.

598
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,490
I don't know why.
I don't pay attention to bureaucratic details.

599
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,624
I see.

600
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:39,429
Look, at Hopkins you can't be a technician
without a college degree.

601
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:42,507
- And where are you going?
- I need to fix some steps.

602
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:45,905
We have work to do.

603
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:50,175
Do I have your permission
to do some work for my landlord...

604
00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:51,749
so I can pay my rent?

605
00:50:57,089 --> 00:51:00,456
Dr. Blalock, could you come here, please?

606
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,329
You're not gonna believe this.

607
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,824
Look at the oximeter.

608
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,809
The gums are blue, Doctor. Vivien did it.

609
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:26,376
Off, Alfred.

610
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,522
I brought him up here...

611
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,486
I gave him this opportunity.

612
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:38,359
I don't set the pay scale.
I just don't see what more I can do.

613
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,431
You're probably feeling guilty.

614
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:44,163
Guilty? What the hell
do I have to feel guilty about?

615
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,861
For not sending him to college.

616
00:51:45,971 --> 00:51:48,132
You think I should have
sent Vivien to college?

617
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,107
Sure, why not? Told me that was his dream.

618
00:51:51,343 --> 00:51:54,779
- Even mentioned it to me once.
- You know I need him in the lab.

619
00:51:57,783 --> 00:52:00,650
I guess there's only so much good
one person can do.

620
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:03,787
Congratulations on the dog.

621
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,990
The kind of raise you're suggesting,
how important is this?

622
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:13,328
He makes it possible for me
to be in many places at the same time.

623
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,798
Can't you just hire
a well-trained college kid--

624
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:18,699
No, I can't. His hands are important to me.

625
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:21,500
He's good at following my instructions,
improving on them...

626
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,301
better than anyone I've encountered.

627
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:26,343
You want me to circumvent
every administrative regulation...

628
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:27,912
on behalf of a colored helper?

629
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,777
Walter, I'm close
to accomplishing something.

630
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,407
I need him with me
so I can continue with my research.

631
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,486
Can I count on your help?

632
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:40,490
Hello, Clara.

633
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,984
Dr. Blalock.

634
00:52:46,064 --> 00:52:47,554
Come in, sir.

635
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,131
Thank you.

636
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:55,798
Is Vivien at home?

637
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:58,605
Yes, he's putting the kids down.

638
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:09,515
You know, in 13 years, Dr. Blalock...

639
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:12,590
I don't recall
you ever stopping by our house.

640
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:16,022
I don't recall ever being invited.

641
00:53:16,795 --> 00:53:18,092
Professor.

642
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:20,758
Did something happen?

643
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:23,699
Yes, I obtained a raise for you,
$25 extra a month...

644
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:25,463
on top of what you're already making.

645
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,300
That's $300 for the whole year.
Will that be sufficient?

646
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:32,366
- What job classification?
- Surgical technician. I got you promoted.

647
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:35,205
Promoted. To what he already does.

648
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,214
Excuse me.

649
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:49,524
You can pay your rent
and put all your focus on our research.

650
00:53:49,628 --> 00:53:53,086
Vivien, back there in the lab with Ponchos,
what did you do?

651
00:53:53,632 --> 00:53:56,260
What you suggested. A partial fistula.

652
00:53:56,835 --> 00:54:00,168
I stitched the main arteries
and veins together, end-to-end...

653
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:01,773
and two lobes in the lungs.

654
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:02,330
and two lobes in the lungs.

655
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:06,042
We created a blue baby's heart in that dog.

656
00:54:10,382 --> 00:54:11,508
Did we?

657
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:14,779
Now we have our disease model,
we can find a cure.

658
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,046
And much as I enjoyed
coming here to see you...

659
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:21,284
would you mind terribly
if I got you a telephone?

660
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:24,486
No, not at all.

661
00:54:25,197 --> 00:54:26,494
Thank you.

662
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,827
A shunt.

663
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,608
I'm sorry, Doctor. What'd you say?

664
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:43,708
We need to create a shunt
to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs.

665
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,317
Can't see how to do it.

666
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:54,851
Remember back in Vanderbilt
when we were doing the research...

667
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:58,228
on how to create high blood pressure
in the lungs?

668
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:02,560
Yes, I connected the subclavian
to the pulmonary artery.

669
00:55:03,702 --> 00:55:06,136
We failed to get the higher blood pressure...

670
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:08,706
but we did get higher blood flow.

671
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,575
Which is exactly
what Dr. Taussig said these babies need.

672
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:19,416
That's it. We build a bypass.

673
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,949
Take an artery and redirect it.

674
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:29,125
- Systemic artery to the pulmonary artery.
- Through the lungs.

675
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:33,889
It's a long way around, but it gets you there.

676
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:37,594
If we wait from the right side,
we have an advantage there.

677
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:41,433
But the recurrent nerve is in the way,
and if we kink that--

678
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,441
- Vocal cords parallel.
- And the carotid's here.

679
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:47,740
We may kill the brain if we damage that.

680
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:50,542
Comforting thought.

681
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,881
The subclavian....

682
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,014
Tie it off.

683
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:04,086
After the divide.

684
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:10,262
Cut it right under the clavicle.

685
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:12,496
Swing it down.

686
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,431
Long, slow general arc.

687
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,338
Will it hold if we pull it down four inches?

688
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,001
If your hands don't get too excited.

689
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:23,907
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

690
00:56:24,082 --> 00:56:26,983
No one's ever done anything as hard as this.

691
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,417
Changing the course of blood.

692
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:32,012
It'd turn blue into pink.

693
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:39,860
And death into life.

694
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,253
I don't care what the chart says.

695
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,721
This girl wants to live.

696
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:25,506
- Retractor.
- No, suture.

697
00:57:26,645 --> 00:57:29,375
Can't we try things my way occasionally?

698
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,173
All right.

699
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:33,979
Sutures.

700
00:57:38,356 --> 00:57:41,257
Do you mind
if I show you something, Doctor?

701
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,630
Thank you.

702
00:57:58,376 --> 00:57:59,968
Do you need any help?

703
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:02,171
No, that's fine. Thank you.

704
00:58:07,018 --> 00:58:10,112
I have to purse-string the anastomosis.

705
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,584
Okay, there. He's all yours, Doctor.

706
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:23,024
Do you feel the connection?

707
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:28,528
Are you sure you did this, Vivien?

708
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,935
This is like something the Lord made.

709
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:43,014
Look, Mr. Saxon, Mrs. Saxon...

710
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:46,720
I acknowledge
that these are uncharted waters.

711
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:48,315
There are risks.

712
00:58:48,426 --> 00:58:53,056
But I think we have found a way
to repair your daughter's heart.

713
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,593
How?

714
00:58:57,001 --> 00:59:00,630
You're stationed, where,
Norfolk, is it, Mr. Saxon?

715
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:01,967
Yes, sir.

716
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:05,236
Been working on the Spencer,
trying to get her back out to sea.

717
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,675
You work on the engines, right?

718
00:59:07,779 --> 00:59:09,041
Yes, sir.

719
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:12,241
I'd be changing around some of the piping...

720
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,215
Ieading to and from your daughter's heart.

721
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:19,815
- Just switching around the pipes?
- Yes.

722
00:59:20,492 --> 00:59:23,393
Arteries that bring the blood...

723
00:59:23,495 --> 00:59:25,326
to and from the heart to the lungs...

724
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,920
act just like pipes.

725
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:31,134
I've been successful,
switching them around.

726
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:36,438
- It's that easy?
- No, it's not that easy.

727
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:38,370
No surgery is...

728
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:41,104
and this operation
has special complications.

729
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:43,737
But I still think it's worth doing.

730
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,884
We're going to talk about this, Doctor.

731
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,926
Good idea.

732
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:07,065
It's going to be a lot harder with a baby.

733
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:10,665
We're going to have to collapse
one of her lungs.

734
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,137
She's already so cyanotic.

735
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,905
She's not getting enough oxygen...

736
01:00:17,015 --> 01:00:20,746
and we're going to have to take away
half of her lung function.

737
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:24,716
You made those new clamps yet?

738
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:26,313
I'm working on it.

739
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:29,519
What if I shred her insides
with those clamps?

740
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,891
So many ways to fail.

741
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,560
Every second counts.

742
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,727
A single minute is too long.

743
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:40,566
A single minute
of poor blood flow to the brain...

744
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:44,199
a single second of open bleeding....

745
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:49,175
Are you saying
I shouldn't allow this doctor...

746
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,042
to perform a miracle to save my baby?

747
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,778
We don't get to demand miracles.

748
01:00:54,886 --> 01:00:57,548
Honey, God has his plans.

749
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,819
Maybe we just have to accept it.

750
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:03,325
But I was so happy
when I was pregnant with Eileen.

751
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:08,929
You know, I haven't had enough time.
Why can't God let me get to know her first?

752
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,531
I mean, I don't want to go against him.

753
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:15,401
But why can't His plan be...

754
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:18,141
to let this doctor save her life?

755
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:21,772
Prof. Blalock.

756
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:26,313
Mrs. Saxon told me
you plan to operate on her baby.

757
01:01:26,618 --> 01:01:29,610
- Have you seen this child, Doctor?
- I check on her every day.

758
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:33,316
And you're still going to proceed?
Have you had any success in the lab?

759
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:37,758
Absolutely. I successfully performed
a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago.

760
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:42,060
I can't imagine you're going to proceed
based on the laboratory success on a dog.

761
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,464
How many people have you saved?

762
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:49,101
So what you're saying is
you're performing an experiment...

763
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,265
not an operation?

764
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:54,243
My instincts tell me
nature made a mistake and I can fix it.

765
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:57,610
Would you like to see
what I've been doing, Father?

766
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:12,830
Right now my instincts tell me
perhaps you should come back another day.

767
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:17,463
What? Your quest for glory is vain, arrogant.

768
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:21,004
It takes arrogance to cut someone
with a scalpel to save their life.

769
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:25,098
I have no doubt.
But if you intervene with God's will...

770
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,402
violate the purity of an innocent heart...

771
01:02:28,513 --> 01:02:32,472
the parents, not you, Doctor,
will bear the burden of guilt.

772
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:36,178
Perhaps God is, as you say,
trying to kill this child.

773
01:02:36,888 --> 01:02:38,378
I am not.

774
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,651
Look at this. The shunt gave out.

775
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,889
Looks like a train wreck.

776
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:53,234
What happened to you, Ponchos?

777
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:56,540
- Maybe we should just stop here, Doctor.
- No.

778
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,871
We using the wrong vessel?

779
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:05,407
What the hell's going on?

780
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,693
Viv, get up.

781
01:03:19,697 --> 01:03:21,665
Wake up. It's okay.

782
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:24,459
It's okay, baby.

783
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:29,538
- It's just a nightmare.
- My God.

784
01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:37,646
Where the hell have you been, Vivien?

785
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:41,708
I had a dream
about this white woman last night.

786
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,778
Perhaps that's something
best kept to yourself.

787
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:46,083
No.

788
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:50,456
I knew it was Eileen Saxon.
She was all grown up.

789
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:55,097
She was sitting there in a corner.
She was knitting...

790
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,332
and she let out a baby voice...

791
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,771
and she fell over dead. I couldn't see it...

792
01:04:01,873 --> 01:04:04,842
but I knew on the inside
she had a baby heart.

793
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:09,242
- She just fell over dead.
- What the hell does that have to do with....

794
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:18,216
The stitches didn't grow.

795
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:22,986
When we did the shunt on Ponchos,
he was 10 pounds. He went up to 20.

796
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:26,188
- He pulled it loose.
- I was wrong. Purse-stringing doesn't work.

797
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:29,596
We need a new stitching technique.

798
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:32,464
Continuous on the back wall,
interrupted on the front wall.

799
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,037
That's what we need.

800
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:37,434
And then, the shunt will grow.

801
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:41,678
65% oxygenation.
She's deteriorating so rapidly.

802
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:45,574
- Have we got time to practice the operation?
- We can't let up.

803
01:04:45,683 --> 01:04:49,119
- What about the new stitching technique?
- We're trying it out tomorrow.

804
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:54,146
You have to see this.

805
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:58,058
Vivien Thomas is operating,
assisted by the Chief of Surgery.

806
01:05:03,468 --> 01:05:06,437
Pull the inbound vein anastomosis.

807
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:09,805
Long, slow, general arc.

808
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:13,741
I can't see. Can you see, Vivien?
Could you adjust that lamp?

809
01:05:15,613 --> 01:05:17,808
Are the clamps still holding?

810
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:20,540
- Yes.
- No kinking?

811
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:21,777
None.

812
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,821
All right, now for the tough part.

813
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,915
Continuous sutures on the back wall...

814
01:05:30,495 --> 01:05:32,588
interrupted on the front.

815
01:05:45,176 --> 01:05:47,110
Removing bulldog clamp.

816
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,514
Come on, girl.

817
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,641
Come on, please.

818
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:58,017
That's it, a little bit more.

819
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:01,053
I can feel the flow to the lungs.

820
01:06:03,494 --> 01:06:07,055
Helen, tell the Saxons we'll be operating.

821
01:06:07,165 --> 01:06:08,496
You bet.

822
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,696
You'll be ready.

823
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:17,705
Yes, now that I've seen the master at work.

824
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,703
Master of the hounds.

825
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,176
Your daddy should be proud of you.

826
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,872
I think he is.

827
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:28,048
Mine was only proud of the fact
that I could wiggle my ears.

828
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,779
I think he'll be proud when you operate.

829
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:32,446
He's dead.

830
01:06:33,891 --> 01:06:36,359
The dead are with us all the time, I believe.

831
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,655
Can't separate the past from the future...

832
01:06:38,763 --> 01:06:41,755
any more than you can
your right arm from your left arm.

833
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:45,165
But, you see, they are separated...

834
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:48,071
by this, by the heart.

835
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,030
Or connected.

836
01:06:52,643 --> 01:06:53,871
Or connected.

837
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:06,185
Nolitangere; Do not touch.

838
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:09,126
Do not touch the heart.

839
01:07:11,329 --> 01:07:14,730
We are gonna challenge
this ancient doctrinal myth...

840
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:18,426
in this hospital. Who wants to attend?

841
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:24,234
Dr. Swedlin?

842
01:07:26,077 --> 01:07:27,942
Dr. Philmore?

843
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:35,312
Dr. Cooley.

844
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:39,386
And Dr. Longmire.

845
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,659
Thank you.

846
01:07:53,704 --> 01:07:56,104
You're dangling your reputation off a cliff.

847
01:07:56,207 --> 01:07:58,198
Calm down, Walter, this isn't grand opera.

848
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:01,403
Isn't a doctor's first tenet: "Do no harm"?

849
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,876
What are you saying?

850
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,945
Postpone the operation
until you have more experience.

851
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,315
Postponing means
signing that baby's death warrant.

852
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,150
- I will not be the one to do that.
- But they'll ruin you.

853
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:16,192
Walter, I'm operating tomorrow.

854
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:22,332
You're rushing this...

855
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,364
because you don't want to admit
to those parents...

856
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:27,437
that you spoke too soon.

857
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,895
You should come to bed.

858
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:54,687
I tried that.

859
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:00,531
Can I give you a ride
to the hospital tomorrow?

860
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:01,832
Thanks.

861
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:07,073
I could use the lift.
I don't trust myself behind the wheel.

862
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:10,371
Al, anybody would be nervous.

863
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,371
It's not that.

864
01:09:16,454 --> 01:09:19,389
I was just thinking
about a remark you made.

865
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,851
You said I used to be wild...

866
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,824
not just ambitious.

867
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:32,366
But I wonder if my ambition
hasn't driven me wild.

868
01:10:31,128 --> 01:10:33,221
Dr. Taussig, Professor.

869
01:10:34,832 --> 01:10:38,063
I just wanted to wish good luck to everyone.

870
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:40,397
Thank you, Vivien.

871
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:42,095
Thanks, Vivien.

872
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:57,644
We're going to block
that baby's pulmonary artery for 30 minutes.

873
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:04,626
As long as her blood pressure doesn't go
below 60, I think she should be fine.

874
01:11:04,929 --> 01:11:07,363
I don't think
she can survive much lower than that.

875
01:11:07,465 --> 01:11:10,832
- Isn't that right, Dr. Harmel?
- Not below 60. That's right, Doctor.

876
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:13,199
Dr. Blalock, they're ready.

877
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:19,641
Doctor.

878
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:28,978
Coming in now.

879
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:55,538
Dr. Longmire.

880
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:04,451
What is going on?

881
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,195
They won't page him.

882
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:20,667
- Why not?
- Something about hospital policy.

883
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:25,866
Page Vivien Thomas immediately.

884
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,805
Dr. Blalock, what's wrong?
What's happened?

885
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:30,469
It's all right.
I won't tell you again. Page him.

886
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:34,514
- We're only allowed to page doctors.
- Give me that, goddamn you.

887
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:38,880
Vivien Thomas, paging Vivien Thomas.

888
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:42,821
You're wanted in OR right now.
Come on the run, do you hear?

889
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:44,721
This is Blalock.

890
01:12:45,493 --> 01:12:47,188
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

891
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:57,434
Jesus.

892
01:12:58,473 --> 01:13:00,373
About time. Scrub up.

893
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,466
- Scrub up?
- You're coming in with me.

894
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,239
Would you find Mr. Thomas
something to stand on?

895
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:07,211
What for, Doctor?

896
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:10,307
You're talking me through this.
Now scrub up.

897
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,659
What's he doing here?

898
01:13:24,265 --> 01:13:27,200
- What the hell is that?
- I'll see about this.

899
01:13:28,836 --> 01:13:30,895
Should we say a prayer?

900
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:33,565
Forget it. He won't listen to me.

901
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,967
Dr. Blalock, a word.

902
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:39,342
- You can resume your duties.
- These are his duties.

903
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,514
- Can you see now?
- Yes, Doctor.

904
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:50,847
Okay, I think we're ready to start.

905
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:56,923
Okay, we're going in.

906
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:07,799
It's going to be all right. It'll be just fine.

907
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:10,940
She'll be all right.

908
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:16,674
Incising the mediastinum pleura...

909
01:14:16,784 --> 01:14:19,617
from the main left pulmonary artery.

910
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,121
To the apex of the pleural space.

911
01:14:22,223 --> 01:14:25,215
I'm dissecting the pulmonary artery.

912
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:27,453
Well back into the mediastinum.

913
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:29,393
This all right, Vivien?

914
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:31,256
That looks fine.

915
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:34,767
The right angle clamp.

916
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:49,775
Okay, I think it's holding.

917
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:52,819
Are you able to deliver
to the left subclavian artery?

918
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,218
I believe so. Blood pressure?

919
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,257
70, falling.

920
01:14:58,059 --> 01:15:00,220
Do not move that light.

921
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,565
And now...

922
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:10,730
- I'm dividing the--
- Careful.

923
01:15:15,676 --> 01:15:18,167
- Clamp it.
- I can't reach it, Doctor.

924
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,841
I got it. Hemorrhage controlled.

925
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:26,119
Can you see, Doctor?

926
01:15:26,754 --> 01:15:28,745
Not really. Nurse.

927
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,095
For goodness sake,
can't you even see my ears?

928
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:42,692
Sorry, Doctor.

929
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:45,834
Suture.

930
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:01,283
- Blood pressure is 68.
- Yes, go on.

931
01:16:01,656 --> 01:16:03,351
Watch the carotid.

932
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,319
Yes, traction on the suture.

933
01:16:06,427 --> 01:16:09,225
Okay, now the clamp Vivien made.

934
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:12,456
- What clamp?
- The one just there.

935
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,228
Right there, yes.

936
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:19,028
We're about to connect the shunt.

937
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,374
Blood pressure is 60.

938
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:24,110
No, 59.

939
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,237
I know, I'm almost there.

940
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:37,620
Now front, interrupted.

941
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,452
That's good, Doctor. Just a little more now.

942
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:00,640
Removing the bulldog clamp.

943
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:07,484
- I see some bleeding right--
- I know, I see it, too. Suture.

944
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:19,124
- No, Doctor, the other way.
- Yes.

945
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:23,402
Good, you got it now.

946
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:28,706
Bleeding controlled.

947
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,974
I'm palpating the connection.

948
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,977
What do you feel?

949
01:17:41,422 --> 01:17:44,414
I can't tell
if blood is flowing through the shunt.

950
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:47,085
It's just too small to feel anything.

951
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,096
Dr. Blalock, you have to see this.

952
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:05,377
My God.

953
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,318
Her blood pressure is rising.

954
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,886
Evacuate the blood in the chest cavity.

955
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:20,688
Put in the chest tube.

956
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:23,730
Are we inflating the left lung with oxygen?

957
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:26,294
Ready for closure.

958
01:18:38,913 --> 01:18:40,403
Who would have thought it possible?

959
01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:44,348
Heart surgery.
And we did it right here in Johns Hopkins.

960
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:51,419
- Thank you, Dr. Blalock.
- Thank you so much.

961
01:19:01,869 --> 01:19:03,769
I knew you could do it.

962
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:08,641
- Some operation.
- Amazing.

963
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:12,873
That child's chances were so slim.
Took a hell of a surgeon to pull her through.

964
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:15,608
He was lucky
to have that nigger in there with him.

965
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:17,547
Thomas sure saved his ass.

966
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:21,250
I'd like to see him try it without him.

967
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:33,196
You did well in there, Vivien.

968
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:35,935
Thank you.

969
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:44,001
You performed an excellent surgery, Doctor.

970
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:45,339
Yes.

971
01:19:47,515 --> 01:19:49,107
I think I did.

972
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:24,678
Please, I understand. This is a hospital.
Can you please keep your voices down?

973
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,816
I can understand how you all must feel...

974
01:20:27,922 --> 01:20:31,380
but we have been overwhelmed
with children from all across the country...

975
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:34,290
and then there's just one doctor
to perform these operations.

976
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:36,920
So if you could just go
to the administration office...

977
01:20:37,031 --> 01:20:39,932
they'll accommodate all of you
into Dr. Blalock's schedule...

978
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:41,296
as soon as possible.

979
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:43,836
All right? I'm terribly sorry.

980
01:20:45,606 --> 01:20:49,042
Making the first incision.

981
01:20:54,248 --> 01:20:56,512
- Are you there, Vivien?
- Yes, I'm here.

982
01:20:58,853 --> 01:21:01,788
Thank you for the opportunity to observe,
Dr. Blalock.

983
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:04,517
- It's an honor, Doctor.
- Again, excellent work, gentlemen.

984
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,855
Thank you, Helen.
May I introduce my colleagues...

985
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:11,762
Dr. Helen Taussig, Vivien Thomas.
This is Dr. Craford, from Stockholm...

986
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:14,699
- and Dr. Petrovsky from Leningrad.
- Honored to meet you.

987
01:21:14,802 --> 01:21:19,171
You have given surgeons around the world
great courage with your deeds.

988
01:21:19,273 --> 01:21:24,006
Coming from such an eminent surgeon
as yourself, that is a compliment, indeed.

989
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:26,677
It's been a great pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Taussig.

990
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,612
- Thank you.
- Dr. Thomas.

991
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:31,207
Call me Mr. Thomas, or Vivien.

992
01:21:31,919 --> 01:21:33,682
You're not a doctor?

993
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,882
No, I just work here with Dr. Blalock.

994
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:40,093
Can we please have
all the doctors who participated...

995
01:21:40,194 --> 01:21:42,890
in the "blue baby" operation in this shot?

996
01:21:43,364 --> 01:21:47,960
There's a young woman who hitchhiked
from Appalachia with her son.

997
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:52,033
And I think his blood levels
may be low enough to test.

998
01:21:52,406 --> 01:21:55,068
Talk to Dr. Taussig about scheduling him in.

999
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:59,169
If you'd all turn and face the center, please,
like Dr. Longmire.

1000
01:22:00,314 --> 01:22:02,077
- Helen.
- Very good.

1001
01:22:02,883 --> 01:22:06,080
Thank you,
now focus your attention here, please.

1002
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:09,521
Smile, focus here. Hold that.

1003
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:14,019
Good. Now if we could have
one of you alone, Dr. Blalock.

1004
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:22,099
Very good, sir. Focus here, if you would.

1005
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:24,360
Here we go, Doctor.

1006
01:22:27,174 --> 01:22:29,005
Thank you very much.

1007
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,750
They're nice pictures, aren't they?
They always have nice pictures.

1008
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:48,261
Just 'cause you're not in the news
doesn't mean you weren't there, Viv.

1009
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:58,161
I'll be back.

1010
01:23:34,808 --> 01:23:37,402
A man who is a real pioneer...

1011
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:40,969
a gambler who takes all the right risks...

1012
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:44,983
who's rescued untold lives
with his work in shock...

1013
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:49,449
and has gone on to challenge
the entire medical establishment...

1014
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,287
to reconsider an age-old taboo...

1015
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:56,854
in performing the world's first heart surgery.

1016
01:23:58,232 --> 01:24:01,861
Now, without embarrassing myself,
I'd like to introduce...

1017
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:05,962
a man who has undeniably
brought a dash of pink...

1018
01:24:06,106 --> 01:24:08,131
to the cheeks of others.

1019
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:10,839
Dr. Alfred Blalock.

1020
01:24:38,305 --> 01:24:41,274
Thank you. I am indeed honored.

1021
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,370
And while I am grateful...

1022
01:24:47,214 --> 01:24:51,310
for the many gifts
that have been given to me in my life...

1023
01:24:53,687 --> 01:24:57,316
perhaps the greatest gift
has been the support...

1024
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:00,722
of my colleagues over this last year.

1025
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:03,729
My good friend, Walter Dandy.

1026
01:25:05,265 --> 01:25:09,827
The wonderful, brilliant colleagues
who assisted me in our operation;

1027
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:13,473
Dr. Helen Taussig...

1028
01:25:13,574 --> 01:25:15,439
Dr. William Longmire...

1029
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:17,705
Dr. Denton Cooley...

1030
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:19,802
Dr. Mel Harmel.

1031
01:25:20,514 --> 01:25:22,004
I believe...

1032
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:25,914
one group of people
could not have accomplished...

1033
01:25:26,553 --> 01:25:31,286
so much in so little time
without a strong, unified effort...

1034
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,393
in the spirit of breaking new ground...

1035
01:25:37,498 --> 01:25:38,829
together.

1036
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:45,064
To further the reach of medicine
is one that should be cherished...

1037
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:48,965
and never allowed to die.

1038
01:26:12,633 --> 01:26:14,533
What the hell is this?

1039
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,898
I need to do something different.

1040
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:20,770
What about our work?

1041
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:25,110
You got all of those other people
you were thanking.

1042
01:26:25,779 --> 01:26:27,940
What are you talking about?

1043
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,879
Belvedere Hotel.

1044
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:35,488
The Belvedere is segregated.
You were there?

1045
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:39,821
Snuck in, just like a bellhop.

1046
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:42,987
Is that what this is about,
hobnobbing with the powers that be?

1047
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:45,224
Vivien, they will never
let you into their club.

1048
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:48,824
It is naive to think otherwise.
Will you stand still?

1049
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:53,797
I'm not talking about them.
I'm not talking about Hopkins.

1050
01:26:53,907 --> 01:26:55,841
I'm talking about you.

1051
01:26:56,076 --> 01:26:57,202
Me?

1052
01:26:59,246 --> 01:27:03,114
What have I ever done
except fight in your corner?

1053
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:07,887
I have taken you every step of the way
with me...

1054
01:27:07,988 --> 01:27:11,355
and now you want to throw all that away?
For what?

1055
01:27:12,392 --> 01:27:15,122
Is that any way to show your gratitude?

1056
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:17,720
I don't know. You tell me, Doctor.

1057
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:22,066
Vivien, take pride in the fact
you have power in your mind...

1058
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:23,659
and in your heart.

1059
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,604
- And in my hands.
- Exactly, in your hands.

1060
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:32,570
We made history together.

1061
01:27:34,114 --> 01:27:36,014
We changed the world.

1062
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:43,412
The world.

1063
01:27:47,127 --> 01:27:49,288
I'm invisible to the world.

1064
01:27:49,696 --> 01:27:52,358
I don't mind that. I understand that.

1065
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:57,195
I thought it was different in here.

1066
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:14,911
Mr. Thomas, I'm a little confused.

1067
01:28:15,155 --> 01:28:17,783
Now you want college credit
for Morgan State...

1068
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:20,526
without actually taking classes?

1069
01:28:20,627 --> 01:28:22,652
In certain courses, yes.

1070
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:25,732
I'll take the test. I'll take finals...

1071
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:29,562
Chemistry, Biochemistry, Science, Physics.

1072
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,571
Also, I can get the credit
for material I already know.

1073
01:28:32,673 --> 01:28:35,870
I need to get through college
a little more quickly...

1074
01:28:35,976 --> 01:28:38,274
so I can get on to med school.

1075
01:28:38,378 --> 01:28:40,209
And so you actually participated...

1076
01:28:40,314 --> 01:28:42,874
in all this groundbreaking research,
Mr. Thomas?

1077
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:44,644
Yes, I did.

1078
01:28:45,085 --> 01:28:48,816
I'm afraid it just doesn't work like that.

1079
01:28:49,256 --> 01:28:51,622
You'll have to start with Freshman English.

1080
01:28:51,725 --> 01:28:54,558
Social Science, maybe.

1081
01:28:54,661 --> 01:28:57,425
I don't have time for that.

1082
01:28:57,798 --> 01:28:59,857
I'm 35 years old.

1083
01:29:03,136 --> 01:29:06,037
You're saying
that I have to start at the beginning?

1084
01:29:07,507 --> 01:29:11,204
Yes, Mr. Thomas.
I'm afraid that is in fact what I'm saying.

1085
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:15,407
I thought this institution
provided opportunity for colored people?

1086
01:29:16,116 --> 01:29:18,812
I have a wife, two young daughters, son.

1087
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:21,945
And I've been working in my field for over....

1088
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:26,550
Almost 15 years now.
I'm from Nashville, I came....

1089
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:54,877
And what can I do for you?

1090
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:59,587
My name is Vivien Thomas.
I work for the Ralph Wintham company.

1091
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:04,221
We have a line of pharmaceuticals,
particularly antacids.

1092
01:30:04,331 --> 01:30:07,095
We already have a supplier of antacids.

1093
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:13,037
Yes, well, these antacids
block against gastroesophageal reflux...

1094
01:30:13,373 --> 01:30:16,672
- without any adverse side effect--
- Vivien Thomas.

1095
01:30:17,911 --> 01:30:20,277
The fellow with the blue babies?

1096
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:24,742
A patient of mine who works at the hospital
told me about you.

1097
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:29,048
Hopkins is doing well
because of what you did for them...

1098
01:30:30,724 --> 01:30:32,419
and here you are.

1099
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:38,319
I don't have anything against the hospital.

1100
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:42,893
I'm just working in medicine
in a different way now.

1101
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:49,373
Let's see what other lines you have.

1102
01:30:49,476 --> 01:30:52,445
Yes, we have effervescent powder here....

1103
01:31:02,055 --> 01:31:04,990
Oh, William, look who's here?

1104
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:09,320
- Hello.
- Say hi to Grandma.

1105
01:31:10,263 --> 01:31:12,925
My goodness.

1106
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:17,564
How you doing, sweetheart? Look at him.

1107
01:31:22,809 --> 01:31:26,836
Stop running. Go up and wash your hands.
And you bring your little sister down.

1108
01:31:26,947 --> 01:31:29,177
And be careful on them steps.

1109
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:31,378
What about construction?

1110
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:34,283
I keep asking him. "Thomas and Thomas."

1111
01:31:34,621 --> 01:31:36,851
With the building boom, we could clean up.

1112
01:31:36,957 --> 01:31:39,391
Now, he know I can't saw a plank
worth a damn.

1113
01:31:39,493 --> 01:31:41,290
- Yeah, that's the truth.
- Yeah, Dad.

1114
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:44,887
I did see that mailbox
leaning to the side a little bit.

1115
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,099
I don't understand
why you quit teaching in the first place.

1116
01:31:48,201 --> 01:31:50,761
I never really liked the classroom
that much, Clara.

1117
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:51,997
Too many kids.

1118
01:31:52,105 --> 01:31:54,801
But you fought all those years,
and you won the case, so--

1119
01:31:54,908 --> 01:31:56,205
Exactly.

1120
01:31:56,309 --> 01:32:00,109
And quitting now means
you've just wasted a whole lot of time.

1121
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:03,512
- No--
- I don't think it's a waste of time.

1122
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:06,442
If Harold wasn't down there
doing what he was doing...

1123
01:32:06,553 --> 01:32:09,784
there'd still be a lot of colored teachers
down there getting cheated.

1124
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,051
I think they ought to
name a school after him.

1125
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,252
Yeah. Harold Thomas High.

1126
01:32:15,095 --> 01:32:16,562
- Harold Thomas High.
- Hear, hear.

1127
01:32:16,663 --> 01:32:20,827
No, most of these young teachers,
they don't know anything about that strike.

1128
01:32:20,934 --> 01:32:22,868
They take their equal paycheck for granted.

1129
01:32:22,969 --> 01:32:24,266
Harold, you're full of excuses.

1130
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:27,238
There's no point
in waiting for the world to thank you.

1131
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,932
That bus ain't never going to come.

1132
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:31,704
- Amen to that.
- I'm not waiting, Pop.

1133
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:34,970
I'm just looking for something
that excites me as much as...

1134
01:32:35,148 --> 01:32:37,241
hammering nails pleases you.

1135
01:32:45,325 --> 01:32:47,885
Viv, Jeopardy is on.

1136
01:32:48,428 --> 01:32:50,453
I'll be in in a minute.

1137
01:32:53,066 --> 01:32:54,328
You okay?

1138
01:32:55,702 --> 01:32:56,930
I'm fine.

1139
01:32:57,771 --> 01:33:00,467
Stomach's bothering me a little bit,
but I'm fine.

1140
01:33:00,574 --> 01:33:04,704
Why don't you take those fancy antacid pills
that you always brag about?

1141
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,543
It's your brother?

1142
01:33:11,251 --> 01:33:15,017
I miss him. I miss the old Harold.

1143
01:33:16,456 --> 01:33:18,390
Seems a little lost now.

1144
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:20,057
I miss you.

1145
01:33:23,563 --> 01:33:25,758
Still got my mind in that lab.

1146
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:30,498
It's not just your mind, Viv.
It's your heart, too.

1147
01:33:32,272 --> 01:33:35,139
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Clara.

1148
01:33:35,408 --> 01:33:37,842
I think I've embarrassed myself enough.

1149
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:41,605
I can't go back in there
with my tail between my legs.

1150
01:33:41,715 --> 01:33:44,343
It's where you belong, Vivien Thomas.

1151
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:47,978
So how you walk back on in there,
well, that's up to you.

1152
01:33:52,526 --> 01:33:53,550
Yes?

1153
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,757
Doctor. Good morning.

1154
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:14,640
How was your trip to Europe?

1155
01:34:16,983 --> 01:34:19,144
It was very gratifying...

1156
01:34:19,252 --> 01:34:23,348
and how well it seems
to have stood on its feet...

1157
01:34:23,723 --> 01:34:25,418
for this moment in time.

1158
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:31,126
What can I do for you, Vivien?

1159
01:34:31,231 --> 01:34:33,062
I've made a mistake...

1160
01:34:35,835 --> 01:34:38,463
and I would like my old position back.

1161
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:42,369
And how's it going to be any different?

1162
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,539
I'm still the same self-righteous bastard.

1163
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:51,247
It's not about you.

1164
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,584
It's about the work.

1165
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:00,720
I like the work.

1166
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,449
Mr. Thomas, we've got an animal
going into shock here.

1167
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,822
What do we do, sir?

1168
01:36:08,928 --> 01:36:13,365
Did you try clamping off
the lateral part of the atrium?

1169
01:36:13,466 --> 01:36:15,798
Yeah, hold it right there.

1170
01:36:15,902 --> 01:36:18,462
- Careful.
- Okay.

1171
01:36:21,074 --> 01:36:24,009
Yeah. You handled yourself
well there, Doctor.

1172
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:26,078
- That's good.
- Thank you.

1173
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,008
It started--

1174
01:36:31,384 --> 01:36:35,013
There was a message for you, Mr. Thomas.
Dr. Blalock wanted to see you.

1175
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,789
I'm sorry. Would you....

1176
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:40,485
- Tell him I'll see him--
- He's about to leave for the day.

1177
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:44,194
Honey, I have to call you back. Okay.

1178
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:54,401
How's your girls?

1179
01:36:54,507 --> 01:36:59,035
They're fine. They're doing well.
Theo's in Morgan State now.

1180
01:37:00,113 --> 01:37:02,946
- That must feel good.
- Yes.

1181
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:07,377
How are things with you?

1182
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:16,486
I've had the unfortunate experience
of being put in the hands of a surgeon.

1183
01:37:25,305 --> 01:37:27,865
You have something on your mind, Doctor?

1184
01:37:27,974 --> 01:37:31,239
Yes, Columbia's been dangling
an offer to teach...

1185
01:37:31,344 --> 01:37:33,278
but I wanted to talk to you first.

1186
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,610
I really would like you to come with me.

1187
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:39,446
They know about your work.
You could write your own ticket.

1188
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,780
It's hard to imagine being there without you.

1189
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:49,955
I thank you for thinking of me, Doctor.

1190
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:53,893
I think I should stay here.

1191
01:37:56,136 --> 01:38:00,596
We could do great things there.
Wouldn't it be fun to do it one more time?

1192
01:38:00,807 --> 01:38:02,399
One more time.

1193
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:07,845
I like what I'm doing.

1194
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:12,249
Teaching, helping people along.
Working with the young doctors.

1195
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:15,752
I like it here at Hopkins.

1196
01:38:15,855 --> 01:38:20,383
Yeah, I guess you got your own things
going on here now.

1197
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:23,159
I recognize this man.

1198
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:27,993
- Man looks very distinguished up there.
- Thank you, Vivien.

1199
01:38:28,568 --> 01:38:32,402
- That was a while ago.
- Yeah. I'm feeling the years now.

1200
01:38:33,907 --> 01:38:35,340
Yes.

1201
01:38:36,676 --> 01:38:38,303
We all are now.

1202
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:45,847
You know, Vivien...

1203
01:38:48,588 --> 01:38:51,182
they say you haven't really lived...

1204
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:55,025
unless you have a lot to regret.

1205
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:01,730
I regret....

1206
01:39:06,139 --> 01:39:07,970
I have some regrets.

1207
01:39:16,816 --> 01:39:20,081
But I think we should remember
not what we lost...

1208
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:23,985
but what we've done.

1209
01:39:26,192 --> 01:39:28,854
All the lives we saved, and we did.

1210
01:39:31,364 --> 01:39:33,832
We saved plenty, didn't we, Vivien?

1211
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:35,701
Yes, we did.

1212
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:44,301
No.

1213
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:03,323
Vivien, it's Helen.

1214
01:40:04,797 --> 01:40:06,856
I'm sorry to tell you...

1215
01:40:06,966 --> 01:40:10,129
that Dr. Blalock passed away in his sleep
last night.

1216
01:40:10,303 --> 01:40:14,262
We see death every day.
It doesn't make it any easier, does it?

1217
01:40:16,142 --> 01:40:18,372
I'm very sorry.

1218
01:40:44,237 --> 01:40:45,636
Today, we honor someone...

1219
01:40:45,738 --> 01:40:48,229
who never took a course
in medical school...

1220
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:52,107
and still became
one of our greatest teachers of medicine.

1221
01:40:53,513 --> 01:40:56,812
This individual
helped change the way we understand...

1222
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,384
how the human heart works forever.

1223
01:41:00,453 --> 01:41:03,115
And now I'm honored to read;

1224
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:09,054
"The Board of Regents of this,
the Johns Hopkins University...

1225
01:41:09,329 --> 01:41:13,060
"in consideration
of an innovative scientist...

1226
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:18,237
"an outstanding teacher,
and a skilled clinical technician...

1227
01:41:18,738 --> 01:41:21,969
"has this day
awarded this honorary doctorate...

1228
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:25,377
"to Mr. Vivien Thomas."

1229
01:41:45,965 --> 01:41:48,092
Congratulations, Dr. Thomas.

1230
01:42:06,786 --> 01:42:08,754
Thank you, Dr. Taussig.

1231
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:14,149
I'm not accustomed
to being in the limelight.

1232
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:17,828
So being placed in the position...

1233
01:42:18,231 --> 01:42:20,358
I find myself in now...

1234
01:42:21,334 --> 01:42:24,167
makes me quite humble...

1235
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:26,864
and a little proud.

1236
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:31,208
When I put my hammer and saw down...

1237
01:42:32,512 --> 01:42:34,070
40 years ago...

1238
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:38,949
and was offered an opportunity
to work with a young surgeon...

1239
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:41,346
I had no idea...

1240
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:48,153
that I'd be able to make a mark
on an institution as prestigious as this one.

1241
01:42:48,327 --> 01:42:50,261
I had no idea that I...

1242
01:42:50,997 --> 01:42:54,763
would have any contribution
to make to medicine...

1243
01:42:55,501 --> 01:43:00,029
that would merit this type of recognition.

1244
01:43:05,144 --> 01:43:09,638
I simply say thank you to all of my family...

1245
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:13,443
and all of my friends who are here...

1246
01:43:15,054 --> 01:43:18,956
and to all of my friends
who could not be here.

1247
01:43:19,692 --> 01:43:21,626
I thank you very much.

1248
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:35,799
This is also a special occasion...

1249
01:43:36,075 --> 01:43:39,135
to mark the unveiling
of your likeness, Vivien.

1250
01:45:09,001 --> 01:45:12,767
Paging Dr. Thomas.
Dr. Vivien Thomas to the boardroom, please.
