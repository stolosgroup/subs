﻿CHAPTER I

8
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,711
﻿I have the feet.

9
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,381
﻿- You got it.
- Yes.

10
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,680
﻿There, there.

11
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,303
﻿They're saying
time travel is possible now.

12
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,430
﻿Oh?

13
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,809
﻿How are they going to do that?

14
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,103
﻿No, just, theoretically...

15
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,565
﻿They're saying
it's theoretically possible.

16
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,655
﻿Then someone must be trying
to figure out the practical details.

17
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,116
﻿Probably...

18
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,005
﻿Not that I'm in any hurry
to see the future.

19
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,550
﻿I like it fine in the here and now.

20
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,434
﻿I expect it'll be just as possible...

21
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,437
﻿to go back in time.

22
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,152
﻿Yes... of course.

23
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,233
﻿Shhh... ok.

24
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,829
﻿I didn't check the upper barn..

25
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,915
﻿I think you should start there.

26
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,112
﻿374.

27
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,930
﻿All good... shhh...

28
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,352
﻿This is better than last year.

29
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,524
﻿Which makes it better
than the year before.

30
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,491
﻿The tractor is making a new noise.

31
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,117
﻿Ah, ok...

32
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,331
We better take a look
before we start planting.

33
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,384
﻿Hey, boy. One more time.

34
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,412
﻿What's gotten into you, boy?

35
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,525
﻿Move!

36
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,445
﻿Move away, go!

37
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,940
﻿What did he say?

38
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,401
﻿Don't know. Missed it.

39
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,696
﻿Something about folk tales, I think.

40
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,797
﻿It's ok.

41
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,389
﻿- Ingvar...
- Yes.

42
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,724
﻿I'm off.

43
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,270
﻿I'll be out when she's asleep.

44
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,481
﻿No, just stay with her.

45
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,816
﻿Ok... I'll look after her.

46
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,577
﻿- Hi.
- Hi.

47
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,667
﻿- Is she still asleep?
- Yeah, she must have been tired.

48
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,891
﻿Did you put her to sleep
in the bedroom?

49
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,352
﻿No, she's on the couch.

50
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,579
﻿- I'll check downstairs.
- Yes.

51
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,291
﻿Ada.

52
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,379
﻿Ada.

53
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,091
﻿- Did you find her?
- No, she's not here.

54
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,530
﻿Listen..

55
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,865
﻿Everything will be ok...
we will find her.

56
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,993
﻿I'll go check down by the river.

57
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:49,753
﻿Ada!

58
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,718
﻿Ada!

59
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,490

61
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,356
﻿Ada!

62
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,495
﻿Anything?

63
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,205
﻿Go away!

﻿This is pretty... let's try it on?

67
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,377
﻿Wow...

68
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,631
﻿you look beautiful.

69
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,429
﻿Come on, dog.

70
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,933
﻿Stay there.

71
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,812
﻿- Hello...
- Hi.

72
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,606
﻿Did you just arrive?

73
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,816
﻿No, I came in the night.

74
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,319
﻿I crashed in the barn.

75
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,155
﻿- You must be hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

76
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,741
﻿Come on...
let's get you something to eat.

77
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,243
﻿Come, boy.

78
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,502
﻿- We have a guest.
- Oh?

79
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,173
﻿So you're back... Again?

80
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,758
﻿Good to see you.

81
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,761
﻿- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

82
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,102
﻿Are you expecting guests?

83
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,437

﻿Come sweetie.
Don't be shy.

86
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,645
﻿Here you go.

87
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,859
﻿This is Pétur... daddy's brother.

88
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,739
﻿She's not used to strangers.

89
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,746
﻿Go right ahead... you're our guest.

90
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,294
﻿One more time.

91
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,878
<i>﻿Can I splash?</i>

92
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,092
<i>﻿All ok?</i>

93
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,052
<i>﻿One more time.</i>

94
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,244
﻿What the fuck is this?

95
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,330
﻿Happiness...

96
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,632
﻿Towel for you...

97
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:27,096
﻿then there are some clothes
in the closet that you can use.

98
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,767
﻿Come here...

99
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,856
﻿Good night, Uncle Pétur...

100
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,861
﻿Good night.

101
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,666
﻿- Ingvar...
- No. Pétur, no...

102
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,339
﻿There's nothing for us to talk about.

103
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,761
﻿Listen...

104
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,057
﻿you can stay here as long as you want

105
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,520
﻿but don't interfere with
how María and I live our lives.

106
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,439
﻿Ok?

107
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,912
﻿Why is he back?

108
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:38,668
﻿I don't know...
same as usual, I guess.

109
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:45,132
﻿People who misunderstand him...
and owe him money?

110
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:50,805
﻿Yeah, he's always been unlucky
in that way.

111
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,439
﻿- How long is he staying?
- Ssshhh...

112
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,321
﻿I don't know.

113
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,984
﻿Ada!

114
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,301
﻿- Want some coffee?
- Yes.

115
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,310
﻿Don't do that.

116
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,608
I ﻿saw you taking a bath last night.

117
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,699
﻿You left the door open. Were you maybe
hoping I'd come sneak a peek?

118
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,122
﻿What are you doing Pétur?

119
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,499
﻿Don't be such a goddamn child.

120
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,501
﻿It's you guys
who are acting childish...

121
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,963
﻿playing house with that animal.

122
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:31,692
﻿We're clearing some stuff in the shed.

123
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,866
﻿It'd be great if you could help out.

124
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,087
﻿Man, I've got fond memories of that one.

125
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,923
﻿You should, yes...

126
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,065
﻿- Hey...
- Should we get this done?

127
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,775
﻿Yeah, definitely.

128
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,577
﻿Here...

129
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,963
﻿Oh man, are you joking?
This thing is still here?

130
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,966
﻿Do you want some?

131
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:24,972
﻿Here, sheepie, sheep.
Here, little sheepie-sheep...

132
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,142
﻿That's right... you want to eat?

133
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:34,815
﻿Like a little lamb...
Yes, little lamb...

134
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:41,030
﻿What to eat, little sheep...
Sheepie, sheepie, sheep...

135
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,199
﻿What the hell do you think
you're doing man?

136
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,075
﻿Can't you ever leave
a good thing alone?

137
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,330
﻿Ingvar...

138
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,289
﻿Ingvar!

139
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:55,336
﻿It's not a child, it's an animal.

140
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,464
﻿Pétur...

141
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,204
﻿Ada..

142
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:03,941
﻿CHAPTER III

143
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,706
﻿Ada, come on sweetie.

144
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,812
﻿And now they are king and queen
in their kingdom.

145
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:31,111
﻿They sit in magnificent chairs,
that are called thrones.

146
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:34,281
﻿And they are very happy.

147
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:40,704
﻿And it was all because Dimmalimm
was such a good little girl.

148
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:48,253
﻿No one is so sweet and mild
as Dimma-limma-limm.

149
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:54,510
﻿And nowhere is so fair a child
as Dimma-limma-limm.

150
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,151
﻿Ada!

151
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,197
﻿Hold on tight.

152
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:17,068
﻿The fishes sing a sweet song
when found upon a hill.

153
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:22,115
﻿The sheep walk quietly along
on the ocean calm and still.

154
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,077
﻿Don't you know any rhymes?

155
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,997
﻿Just like your dad.

156
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:34,044
﻿When I was a boy...
I knew all the rhymes.

157
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:38,590
﻿Not that it has helped me much in life.

158
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,396
﻿Dammit!

159
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,710
﻿Seven down for your six.

160
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,467
﻿Yes...

161
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,094
﻿- Put this down...
- No, no hold on...

162
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,888
﻿- What?
- You're cheating.

163
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,766
﻿- No, I'm not cheating.
- You have to draw a card first.

164
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:57,103
﻿- Oh, yes.
- You always forget it.

165
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,980
﻿Hey...

166
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,149
﻿Hello! You guys sure took your time?

167
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,570
﻿You hungry, sweetie?

168
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,616
﻿- Good fishing I assume?
- Yeah, plenty of fish.

169
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,746
﻿Ada sweetie, come sit on the couch.

170
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,500
﻿What a piece of crap that tractor is...
I left it.

171
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,544
﻿Oh?

172
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,921
﻿You sure you weren't just out of oil?

173
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,340
﻿It may have absorbed some air
or something.

174
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,927
﻿- Did you empty out the filter?
- Do you think I'm stupid?

175
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,348
﻿There's a plate for you
if you're hungry.

176
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,855
﻿And what... You're boozing it up?

177
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,774
﻿Oh, just working on our team spirit
for the game... Have a glass.

178
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,485
﻿- No. I don't think so.
- You sure?

179
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,071
﻿Well... Maybe just a tiny sip.

180
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,414
﻿God dammit... well done.

181
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,877
﻿My nerves, man.

182
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,963
﻿What now...
Are they putting him on?

183
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,924
﻿Oh my god.

184
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:11,261
﻿Yes, yes, yes...

185
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,099
﻿Ok, ok. Come on...
come on, into the corner.

186
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,017
﻿Noooo!

187
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,269
﻿Why can't he just nail it?!

188
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,314
﻿Bunch of losers!

189
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:28,278
﻿- Come on 11 seconds left.
- Attack time, guys.

190
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:33,700
﻿- They're delaying...
- They're holding the ball...

191
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,786
﻿- What is he doing?
- Is he out?

192
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,914
﻿What is going on?

193
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,457
﻿What is happening?

194
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,543
﻿- Defend it...
- He'll defend it.

195
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:47,005
﻿He's got it no worries...
he's got it...

196
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:48,757
﻿Defend now, defend.

197
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,175
﻿Yes, yes...

198
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,678
﻿- No...
- No!!!

199
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,932
﻿No...

200
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,163
﻿We shouldn't have
watched this game.

201
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,500
﻿Listen.

202
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,543
﻿This doesn't work..

203
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,048
﻿Now, this should cheer us up.

204
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:53,154
﻿What are you doing? Turn it off.

205
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,740
﻿- What... You have this on VHS?
- Yes.

206
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,535
﻿How old is this even? It can't be...

207
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,329
﻿- Look at you.
- Stop this... come on turn it off.

208
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,833
﻿- Look how cute you are.
- Look, it's Uncle Pétur, look.

209
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,253
﻿- Look, it's Uncle Pétur.
- See how cool you were.

210
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,672
﻿I've never seen this...

211
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,215
﻿- You've never seen this?
- Never...

212
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,092
﻿- Of course you have seen it.
- No.

213
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,635
﻿You're kidding me...

214
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,970
﻿Dance?

215
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,266
﻿Yes. Come, let's try.

216
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:27,063
﻿- Oh, look at you.
- It doesn't age too badly.

217
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:34,112
﻿Looking classy and so young.

218
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,115
﻿...and jump.

219
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,430
﻿You were always so cool.

220
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,602
﻿Want to dance with Uncle Pétur?

221
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,189
﻿Uncle Pétur is on TV.

222
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,304
﻿What's happening to the handball specialist
that I was watching the game with?

223
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,516
﻿He doesn't know how to play it!

224
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,770
﻿Ok... come on, try me...

225
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,484
﻿- What is going on? You're off man.
- Hold on. Hold on...

226
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,195
﻿He has to have
a sip of whiskey in between.

227
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,572
﻿Man, that's good.

228
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:44,075
﻿Ok... bring it on.

229
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,036
﻿- One more time.
- One more time.

230
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,621
﻿Ok, one more time.

231
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:49,664
﻿Here.

232
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,333
﻿This time nothing...
Nothing goes past.

233
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:56,212
﻿- You ready?
- Yes, yes, bring it on.

234
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:01,259
﻿What is happening?

235
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,221
﻿- You okay?
- Yes, yes, I'm good.

236
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,807
﻿Come.

237
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:12,645
﻿That's all for me...
I think I have to go to bed.

238
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,899
﻿I'm not used to drinking so much.

239
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:17,859
﻿Say what?

240
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,820
﻿- I'm going to rest a bit.
- I think that's wise.

241
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,155
﻿Close my eyes a bit...

242
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,663
﻿Well, old man... There.

243
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,085
﻿Ada, honey...

244
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,795
﻿Come here.

245
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,924
﻿Lie down with me
while I fall asleep.

246
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,029
﻿Well, well.

247
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,784
﻿- Is he asleep?
- He just... Bam.

248
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,497
﻿He got so drunk.

249
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,544
﻿No. Come on,
it's been such a nice evening.

250
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,309
﻿It could get even nicer.

251
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:23,234
﻿Listen, stop this.

252
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:37,874
﻿Does... Ada know...
that you killed her mother?

253
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:03,274
﻿Come.

254
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,099
﻿Ah, María.

255
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,184
<i>﻿María...</i>

256
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,191
<i>﻿This is not funny.</i>

257
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,863
<i>﻿María... Come on.</i>

258
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,324
<i>﻿Open up.</i>

259
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,829
<i>﻿María.</i>

260
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,248
<i>﻿Open the door!</i>

261
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,668
<i>﻿María!</i>

262
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,630
<i>﻿María!</i>

263
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,094
<i>﻿María!</i>

264
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,446
<i>﻿María!</i>

265
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,991
<i>﻿María!</i>

266
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,910
<i>﻿María!</i>

267
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,191
﻿Pétur...

268
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,236
﻿We're leaving.

269
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,864
﻿I'll wait in the car.

270
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,322
﻿María?

271
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,617
﻿Pétur?

272
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,807
﻿Thank you, Ada dear.

273
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,398
﻿Ada, can you turn off
the radio for me, honey?

274
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:21,188
﻿Pétur.

275
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,735
﻿I know...

276
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:44,336
﻿Ada is a gift...

277
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,798
﻿A new beginning.

278
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,022
﻿Dog!

279
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:15,159
﻿Ada, honey, you coming?

280
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,413
﻿Should we fix the tractor?

281
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,540
﻿Good morning.

282
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,272
﻿When you turn your back
to the house...

283
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,984
﻿the mountain top
is always in front of you.

284
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:36,865
﻿Then on the way home...
it is always right behind you.

285
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,704
﻿If it's cloudy and you can't see it...

286
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,081
﻿that's a good question.

287
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,542
﻿Then you listen for the river...

288
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:50,754
﻿because the river
runs down the mountain. Right?

289
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,384
﻿Then you just have to find the river...

290
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,722
﻿and then you will always
know the way home.

291
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,089
﻿Let's go see about those fishing nets.

292
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,049
﻿Hi!

293
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,974
﻿Ingvar!

294
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,938
﻿Ada!

295
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,775
﻿Ingvar!

296
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,569
﻿Ada!

297
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,500
﻿What?

298
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,837
﻿Ingvar...

299
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,553
﻿What... what is happening?

300
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,015
﻿What is happening...

301
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:40,479
﻿My love...
what is happening...

302
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:43,648
﻿What happened?

303
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:54,826
﻿Ingvar... what happened?
Where is Ada?

304
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:58,080
﻿My love.

305
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,917
﻿No.

306
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:32,257
﻿It will be ok...

307
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:35,510
﻿It will be ok.
