2
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,647
<i>For once I believe you,
because you're just rotten enough.</i>

3
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:31,983
<i>- We're both rotten.
-And you are a little more rotten.</i>

4
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,486
<i>You got me to take care
of your husband for you...</i>

5
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,301
<i>...and you get security to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me too.</i>

6
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,638
<i>And somebody else would have come
along to take care of the kidy for you.</i>

7
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,828
<i>That's the way you operated, baby.</i>

8
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:46,060
<i>Suppose it is? It's what you've got
cooked up for tonight any better?</i>

9
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,231
<i>I don't like that music anymore.</i>

10
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,255
<i>You mind if I close the window?</i>

11
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,526
<i>You can do better than that,
can't you baby?</i>

12
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:16,820
<i>Better try it again.</i>

13
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,242
<i>Maybe if I come a little closer?</i>

14
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,484
<i>How's this?
Think you can do it now?</i>

15
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,224
<i>Why didn't you shoot again, baby?</i>

16
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:55,504
<i>Don't tell me it's because you've been
in love with me all this time.</i>

17
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,571
<i>No. I never loved you Walter,
not you or anybody else.</i>

18
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,908
<i>I'm rotten to the heart,
I used you just as you said.</i>

19
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,619
<i>That's all you ever meant to me...</i>

20
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,624
<i>- ...until a minute ago.
- What the fuck are you doing?</i>

21
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,193
Do you know what time it is?

22
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,951
Listen up.

23
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:28,663
At twenty two hundred...

24
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,686
...Wet suit's down the hole
when the snake hits the carpet.

25
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,293
Security lifts the key.

26
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,587
I terminate the torpedoes.

27
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,611
You charm the Snake
into the stall.

28
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:41,905
Bait and switch.

29
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,616
At twenty two twenty...

30
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:47,327
Wet suit turns
out the lights.

31
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:49,308
Glasses on.

32
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,185
I bag the snake.

33
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,688
Key in the bag.
Bag to the boat.

34
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:59,005
No radio unless absolutely necessary.

35
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,446
Code Red.
5 minutes to blackout.

36
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:05,157
Drop everything.
Walk away.

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,911
If the cops get you,
tell them the truth.

38
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,831
You know no one.

39
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,542
Got it?

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,836
Got it?

41
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,822
You have your passport?

42
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:31,955
The plane leaves tomorrow
at 0 seven hundred.

43
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:37,690
And remember,
no names and no guns!

44
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:46,344
Are you high?

45
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,079
Then stop dreaming, bitch.

46
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:55,103
This isn't a game tonight.
People can die.

47
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,108
Now get moving.

48
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,166
You forget something?

49
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:51,722
Stepping onto the red carpet here is
Régis Wargnier...

50
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:54,225
...the director of "East West"...

51
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,727
present tonight for
a special screening of his film...

52
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,334
...he is accompanied by
the producer Yves Marmion.

53
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,732
And the splendid actress
Sandrine Bonnaire.

54
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,713
On his right is Veronica...

55
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:07,050
...who is wearing a amazing top
in shape of a serpent.

56
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:11,117
It was especially designed
by Elli Medeiros.

57
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:16,747
And the reason why those young brawny
people in tuxedos are surrounding...

58
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:20,084
...the super model is that this piece
of jewelry is priceless.

59
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:23,108
Now, the people from Chopard
are telling me that this top...

60
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:25,715
...is actually adorned with
500 diamonds for...

61
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:29,468
- ...a total weight of 385 carats...
- Gee! That's worth a small fortune.

62
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:33,848
With an estimated value
of over 10 million dollars.

63
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,454
Check out that ass, man!

64
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,526
Look at those boobs!

65
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,924
Worth ten million dollars!

66
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:23,272
Check out the way that slut moves,
fuck, what is she on?

67
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:32,239
- I can't believe you did that!
- I'm sorry, I was looking at the girl.

68
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,429
Yeah, you were looking,
but you ruined my pants!

69
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,349
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Ok, I'll fix it.

70
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,434
You'd better fucking
clean it up, man!

71
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,141
Regis, we must go,
they're waiting for us.

72
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:28,606
I just gotta go to the bathroom.
You know how it is for girls.

73
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,170
You come back?

74
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:31,838
One minute.

75
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,246
- At last!
- Here they are.

76
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:48,313
Okay, great. But look what you did
to my pants!

77
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:54,256
- I've got just the stuff to fix that.
- Then move your ass!

78
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:49,520
I've gotta piss too,
I'll be right back.

79
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,634
Give me the key!

80
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,043
Got a light?

81
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,947
- So have you got it?
- Got what?

82
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,632
We've got a problem.

83
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,354
Code red.

84
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:49,359
Do you hear me?
Code red, I repeat...

85
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:53,321
...a man is walking
into the ladies room.

86
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,171
Miss Veronica?

87
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,517
Ok baby, baby we gotta go...

88
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,243
Miss Veronica?

89
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,983
Are you alright?

90
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,318
The key's in the bag.

91
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:57,195
Get moving!

92
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,855
You'd better get out of here.
Go!

93
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,571
They stole the diamonds!

94
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,661
Asshole!
You said no fucking guns!

95
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,894
They switched them
with the real! They're glass!

96
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:33,377
- Where's my fucking passport?
- They're fucking glass!

97
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:41,198
- You'd better kill me now, bitch!
- Oh, shut the fuck up!

98
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:46,515
Call security!

99
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,809
You understand...dead!

100
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,833
I repeat...don't move!

101
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,692
Stay where you are!

102
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,299
Don't move!

103
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:22,697
Don't move or I'll shoot!

104
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:33,959
Shit...

105
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,324
Hey, Racine!

106
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,709
Racine?

107
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,420
Okay, we're here,
but what's going on?

108
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:03,572
That bitch double crossed us.
She's got the diamonds!

109
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,804
Oh no. Where is she?

110
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,828
In Paris. She's got some girlfriend
in Belleville.

111
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,942
Yeah...

112
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:24,009
No, no. You don't understand.
I need a passport yesterday.

113
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,068
Did you get it?

114
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,784
What is it?

115
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,831
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

116
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,689
Excuse me, madame...

117
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,983
...but I believe this is
a free country.

118
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,799
And I'm entitled to make
any picture of anything...

119
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,093
...and anyone I want
from my balcony.

120
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,534
Go fuck yourself!

121
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:33,766
Go to church.
Try to save your soul.

122
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,747
Got you!

123
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,473
My darling!

124
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:51,969
Yes, that's strange.
Yes, it's her.

125
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,230
Do you really think it's her?

126
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,928
Lily!

127
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,392
Wait!

128
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,668
But what is she doing?

129
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,691
Wait for us!

130
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,341
Lily! Wait!

131
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:38,265
- Wait, Lily!
- Charles De Gaulle. Hotel Sheraton.

132
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,142
Go and get the car.

133
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,054
What do you want?

134
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,012
Don't move!

135
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,411
Stay put! Right!

136
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,705
Take off your glasses...

137
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,458
Good. The light is perfect.

138
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,525
- Brought the money?
- Of course!

139
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:17,487
- Perfect for what?
- I need a picture for the passport.

140
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:24,473
I got you, fucking bitch!

141
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,037
Come on!

142
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,521
Before I snap
your double-crossing neck...

143
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,441
...just tell me one thing.

144
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:37,194
Where are...

145
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,801
...the diamonds?

146
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,143
Pay back time, bitch!

147
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,893
Oh my god!

148
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,898
Don't touch her!

149
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:37,150
- Are you preparing the tea?
- Yes, of course.

150
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,340
Forget it!

151
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:43,719
- We should have done something.
- It's none of our business.

152
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:48,203
Oh right, you read two words
and she falls apart.

153
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:51,018
People die and
wills have to be read.

154
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:55,085
Did you see the look on her face?
And her hair?

155
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:59,047
- What has she done with her hair?
- I'm just a notary, damn it!

156
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:03,426
What if the kids and I were killed?
Would you give a damn what I left you?

157
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,555
When your gun disappeared,
I knew she would do something crazy.

158
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,370
- How do you know she stole it?
- Who else?

159
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,560
Go check on the tea.

160
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,735
Feeling better, Lily?

161
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:23,342
Excuse me,
but I don't understand...

162
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,366
Now, you just shut up, honey,
save your strenght.

163
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,347
You just have to rest.

164
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,058
You have suffered
a terrible tragedy...

165
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,082
...and you need time to get better,
you know.

166
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:39,400
And if you get the urge to do anything
silly, I want you to call me.

167
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:44,718
Before we leave...

168
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,742
I want you to answer
just one question.

169
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,747
Did you borrow Louis's gun?

170
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,752
Are you sure?

171
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:05,780
Okay, but if you come across it,
you'll tell me, won't you?

172
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:09,013
Good.

173
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,037
I'll turn the TV on
so you'll have company.

174
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:21,734
We'll be back tonight
with some dinner.

175
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,990
Drink your tea while it's hot.

176
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,991
Holly shit!

177
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,020
Ah, my god!

178
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:05,528
And if you could see the future
in a crystal ball...

179
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:08,969
...or in the palm of your hand,
or in a dream...

180
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,471
...would you change it?

181
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:20,126
So what should one think
of these phenomenon?

182
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,837
How can they be explained?

183
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:25,861
Is it really possible
to receive messages...

184
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:29,093
...from what one might call
the "hereafter"...

185
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,558
Could one be unconsciously gifted
with a perception power...

186
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:39,103
...which would allow us...

187
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,355
"I thought I could start over
in America.

188
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,545
My English is not so good,
but I'm a fast learner.

189
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,630
I even bought myself a ticket
but I lost it.

190
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,820
I can't live without
Thierry and Brigitte.

191
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:05,323
Forgive me, my God.
Allow us to be together again."

192
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:31,615
There's been a mistake. The computer
has sold the same seat twice.

193
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:34,534
I'm terribly sorry.

194
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:39,539
Could we accommodate you
in our first class cabin?

195
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,502
This way please.
It's right here.

196
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:56,744
Excuse me.

197
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,372
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

198
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:45,438
I'm sorry I woke you up.

199
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:51,173
You fell asleep here.
Are you OK?

200
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,074
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

201
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,098
I'm sorry.

202
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,496
Do you speak French?

203
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:03,790
- I'm sorry.
- Are you American?

204
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,440
California.

205
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,734
I mean I grew up
in California...

206
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,819
...but I live in Washington now.

207
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,658
- What do you do in life?
- In life?

208
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:22,038
Well, I started in software.

209
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:27,147
And made some money...

210
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:30,796
...and found out that
I was interested in other things.

211
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,133
Like what things?

212
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:38,095
Well, like the whole world...

213
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,181
I went back to school
in Washington,

214
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:43,205
I got a degree in Foreign Relations.
I taught for a little while...

215
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:46,854
...and then I got a posting
at the State Department.

216
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:53,215
America is a country
very big, no?

217
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:58,532
Very big.
Is this your first trip?

218
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:02,912
I begin my new life there.

219
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,248
France is no good for me.

220
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:09,585
How can you say that?
France is a fabulous country.

221
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:13,235
Really. That's the...
Queen of Europe to me.

222
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:15,216
The art, the history...

223
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:19,282
...the sense of language,
Stendhal, Racine, Balzac...

224
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:26,894
I lost my baby there...

225
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,653
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

226
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:37,947
That's terrible.

227
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:40,658
Please forgive me.

228
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:44,203
It's OK. It's OK.

229
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:48,270
That is just awful.

230
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:17,153
Hi! Mister Bardo is not here
at the moment.

231
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:19,864
What are you doing?
Trying to dodge bill collectors?

232
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:22,158
- Nick, it's Johnny.
- I know who you are.

233
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:24,035
- What are you doing?
- Working.

234
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,476
- Something I can sell?
- Could be. I just need one more piece.

235
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:30,499
Another shot of that table?
What's happen' to you?

236
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:32,898
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

237
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:36,234
How would you like a break from your
masterwork and make some real money?

238
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,988
- What are you selling?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

239
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:44,472
As strange as it may seem to you, Jean,
photographers actually read.

240
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:47,600
You know books, magazines,
and even daily newspapers.

241
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:49,372
All right, all right, smart ass,
who is he?

242
00:43:49,998 --> 00:43:52,396
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

243
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:56,671
He's got a wife but no one seems
to have a picture of her.

244
00:43:58,027 --> 00:44:00,634
- Maybe she's camera shy.
- No, she's not camera shy.

245
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,719
She's got a past and
she's not talking about it.

246
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,117
And I did some checking and
found out she's really French.

247
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,098
Married before
with a kid.

248
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:10,748
I've got an ex I don't talk about
either. What's wrong with that?

249
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:12,938
Nothing except that
you don't dodge photographers...

250
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:14,815
...like you've got something
to hide.

251
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:18,360
- So you want me to nail her, right?
- You are the best.

252
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:23,573
I don't like to do this.
I feel like shit.

253
00:44:23,678 --> 00:44:27,118
- And besides, I am retired.
- On what? IOUs?

254
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,872
I'm not just your agent Nicolas,
I'm your bank and you're way past due.

255
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:34,835
Do yourself a favour and go to work.
I can get 5 figures for this picture.

256
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,299
All right. What's her schedule?

257
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:44,323
She arrives
by private jet tonight.

258
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:49,015
- I gotta go, I gotta go. Bye.
- Take that picture.

259
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:15,187
Be careful. You almost fell!

260
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:18,003
Where are you going?

261
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:23,321
Let's see if you understand me.
Listen, I'm looking for public toilets.

262
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:25,510
The Champs Elysées are
over there or over here?

263
00:45:30,098 --> 00:45:35,312
I'd like to go to the public toilets
which are in that direction. Please.

264
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:40,525
If you understand me,
in that direction...

265
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,100
And thanks for the ride!

266
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,923
Can we jump in?

267
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:14,056
Nice wheels!

268
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:17,601
What did you expect?
I only steal the best!

269
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,232
- Is this Nicolas Bardo?
- Speaking.

270
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,526
You took a picture
of Mrs. Watts?

271
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:29,071
Who wants to know?

272
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:31,782
Leonard Shiff.
Head of Watts' security.

273
00:47:32,408 --> 00:47:34,076
I'd like to buy it.

274
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:38,873
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Shiff,
but it's already been sold.

275
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:42,522
Unsell it. We'll double
whatever you've got.

276
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:46,172
That's very generous but I...

277
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:48,570
I don't think you realize
who you're dealing with, Mr. Bardo.

278
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:51,802
We know all about you,
your overdrawn bank account...

279
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:54,513
...your criminal record.
I suggest...

280
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,537
...you get that picture back
and you bring it to me...

281
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:00,874
...at the residence tomorrow
morning 11a.m. sharp.

282
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,879
- Don't keep me waiting.
- Sir, hold on! Hello!

283
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,737
Nice going, man. Really.

284
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:13,699
Thanks for keeping your mouth shut.

285
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,079
They must have offered you
some sweet deals to talk?

286
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,685
There was nothing
to talk about.

287
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:27,046
They just asked about the diamonds,
of which I knew shit.

288
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:30,800
Once the insurance paid off,
they stopped asking.

289
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:36,117
Don't worry, man!
That bitch knows.

290
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,767
I thought about her
every fucking minute...

291
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:45,502
...every fucking hour,
for seven fucking years!

292
00:48:47,796 --> 00:48:49,777
Where is she?

293
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,431
I've been looking. I talked to
everyone, I never stopped.

294
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:03,124
I ran down every scumbag
that ever knew her.

295
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:05,418
She just vanished off
the face of the earth?

296
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,129
Hey, I'm not Interpol, alright!

297
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:11,153
I've been fucked same as you!

298
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:14,906
I did a hell of a lot
of checking!

299
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:19,911
I've got one thing,
maybe, one thing...

300
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,125
You know that girlfriend of hers?

301
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,419
The brunette...

302
00:49:29,817 --> 00:49:33,571
She's fencing diamonds.
It's all I've got.

303
00:49:58,179 --> 00:49:59,534
Wait, wait.

304
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,828
Excuse me, officer...

305
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,893
There is less and less sun.

306
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,927
Let's wait for the sun.

307
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:56,586
Park Bardo in the office
until I can get...

308
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,554
Hold on a second.

309
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:21,403
I don't believe it. This paparazzi scum
is wearing a wire.

310
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,285
Make sure he doesn't get
passed security.

311
00:53:38,503 --> 00:53:39,859
Hold on...

312
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:46,428
- Can you help me, please?
- One minute, pal.

313
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:09,756
Damn it! Damn it!

314
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,363
Oh shit!

315
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,378
- Is the bar open?
- Yes of course, sir.

316
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:31,132
But you can't stay there.
Please move your bike.

317
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:35,824
- You can't leave it there.
- I know, I know.

318
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,454
- Please...
- Okay.

319
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,960
Hi! I'm sorry to bother you but
I rented this room last night...

320
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:52,150
...and I think I left my disk here.

321
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:55,174
- A disk?
- When I got home...

322
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:58,198
I checked my laptop,
and the backup disk was gone!

323
00:58:58,824 --> 00:59:02,577
It's the only copy I have and I've been
searching like hell for it.

324
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:07,269
Then I remembered the only place
I could have left it was...here.

325
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:09,772
So did you mind if I come in
and just take a look around?

326
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:12,483
- I don't think it's a good idea...
- Thank you very much.

327
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,403
I appreciate it.

328
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:20,929
Thank you.

329
00:59:21,242 --> 00:59:23,953
Oh my God, I got so much information
in that disk.

330
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:30,001
You didn't see a disk right?
I mean, actually it's not a disk.

331
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,190
It's not like a CD or a DVD
or anything like that...

332
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:36,674
...it's called floppy. It's a black thing
that you introduce in the computer.

333
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,949
I am remembering now
that I put it there...

334
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:45,016
...'cause I was working in bed.
I just love to work in bed.

335
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:48,769
I bet you do too.
Anyway, let me...

336
00:59:49,395 --> 00:59:51,793
Let just remember
exactly what I did.

337
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,087
I sat over here.

338
00:59:55,443 --> 00:59:58,779
I sat over here and I put it on my lap,
because it's a laptop...

339
00:59:58,779 --> 01:00:00,865
...and I just plugged it
over there and...

340
01:00:01,073 --> 01:00:04,514
Actually, you know what had happened?
What happened is that I wasn't alone.

341
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:06,704
I wasn't alone and then...

342
01:00:08,998 --> 01:00:10,770
Oh my God!

343
01:00:11,396 --> 01:00:13,794
That's not your business.

344
01:00:14,003 --> 01:00:16,818
Well, ah...No, it's not.

345
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,738
It's not but it is.

346
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,032
Because...

347
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:23,700
Excuse me...

348
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:30,895
Are you alright?

349
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:34,231
I think I can help you.

350
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:36,525
I have been working in a hospital
for a couple of years and...

351
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:39,966
I was a kind of a candy striper myself.
Just sit down over here.

352
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:43,616
Give me your arms. Put them up.
Just like this and...Relax! Relax!

353
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:45,910
And breathe, breathe and relax.

354
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:49,038
And now listen to me.
Good.

355
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:53,313
I know, because I have been accused of
having an overactive imagination...

356
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:56,024
...but when a classy woman
like yourself...

357
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:58,944
...checks into an airport hotel,
in the middle of the morning...

358
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:02,697
...with a bunch of bullets and a gun,
there's only one word that follows.

359
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:05,200
What word?

360
01:01:05,304 --> 01:01:06,243
"Bang".

361
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:09,996
Now, if a guy walks in...

362
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:12,707
...maybe there doesn't have
to be a "bang".

363
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,001
Maybe there is something
to talk about?

364
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:18,651
Coffee?

365
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:24,907
Maybe we should have start
with some introductions?

366
01:01:26,054 --> 01:01:28,140
I don't care who you are.

367
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:31,163
And I definitely don't want
you to know who I am.

368
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:33,457
All right, that's fair enough.

369
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,438
Let's call me...
"Harry"...

370
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:39,922
...and let's start with the shiner.

371
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:42,529
Who's beating you up?

372
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:47,847
- Must we talk about this?
- Yes.

373
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,496
Or we're gonna find
the local police station...

374
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,894
...and we're gonna talk
about it there.

375
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:02,966
- My husband.
- All right, why?

376
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:07,137
He has...

377
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:11,516
...difficulty to control
his temper.

378
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:16,730
Why does he lose it?

379
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:20,484
Because I can't live
with him here.

380
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:26,427
- Why not?
- I have a past here.

381
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:30,702
I was safe in the States
but here...

382
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:34,143
...it only takes one photo...

383
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:42,068
Like the one today?

384
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,808
I took that picture.

385
01:02:57,604 --> 01:03:01,358
So "Harry" is Nicolas Bardo.

386
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:07,405
Why did you follow me,
to get more photos?

387
01:03:08,344 --> 01:03:10,012
No, no, I...

388
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:14,496
I just came to tell
your security goon, Mr. Shiff...

389
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:18,041
...that I couldn't stop the picture
from being published. I'm sorry.

390
01:03:18,354 --> 01:03:21,795
Anyone can see that.
You've wasted your time.

391
01:03:28,677 --> 01:03:30,762
This espresso is cold.

392
01:03:31,388 --> 01:03:33,473
- Can I get you another cup?
- Why?

393
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:36,810
There's nothing more to say.

394
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,147
Can I go now?
You have the gun.

395
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:43,066
Sex Shops are open all day.

396
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:46,194
I don't think I'll be going to one.

397
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:49,427
How can I be sure?

398
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:53,702
Just stay with me.

399
01:03:55,787 --> 01:03:58,185
I need air but I don't want
to talk anymore.

400
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:08,300
Good...
So where is she?

401
01:04:08,925 --> 01:04:11,011
The ambassador is
extremely worried.

402
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:14,660
The police? God, no.

403
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:17,684
Keep calling Shiff...

404
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:57,203
Right when I got divorced,
I just decided to leave Spain...

405
01:04:57,516 --> 01:05:00,644
...and come here to Paris to prevent
myself...kind of think, you know...

406
01:05:01,478 --> 01:05:03,563
I mean I've got these crazy
photographer ideas...

407
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:06,900
...and don't think for a second that
I am a paparazzi. I hate them.

408
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:10,237
I feel like shit but I have to make
some money. That's the only way...

409
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:12,635
But...There is
a square here in Paris...

410
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:17,014
...full of coffee shops, beautiful,
and there is one in particular...

411
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:19,621
...in a corner, you know,
with these light reflections...

412
01:05:19,934 --> 01:05:21,915
...and I saw something
that changed my life...

413
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:25,356
- It's a great story, Nicolas.
- This is the best part!

414
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:27,650
I know. I know.
Maybe another time.

415
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:32,029
It's a great story
but right now I'm...

416
01:05:33,593 --> 01:05:38,494
...very tired and I would just like to
take a warm bath and relax a little...

417
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:41,935
...before I go home, OK?
Thank you for today.

418
01:05:42,561 --> 01:05:45,376
I'll be waiting out here...
Just in case you need anything...

419
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:51,007
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No, no, no. It's not that.

420
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:53,613
It's just being careful.

421
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,035
- Are you all right?
- No.

422
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:04,353
- I'm out of my medicine.
- There was a pharmacy in the airport.

423
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,751
Oh that's right.

424
01:06:09,984 --> 01:06:12,069
My inhaler is in my car.

425
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:14,363
They can refill it
for me there.

426
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:17,387
That wouldn't be being careful...

427
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:20,307
Nicolas, take my car...

428
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:26,771
...take my purse if you're so
worried that I go somewhere.

429
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:31,568
You can call a taxi,
I don't...

430
01:06:34,592 --> 01:06:36,990
Yes, Nicolas,
I could call a taxi.

431
01:06:39,597 --> 01:06:41,578
But I'm not going to do that.

432
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:50,650
I'm not going to need these
in the bath.

433
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:52,943
Hey! Wait.

434
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:58,053
I'm definitely not going anywhere
without them.

435
01:07:09,314 --> 01:07:11,712
Are you flirting with me?

436
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,760
Was I?

437
01:07:19,845 --> 01:07:22,244
I believe so, yeah.

438
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,206
I didn't mean to.

439
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,230
It's just that...

440
01:07:30,377 --> 01:07:34,548
...all your boyhood stories
make you so...

441
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:37,884
...damn lovable.

442
01:07:43,828 --> 01:07:46,226
Was that the point?

443
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,968
Hello, is this police?

444
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:45,348
Madre de Dios.
My name is Sophia.

445
01:08:45,556 --> 01:08:49,727
I call now from the airport
De Gaulle. Yes, De Gaulle.

446
01:08:50,978 --> 01:08:54,419
A man just hit the lady
in front of the pharmacy.

447
01:08:55,983 --> 01:09:01,822
Yes, wait a second. Yes, man
is still there, but I see no lady.

448
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,638
Yes, he steal her car.

449
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,974
No, I can't. No, not possible.
No, sorry.

450
01:09:08,287 --> 01:09:10,998
My husband calling me. Sorry.
No, I can't.

451
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:19,340
Is it your car?

452
01:09:19,444 --> 01:09:22,155
It's not mine but...
Somebody lend it to me and...

453
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,095
Come in!

454
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:54,583
Good morning.

455
01:09:55,939 --> 01:09:58,024
You can put it there.

456
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:11,267
- Could you hand me my bag?
-Of course.

457
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,665
It's over there by the bed.

458
01:10:29,827 --> 01:10:32,955
- I can't find it.
- Maybe on the floor?

459
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:39,941
I'm sorry but I don't see it.

460
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:44,425
This is the gun
we found in the Mercedes.

461
01:10:44,634 --> 01:10:47,032
- Any details?
- No, it's not registered.

462
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:51,515
Concerning the car...
It belongs to the American Embassy.

463
01:11:04,549 --> 01:11:07,990
This doesn't make much sense.
I'm Chief Inspector Serra.

464
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:10,910
Maybe you can help me out?

465
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:13,621
I said it already.

466
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:16,853
But, OK.
Alright.

467
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,981
Mrs. Watts was trying
to kill herself.

468
01:11:20,816 --> 01:11:22,380
I stopped her...

469
01:11:22,588 --> 01:11:24,986
...so she set me up for you guys,
to get me out of her way.

470
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:27,906
How did you come up with that?

471
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:33,745
I read a lot of mysteries and I just
figure out the endings half way...

472
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,603
I put the clues together and
I know what happened, sir.

473
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:39,584
What happened, Mr. Bardo...

474
01:11:39,897 --> 01:11:43,651
...was a car belonging to Ambassador
Watts was found in your possession.

475
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:45,632
I know, I know that...

476
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,907
On the front seat was
a gun, bullets...

477
01:11:52,097 --> 01:11:53,869
...blouse and dress.

478
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:58,874
The only thing missing is the woman.

479
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:03,045
Where is she?

480
01:12:04,714 --> 01:12:06,799
I don't know. I don't know...

481
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:10,866
- You checked out the hotel?
- Yeah, we checked the room.

482
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:13,889
We found a naked waitress
in a coma.

483
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:18,165
Did you have anything
to do with that?

484
01:12:20,146 --> 01:12:21,501
No.

485
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,881
I wasn't there.
I was buying an inhaler.

486
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:28,175
Inhaler?

487
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,156
Yes...

488
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,203
An inhaler. All right?
Mrs. Watts has asthma.

489
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,791
So I went to a pharmacy to get
her prescription refilled. That's it.

490
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:48,090
So, you figured...

491
01:12:49,342 --> 01:12:53,095
...by having her car and her clothes,
she wasn't going anywhere?

492
01:12:54,972 --> 01:12:56,745
That's correct, yeah.

493
01:12:58,413 --> 01:13:01,124
And you kept the gun
so she wouldn't shoot herself?

494
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,044
That's right.

495
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:07,485
Why would she want to do that?

496
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:14,158
- Excuse me?
- Why would she want to do that?

497
01:13:15,096 --> 01:13:19,580
Well, her husband was beating her up
because she wanted to leave him.

498
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:23,125
The American Ambassador
beats his wife?

499
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,154
That's right, that's right, yes.

500
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:34,491
And she has
the face to prove it...

501
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:42,103
You see...

502
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:44,814
I'm kind of
a mystery buff myself.

503
01:13:46,795 --> 01:13:49,193
And you know what kind
of mystery this is?

504
01:13:52,843 --> 01:13:54,511
- A kidnapping.
- Oh come on!

505
01:13:54,824 --> 01:13:56,805
Ambassador's wife held
for ransom.

506
01:13:57,118 --> 01:14:00,246
Everything was going fine until
someone reported a stolen car.

507
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:04,000
You didn't even have time
to send the ransom note...

508
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:06,815
- ...or did you?
- No. What are you talking about?

509
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:11,298
I am no kidnapper, sir.

510
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:13,801
Why don't we take a ride
down to the Residence...

511
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:16,512
...and see what the Ambassador
has to say about that?

512
01:14:16,825 --> 01:14:19,536
I think this is
a terrible misunderstanding.

513
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:21,934
I spoke with Mrs. Watts...

514
01:14:22,143 --> 01:14:24,958
...she explained to me how
she let Mr. Bardo use her car.

515
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:28,295
I don't know who reported it stolen
because it wasn't.

516
01:14:28,503 --> 01:14:30,484
And my attorney,
Mrs. Phillips...

517
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:33,612
...has indicated to me that
no crime has been committed...

518
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:37,575
...so I'm a little confused as to
what we are doing here, inspector.

519
01:14:38,513 --> 01:14:41,224
- You spoke to your wife yourself?
- Yes, I did.

520
01:14:42,893 --> 01:14:46,646
- Could I speak with her?
- I don't think that's necessary.

521
01:14:47,272 --> 01:14:50,296
This has been an awkward situation
for all of us concerned...

522
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,528
...and I really...
I don't want to prolong it.

523
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:01,766
Mrs. Phillips will have to handle
your questions from now on.

524
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:04,164
I have an engagement.
Please excuse me.

525
01:15:16,364 --> 01:15:20,534
Inspector Serra, you've displayed
a boorish lack of sensitivity...

526
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:23,454
towards the American Ambassador.

527
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,521
We do not need or want your
investigative skills employed...

528
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:32,213
...to discover why Mrs. Watts was in
a hotel bedroom with Mr. Bardo.

529
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,531
I suggest you return to
your duties and drop this matter.

530
01:15:38,573 --> 01:15:40,659
The less said about it the better.

531
01:15:42,953 --> 01:15:45,872
I'd still like
to talk to Mrs. Watts.

532
01:15:45,977 --> 01:15:50,773
- And what crime has she committed?
- No crime, I just want to see her.

533
01:15:51,607 --> 01:15:55,048
Well, I'm sure we all want
to see lots of people...

534
01:15:56,299 --> 01:15:59,427
...but fortunately in our country
and in yours...

535
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:03,077
...they are not compelled to see us.

536
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:06,101
Good day, Inspector.

537
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,002
Sir!

538
01:16:11,002 --> 01:16:13,713
Do you know the penalty for having
an illegal hand gun?

539
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:16,736
- I told you, it's not my gun.
- OK. Then we'll just keep it.

540
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:19,656
Now, about your motorcycle...

541
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:24,140
- You really want to report it stolen?
- Of course I want to report it stolen.

542
01:16:24,348 --> 01:16:26,121
If it wasn't at the hotel,
somebody took it, sir.

543
01:16:26,329 --> 01:16:28,102
Why don't you look a little harder?

544
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:30,396
If it doesn't turn up in a few days,
give me a call.

545
01:16:31,022 --> 01:16:35,505
Sir, you don't believe one goddamn
thing I said, right?

546
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:39,155
Not only don't I believe you,
I don't even like you.

547
01:16:39,989 --> 01:16:42,387
Look, Bardo, I know who you are.

548
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,828
Ex-paparazzi smart ass who
hasn't worked for seven years.

549
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:49,165
I don't know what you're up to
but it's not smart.

550
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:52,189
And if you keep it up, you're going
to wind up on a cell block...

551
01:16:52,397 --> 01:16:54,378
...full of smart guys just like you.

552
01:19:02,214 --> 01:19:03,883
"Mr. Watts...

553
01:19:04,196 --> 01:19:06,594
...if you ever want
to see your wife again...

554
01:19:07,532 --> 01:19:09,201
...bring 10 million dollars...

555
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:12,642
...in Bearer Bonds to
the Passerelle Debilly...

556
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:14,935
...at 2 a.m. this morning.

557
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:18,689
If you inform the police or arrive
with anyone besides yourself...

558
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,547
...she will be killed."

559
01:19:26,197 --> 01:19:27,865
Oh shit.

560
01:19:33,183 --> 01:19:35,268
Son of a bitch!

561
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:48,511
Mrs. Watts...

562
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:53,307
Call me Lily.

563
01:19:54,976 --> 01:19:56,644
Okay, Lily.

564
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:00,919
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Lily?

565
01:20:01,857 --> 01:20:03,526
Are you mad at me?

566
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,924
Mad? Nah...

567
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:09,261
You're making everybody think
I've kidnapped you.

568
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:13,223
Haven't you?

569
01:20:13,536 --> 01:20:15,204
That is not funny...

570
01:20:15,517 --> 01:20:17,498
No, Nicolas. You're right.
It's not funny.

571
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:20,939
It wasn't funny when you sold my picture
to the papers either.

572
01:20:21,877 --> 01:20:24,171
Then you showed up
to do what?

573
01:20:24,276 --> 01:20:27,299
Explain, apologize, lie?

574
01:20:28,342 --> 01:20:32,200
I was afraid for your life.
I felt responsible for it, damn it!

575
01:20:32,722 --> 01:20:35,120
That's so sweet, Nicolas.

576
01:20:38,352 --> 01:20:40,438
I'm a bad girl, Nicolas.

577
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:44,087
Real bad.

578
01:20:45,026 --> 01:20:47,111
Rotten to the heart.

579
01:20:47,737 --> 01:20:50,448
Last scrape I was in
I fucked up a lot of people.

580
01:20:51,803 --> 01:20:54,514
Bad people. People like me.
People that don't forget.

581
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:59,206
But I was given a second chance.

582
01:21:00,249 --> 01:21:04,316
So I went back to States where I got
everything a bad girl ever wanted.

583
01:21:06,297 --> 01:21:08,382
Fucking Watts!

584
01:21:10,572 --> 01:21:14,743
He was sweet, until being the richest
man in the world wasn't enough.

585
01:21:16,307 --> 01:21:18,392
He had to have public glory.

586
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:21,312
So he gave away
a ton of money...

587
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:23,710
...bought himself
the French Ambassadorship.

588
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:27,464
Which meant the Misses got dragged out
into the Parisian limelight.

589
01:21:29,028 --> 01:21:30,696
Well, I couldn't do that Nicolas...

590
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:33,407
...'cause bad people
read newspapers too.

591
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:35,701
There you go.

592
01:21:37,682 --> 01:21:39,664
Enter my worst nightmare.

593
01:21:40,811 --> 01:21:44,669
You snap that fucking picture,
sell it to the tabloids.

594
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:48,944
And now it's only a matter of time
before those bad people come running.

595
01:21:52,176 --> 01:21:55,617
So I got the photographer turned
blackmailer to kidnapped me.

596
01:21:57,494 --> 01:22:00,205
Blackmailer?
You offered me money!

597
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:04,376
And I have never kidnapped anybody,
you fucking bitch!

598
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:06,878
Then where am I, Nicolas?

599
01:22:08,547 --> 01:22:11,988
Why did you have my car,
my clothes, a gun?

600
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:16,680
Why was a ransom note
e-mailed from your computer?

601
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:21,372
- Everyone knows you did it.
- I've got to think. I've got to think.

602
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:24,291
I've got to think.

603
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,315
Don't bother.
You don't have to think about anything.

604
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,818
I've got it all thought out
for you.

605
01:22:30,131 --> 01:22:33,884
Watts is coming up here at 2 a.m.
with 10 million dollars in a briefcase.

606
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,804
Now if you start being
a little nice to me...

607
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:39,932
I might catch you in on the take.

608
01:22:45,563 --> 01:22:47,544
We are going to the police.

609
01:22:47,857 --> 01:22:49,942
Why would you want to do that?

610
01:22:50,568 --> 01:22:53,279
Because you're gonna tell them
the crazy story you just told me.

611
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,511
Nicolas?
You think I'm stupid?

612
01:22:57,137 --> 01:23:00,578
I'm going to tell them
a kidnapping story...

613
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:02,976
...starring you.

614
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,251
Son of a bitch! Fuck...

615
01:23:07,564 --> 01:23:09,962
- Nicolas!
- Hold. Hold on. Hold on.

616
01:23:10,275 --> 01:23:12,986
See, I did have time
to go back to that sex shop.

617
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:15,176
C'mon!

618
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:18,200
What did you do with that other gun
I gave you?

619
01:23:18,825 --> 01:23:20,911
- The cops took it.
- They took it?

620
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,124
- I got you another one. Come here.
- Be careful with that thing.

621
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:27,688
It's all right.

622
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:36,760
Isn't sugar better than vinegar?

623
01:23:38,324 --> 01:23:39,679
Come on.

624
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,481
We've got a couple hours, baby.

625
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:53,130
Let's go do something fun,
want you?

626
01:24:14,506 --> 01:24:17,634
How come you're the only man in this
room that doesn't want to fuck me?

627
01:24:21,492 --> 01:24:23,890
Nicolas! Where are you going?

628
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:26,497
I'm just going to buy some cigarettes.
And you know...

629
01:24:26,497 --> 01:24:28,582
...don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere...

630
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:31,189
...while you've got my balls
in your pocket, Lily.

631
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:40,886
Pack of cigarettes.
Anything American.

632
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:48,915
22 francs.

633
01:25:04,243 --> 01:25:05,807
Hey, Nicolas! Come here!

634
01:25:06,224 --> 01:25:08,310
Meet my friend, Napoleon.

635
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:10,916
I think he is in love.

636
01:25:12,272 --> 01:25:15,400
Can we just go outside for a second?
I need to talk to you.

637
01:25:15,504 --> 01:25:18,320
Nicolas, com'on we're having fun.
Just be cool.

638
01:25:18,528 --> 01:25:20,614
Well, I'm gonna go outside, all right?

639
01:25:20,926 --> 01:25:24,993
Nicolas, we don't want you to wait out
in the cold, do we Napoleon?

640
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:28,330
I mean, if we hit it off...

641
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,671
I don't know, I was kind of thinking
of letting you off the hook.

642
01:25:36,984 --> 01:25:38,548
- Really?
- Yeah.

643
01:25:38,653 --> 01:25:41,051
I mean, you don't seem to be enjoying
my company much.

644
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:45,430
Maybe Napoleon and I should just
sail off into the sunset.

645
01:25:45,951 --> 01:25:48,037
And you can go fuck yourself.

646
01:29:37,642 --> 01:29:39,310
I hope you didn't kill him.

647
01:29:40,978 --> 01:29:43,376
He was going to save me
from a dip in the Seine.

648
01:29:43,689 --> 01:29:45,045
What?

649
01:29:45,358 --> 01:29:49,424
We had big plans. I was going off
the bridge into his boat.

650
01:29:51,197 --> 01:29:53,595
Oh poor Lily,
whatever happened to her?

651
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:56,515
She must have drowned
and washed out to sea.

652
01:29:57,453 --> 01:30:00,477
Thanks a lot,
you've ruined everything.

653
01:30:04,126 --> 01:30:05,690
Fuck you.

654
01:30:12,051 --> 01:30:15,179
What's the matter, Nicolas?
Did I make you jealous?

655
01:30:16,117 --> 01:30:17,890
Jealous? Yes.

656
01:30:20,497 --> 01:30:23,208
I was jealous.
I am jealous.

657
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:28,213
Come on, Nicolas!
You don't have to lick my ass.

658
01:30:28,839 --> 01:30:30,403
Just fuck me.

659
01:30:34,678 --> 01:30:36,346
- You know what?
- What?

660
01:30:36,972 --> 01:30:38,640
We can still go away.

661
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:42,394
Both of us. Together.

662
01:30:48,024 --> 01:30:49,693
That's so sweet.

663
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:53,134
Come here. Come here.

664
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:08,879
That's so romantic.

665
01:31:10,234 --> 01:31:11,902
Without the money?

666
01:31:14,196 --> 01:31:15,760
Are you nuts?

667
01:31:43,184 --> 01:31:45,165
That's a choice.

668
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:49,857
A bad choice.
There are other ones.

669
01:31:50,483 --> 01:31:52,881
What? Like doing the right thing?

670
01:31:57,782 --> 01:31:59,867
That's a start.

671
01:32:02,474 --> 01:32:04,559
I tried that once, Nicolas.

672
01:32:08,209 --> 01:32:09,877
And you know what it got me?

673
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:14,569
A lifetime of looking
over my shoulder.

674
01:32:17,176 --> 01:32:19,887
You know why no good deed
goes unpunished?

675
01:32:22,494 --> 01:32:26,352
Because this world is hell and
you're nothing but a fucking patsy.

676
01:32:31,461 --> 01:32:33,859
I made everybody think
you kidnapped me...

677
01:32:34,172 --> 01:32:36,883
...so I could screw my husband
out of 10 million bucks.

678
01:32:37,926 --> 01:32:39,594
That's what it's all about...

679
01:32:40,533 --> 01:32:43,244
...me disappearing with
10 million bucks.

680
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:46,998
So...wipe it off...

681
01:32:47,832 --> 01:32:49,500
...and let's go get it.

682
01:32:58,884 --> 01:33:00,240
Fuck you.

683
01:33:21,303 --> 01:33:23,284
You're not gonna hurt her, right?

684
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:25,995
Because I've done exactly
what you told me to do.

685
01:33:28,914 --> 01:33:30,687
I've brought the money...

686
01:33:31,313 --> 01:33:33,294
...and I haven't talked to anyone.

687
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:48,205
- Don't do anything foolish, darling.
- I won't.

688
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:52,584
He just wants me to take the money
and bring it back to him.

689
01:34:04,784 --> 01:34:06,869
It's Nicolas Bardo.

690
01:34:07,078 --> 01:34:10,206
Your wife is staging this kidnapping
to take you for 10 million bucks.

691
01:34:10,727 --> 01:34:13,125
If you don't believe me,
I got it right here on tape.

692
01:34:19,903 --> 01:34:21,988
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

693
01:34:22,197 --> 01:34:23,970
You killed him?

694
01:34:24,282 --> 01:34:26,055
Just being careful.

695
01:34:39,402 --> 01:34:42,843
That fucking bitch.
She's at it again!

696
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:58,796
The fucking bitch!

697
01:35:24,864 --> 01:35:28,305
You didn't think I'd give you a gun
loaded with real bullets, did you?

698
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:41,651
Baby, there's one more thing
we gotta do...

699
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:52,391
Oh God, somebody help!
My husband!

700
01:35:56,562 --> 01:35:58,648
Fucking over everyone again!

701
01:36:00,941 --> 01:36:03,340
- How did you find me?
- Not this time.

702
01:36:04,591 --> 01:36:05,946
Where...

703
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:08,970
...are the diamonds?

704
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,184
Fuck you!

705
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:22,943
Wake up, bitch...

706
01:36:27,322 --> 01:36:28,990
...before you die.

707
01:40:06,812 --> 01:40:08,585
You know what's in this?

708
01:40:11,192 --> 01:40:14,633
The bullet that is gonna spread
your brains all over that wall.

709
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:17,969
You know how I know?
Look at me!

710
01:40:19,846 --> 01:40:21,619
I'm your fucking fairy godmother...

711
01:40:22,974 --> 01:40:25,998
...and I just dreamt your future.
And mine too.

712
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:28,605
And all I know is...

713
01:40:28,918 --> 01:40:31,525
...if there's a snowball chance in hell
that any of that shit happening...

714
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,610
...we're gonna change it right here.

715
01:40:37,572 --> 01:40:38,928
Now, listen.

716
01:40:40,596 --> 01:40:42,577
I know you got a bad break,
but that's history...

717
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:44,663
...and you'd better fuckin' forget it,
'cause if you can't...

718
01:40:45,914 --> 01:40:47,895
Well, then you may as well go
ahead and pull the trigger.

719
01:40:51,023 --> 01:40:53,109
But if you don't end it here...

720
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:56,132
...and you get your ass
on that plane to America...

721
01:40:57,488 --> 01:40:59,886
...your future will be sitting
right next to you.

722
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,474
His name is Bruce
and he's a really good guy...

723
01:41:04,474 --> 01:41:06,872
...and he's gonna look
into your eyes...

724
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:09,583
and he's gonna fall in love.

725
01:41:15,214 --> 01:41:17,195
And after that
you're on your own.

726
01:41:19,802 --> 01:41:21,887
So what do you say?

727
01:41:22,513 --> 01:41:24,181
Do I pull the trigger...

728
01:41:24,807 --> 01:41:26,580
...or do you get your ass
on that plane...

729
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,603
...and have a wonderful life?

730
01:41:34,713 --> 01:41:37,111
How do I know that
you tell the truth?

731
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:43,784
How do I know there is
a bullet in the chamber?

732
01:42:24,763 --> 01:42:27,161
That sure is pretty.
Where did you get it?

733
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,773
In a curio shop in Belleville.

734
01:42:36,128 --> 01:42:38,527
I got it for my daughter.

735
01:42:39,465 --> 01:42:42,593
I've got a little girl myself.
She'll be ten next June.

736
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:46,243
Do you remember
the name of the store?

737
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:48,537
I make a lot of deliveries there.

738
01:42:49,475 --> 01:42:52,290
I'd sure like to get her something
like that for her birthday.

739
01:43:01,988 --> 01:43:04,073
You give this to her.

740
01:43:12,623 --> 01:43:15,021
That's sure nice of you.

741
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:18,775
She'll just love it.

742
01:43:19,609 --> 01:43:21,695
It's just for a little girl.

743
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,031
When she grows up,
she'll think it's too silly.

744
01:43:25,344 --> 01:43:28,055
So just take it
and hang it right there.

745
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:33,582
So that, when you're
on the road...

746
01:43:36,188 --> 01:43:39,004
...your little girl will always
be with you.

747
01:44:00,275 --> 01:44:03,612
Sir is not at home
at the moment!

748
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:05,697
What are you doing,
dodging bill collectors?

749
01:44:05,801 --> 01:44:08,304
- I don't understand.
- Nick, asshole, it's Johnny!

750
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:10,494
- I know who you are.
- What are you doing?

751
01:44:10,598 --> 01:44:12,892
Well just trying to catch
a little lightning in a bottle.

752
01:44:12,892 --> 01:44:14,873
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

753
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,854
How would you like
to make some real money?

754
01:44:16,958 --> 01:44:20,399
- What are you selling, John?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

755
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,423
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

756
01:44:23,944 --> 01:44:27,281
He's got this wife and three kids but
no one seems to have a picture of them.

757
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:29,575
Well, yeah maybe they're camera shy?

758
01:44:29,575 --> 01:44:33,016
There are some people, they like
to keep their home life private.

759
01:44:33,329 --> 01:44:35,310
I know that is weird
but they do.

760
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,438
What's happening to you? D'you found
a fucking god? You owe me, pal.

761
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:41,045
Then I guess I have
to keep on owing you.

762
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:43,130
That's your half.

763
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,737
There it is a little under
four million.

764
01:44:46,988 --> 01:44:50,429
That's the best I could do.
I had to fence them off one at a time.

765
01:44:51,263 --> 01:44:53,975
Sorry that it took so long but
it was the safest way.

766
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,103
Not bad for a night's work, huh?

767
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:59,709
You call that work?

768
01:45:02,003 --> 01:45:05,131
Goodbye, Laure. It's best
we don't see each other again.

769
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:28,280
Gather around for the picture!

770
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:03,002
Let's wait for the sun.

771
01:49:02,348 --> 01:49:05,789
- Excuse me lady, are you all right?
- It was an accident, it was a terr...

772
01:49:11,107 --> 01:49:13,818
Sorry, I'm just so shook up.

773
01:49:21,117 --> 01:49:23,515
Actually, you look like
you need a drink...

774
01:49:25,496 --> 01:49:26,852
A drink?

775
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,354
Yes. Come on.

776
01:49:36,966 --> 01:49:38,426
I'm sorry...

777
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,928
You look so familiar.

778
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:44,682
Haven't we met before?
Somewhere?

779
01:49:46,037 --> 01:49:47,706
Only in my dreams.
