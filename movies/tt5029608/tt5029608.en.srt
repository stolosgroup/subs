2
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,870
The white ones, please.

3
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,205
Twenty pfennig.

4
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:25,419
Thank you.

5
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,713
Pretty girl.

6
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,629
Excuse me.

7
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,841
Do you know who put
flowers on that grave?

8
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,134
Which one?

9
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,179
Frantz Hoffmeister.

10
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,431
Right.

11
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,602
Must've been the foreigner.

12
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,312
Where is he from?

13
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,525
A French coin.

14
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,176
He left flowers on the grave?

15
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:38,928
Roses.

16
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,390
Do you know who he could be?

17
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,021
Maybe a French friend from before the war.

18
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,983
Don't mention it to Hans.

19
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,698
How is he doing?

20
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,119
He hasn't left his office.

21
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,122
It's hard for him.

22
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,252
For all of us.

23
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,714
Does it still hurt?

24
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:19,343
In the evenings,
when I've walked too much.

25
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,137
You will dance again.

26
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,724
The French didn't get your leg.

27
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,101
Thank you, Doctor.

28
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,772
We haven't seen you
at our meetings for months.

29
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,567
I love Germany.

30
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,529
But I love my son more.

31
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,907
I understand.

32
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,369
But must we accept defeat?

33
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,954
Humiliation?

34
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,416
You share our desire
for a strong, powerful nation...

35
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,962
You're here for your leg, Mr. Kreutz.

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,593
Continue the treatment for a week.
That should do it.

37
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,557
There's something else
I wanted to speak to you about.

38
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,020
It's Anna.

39
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,063
Anna?

40
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:19,278
I know she has no family
and loves you like a father.

41
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,407
I know she was engaged to your son...

42
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,535
but I'd like to ask for her hand.

43
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,913
Does she love you?

44
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,666
She will.

45
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,549
Mr. Kreutz wants to speak to you.

46
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,760
Me?

47
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,265
Come in.

48
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:51,810
Good day.

49
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,437
Good day, Anna.

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,938
Have a seat.

51
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,570
How are your studies?

52
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,825
I quit.

53
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,285
What a shame.

54
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,330
I've lost the will.

55
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,836
We've all lost loved ones.

56
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,839
But we must go on living.

57
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,716
We must rebuild.

58
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,968
Yes.

59
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,889
That's what Frantz wrote me
in his last letter.

60
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,228
I know how you feel.

61
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,439
You wouldn't be here if you did.

62
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,736
I can help you forget Frantz.

63
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,992
I don't want to forget him.

64
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,704
How were your patients?

65
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,749
The usual colds.

66
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,128
It's springtime.

67
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,425
Will you go to the ball Saturday?

68
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,509
No.

69
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,430
They've got new dresses in town.

70
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,056
Who would I go with?

71
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,101
Mr. Kreutz.

72
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,605
He wants you to be happy.

73
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,443
Who could that be?

74
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,654
A patient, at this hour?

75
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,202
Come in.

76
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,921
Your name?

77
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,924
Rivoire.

78
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,051
Adrien Rivoire.

79
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,553
You're not from here?

80
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,637
No.

81
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,306
Where are you from?

82
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,642
Paris.

83
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,566
You're French?

84
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,025
Yes.

85
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm sorry. I can't treat you.

86
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,701
Doctor, I must speak to you.

87
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,828
Please go.

88
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,955
I'm not ill, I wanted...

89
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,081
Enough!

90
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,132
Every Frenchman is my son's murderer.

91
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,012
Please leave.

92
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,274
You're right, Doctor.

93
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,693
I was a soldier too.

94
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,404
And I am a murderer too.

95
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,850
Maybe in Frantz's room.

96
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,368
What did the Frenchman say?

97
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,247
You know him?

98
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,749
No.

99
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,626
I saw him at the cemetery.

100
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,920
At the cemetery?

101
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,507
He's come to Frantz's grave
the past two days.

102
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,926
This morning he was crying.

103
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,970
What did he say to you?

104
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,851
Nothing.

105
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,355
I refused to treat him.

106
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,067
But Hans!

107
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,028
He must be a friend of Frantz's.

108
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,280
Someone he knew in Paris.

109
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:56,133
Tell me, is this person staying here?

110
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,804
I'm sorry, he's out.

111
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,146
Looking for someone?

112
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,230
Surely it's me.

113
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,314
No.

114
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,819
- Will you see that he gets it?
- Consider it done.

115
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,781
I know I upset you yesterday.

116
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,659
But will you let me take you to the ball?

117
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,746
Dr. Hoffmeister is not opposed.

118
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,082
I haven't got the heart to dance.

119
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,001
Good-bye, Mr. Kreutz.

120
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,631
Who's the letter for?

121
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,009
The Frenchman.

122
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,471
Are you sure he'll come?

123
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,639
I hope so.

124
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,561
If only Hans hadn't sent him away.

125
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,608
Will Hans come down?

126
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,402
I hope so.

127
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,364
My God, he's here!

128
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,917
Welcome.

129
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,758
I am Frantz's mother.

130
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,718
Good evening.

131
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,347
This is Anna.
She's like a daughter to us.

132
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,641
Frantz's fiancée.

133
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,226
Good evening.

134
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,104
I saw you at the cemetery.

135
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,607
I left the note at the hotel.

136
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:37,984
May I?

137
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,194
Your coat.

138
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,665
This is my husband.

139
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,502
You've already met.

140
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,256
Good evening.

141
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,677
Please come in.

142
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,143
Have a seat.

143
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,063
You have so much to tell us.

144
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,573
How old are you?

145
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,951
Twenty-four.

146
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,496
Frantz would have been 24 in February.

147
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,498
You speak German well.

148
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,376
I get by.

149
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,211
You knew Frantz?

150
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,506
Yes.

151
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,926
You met in France?

152
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,430
Yes.

153
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,683
During his last trip there?

154
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,902
Pardon me.

155
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:12,787
Thank you for your tears
and for your flowers on his grave.

156
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:18,001
We're very touched
to speak with a friend of his

157
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,297
who knew him well and remembers him.

158
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,009
I'm not saying that
because I'm his mother.

159
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,219
Anna too.

160
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,473
We were to be married this autumn.

161
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,684
His favorite season.

162
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,065
Verlaine wrote a poem about autumn.
Frantz taught it to me.

163
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,192
In French.

164
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,577
We understand
how hard it must be to talk about him.

165
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,872
How hard it must be...

166
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,250
to meet his family.

167
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,215
So you think of him always?

168
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,890
And you'll never forget him?

169
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,351
How could I?

170
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,736
Please forgive my husband.

171
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,072
He loved Frantz so much.

172
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,074
He was our only son.

173
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,577
He wishes he could have died instead.

174
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,080
So do I.

175
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,796
Would you tell us how you two met?

176
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,966
The first time.

177
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,593
And the last time?

178
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,139
How was he the last time?

179
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,475
The last time?

180
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:04,274
The last time I saw him...

181
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,692
Was he happy?

182
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,986
“Glücklich”...

183
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,195
Happy.

184
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,449
Was it in Paris?

185
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,284
Before the war?

186
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,124
Yes.

187
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,544
It was in Paris.

188
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,133
I picked him up at his hotel...

189
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,929
and we went to the Louvre.

190
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,849
Two friends.

191
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,562
It was a beautiful day.

192
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,359
He enjoyed seeing the paintings.

193
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,278
And so did I.

194
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,243
We spent some time
looking at Manet's paintings.

195
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,458
I remember...

196
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,630
I remember there was one
he particularly liked.

197
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,344
The one of a pale young man...

198
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,014
with his head thrown back.

199
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,386
Tonight it felt like Frantz was back home.

200
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,973
God bless you.

201
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,641
Thank you.

202
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,567
Thank you for tonight.

203
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,197
You brought them some comfort.

204
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,909
Not Mr. Hoffmeister.

205
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,619
Him too.

206
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,624
It's good you came.

207
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,711
I'm not sure.

208
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,173
Good night.

209
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,258
Good night, Adrien.

210
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,057
HERE LIES FRANTZ HOFFMEISTER

211
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,405
There's nothing under the flowers.

212
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,700
Nothing?

213
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:30,164
They buried him in France,
anonymously, with other soldiers.

214
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,752
We only know the date of his death.

215
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,965
Sometimes I feel like he's not dead.

216
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,718
And he'll be back.

217
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,055
I'm sure he can hear us.

218
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,691
<i>The lingering wails of autumn violins</i>

219
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,486
<i>Make my heart languish and sigh</i>

220
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,574
<i>Breathless and pale</i>

221
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,826
<i>When the bell tolls</i>

222
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,580
<i>I remember days gone by</i>

223
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,707
<i>And I cry</i>

224
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,546
<i>And I go where ill winds blow</i>

225
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>Taking me to and fro</i>

226
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,009
<i>Like a dead leaf</i>

227
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,597
You have a lovely accent.

228
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,434
We often spoke in French.

229
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,603
Our secret language.

230
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,564
Frantz loved France so much.

231
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,485
But he never told me about you.

232
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,991
What was it between you?

233
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,287
A woman?

234
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,379
Then what?

235
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,592
Just friendship.

236
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,268
I'd forgotten this...

237
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,232
The sound of the wind in the leaves.

238
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,985
That sound is why I love spring.

239
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,331
This way.

240
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,440
Did you two come here often?

241
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,191
Yes.

242
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,194
This is where Frantz asked for my hand.

243
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,531
Before he left for the war.

244
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,036
How did you meet?

245
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,372
Didn't he tell you?

246
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,960
In a bookshop when we were students.

247
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,922
He was looking for French poetry...

248
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,717
and I was looking for German poetry.

249
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,180
He asked me who my favorite poet was.

250
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,141
I said Rilke.

251
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,852
And he said Verlaine.

252
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,897
He could've told you about me.

253
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,780
I was jealous of his studies in France.

254
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:54,660
I wish I could have gone with him,
but I think he preferred to be alone.

255
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,580
Far from his country, his family...

256
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,128
He promised we'd go for our honeymoon.

257
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,216
He'd show me Paris.

258
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,010
The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre,

259
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,553
the Grands Boulevards...

260
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,472
I'm hot.

261
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,183
Fancy a swim?

262
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,019
We have no bathing suits.

263
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:20,937
So what?

264
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,688
Let's go.

265
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,684
Feels great.

266
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,229
You should've gone in.

267
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,983
Actually, I don't know how to swim.

268
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,026
Really?

269
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,363
I could've taught you.

270
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,871
Are those war wounds?

271
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,049
You must've suffered a lot.

272
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,431
My only wound is Frantz.

273
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,111
He resembles him.

274
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,529
Don't you think?

275
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:01,078
Not physically, but in his demeanor.

276
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,039
Shy and stormy.

277
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,833
I'm glad he's here.

278
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,919
Any brothers or sisters?

279
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,588
No.

280
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,467
I always wanted a brother.

281
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:17,720
And your parents?

282
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,642
My father died when I was a boy.

283
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,978
My mother took over the domain.

284
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,649
It's been hard, with the war.

285
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,568
What did your father do?

286
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,196
Business.

287
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,324
But he was mainly a musician.

288
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,411
He passed down his passion to me.

289
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,497
I studied at the Conservatory.

290
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,211
Then I became a violinist
in the Orchestre de Paris.

291
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:55,216
But now, since the war,
I can't do it anymore.

292
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,259
You no longer want to play?

293
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,098
I can't hear the notes.

294
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,690
Often, Frantz would play violin for us.

295
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,113
He was not a great musician,
but he played with all his heart.

296
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,641
His room.

297
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,479
It has remained as he left it.

298
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,066
His books.

299
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,945
His clothing, folded in the wardrobe.

300
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,409
Frantz must've been happy here.

301
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:05,995
Yes.

302
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,248
But I ruined it all.

303
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,634
I urged him to enlist.

304
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,390
I sent him into battle.

305
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,727
It was his duty.

306
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,772
To serve the Fatherland.

307
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,982
I was told the same thing.

308
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,588
This... is like my son's heart.

309
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,813
Take it to France.

310
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,440
No.

311
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,529
Tell them an old German gave it to you.

312
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
No, I can't.

313
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,590
This is the last photo of Frantz.

314
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,301
The next day he left for the front.

315
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,012
Frantz hated the war.

316
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,932
He always said
the French were his brothers.

317
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,184
That's enough now.

318
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,650
Read it out loud.

319
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,361
“My dear parents...

320
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,366
How I long to run away and be near you,

321
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,993
far from this chaos.

322
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,706
This morning
we came across a dead soldier.

323
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,584
As though he'd opened our eyes...

324
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,464
we found ourselves in a sea of corpses.

325
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,673
French?

326
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,758
German?

327
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,093
How could we tell?

328
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,513
In school, French children learn German

329
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,515
and German children learn French.

330
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,604
And when they grow up,
they have to kill each other.”

331
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,648
I must go. Thank you.

332
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,232
Before you go...

333
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,611
could you do us a favor?

334
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,086
Play for us.

335
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,716
Don't be afraid to make us happy.

336
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,477
Will you be all right?

337
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,649
Perhaps you caught cold at the lake.

338
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,528
Frantz was a pacifist.

339
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,448
Didn't you know?

340
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,162
I'm sorry it upsets you.

341
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,415
It doesn't. I felt the same.

342
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,552
Feeling better?

343
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,097
Will we see you tomorrow?

344
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,602
This makes no sense.

345
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,854
It does them good.

346
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,024
Me too.

347
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,866
Well then,
would you like to go to the ball?

348
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,535
The ball?

349
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,038
I saw a poster for the Spring Ball.

350
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,707
- And I thought...
- All right.

351
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,459
You look beautiful.

352
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,087
The dress really suits you.

353
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,256
- Does it?
- Yes.

354
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,009
Frantz would've loved it.

355
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,970
You're positively ravishing.

356
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,474
Don't tell anyone,
but it's a French model.

357
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,268
Straight from Paris.

358
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,944
Thank you.

359
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,085
That Frenchman.

360
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,420
What's he doing here?

361
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,089
Not sure this is a good idea.

362
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,175
Don't worry.

363
00:36:58,634 --> 00:36:59,676
I'm here.

364
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,519
Come.

365
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,355
Oh, no... I can't.

366
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,107
You can't waltz?

367
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,651
No. Well, yes, but no.

368
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,819
Come on.

369
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:33,562
Am I okay?

370
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,120
Would you like to dance with us?

371
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,231
Thought you didn't have
the heart to dance?

372
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,652
Someone talked you into it.

373
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,030
He's a friend of Frantz's.

374
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,866
Right. A Frenchy.

375
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,285
So?

376
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:34,748
A Frenchman here today,
at a German party.

377
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,875
Don't you read the papers?

378
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,418
The war is over.

379
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,837
Shame on you!

380
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,675
I wanted to ask you for this dance.

381
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,886
I see there's no point.

382
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:00,899
Here...

383
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,943
- Take my jacket.
- Thanks.

384
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,155
I've never drunk so much.

385
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,492
I've never danced so much.

386
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,244
Frantz loved to dance.

387
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,455
But he wasn't as popular as you.

388
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,375
If he'd have come back,
he would've been.

389
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,215
Why do you say that?

390
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,135
Because I'd have married him
and kept my eye on him.

391
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,226
I see why you were friends.

392
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,569
Your jacket.

393
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,575
Thanks.

394
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,078
Thank you too.

395
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,915
Good night.

396
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,001
Good night.

397
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,436
- Shit...
- Can I help you?

398
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,771
Are you all right?

399
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,236
Are you okay?

400
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,740
Hands off! You make me sick!

401
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:45,879
<i>Dear Anna...</i>

402
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,882
I must...

403
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,136
write you this letter.

404
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,267
I must tell you...

405
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,371
Hello, my friends.

406
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,501
I thought our meetings
no longer interested you.

407
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,086
They do, more than ever.

408
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,254
And...

409
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,799
to make up for my absence...

410
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,343
let me buy this round.

411
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,594
Waiter...

412
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,764
Eight beers, please.

413
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,057
Count me out.

414
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,018
- Seven, then.
- Make it six, Doctor.

415
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,019
Five.

416
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,271
Four.

417
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,737
Fine.

418
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,573
One beer for me.

419
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,326
We were just talking about you.

420
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:02,414
Then it's a good thing I came.

421
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,292
You should've brought your new friend.

422
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,376
True.

423
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,378
That's a good idea.

424
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,178
Gentlemen...

425
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,017
That young man came from France...

426
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,104
to place flowers on my son's grave.

427
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,941
Show him some respect.

428
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,778
<i>Shall we sing La Marseillaise too?</i>

429
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,408
I stopped singing when my son died.

430
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,660
And who killed your son?

431
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:41,620
And my son?

432
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,663
And my two sons?

433
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:52,464
And my son, your son, yours...

434
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,508
and your two boys...

435
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,302
Who sent them to the front?

436
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,640
Who furnished the ammunition and bayonets?

437
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:03,642
We did.

438
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,062
Their fathers.

439
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,482
On our side, as on the other side.

440
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:13,943
We...

441
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,072
are responsible.

442
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,327
When we killed their sons
by the thousands...

443
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,997
we celebrated our victory
by drinking beer.

444
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,334
And when they killed our sons...

445
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,755
they celebrated by drinking wine.

446
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,845
We are fathers who drink
to the death of our children.

447
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,020
Good day.

448
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,648
Good day, Adrien.

449
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,192
How are you today?

450
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:55,944
Much better.

451
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,070
Good.

452
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,365
Still coming to dinner?

453
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,408
Yes.

454
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:05,120
Magda's making her specialty.
You won't be disappointed.

455
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,162
Thank you.

456
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,414
See you tonight.

457
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,253

My key, please.

462
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,612
Let me introduce myself. Kreutz.

463
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,159
So you were a friend of Frantz's?

464
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,705
And you came here
to dance with his fiancée?

465
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,375
I don't know what you mean.

466
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,336
Our German maidens are pretty.
Good dancers too.

467
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,337
Kreutz!

468
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,964
Stop it.

469
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,216
Imbecile.

470
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,496
Good evening.

471
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,539
Is Mr. Rivoire here?

472
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,957
No, miss.

473
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,293
Has he left?

474
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,295
No, his train leaves tomorrow.

475
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,505
And tonight?

476
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,008
He went out without a word.

477
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,356
I was waiting for you.

478
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,358
How did you know I would come?

479
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,193
I hoped you would.

480
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,447
Why didn't you come for dinner?
Or let us know?

481
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:47,991
You're right...

482
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,826
You hurt their feelings.

483
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,120
This has got to stop!

484
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,874
Frantz! Me. This charade.

485
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,542
What charade?

486
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,919
Our Franco-German friendship.

487
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,260
I have to confess everything.

488
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,013
Confess what?

489
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,269
“The noise is terrifying.

490
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,979
You can't imagine.

491
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,233
The battle will be horrendous.

492
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,904
But we won't all die.
With any luck, I'll survive.

493
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,489
In a pocket next to my heart,

494
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,909
I keep the dried rose you sent me...”

495
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,911
How do you know that letter?

496
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,751
It was the 15th of September.

497
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,006
The 15th of September, 1918.

498
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,598
<i>My regiment was stationed
near Dormans, in the Marne.</i>

499
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,684
<i>We got up like any other day.</i>

500
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,981
<i>We were trudging through the fields
on reconnaissance. Quietly.</i>

501
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,362
<i>Suddenly, the enemy launched an assault.</i>

502
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,324
<i>Some of us were hit right away.</i>

503
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,500
<i>I ran.</i>

504
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,505
<i>I ran for the shelter of the trenches.</i>

505
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,763
<i>I came face to face with a man.</i>

506
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,516
<i>He, a German soldier.</i>

507
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,893
<i>I, a French soldier.</i>

508
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,063
<i>His eyes were so big, so full of despair.</i>

509
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:45,400
<i>Did they express sadness at dying...</i>

510
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,820
<i>or pity for me at having to kill him?</i>

511
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:57,662
<i>I shot my gun.</i>

512
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,707
<i>I shot first.</i>

513
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,458
<i>And he fell.</i>

514
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,647
I'm the one who killed Frantz.

515
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:26,899
Not you.

516
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:31,738
If only he'd shot me,
wounded me... but no.

517
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,366
His rifle wasn't even loaded.

518
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,494
He didn't defend himself.

519
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,835
<i>A shell struck nearby
and I was blown on top of him.</i>

520
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:50,214
<i>Our two bodies lying together.</i>

521
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,091
<i>Him...</i>

522
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:53,468
<i>dead.</i>

523
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,553
<i>And me alive.</i>

524
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,954
<i>There was a letter in his jacket.</i>

525
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,082
<i>I read it.</i>

526
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,418
<i>It's been with me since.</i>

527
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,254
<i>Etched into me.</i>

528
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,178
The letter was for you, Anna.

529
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,849
Why did you come here?

530
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,561
To ask for your forgiveness.

531
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,150
To unburden myself.

532
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,321
To learn about the man I killed.

533
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,742
I wanted to tell you right away
but you saw me here.

534
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:03,538
You believed in our friendship.
I didn't dare set you straight.

535
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,417
Thanks to my lie,
I've gotten to know Frantz.

536
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,629
His family, his house...

537
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,422
his fiancée.

538
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,593
Each day, I've loved him a bit more.

539
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:23,307
Each day, my pain has grown more acute.

540
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,563
So the Louvre...

541
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,192
the Manet paintings,
the violin lessons...

542
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,653
You lied to us.

543
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:38,281
Yes.

544
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,162
I'm a coward.

545
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,634
And maybe it made us all feel better.

546
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,233
Wait!

547
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,570
My train leaves tomorrow at noon.

548
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,659
I'll go tell them everything.

549
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,456
See you tomorrow.

550
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,807
Good morning.

551
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,475
Good morning, Mr. Rivoire.

552
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,977
My bill, please.

553
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,603
Right away.

554
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,286
I was about to go see the Hoffmeisters.

555
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,620
No need. I told them everything.

556
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,047
How did they take it?

557
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,466
As any parents would.

558
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,890
They don't want to see me anymore?

559
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,184
Right.

560
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,774
I understand.

561
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,741
Let's go.

562
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,538
Carriage 6. Have a nice trip.

563
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,925
Could I write to them after a while?

564
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,511
I don't think so.

565
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,014
Anna...

566
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,725
I need to write to them.

567
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,398
Then write directly to me.

568
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:02,360
I'll read them your letter.

569
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,278
You're right.

570
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,329
Thank you for everything.

571
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,581
Farewell.

572
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,757
Did you kiss him for us?

573
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,554
I hope his mother is not too ill.

574
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:15,516
Did you tell him we hope
to hear him play violin again?

575
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,351
I did.

576
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,270
When might he be back?

577
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:23,732
That'll depend on his mother and his work.

578
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,153
Soon, no doubt. Two or three months.

579
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:28,529
Wonderful.

580
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,406
Let's eat.

581
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,453
He could've come to tell us good-bye.

582
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,873
He's sorry about that.

583
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,127
One always forgives the young.

584
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,387
<i>My dear Anna,</i>

585
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,265
<i>I'm writing this letter in French,</i>

586
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,642
<i>to be sure my parents can't read it.</i>

587
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,769
<i>I hope you'll get it.</i>

588
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,229
<i>It's cold and muddy here.</i>

589
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,024
<i>An attack could be launched at any moment.</i>

590
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,693
<i>The noise is terrifying.</i>

591
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,778
<i>You can't imagine.</i>

592
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,323
<i>The battle will be horrendous.</i>

593
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:40,244
<i>But we won't all die.
With any luck, I'll survive.</i>

594
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,956
<i>In a pocket next to my heart...</i>

595
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,668
<i>I keep the dried rose
you sent me in your last letter.</i>

596
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:53,924
<i>Promise me, my dear Anna,
that' if anything happens to me</i>

597
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,676
<i>you will keep loving life...</i>

598
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,720
<i>and be happy.</i>

599
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,037
Why did you do that?

600
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,832
Enough death, with the war.

601
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,003
You live at Dr. Hoffmeister's?

602
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,550
Don't tell anyone.

603
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,237
Still a slight fever.

604
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,739
You must eat.

605
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,575
It's nice and hot.

606
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,123
I'm not hungry.

607
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,085
You used to have such a good appetite.

608
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:03,048
The bookseller received
the book you ordered.

609
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,050
Thank you, Magda.

610
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,461
A little fresh air.

611
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:27,799
Anna...

612
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,929
When we lost Frantz...

613
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,223
you comforted us.

614
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,644
You helped us survive.

615
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,522
Now it's our turn.

616
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,234
However, you must get up.

617
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,487
You must go outside.

618
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,114
You must live.

619
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,209
Something for you.

620
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,293
What is it?

621
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:09,967
I'll be right back.

622
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:12,678
Excuse me.

623
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,640
- What is it?
- A letter from Paris.

624
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,143
Finally.

625
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,150
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

626
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:30,946
<i>As promised,
I waited several weeks before writing.</i>

627
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,115
<i>My return to France has been difficult,</i>

628
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,325
<i>but I'm trying to survive.</i>

629
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,577
<i>I'm enclosing my letter
for Frantz's parents.</i>

630
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,789
<i>I know it cannot expunge my crime,</i>

631
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,959
<i>but I hope it will explain
why I came to you all.</i>

632
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,546
<i>I know forgiveness is impossible.</i>

633
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,800
<i>But please, write back to me.
I await your letter, Anna.</i>

634
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:53,218
“Since my return,

635
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,303
I've been caring for my mother.

636
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,806
She's doing much better.

637
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:02,102
I told her about the wonderful time
I spent with you,

638
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,355
Frantz's dear family.

639
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,735
In Paris, life goes on.

640
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:14,156
Everyone's trying to forget
the pain of the war.

641
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:19,411
I'm pleased to be playing
with the Orchestre de Paris again.

642
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,956
The music soothes me...”

643
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,711
<i>The music soothes me,
gives me strength and restores my joy.</i>

644
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,630
<i>We'll be going on tour for several months,</i>

645
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,925
<i>but as soon as time permits,
I'll try to come see you.</i>

646
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:37,763
<i>I promise Dr. Hoffmeister
I will play Frantz's violin again.</i>

647
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,433
<i>My dear friends, I hope you are well.</i>

648
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,851
“I hope you are well.

649
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:47,481
I miss you
and the clean air of Quedlinburg.

650
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,441
See you very soon.

651
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,068
Your Adrien.”

652
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,531
Did you read us everything?

653
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,791
We received your letter...

654
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:08,877
and...

655
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,775
<i>Father, you know my lie...</i>

656
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,528
and the anguish it causes me.

657
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:38,782
God in his infinite wisdom
has heard you, my child.

658
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,412
Though he condemns lying...

659
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:49,042
your silence
regarding the death of your fiancé

660
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,295
comes from a pure intention
and is thus excused.

661
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:57,008
So I shouldn't tell them?

662
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,303
What would the truth bring?

663
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,391
Only more pain.

664
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,686
Only more tears.

665
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:14,442
What do you feel for the young Frenchman?

666
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:20,115
I don't know anymore.

667
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,619
He killed the man I loved.

668
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,624
That French soldier...

669
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,003
came to Germany...

670
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:35,547
to ask forgiveness.

671
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,177
Forgive him.

672
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,182
As Jesus forgave those who crucified him.

673
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,186
I absolve you from your sins, my child.

674
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:01,698
Amen.

675
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,000
Good day, Anna.

676
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,212
Good day, Mr. Kreutz.

677
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:17,714
How are you feeling?

678
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:19,466
Well, thank you.

679
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,509
I heard you'd taken ill.

680
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:24,179
That's over now.

681
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:25,889
Glad to hear it.

682
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,268
My behavior was foolish, idiotic.

683
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:36,358
So many Germans died in France.
It's easy to feel angry at a Frenchman.

684
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:38,735
I know.

685
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,030
I don't share
Dr. Hoffmeister's convictions...

686
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:47,619
but it was brave of him
to open his doors to a Frenchman...

687
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,789
who could've killed his son.

688
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,337
I'm sorry to bring that up again.

689
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,718
I know how much you loved Frantz.

690
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,101
I saw Kreutz this afternoon.

691
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:12,769
And?

692
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,731
He asked for my hand again.

693
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:19,859
He never gives up.

694
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,325
What if I were to say yes?

695
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:33,290
You want to marry him?

696
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,792
That was your wish.

697
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,128
Before we met Adrien.

698
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:45,593
<i>Dear Adrien...</i>

699
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:49,139
<i>Forgive me for taking so long
to write you back.</i>

700
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,558
<i>Our pain is still immense,</i>

701
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,728
<i>but we know that you, like Frantz,</i>

702
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,272
<i>are a victim of that horrible war.</i>

703
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,151
<i>You were forced
to kill an enemy in wartime.</i>

704
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,446
<i>You did your duty as a French soldier.</i>

705
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:10,493
<i>I've come to understand
and accept your lie.</i>

706
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,288
To France.

707
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,999
<i>Autumn promises to be lovely this year.</i>

708
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,209
<i>We're ready to see you again.</i>

709
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,920
<i>Feel free to write to me.</i>

710
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,424
<i>I promise I'll write you back immediately.</i>

711
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:26,384
<i>Your Anna.</i>

712
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,684
“Return to sender”.

713
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,479
He's no longer at this address.

714
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,856
Do you have another one?

715
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,484
No.

716
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,951
You must find Adrien, as he found us.

717
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,870
Impossible, Magda.

718
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:56,790
You know his name

719
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,875
and his former address.

720
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,460
You'll find him.

721
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,797
What if something has happened to him?

722
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,757
It's better to know.

723
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,760
You can't be left in the dark.

724
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:13,640
You're young and beautiful.

725
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,558
Your whole life is ahead of you.

726
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:20,688
Don't let this chance pass you by.
Go to France and bring him back to us.

727
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:35,537
Have a good trip, Anna.

728
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,290
Be safe.

729
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,504
Give Adrien our love.
Tell him we're waiting for him.

730
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,925
Everything will be fine.

731
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:58,017
Bon voyage!

732
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,561
See you soon.

733
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:01,813
Good-bye.

734
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,600
- Carriage 2.
- Thank you.

735
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:55,825
Passports, please.

736
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:02,290
German?

737
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,296
- Why have you come to France?
- To see a friend.

738
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:09,964
A prisoner?

739
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,592
No, he's French.

740
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,497
Evening, little lady. Where to?

741
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,292
Hôtel des Camélias, Passage des Arcanes.

742
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,960
Right. Get in.

743
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,347
- First time at that hotel?
- Yes.

744
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,892
My fiancée stayed there before the war.

745
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,437
I can see why.

746
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,231
Bet he had fun.

747
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,420
Room 3.

748
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,840
Upstairs, on the left.

749
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,142
Tomorrow?

750
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,310
The day after?

751
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,621
Excuse me, madam.

752
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:13,833
I'm looking for Adrien Rivoire.
He used to live here?

753
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,919
- Yes, but he left some time ago.
- When?

754
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:18,796
A few months ago.

755
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,007
Do you know where he lives now?

756
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,885
He left no forwarding address.
I've got mail for him.

757
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:27,013
- Any idea how I could find him?
- None at all.

758
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,389
Good-bye, miss.

759
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,112
I'm looking for violinist Adrien Rivoire.

760
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,405
Do you know him?

761
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:47,074
Sorry, I don't know the musicians by name.

762
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,285
He works here,
with the Orchestre de Paris.

763
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,371
There are tickets available for tonight.

764
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,208
<i>Dear Magda, dear Hans...</i>

765
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,543
<i>The trip went well.</i>

766
01:19:57,627 --> 01:20:00,004
<i>I have arrived in Paris.</i>

767
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:03,549
<i>Everything is different
from what Frantz told us.</i>

768
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:06,344
<i>I suppose the war changed many things.</i>

769
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:08,304
<i>As planned,</i>

770
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,642
<i>I'm staying at the same hotel
Frantz stayed in as a student.</i>

771
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:17,480
<i>Tonight I'm going to the Opera
in the hopes of finding Adrien.</i>

772
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:22,485
<i>First, I'll go to the Louvre to see
the paintings Frantz loved so much.</i>

773
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:34,914
To all our sons,

774
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,208
who gave their lives for France.

790
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,417
Good day, sir.
I'm looking for a Manet painting

791
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,003
of a young man with his head thrown back.

792
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,922
In the back on the right.

793
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:06,964
Thank you.

794
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,895
Excuse me, may I?

795
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:42,703
I had him for a week,
then he was moved to another ward.

796
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,663
He was very ill?

797
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,792
Some pull through, others don't.

798
01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:51,295
So he committed suicide.

799
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:54,924
I didn't say that. But he was fragile.

800
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:56,217
An artist.

801
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:02,181
Go to the office
and consult the patients' register.

802
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,372
PASSY CEMETERY

803
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:48,519
Are you all right?

804
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,409
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for Mr. Rivoire's grave.

805
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,702
Rivoire...

806
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,120
He died in August.

807
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,581
Down that aisle on the right.

808
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,412
TO MY BELOVED HUSBAND

809
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,749
ANATOLE RIVOIRE
OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR

810
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:16,607
Good day.

811
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:19,485
Does Mrs. Rivoire live here?

812
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,362
May I see her?

813
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:23,948
Come in, miss.

814
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,664
My husband
was critically wounded in Verdun.

815
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,707
They amputated both his legs.

816
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,919
He lost the will to live after that.

817
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:40,464
He took matters into his own hands.

818
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:48,389
But it's not Anatole
you're looking for, it's Adrien.

819
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:54,103
I remember
seeing him at the Opera before the war.

820
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,438
A handsome young man.

821
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:59,358
His mother and Anatole had fallen out.

822
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,026
Over an inheritance.

823
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:02,903
Do you know where he might be?

824
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,448
You're from Germany, aren't you?

825
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,037
What is your relationship with Adrien?

826
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:15,708
We're friends.

827
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:12,431
Excuse me, sir.

828
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,683
I'm looking for the Rivoire house.

829
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,935
The château's on the edge of town.

830
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:53,722
Good day.

831
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,767
So you're little Anna?

832
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:59,228
Yes. Good day, madam.

833
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,063
What a surprise.

834
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,399
My son has told me so much about you.

835
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:04,983
He'll be so happy.

836
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,069
Let me embrace you.

837
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,324
Félicie, come get her things.

838
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,286
Adrien will be here soon.
He's out riding.

839
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:18,705
Come with me.

840
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,834
Do you understand me?

841
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,794
Are you fluent in French?

842
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:25,421
Wonderful.

843
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,174
It was hard when he came back.

844
01:30:29,258 --> 01:30:30,884
Everything's better now.

845
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,012
He left Paris, his orchestra

846
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,390
and came back to live here,

847
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,558
with me.

848
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:40,602
He helps me run the domain.

849
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,021
Here he is.

850
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:45,232
Adrien, look who's here.

851
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:53,824
My God, Anna...

852
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,247
You, here. In France.

853
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,834
How did you find us?

854
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,044
I came to Paris for a visit...

855
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,256
Your aunt gave me this address.

856
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:11,008
I'm so happy.

857
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:12,968
Have a seat.

858
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:18,724
Which hotel are you staying at?

859
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,350
I don't know yet.

860
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:22,311
There's a charming inn in town...

861
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,229
We have room here.

862
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:26,565
Yes, of course.

863
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:31,278
We're having some friends over
for dinner and a recital.

864
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,946
Please join us.

865
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,114
Thank you.

866
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,240
Tell me, Anna...

867
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:37,409
How are they doing?

868
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:38,952
Who?

869
01:31:39,036 --> 01:31:40,454
The Hoffmeisters.

870
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:45,626
Quite well.

871
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,252
Really?

872
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:53,717
Life goes on.

873
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,724
Why didn't you answer my letters?

874
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:04,436
I was desperate to hear from you.

875
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:07,439
I know.

876
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:10,192
I should have written you sooner.

877
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,279
But it wasn't easy.

878
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:17,699
Because of the Hoffmeisters?

879
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,747
They've forgiven you.

880
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,879
I came to tell you in person.

881
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:35,676
And you, Anna?

882
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:40,180
Me too.

883
01:32:46,687 --> 01:32:47,604
Thank you.

884
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:51,483
Those are the sweetest words
I'll ever hear.

885
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,238
Though I will never forgive myself.

886
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,575
Time, Adrien.

887
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:02,619
Time will help you forget.

888
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,669
Want to swim again?

889
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:14,214
Will you join me this time?

890
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,632
Sure.

891
01:33:15,716 --> 01:33:17,342
Have you learned to swim?

892
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:18,302
No.

893
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:20,429
I was waiting for you.

894
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,815
You know, Anna...

895
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:37,654
When I came back from Germany,
I wanted to die.

896
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,701
So did I.

897
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,414
Really?

898
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,336
I didn't want to feel anything anymore.

899
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,130
No more sadness.

900
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:56,965
But...

901
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,968
that was selfish.

902
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,767
We must live for others as well.

903
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:25,911
Anna, this is Fanny.

904
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,831
Good day, Anna.

905
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,167
So pleased to meet you.

906
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,253
Adrien tells me
wonderful things about you.

907
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:37,214
You'll be hearing her tonight.

908
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,132
Fanny sings beautifully.

909
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:40,300
You're too kind.

910
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,387
But it's true. Your voice is divine.

911
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:45,305
Isn't it, Adrien?

912
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:46,932
Yes, it certainly is.

913
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:51,895
I think your room is ready.

914
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:53,563
Félicie will take you.

915
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:55,273
It's upstairs.

916
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:14,251
This is your room, miss.

917
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,201
Come in.

918
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:52,622
Excuse me, am I disturbing you?

919
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,125
I was just unpacking.

920
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:58,128
I wondered
if you needed a dress for tonight.

921
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:01,006
I don't suppose you planned for it.

922
01:36:03,884 --> 01:36:05,802
We must be about the same size.

923
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:17,022
It's perfect.

924
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,565
It really suits you.

925
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,901
I'll help you with the belt.

926
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:23,487
Thank you.

927
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:25,739
Thank you, Anna.

928
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:28,116
For all you've done for Adrien.

929
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,660
I haven't done anything.

930
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,872
You welcomed him, listened to him.

931
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,541
You could have turned him away.

932
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,671
Adrien's family
thought he'd lost his mind.

933
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:45,383
Only I encouraged his trip to Germany.

934
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,680
He wanted to be forgiven.

935
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:53,642
Replace the man he'd killed.

936
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:59,606
But... such things are impossible.

937
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,277
We can never replace a loved one, can we?

938
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:07,405
I don't know.

939
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18,458
Your fiancé's name was Frantz?

940
01:37:25,799 --> 01:37:27,843
My brother's name was François.

941
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,680
He was 20.

942
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,432
He died at the front, too.

943
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,526
Adrien tells me you play piano.

944
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,530
Yes, a little.

945
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,782
Then you'll play with us tonight.

946
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:54,744
They had us ringing the bells
all day long.

947
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:57,622
Even the deaf could hear those bells!

948
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:01,459
It was madness.
We wondered how we'd sleep!

949
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:02,878
And we didn't sleep!

950
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:05,547
Should've stuffed
your ears with cotton, old girl!

951
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:10,218
Adrien, were you still in Paris
on Armistice Day?

952
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:12,470
Yes. In the madhouse.

953
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,518
And you, Anna?

954
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:20,604
What was it like in Germany?

955
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:22,647
How can you ask such a question?

956
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:23,732
I'm sorry.

957
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:25,650
I've put my foot in it!

958
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:29,154
But it would be interesting to know.

959
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,492
The bells rang, too.

960
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,331
We felt relieved.

961
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:40,624
Some even danced.

962
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:43,168
You see, Fanny?

963
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:45,795
The French weren't the only ones dancing.

964
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,006
On dead bodies.

965
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,636
Cheese, anyone?

966
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:54,471
I'd love some.

967
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,390
Armand, the cheese, please.

I can't do it.

985
01:40:08,545 --> 01:40:11,423
Forgive her. She's had a long trip.

986
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:12,507
Go ahead.

987
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,801
Why exactly has she come to France?

988
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:18,972
To steal our Adrien, I suppose.

989
01:40:34,821 --> 01:40:39,034
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

990
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:40,326
Why do you say that?

991
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,203
I don't belong here.

992
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:46,541
I couldn't play
for the Hoffmeisters either, remember?

993
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,046
You were thinking of Frantz.

994
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:52,922
Right?

995
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:57,594
I wasn't thinking of Frantz.

996
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:01,848
I was thinking of you, Adrien.

997
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:04,267
Me?

998
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:07,187
You really don't get it.

999
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,232
Anna, wait. Calm down.

1000
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:13,109
Where will you sleep tonight?

1001
01:41:13,193 --> 01:41:16,488
Stay with us.
Leave early in the morning if you like.

1002
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,239
No one is upset with you.

1003
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:20,366
I'll explain it to them.

1004
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:44,766
I'm sorry.

1005
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:47,769
You're right.

1006
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,354
Do what you wish.

1007
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:54,609
Good night.

1008
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:19,092
Are you taking her?

1009
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,051
Yes.

1010
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,720
Does Fanny mind?

1011
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:23,847
No.

1012
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,014
Isn't she jealous?

1013
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:27,100
She has no reason to be.

1014
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,435
Then why did you invite her?

1015
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:31,813
She came of her own volition.

1016
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,191
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

1017
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,943
She came...

1018
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:40,446
to tell me she forgives me.

1019
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,324
You're so innocent, so naive...

1020
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,785
That's why I love you!

1021
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:47,829
- Don't touch me.
- But Adrien...

1022
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:50,331
My darling.

1023
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:54,460
You're ready.

1024
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:57,213
Great. I'll get the car.

1025
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:12,604
You know, Anna, my son is very fragile.

1026
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:15,273
You mustn't torment him.

1027
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:20,486
I'm not the one tormenting your son.

1028
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:22,655
It's Frantz.

1029
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:49,557
How long have you known Fanny?

1030
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:51,893
Since childhood.

1031
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:54,812
We lost touch when I went to Paris.

1032
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:58,858
But when I returned from the front,
we found each other again.

1033
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,444
She's helped me a lot.

1034
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,365
She lost loved ones too.

1035
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:08,660
- Her brother.
- Yes.

1036
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,536
I liked him very much.

1037
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:19,837
You know, Anna...

1038
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:23,591
My mother wants this marriage.

1039
01:44:25,385 --> 01:44:26,719
It eases her mind.

1040
01:44:28,388 --> 01:44:29,681
As for Fanny...

1041
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:32,517
She's brave, she's always loved me.

1042
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:56,958
Would you agree to come to our wedding
a month from now?

1043
01:44:58,376 --> 01:44:59,252
Fanny and I...

1044
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:01,587
would be delighted.

1045
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:06,092
I don't think so.

1046
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:58,269
It's too late.

1047
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,032
Be happy, Anna.

1048
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:01,541
A letter from Anna.

1049
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:04,293
- Anna?
- Yes.

1050
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:16,097
“My dear parents...

1051
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:18,683
I'm writing you from Paris,

1052
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:21,352
where I've finally found Adrien.

1053
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:27,108
He's doing well and sends his love.

1054
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:32,113
He is now first violin
with the Orchestre de Paris.

1055
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:36,534
I go to the Opera every night
to hear him play.

1056
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,828
For private recitals,

1057
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:42,248
he sometimes asks me
to accompany him on piano.

1058
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:47,545
We're having a marvelous time.

1059
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,755
He's taking me around Paris,

1060
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:51,674
to all the places...

1061
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:55,219
Frantz told us about.

1062
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,222
Yesterday, at the Louvre...

1063
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,267
we saw the Manet paintings.

1064
01:48:03,269 --> 01:48:06,856
How I wish you could be here

1065
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:09,567
to share these moments with us.

1066
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:13,571
<i>I don't know when I'll be home.</i>

1067
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,616
<i>I'm happy in Paris...</i>

1068
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,579
<i>the city Frantz loved so much.</i>

1069
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:23,998
<i>Take good care of yourselves.</i>

1070
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:28,377
<i>All my love.</i>

1071
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:29,712
<i>Your Anna.”</i>

1072
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,788
You like this painting too?

1073
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,378
Yes.

1074
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:14,090
It makes me want to live.

1075
01:49:15,305 --> 01:50:15,918
