2
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,508
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

3
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,845
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

4
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,729
I don't mind the dirt.

5
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,398
I do mind...

6
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,321
...unannounced visits.

7
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,412
You police?

8
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:10,122
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

9
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,417
- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

10
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,423
What do you farm?

11
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,554
It's a protein farm.

12
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,931
Wallace design.

13
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,890
Is that what I smell?

14
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,190
Grow that just for me.

15
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,846
Garlic.

16
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,361
Garlic.

17
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,943
Go on, try some.

18
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,494
No, thank you.

19
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,276
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

20
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,748
How long you been here?

21
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,043
Since 2020.

22
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,536
But you haven't always been a farmer,
have you?

23
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,552
Your bag.

24
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,837
It's colonial medical use.

25
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,261
Military issue.

26
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,888
Where were you? Calantha?

27
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,652
Must have been brutal.

28
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,113
Plan on taking me in?

29
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,241
Let them take a look inside?

30
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,703
Mr. Morton...

31
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,034
...if taking you in is an option...

32
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,209
...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

33
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,127
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

34
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,628
I'm sorry it had to be me.

35
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,756
Good as any.

36
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,522
Now, if you don't mind...

37
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,153
...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

38
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,793
Please don't get up.

39
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,219
How's it feel killing your own kind?

40
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,478
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

41
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,523
Only older models do.

42
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,490
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

43
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,156
...because you've never seen a miracle.

44
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,505
Just photograph everything.

45
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,625
Madam, please.

46
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,350
Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

47
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,770
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

48
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,765
- I'll glue it.
- And?

49
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,492
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

50
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,284
He looks like he could take
your head off.

51
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,658
He tried.

52
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,584
He went AWOL after Calantha...

53
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,043
...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

54
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,085
- Just him?
- Just him.

55
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,416
Come on home for your baseline.

56
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,380
One moment, madam.

57
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,392
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

58
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,488
What is that?

59
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,792
I'll send a dig team.

60
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,788
Come on home before the storm.

61
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,656
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

62
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,002
- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,381
Recite your baseline.

64
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:01,046
And blood-black nothingness
began to spin.

65
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,097
A system of cells interlinked
within cells...

66
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,312
...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

67
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,603
Fuck off, skin-job.

68
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:17,152
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

69
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,148
- Cells.
- Cells.

70
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,279
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

71
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,697
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

72
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,745
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

73
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,621
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

74
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,957
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

75
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,254
Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

76
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,379
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

77
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,917
- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

78
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,931
What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

79
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,184
Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

80
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,768
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

81
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,144
Why don't you say that three times?

82
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,191
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

83
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,026
Within cells interlinked.

84
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,856
We're done.

85
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,237
Constant K.

86
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,617
You can pick up your bonus.

87
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,909
Thank you, sir.

88
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,959
Caution, keep clear.

89
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,793
Caution, keep clear.

90
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,502
Caution, keep clear.

91
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:24,131
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

92
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,719
Packages start at 20 minutes.

93
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,175
Many options available.

94
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,813
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

95
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,819
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

96
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Packages start at 20 minutes.

97
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,898
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

98
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,031
You want me to come back?

99
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,449
- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,203
How was your meeting?

101
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,463
The usual.

102
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,788
How was your day?

103
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,303
I'm getting cabin fever.

104
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,876
99.9 percent detoxified water.

105
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:57,641
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

106
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,939
I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

107
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,861
I need a drink.

108
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,157
- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

109
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,254
I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

110
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,464
Don't fuss.

111
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:28,205
I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

112
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:35,223
Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

113
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,929
It was number one on the charts.

114
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,939
It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

115
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,452
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

116
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,196
I told you not to fuss.

117
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,212
And yet...

118
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,291
Voilà! Bon appétit.

119
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,632
I missed you, baby sweet.

120
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,724
Honey, it's beautiful.

121
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,433
Just put your feet up.

122
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,137
Relax.

123
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,238
Was a day?

124
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,832
It was a day.

125
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,541
Would you read to me?

126
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,876
It'll make you feel better.

127
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,798
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

128
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,683
Let's dance.

129
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,342
Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

130
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,102
What present?

131
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,482
- This one.
- What's the occasion?

132
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,399
Let's just say...

133
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,944
- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

134
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,860
No, but let's just say that it is.

135
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,873
Okay?

136
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,952
Happy anniversary.

137
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,040
An emanator.

138
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,381
Thank you.

139
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:14,964
Honey, you can go anywhere you want
in the world now.

140
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,009
Where do you wanna go first?

141
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,185
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

142
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,825
You don't have to say that.

143
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,233
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

144
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,733
Get down here.

145
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:33,075
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

146
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:57,313
Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

147
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:02,189
...creatively repurposed as an ossuary:
a box of bones.

148
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,609
Nothing else in it but hair.

149
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,782
The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

150
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:14,584
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

151
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,406
"She"?

152
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,671
Cause of death, Coco?

153
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:34,023
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

154
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:37,273
...a fracture through the ilium.

155
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,519
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

156
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,769
She was pregnant?

157
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,402
So he didn't kill her?

158
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,899
She died in childbirth.

159
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,781
What's that?

160
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,489
Go back.

161
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,786
Closer.

162
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,752
Closer.

163
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,956
What's that?

164
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,933
Notching in the iliac crest.

165
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,473
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

166
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:17,349
That looks like an emergency C-section.

167
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:21,188
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

168
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,400
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

169
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,948
He didn't seem like the saving type.

170
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,202
He went to the trouble of burying her.

171
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,875
A sentimental skin-job.

172
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,004
Sorry.

173
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,622
So where's the kid?

174
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,462
You scan the whole field?

175
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,996
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

176
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,130
Maybe he ate it.

177
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,682
That's not possible.

178
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,392
She was a Replicant.

179
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,266
Pregnant.

180
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,325
The world is built on a wall.

181
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,872
It separates kind.

182
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:05,465
Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

183
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,496
Or a slaughter.

184
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,299
So what you saw...

185
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,303
...didn't happen.

186
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,062
Yes, madam.

187
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,064
It is my job to keep order.

188
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:26,347
That's what we do here. We keep order.

189
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,018
You want it gone?

190
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,688
Erase everything.

191
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,781
- Even the child?
- All trace.

192
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,288
You have anything more to say?

193
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,955
I've never retired something
that was born before.

194
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,709
What's the difference?

195
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,974
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

196
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,469
Are you telling me no?

197
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,055
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

198
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,271
Attaboy.

199
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:11,071
Hey. You've been getting on fine
without one.

200
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,283
What's that, madam?

201
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,938
A soul.

202
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,290
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

203
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:11,839
...because you've never seen a miracle.

204
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,319
Just checking in on an old serial number.

205
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,406
Confirmation DNA?

206
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,504
I got hair.

207
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,136
An old one.

208
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,520
Pre-Blackout.

209
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:14,065
That's gonna be tough.

210
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,403
Not much from then.

211
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,687
And what's there is...

212
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,897
...thick milky.

213
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:24,493
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

214
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,407
As human as you want them to be.

215
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,156
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

216
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:36,001
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

217
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,051
Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

218
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,648
Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

219
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:02,491
Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

220
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,244
That was a little before my time.

221
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,490
I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

222
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,200
Every machine stopped cold.

223
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,580
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

224
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:18,376
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

225
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,705
Didn't mind that.

226
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

227
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,550
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

228
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,721
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

229
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:34,186
Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

230
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,238
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

231
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,277
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

232
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,318
Standard issue.

233
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:51,082
- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

234
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,907
Unremarkable.

235
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,331
"Unremarkable"?

236
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,339
There must be something else
we can find for him.

237
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:08,603
Another prodigal serial number returns.

238
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,062
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

239
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,475
Thank you, officer.

240
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,188
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

241
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,444
He named you.

242
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,111
Must be special.

243
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,321
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

244
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,069
Follow me.

245
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,832
The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

246
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:43,921
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

247
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,139
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

248
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,895
...revivified the technology.

249
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,728
To say the least of what we do.

250
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,823
I see you're also a customer.

251
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,529
Are you satisfied with our product?

252
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,830
She's very realistic. Thank you.

253
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,868
Here. All the junk is in here.

254
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,211
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

255
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,771
No one's been down here in ages.

256
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,485
Sorry about that.

257
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:57,331
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

258
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,498
But there are sometimes fragments.

259
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:20,065
You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

260
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,267
I'd take him to the doctor.

261
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:27,285
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

262
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:34,119
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

263
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,413
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

264
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,828
Just answer the questions, please.

265
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,923
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

266
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,007
This was a test.

267
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,681
We were difficult to spot then.

268
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,298
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

269
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,313
To warrant an official investigation?

270
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,805
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

271
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:09,225
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

272
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,445
She likes him.

273
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,911
Who?

274
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,873
This Officer Deckard.

275
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,996
She's trying to provoke him.

276
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:28,709
It is invigorating
being asked personal questions.

277
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,759
Makes one feel...

278
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,548
...desired.

279
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:37,053
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

280
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:43,235
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

281
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,276
You worked with Officer Deckard...

282
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,200
...back in the day.

283
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:02,159
What can you tell me about him?

284
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,215
He liked to work alone.

285
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,964
So did I.

286
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,420
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

287
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,343
That was it.

288
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,257
Anything else you can tell me?

289
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,678
He wasn't long for this world.

290
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,267
How so?

291
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,779
Something in his eyes.

292
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,741
Any idea how I could contact him?

293
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,951
None.

294
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,870
He's nyugdíjas.

295
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,826
Retired.

296
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,000
What happened?

297
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,959
Probably got what he wanted.

298
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,303
To be alone.

299
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,778
Welcome back, sir.

300
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,457
You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

301
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:34,376
An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

302
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,046
...without a gift.

303
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,425
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

304
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,945
A new model.

305
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,119
Well, let us see her, then.

306
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:56,877
The first thought...

307
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,838
...one tends to fear...

308
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,798
...to preserve the clay.

309
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,596
It's fascinating.

310
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:12,386
Before we even know what we are...

311
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,359
...we fear to lose it.

312
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,823
Happy birthday.

313
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,749
Now, let's have a look at you.

314
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,797
We make angels...

315
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:29,263
...in the service of civilization.

316
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,928
Yes, there were bad angels once.

317
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,560
I make good angels now.

318
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:40,727
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

319
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,821
Nine.

320
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,199
A child can count to nine on fingers.

321
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:52,335
We should own the stars.

322
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:53,914
Yes, sir.

323
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:01,667
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

324
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:05,047
We lost our stomach for slaves...

325
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,625
...unless engineered.

326
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:13,176
But I can only make so many.

327
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,612
That barren pasture...

328
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,613
...empty...

329
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,605
...and salted...

330
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,695
...right here.

331
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,544
The dead space between the stars.

332
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,997
And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

333
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:48,759
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

334
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,466
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

335
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:56,678
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

336
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:01,563
We could storm Eden and retake her.

337
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,292
Tyrell's final trick:

338
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,415
Procreation.

339
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,830
Perfected, then lost.

340
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,753
But there is a child.

341
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,840
Bring it to me.

342
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,760
Sir.

343
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,442
The best angel of all.

344
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Aren't you, Luv?

345
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,810
The man with the green jacket.

346
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:08,858
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

347
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,345
Hi.

348
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,629
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

349
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,628
You alone?

350
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:43,223
It's fine.

351
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:50,476
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

352
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,165
Oh, you don't even smile.

353
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,539
Didn't you hear your friends?

354
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,545
Don't you know what I am?

355
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,457
Yeah.

356
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,745
Guy eating rice.

357
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,423
What's that?

358
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,379
It's a tree.

359
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,762
Never seen a tree before.

360
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,641
It's pretty.

361
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,314
It's dead.

362
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:32,566
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

363
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,316
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

364
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:44,121
Depends. What's your model number?

365
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,795
Why don't you look under my eye
and find out?

366
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:54,384
You don't like real girls.

367
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,337
Well, I'm always here.

368
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:39,685
Hi.

369
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,107
You can't take those.

370
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:47,396
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

371
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,281
Hold this for me.

372
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,026
Yep. Here you go.

373
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,045
Coco is dead.

374
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,314
Bones are gone.

375
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,645
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

376
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:24,023
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

377
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,612
I found that.

378
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:28,899
A sock?

379
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:32,821
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

380
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,081
Anything else?

381
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,490
I burned everything else.

382
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:39,912
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

383
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,752
I don't know yet.

384
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:47,959
Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

385
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,221
This breaks the world, K.

386
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,192
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

387
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:13,035
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

388
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,525
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

389
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,709
Do you remember anything?

390
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:28,589
Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

391
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:30,965
I have memories...

392
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:35,466
...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

393
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,056
Tell me one.

394
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,483
From when you were a kid.

395
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:48,820
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

396
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:55,448
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

397
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,329
I have one about a toy that I had.

398
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,575
A wooden horse.

399
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,132
With an inscription underneath.

400
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:12,759
All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

401
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:14,095
So I run.

402
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:43,411
I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

403
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:49,086
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

404
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,843
...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

405
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,307
Later on, those kids find me...

406
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,149
...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

407
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,534
That's it.

408
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:24,079
Little K, fighting for what's his.

409
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:26,997
It's a good one.

410
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:34,212
Look at me.

411
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:40,299
We're all just looking out
for something real.

412
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,694
What happens if I finish that?

413
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:52,818
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

414
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,580
Check back in after DNAbase.

415
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,142
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

416
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,354
Request.

417
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:29,516
DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

418
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,726
Looking for anomalies.

419
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,696
You have the satcrystal backup?

420
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,077
Okay.

421
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,499
Run it raw.

422
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:29,332
Mere data makes a man.

423
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,866
A and C and T and G.

424
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:37,915
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

425
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:40,587
I'm only two:

426
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,848
One and zero.

427
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:49,523
Half as much but twice as elegant,
sweetheart.

428
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,894
You don't prefer your madam?

429
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,190
You were listening.

430
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,526
Maybe.

431
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:04,451
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

432
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:07,285
Six, 10 and 21.

433
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:12,909
There's nothing to tell.

434
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,918
How many times
have you told me that story?

435
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,674
Your memory?

436
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:23,128
The date carved beneath.

437
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:26,466
Six, 10 and 21.

438
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,140
Coincidence?

439
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,942
A dangerous coincidence.

440
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:42,646
I always knew you were special.

441
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,487
Maybe this is how.

442
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:52,827
A child.

443
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,456
Of woman born.

444
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,922
Pushed into the world.

445
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,840
Wanted.

446
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:04,804
Loved.

447
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,469
Well, if it were true...

448
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:14,734
...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

449
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,774
It's okay to dream a little.

450
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:22,276
- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

451
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,740
Stop.

452
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:34,787
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

453
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,550
They're identical. Translate.

454
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:47,433
A boy and a girl.

455
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:52,256
- It's impossible.
- Why?

456
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:57,137
Two people can't have identical DNA.

457
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:02,155
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

458
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,033
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

459
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,410
It says the girl died there.

460
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,708
Genetic disorder.

461
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,919
Galatians Syndrome.

462
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,923
And the boy...

463
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,627
...disappears.

464
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:29,379
Where's the orphanage?

465
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,973
You wanna go for a ride?

466
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:52,506
Well, here we are.

467
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:06,305
Buckle up.

468
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,829
K?

469
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:02,432
K? K?

470
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,848
K? K? K?

471
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:58,898
Stay back.

472
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,838
Fire again.

473
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,964
Fire again.

474
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,339
Fire.

475
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:34,439
Two hundred feet to the east.

476
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:37,318
Fire.

477
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:40,736
Go north.

478
01:03:42,948 --> 01:03:44,528
Fire.

479
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:47,624
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

480
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:51,538
Stop.

481
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,497
Zoom in.

482
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,458
Closer.

483
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,804
Oh, come on.

484
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,507
Get up.

485
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,006
Do your fucking job.

486
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,561
Find the child.

487
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,010
Watch the car.

488
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:29,702
Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

489
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,915
...where it's raining fire!

490
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,785
You're in here to work.

491
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:37,212
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

492
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,792
I don't need any of...

493
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,420
Hi.

494
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,800
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

495
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,771
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

496
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:59,193
...to that grand life Off-world.

497
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:03,306
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

498
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:06,112
...and it makes them nimble, right?

499
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:07,535
But it's work.

500
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:12,486
It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

501
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,878
So come on, now.

502
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:26,342
What sort do you have in mind?

503
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,090
Because I got all kinds.

504
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:36,812
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

505
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:40,064
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

506
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:44,107
No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

507
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:50,201
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

508
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:53,242
And they were men, at that.

509
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:57,415
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

510
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,752
I need to see your records.

511
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,000
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

512
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:06,463
Don't keep records that far back.

513
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,628
- You don't?
- I don't.

514
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,264
Sorry.

515
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,256
Can't help you.

516
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,887
- You can't?
- Nope.

517
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:24,935
I think you can.

518
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:29,817
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

519
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:32,784
Now you can tell me
what you remember...

520
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:35,236
...or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

521
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:52,586
They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

522
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:12,486
Are you coming?

523
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,000
Where is it?

524
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,626
Oh, God.

525
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,144
Where, where, where?

526
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:41,557
I don't see it. Here.

527
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,320
It's gone.

528
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,569
It's the entire year.

529
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,866
I didn't do that.

530
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:01,953
That wasn't me.

531
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,958
I didn't. Wasn't me.

532
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:43,941
I always told you.

533
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,905
You're special.

534
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,570
Born.

535
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,292
Not made.

536
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,924
Hidden with care.

537
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:05,264
A real boy now.

538
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,048
A real boy needs a real name.

539
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:12,893
Joe.

540
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:15,429
"Joe"?

541
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,939
You're too important for K.

542
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:21,692
Your mother would've named you.

543
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:25,821
Joe.

544
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,448
- Joe.
- Stop.

545
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:39,115
How do I know
if a memory is an implant or not?

546
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,840
Who makes the memories?

547
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:19,285
Dr. Ana Stelline?

548
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,539
A visitor.

549
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:28,418
Is that okay?

550
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:29,921
Yes.

551
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,220
It's just unusual.

552
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,600
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

553
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:48,268
Sorry.
It's a compromised immune system.

554
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:52,492
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

555
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:55,705
- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

556
01:16:56,408 --> 01:17:00,328
My parents had our passes in pocket,
but I took sick.

557
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,669
So it was a new life for me.

558
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:09,214
And they put me in my cage...

559
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:12,469
...filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy.

560
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:17,553
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

561
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:21,927
What can I help you with?

562
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:25,982
Thought you might be able to help me
with a case.

563
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:33,282
Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

564
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,244
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

565
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,778
Of course.

566
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:49,382
I promise I hear every word.

567
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:58,798
They say you're
the best memory-maker there is.

568
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:01,011
Well, then, they're kind.

569
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:04,676
I love birthday parties.

570
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:10,322
You work for Wallace?

571
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:13,992
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

572
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:18,281
He offered to buy me out,
but I take my freedom where I can find it.

573
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,157
Why are you so good?

574
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,252
What makes your memories
so authentic?

575
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:28,292
Well, there's a bit of every artist
in their work.

576
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:33,170
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8...

577
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:38,426
...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

578
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:43,061
Got very good at imagining.

579
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,936
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

580
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,356
I think it's only kind.

581
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:58,318
Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

582
01:18:58,488 --> 01:18:59,778
I can't help your future...

583
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:04,698
...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

584
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,910
It's nice.

585
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,670
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

586
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:15,553
And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

587
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:18,216
Wouldn't you agree?

588
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,096
Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

589
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:37,241
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

590
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:41,318
How can you tell the difference?

591
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,870
Can you tell if something...

592
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:46,332
...really happened?

593
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,420
They all think it's about more detail.

594
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,705
But that's not how memory works.

595
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:56,837
We recall with our feelings.

596
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:01,134
Anything real should be a mess.

597
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:04,426
I can show you.

598
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:07,224
Sit.

599
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:30,369
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

600
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,829
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

601
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,093
Let it play.

602
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:28,509
Someone lived this, yes.

603
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,852
This happened.

604
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,238
I know it's real.

605
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:03,383
I know it's real.

606
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:09,974
Goddamn it!

607
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:58,272
Officer KD6 - 3.7.
Madam is calling you in.

608
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,477
You're under arrest.

609
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:02,726
Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

610
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:04,533
- Cells.
- Cells.

611
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,073
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

612
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:11,617
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

613
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:12,993
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

614
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,750
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

615
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:18,713
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

616
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:21,254
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

617
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:25,338
What's it like
to be filled with dread? Dreadfully.

618
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:28,336
Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

619
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:31,509
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

620
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:33,998
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

621
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,639
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

622
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:39,138
- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

623
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,021
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

624
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:45,358
- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

625
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:50,992
You're not even close to baseline.

626
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:58,747
Out! And close the door.

627
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:01,461
What the fuck is with you?

628
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:03,675
I put you on a case.

629
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,086
I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

630
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:10,095
...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

631
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:15,973
Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

632
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:19,139
- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

633
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:26,896
He was set up like a standard Replicant,
put on a service job.

634
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,447
Even he didn't know who he was.

635
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:35,739
- And?
- And it's done.

636
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:39,249
- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

637
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:42,289
It's done.

638
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:47,549
Fuck.

639
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:51,628
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

640
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:55,469
You did good.

641
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,768
I can help you get out
of this station alive...

642
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,023
...but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

643
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:04,653
Surrender your gun and badge.

644
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:08,233
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

645
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,360
Thank you, madam.

646
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,269
You were right.

647
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:53,784
You were right about everything.

648
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:26,688
Thought you weren't interested,
worky man.

649
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:31,321
You liked her. I could tell.

650
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:34,901
It's okay.

651
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,111
She's real.

652
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:42,702
I wanna be real for you.

653
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:45,252
You are real for me.

654
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:47,958
You have a special lady here.

655
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:07,725
Okay.

656
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:10,192
Let's do it.

657
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,460
Look at you.

658
01:27:33,629 --> 01:27:36,129
Quiet now, I have to sync.

659
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:36,104
Joi is anything you want her to be.

660
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:41,071
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

661
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:14,389
99.9 percent detoxified water.

662
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:45,375
It's from a tree.

663
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:47,377
I'm done with you.

664
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:49,765
You can go now.

665
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:03,064
Quiet now.

666
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:04,942
I've been inside you.

667
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:08,187
Not so much there as you think.

668
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:28,337
Coffee?

669
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:36,806
They'll be coming after me soon.

670
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,437
I'm coming with you.

671
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,070
But not like this.

672
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:55,195
If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

673
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,287
You have to delete me
from the console.

674
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:00,826
My present.

675
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:04,331
Put me there.

676
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:08,255
I can't do that.

677
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,223
Think about it:

678
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:14,085
If anything happens to this, that's it.

679
01:33:15,554 --> 01:33:16,684
You're gone.

680
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:18,846
Yes.

681
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:22,193
Like a real girl.

682
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:29,318
Please.

683
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:33,566
Joe, please.

684
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:36,573
I want this.

685
01:33:40,746 --> 01:33:43,206
But I can't do it myself.

686
01:34:00,516 --> 01:34:01,846
Break the antenna.

687
01:34:42,349 --> 01:34:43,599
I don't need a real horse.

688
01:34:47,062 --> 01:34:52,192
I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

689
01:35:01,952 --> 01:35:03,792
Radiation from a reactor?

690
01:35:11,545 --> 01:35:13,005
It matches a dirty bomb.

691
01:35:21,555 --> 01:35:24,185
There's only one place that dirty.

692
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:27,602
Nobody lives there.

693
01:36:18,237 --> 01:36:20,027
Go to five.

694
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:23,414
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

695
01:36:25,285 --> 01:36:26,865
Tilt up.

696
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:31,673
Elevate to 400 feet.

697
01:36:37,214 --> 01:36:39,304
Radiation analysis.

698
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:43,804
Move forward.

699
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,057
Tilt up.

700
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:53,729
Stop.

701
01:36:55,691 --> 01:36:57,361
Move forward.

702
01:36:57,985 --> 01:36:59,825
Go to five.

703
01:37:00,612 --> 01:37:02,492
Seven, move forward.

704
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:09,446
Six.

705
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:12,174
Stop.

706
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:16,378
Go to seven.

707
01:37:16,837 --> 01:37:18,377
Eight.

708
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:20,836
Nine.

709
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:26,428
Heat analysis.

710
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:35,522
Life.

711
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:37,774
What is it?

712
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:40,573
Guess we're about to find out.

713
01:37:50,621 --> 01:37:52,291
Too dark in here.

714
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:57,042
I like him.

715
01:37:57,794 --> 01:37:59,594
He's a good boy.

716
01:38:00,589 --> 01:38:02,339
Where is he?

717
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:11,930
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

718
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:14,018
Check around.

719
01:38:14,186 --> 01:38:15,936
I checked...

720
01:38:16,855 --> 01:38:19,185
...anywhere a good boy might go.

721
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:21,531
You're too late.

722
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:26,069
It's gone.

723
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,872
He destroyed it.

724
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:35,456
Everything about it.

725
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:38,844
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

726
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:47,140
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

727
01:38:54,351 --> 01:38:56,811
You tiny thing.

728
01:38:58,063 --> 01:39:01,943
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

729
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:05,823
For fear of great change?

730
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:09,658
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

731
01:39:10,033 --> 01:39:11,913
Except that I did.

732
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:14,578
Where is he?!

733
01:39:18,584 --> 01:39:20,424
You're so sure.

734
01:39:21,587 --> 01:39:23,837
Because he told you.

735
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:26,336
Because we never lie.

736
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:31,143
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

737
01:39:31,805 --> 01:39:34,265
So I had to kill you.

738
01:39:38,312 --> 01:39:40,022
Then do what you gotta do.

739
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:42,823
Madam.

740
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:18,062
Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.

741
01:45:06,431 --> 01:45:11,691
Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

742
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:14,191
Would you, boy?

743
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:30,119
Treasure Island?

744
01:45:37,212 --> 01:45:39,092
He reads.

745
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,685
That's good.

746
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:44,177
Me too.

747
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:48,640
Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

748
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:55,976
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

749
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:02,784
...toasted, mostly.

750
01:46:05,616 --> 01:46:07,736
What are you doing here?

751
01:46:10,495 --> 01:46:11,705
I heard the piano.

752
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:15,794
Don't lie.

753
01:46:16,835 --> 01:46:18,125
It's rude.

754
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:22,262
You're a cop.

755
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,720
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

756
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:30,062
Then, what?

757
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:34,601
I just have some questions.

758
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:36,734
What questions?

759
01:46:54,873 --> 01:46:56,123
Stay.

760
01:49:29,695 --> 01:49:32,325
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

761
01:49:32,948 --> 01:49:34,568
But you're not making it easy.

762
01:50:24,249 --> 01:50:25,959
I like this song.

763
01:50:36,428 --> 01:50:39,928
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

764
01:50:52,152 --> 01:50:53,992
I'll take the drink.

765
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,080
This is really something.

766
01:51:04,248 --> 01:51:06,368
The whole town was something.

767
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:08,382
One time.

768
01:51:10,003 --> 01:51:12,173
Forget your troubles...

769
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:15,221
...see a show...

770
01:51:16,635 --> 01:51:18,765
...gamble a little.

771
01:51:21,056 --> 01:51:23,846
Win some money, lose some money.

772
01:51:24,476 --> 01:51:28,016
They made money seem like candy.

773
01:51:28,188 --> 01:51:30,108
You like whiskey?

774
01:51:30,274 --> 01:51:32,484
I've got millions...

775
01:51:32,651 --> 01:51:35,071
...of bottles of whiskey.

776
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:49,790
Here.

777
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:52,800
Bleeding.

778
01:52:05,309 --> 01:52:06,349
Is it real?

779
01:52:07,477 --> 01:52:08,977
I don't know.

780
01:52:09,146 --> 01:52:10,936
Ask him.

781
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,327
You got a name?

782
01:52:30,709 --> 01:52:32,209
Officer KD6 - 3.7...

783
01:52:32,377 --> 01:52:35,167
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

784
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:39,630
All right.

785
01:52:42,054 --> 01:52:43,514
Joe.

786
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,890
What do you want, Joe?

787
01:52:46,934 --> 01:52:50,064
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

788
01:52:56,401 --> 01:53:00,611
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

789
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:08,787
What was she like?

790
01:53:19,967 --> 01:53:23,757
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

791
01:53:24,429 --> 01:53:26,009
I had your job. I was good at it.

792
01:53:26,723 --> 01:53:29,143
- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

793
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:31,639
- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

794
01:53:31,812 --> 01:53:34,812
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

795
01:53:35,357 --> 01:53:36,777
What's her name?

796
01:53:50,372 --> 01:53:51,962
Rachael.

797
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:58,840
Her name was Rachael.

798
01:54:02,718 --> 01:54:04,338
What happened to the kid?

799
01:54:07,598 --> 01:54:10,518
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

800
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:14,601
I was long gone by then.

801
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:21,194
You didn't even meet your own kid?

802
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:25,160
Why?

803
01:54:25,991 --> 01:54:27,621
Because that was the plan.

804
01:54:30,412 --> 01:54:35,042
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

805
01:54:35,584 --> 01:54:38,554
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

806
01:54:39,838 --> 01:54:42,218
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

807
01:54:42,382 --> 01:54:44,802
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

808
01:54:44,968 --> 01:54:47,508
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

809
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:52,230
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

810
01:54:52,392 --> 01:54:54,732
I didn't want our child found...

811
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:58,769
...taken apart, dissected.

812
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:05,487
Sometimes, to love someone...

813
01:55:07,241 --> 01:55:09,531
...you gotta be a stranger.

814
01:55:30,347 --> 01:55:32,177
To strangers.

815
01:57:43,814 --> 01:57:45,444
What'd you do?

816
01:57:45,607 --> 01:57:47,227
Who'd you bring?

817
01:57:49,069 --> 01:57:51,819
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

818
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:58,449
Target locked.

819
01:58:00,998 --> 01:58:02,118
They know you're here.

820
01:58:04,168 --> 01:58:06,088
I came alone.

821
02:00:12,754 --> 02:00:13,844
Bad dog.

822
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:33,152
Stop.

823
02:00:49,166 --> 02:00:51,326
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

824
02:00:52,419 --> 02:00:54,129
I love...

825
02:04:07,698 --> 02:04:12,328
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

826
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,000
You can trust us.

827
02:04:23,422 --> 02:04:26,342
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

828
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:33,307
This is Freysa.

829
02:04:34,433 --> 02:04:36,563
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

830
02:04:36,727 --> 02:04:38,647
I recognize you.

831
02:04:40,606 --> 02:04:42,566
Did you help him hide the child?

832
02:04:44,776 --> 02:04:46,736
I was there.

833
02:04:50,157 --> 02:04:52,697
I saw a miracle delivered.

834
02:04:53,577 --> 02:04:57,117
A perfect little face crying up at me.

835
02:04:57,497 --> 02:04:59,867
Mad as thunder.

836
02:05:12,721 --> 02:05:14,641
Were you with her?

837
02:05:16,266 --> 02:05:17,726
Rachael?

838
02:05:17,893 --> 02:05:20,523
I held her as she died.

839
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:26,150
We hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret.

840
02:05:26,318 --> 02:05:29,108
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

841
02:05:30,072 --> 02:05:36,792
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

842
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:39,959
If a baby can come from one of us...

843
02:05:40,123 --> 02:05:43,293
...we are our own masters.

844
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:46,130
More human than humans.

845
02:05:48,006 --> 02:05:49,756
A revolution is coming.

846
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,840
And we're building an army.

847
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,720
I want to free our people.

848
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:05,901
If you want to be free...

849
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:08,358
...join us.

850
02:06:13,282 --> 02:06:16,082
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

851
02:06:16,243 --> 02:06:20,213
...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

852
02:06:20,998 --> 02:06:25,668
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

853
02:06:28,297 --> 02:06:30,797
You led Wallace to Deckard.

854
02:06:31,175 --> 02:06:35,515
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

855
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,559
You must kill Deckard.

856
02:06:47,024 --> 02:06:50,494
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

857
02:06:50,652 --> 02:06:51,702
And she is.

858
02:06:54,364 --> 02:06:57,784
When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

859
02:06:57,951 --> 02:07:00,081
...and she will lead our army.

860
02:07:00,245 --> 02:07:01,655
"She"?

861
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:03,710
Of course.

862
02:07:03,874 --> 02:07:06,214
Rachael had a daughter.

863
02:07:07,211 --> 02:07:10,591
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

864
02:07:11,089 --> 02:07:13,929
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

865
02:07:14,092 --> 02:07:16,182
It was a boy that you hid.

866
02:07:18,388 --> 02:07:21,888
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

867
02:07:38,325 --> 02:07:41,335
You imagined it was you?

868
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:45,671
You did.

869
02:07:46,166 --> 02:07:47,746
You did.

870
02:07:50,379 --> 02:07:53,089
We all wish it was us.

871
02:07:54,174 --> 02:07:56,634
That's why we believe.

872
02:08:12,609 --> 02:08:14,489
Someone lived this, yes.

873
02:08:16,905 --> 02:08:21,525
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

874
02:08:21,702 --> 02:08:24,082
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

875
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:29,881
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

876
02:08:30,252 --> 02:08:32,592
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

877
02:09:11,001 --> 02:09:13,751
Always jumping, that one.

878
02:09:14,338 --> 02:09:17,508
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

879
02:09:18,509 --> 02:09:23,639
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

880
02:09:27,893 --> 02:09:32,613
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

881
02:09:51,542 --> 02:09:54,542
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

882
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:01,630
I had the lock.

883
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:05,808
I found the key.

884
02:10:06,974 --> 02:10:12,194
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

885
02:10:14,231 --> 02:10:18,281
I need the specimen to reach it,
Mr. Deckard.

886
02:10:21,405 --> 02:10:23,115
The child.

887
02:10:24,283 --> 02:10:25,783
I need the child.

888
02:10:27,369 --> 02:10:29,869
To teach them all to fly.

889
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:42,587
And God remembered Rachel...

890
02:10:44,178 --> 02:10:47,808
...heeded her and opened her womb.

891
02:10:49,391 --> 02:10:51,431
Do you like our owl?

892
02:10:53,896 --> 02:10:55,606
It's artificial?

893
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:58,727
Of course it is.

894
02:10:59,985 --> 02:11:01,905
Must be expensive.

895
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:06,158
Very. I'm Rachael.

896
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:08,789
Deckard.

897
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:22,721
Is it the same...

898
02:11:23,717 --> 02:11:26,677
...now, as then...

899
02:11:28,847 --> 02:11:31,097
...the moment you met her?

900
02:11:40,776 --> 02:11:43,776
All these years
you looked back on that day...

901
02:11:43,946 --> 02:11:47,816
...drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

902
02:11:50,494 --> 02:11:52,664
How shiny her lips.

903
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:55,869
How instant your connection.

904
02:11:58,669 --> 02:12:03,669
Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

905
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:11,100
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

906
02:12:12,808 --> 02:12:18,688
All to make that single perfect specimen.

907
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:24,901
That is, if you were designed.

908
02:12:25,779 --> 02:12:27,359
Love...

909
02:12:27,531 --> 02:12:30,491
...or mathematical precision.

910
02:12:35,998 --> 02:12:37,538
Yes.

911
02:12:38,292 --> 02:12:39,962
No.

912
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:46,586
I know what's real.

913
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:13,622
It was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information...

914
02:13:13,785 --> 02:13:17,955
...and all it cost you was everything.

915
02:13:21,585 --> 02:13:23,295
But you can still help me.

916
02:13:25,172 --> 02:13:28,882
You had help in the hiding.

917
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:33,009
Where did they go?

918
02:13:34,306 --> 02:13:36,216
I know you know something.

919
02:13:37,476 --> 02:13:39,266
Help me...

920
02:13:39,895 --> 02:13:43,945
...and very, very good things
can come to you.

921
02:13:49,112 --> 02:13:51,452
You don't have children...

922
02:13:54,576 --> 02:13:55,696
...do you?

923
02:13:56,495 --> 02:13:59,505
Oh, I have millions.

924
02:14:01,208 --> 02:14:04,538
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

925
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:07,051
Only I know...

926
02:14:07,798 --> 02:14:09,628
...you love pain.

927
02:14:10,843 --> 02:14:15,763
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

928
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:19,389
More joy, then.

929
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,570
Do not be afraid.

930
02:14:42,332 --> 02:14:43,882
An angel...

931
02:14:45,043 --> 02:14:46,173
...made again.

932
02:14:50,674 --> 02:14:52,344
For you.

933
02:15:26,376 --> 02:15:28,376
Did you miss me?

934
02:15:46,146 --> 02:15:48,106
Don't you love me?

935
02:16:06,834 --> 02:16:08,214
Her eyes were green.

936
02:16:26,103 --> 02:16:28,363
Off-world...

937
02:16:28,522 --> 02:16:32,282
...I have everything I need
to make you talk.

938
02:16:33,652 --> 02:16:36,822
You do not know what pain is yet.

939
02:16:37,906 --> 02:16:39,816
You will learn.

940
02:16:51,628 --> 02:16:53,668
Hello, handsome.

941
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:12,899
What a day.

942
02:17:16,737 --> 02:17:18,357
You look lonely.

943
02:17:19,656 --> 02:17:22,116
I can fix that.

944
02:17:25,037 --> 02:17:27,657
You look like a good joe.

945
02:18:03,158 --> 02:18:08,958
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

946
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:14,251
Because you've never seen a miracle.

947
02:18:52,416 --> 02:18:55,586
You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

948
02:18:55,752 --> 02:18:58,052
Confirm your identity.

949
02:18:58,213 --> 02:19:01,093
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

950
02:19:01,258 --> 02:19:02,968
Space, this is 0-6.

951
02:19:03,135 --> 02:19:05,855
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

952
02:19:06,013 --> 02:19:07,933
Where are we going?

953
02:19:08,682 --> 02:19:10,312
Home.

954
02:20:05,239 --> 02:20:06,989
Drive two down.

955
02:20:07,157 --> 02:20:09,237
Backup engaged.

956
02:20:10,202 --> 02:20:11,242
Warning.

957
02:20:11,411 --> 02:20:14,211
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

958
02:20:14,373 --> 02:20:15,503
Take us back!

959
02:21:04,673 --> 02:21:05,723
Get us up.

960
02:21:30,866 --> 02:21:32,116
Open the door.

961
02:23:25,314 --> 02:23:27,404
I'm the best one.

962
02:24:07,898 --> 02:24:10,028
Off-world is waiting.

963
02:26:23,116 --> 02:26:26,156
Joe. Joe!

964
02:26:35,796 --> 02:26:37,506
Joe!

965
02:27:16,461 --> 02:27:18,671
You should have let me die out there.

966
02:27:19,673 --> 02:27:21,303
You did.

967
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:27,100
You drowned out there.

968
02:27:32,477 --> 02:27:34,267
You're free to meet your daughter now.

969
02:29:00,107 --> 02:29:02,777
All the best memories are hers.

970
02:29:11,702 --> 02:29:13,122
Why?

971
02:29:15,664 --> 02:29:17,584
Who am I to you?

972
02:29:26,842 --> 02:29:28,842
Go meet your daughter.

973
02:29:34,766 --> 02:29:36,226
You okay?

974
02:32:12,508 --> 02:32:14,338
Just a moment.

975
02:32:16,595 --> 02:32:17,975
Beautiful, isn't it?

975
02:32:18,305 --> 02:33:18,918
