<i>Mimulus bigelovii.</i>

00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>Hey, just checking in on you.</i>

5
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,749
<i>Your email mentioned
a new project.</i>

6
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,253
<i>Just... Just want to know
where you're at.</i>

7
00:03:57,188 --> 00:04:00,157
<i>I... I found something
really sweet yesterday</i>

8
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,525
<i>in her room.</i>

9
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:05,862
<i>It was this book of pressed
flowers you'd given her.</i>

10
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,830
<i>"Little flowers
for a little sister,"</i>

11
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,034
<i>you wrote on it.</i>

12
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:14,538
<i>Anyway, we... we just want you
to know that we love you</i>

13
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,373
<i>and we miss you.</i>

14
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,143
<i>I'd love to talk
when you get a chance.</i>

15
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,479
<i>Okay, we'll talk
to you soon, Elly.</i>

16
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,218
Hmm.

17
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:28,365
Are you okay?
I saw your foot tracks.

18
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,401
I didn't know if you
broke down or something.

19
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,138
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks for checking.

20
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:37,241
There are better places
to hike out here than this.

21
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,878
I'm actually working.
I'm doing a plant survey.

22
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,247
Oh, my dad was talking
about that.

23
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,149
Something about a plant
that's been spreading.

24
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,684
Yeah,
pretty much.

25
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:52,389
Um, okay, well,
thanks again for checking.

26
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,124
Do you need any help
with your work?

27
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:55,692
No, no.
I'm okay.

28
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,761
I'm not supposed
to be out here.

29
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,396
Kind of skipping school.

30
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:07,438
Yeah, I've done my
fair share of that too.

31
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,341
Oh, you actually could help me
out, though.

32
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,644
I... I'm here at Eagle Head
Canyon, right?

33
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:17,281
Yeah, it's about a half a mile that
way, uh, where the big dip is.

34
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,317
Awesome. Thanks.

35
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,424
Well, I mean, you're...
you're already out here.

36
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,693
You can...
You can help me if you want.

37
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,730
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

38
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,067
Cool.
Just go down here.

39
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:42,973
So that...
that's it.

40
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,341
Mm-hmm.

41
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,210
Pretty ugly.

42
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,145
Yeah, that...
For sure.

43
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,548
- You see the different colors?
- Yeah.

44
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,457
- See?
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

45
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,259
- Pretty cool, right?
- Pretty cool. Yep.

46
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:03,894
You take really
good pictures.

47
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,395
And we'll get this
to the county.

48
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,931
Yeah, I know you're
doing an amazing job

49
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,299
with all of this.

50
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,301
That white shoot over there.

51
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,270
All right. Yeah.

52
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,005
Yeah, that's...

53
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,675
8-5-5-6.

54
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,743
Mm-hmm.

55
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,178
Yep.

56
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,170
What kind of flower
is that?

57
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:54,311
Oh, um...
it's a buttercup.

58
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,582
My mom had tattoos.

59
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,092
All right, well,
we should get you back

60
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,361
before you get
into trouble.

61
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:17,001
But we can... we can come
out here sometime,

62
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:19,469
on a weekend,
if you want.

63
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,373
- Cool.
- Cool.

64
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,177
All right, well, I'll be
a couple of hours behind you.

65
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,912
I still have some
work to do.

66
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,080
Okay.

67
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,582
I'll see you later.

68
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,553
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

69
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,325
Come on. Come on!

70
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
Oh, shit.

71
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,674
Oh, fuck.

72
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:26,456
Hey!

73
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,127
Are you okay?

74
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,376
No, no!

75
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,893
No!

76
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,575
No!

77
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:26,716
Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,820
No, no!
Please, no!

79
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:32,389
No, no!

80
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,159
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

81
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,594
What do you need?
What do you need?

82
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,598
Wait. Wait.

83
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:42,899
Okay.

84
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,536
Do you know
where you are?

85
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,708
Do you know what
direction you're facing?

86
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,347
Do you understand me?

87
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,952
We are hours
from the nearest road.

88
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,419
And the sun is down.

89
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,222
We're in the middle
of the desert.

90
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:05,889
You need...

91
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,424
Okay!

92
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:09,492
Um...

93
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,563
Do you have a GPS?

94
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,599
A GPS?

95
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,569
Anything you had is burned
up over there, okay?

96
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,872
I know where we are.
I know this desert.

97
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,309
I can take you wherever
you need to go. Okay?

98
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,411
Just tell... tell me
wherever you need to go.

99
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,954
Salton Sea.

100
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:39,957
The Salton Sea.

101
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,526
Okay, um...

102
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:49,466
That's a... that's a big area.
Do you know what part?

103
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,137
Here. Hold on.

104
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:59,542
North, south, east, west. Where?

105
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,814
Southwest?

106
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,717
Okay,
I can take you there!

107
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,022
Okay.

108
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,126
- Get the drugs.
- Okay.

109
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,526
Get the drugs! Move!

110
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,132
Get it. Get it!

111
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,632
Okay.

112
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,981
Okay,
that's all of it.

113
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,417
- More.
- No.

114
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,486
No, that's all
there was. There...

115
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,688
I mean, there might have been
more, but it's all burnt up.

116
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,557
Move, move.

117
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,778
Salton Sea.

118
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:51,614
That way.

119
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,201
That way.

120
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,016
What happens once we get
to the Salton Sea?

121
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,904
Look, I have...

122
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:31,774
Uh, I have two bags
in my trunk

123
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:35,012
and I think that they
will fit all of the drugs.

124
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,516
Uh, and I will leave you
with the drugs

125
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,118
once we get
to the Salton Sea,

126
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:42,885
and you can walk the...
the rest of the way with them,

127
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,388
and I will leave.

128
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,726
I won't see anyone.

129
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,996
I won't talk to anyone.
I won't say anything.

130
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:55,599
And you'll be gone by the
time I'm back to town.

131
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,737
No, I need to know or I'm
not gonna take you there!

132
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,472
- Wait, watch out!
- Whoa!

133
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:07,378
Stop!

134
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:00,964
Don't move.

135
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,977
We go. Move.
Get out.

136
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,952
Wait.

137
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:33,323
Wait. You wanna walk
to the Salton Sea?

138
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:36,059
That...
That's like 50 miles.

139
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,328
Okay, that'll take
a couple of days.

140
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:40,864
Let's... Look,
let's just try to fix the car.

141
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,433
Will you let me try?

142
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,971
The truck is stuck.

143
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,474
The wheels are destroyed.

144
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,347
I-I don't
have enough water.

145
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,353
And you have two bags.

146
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:07,157
Just like you say,
we'll carry on the drugs.

147
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,526
Load them.

148
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:52,803
Come on. Come on.

149
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:56,406
We can't... We can't do this.
We're not gonna make it.

150
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:05,048
Okay, Salton Sea.

151
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,298
Hi, Jim.

152
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,168
<i>Hi there, Jose.
How are you?</i>

153
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:46,570
- Oh, you know, living the dream.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

154
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,572
How's Imperial County
treating you?

155
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,409
<i>Well, uh, some dirt bikers
just found a buried body</i>

156
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,345
<i>out here on the border of
Imperial and San Diego County.</i>

157
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,049
- Oh, man.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

158
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:00,417
<i>I think the coyotes got
to it and dug it up.</i>

159
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,285
<i>Otherwise, it was
pretty well-buried,</i>

160
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,454
<i>but it's a mess.</i>

161
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:06,923
<i>The body was all beaten
and bloodied.</i>

162
00:30:07,058 --> 00:30:09,292
<i>Male, Latino, 40s.</i>

163
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:11,895
What? You say it's
in my county or yours?

164
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,297
<i>Well, that's why
I'm calling you.</i>

165
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:17,768
<i>The gravesite has technically
crossed the line of both counties.</i>

166
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:19,536
<i>I had to check the GPS.</i>

167
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:21,638
<i>It's in the middle
of the desert.</i>

168
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:24,274
<i>I don't know how
you wanna handle this.</i>

169
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,443
Now, listen, I appreciate
you reaching out, Jim.

170
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,379
I'm personally really
short-staffed right now.

171
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,648
It's just me out here this week.
Ed's on vacation.

172
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:33,683
Mary's down to three days
a week in the office.

173
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,019
<i>Yep.</i>

174
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:36,887
- I could get the coroners out there...
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

175
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,489
...but it'd still be a half
day's drive out of San Diego.

176
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,825
<i>Yeah, I know.
I get it. I get it.</i>

177
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,860
<i>We got a team in El Centro
that can come out.</i>

178
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,197
<i>I just wanna make sure
you guys have the chance</i>

179
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:48,166
<i>if you wanted it,
you know.</i>

180
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:50,201
No, I appreciate it, Jim.

181
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,902
<i>You bet, buddy.</i>

182
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:56,573
You've been seeing, uh, much
drug stuff lately in your area?

183
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,177
<i>Not for a long while.</i>

184
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,280
<i>It's brutal like that shit
from a few years back, though.</i>

185
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:06,984
<i>Well, I'll email you our report
in a few hours so you have it.</i>

186
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,585
<i>You say safe out there, Jose.</i>

187
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:10,387
All right.
Yeah, thanks.

188
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,056
Thanks,
I appreciate that, Jim.

189
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,523
<i>My pleasure.</i>

190
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,918
I need a break.

191
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,921
- No.
- Please.

192
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,825
Please, just a few minutes.
I need some water.

193
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:28,498
Okay.

194
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,579
Hey!

195
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:57,520
Hey!

196
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,489
Hey!

197
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:14,504
No. No!

198
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,142
No, no, no.

199
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,196
No!

200
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,104
Oh, Jesus.

201
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:05,316
What the hell, Alex?

202
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:17,428
What are you doing without a helmet, Alex?
What did I tell you about that?

203
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:18,795
I couldn't find it.

204
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,531
It was on the patio.
I saw it this morning.

205
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:22,866
If you can't find it,
you ask me for a ride or someone else.

206
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,735
Now get off, I'll put it in the
back, We'll take you to school.

207
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,204
I'm two minutes from school.

208
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:29,373
I don't want you riding
5 feet without a helmet.

209
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:30,807
Now, come on. Let's go.

210
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,409
I'll just push it there.

211
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,944
Alex.

212
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,285
Drop by the house on my lunch
and bring it to your classroom.

213
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:42,987
What do you got?
Ms. Marlin, fourth period?

214
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,122
Just leave it in
the front office.

215
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,923
Hey.

216
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,360
<i>Jose, it's Mary.</i>

217
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:52,296
<i>Jose, you there?</i>

218
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,570
Yeah, Mary. What is it?

219
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,038
<i>Where's your pretty face at?</i>

220
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:02,640
I'm out here handing out
speeding tickets.

221
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,707
I'll be back in the office soon.
What's up?

222
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,343
<i>Carl from the county is here,</i>

223
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:08,445
<i>askin' if you've seen
our new botanist, Elly?</i>

224
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,414
Not today, no.

225
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,849
<i>I guess she and Carl were
supposed to meet this mornin'.</i>

226
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,451
<i>He can't get a hold of her.</i>

227
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,819
<i>Drove in from San Diego for it.</i>

228
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,055
I'm sure she just forgot.

229
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:19,756
Probably still
out in the field.

230
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,426
<i>I told him.
He's pissed, though.</i>

231
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,827
<i>If you see her, have her
give Carl a ring, will you?</i>

232
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:26,330
<i>He's in a mood.</i>

233
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:29,967
I know that mood.
Thanks, Mary.

234
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:36,440
Dad, I was in the desert
with Elly yesterday.

235
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,276
What do you mean?

236
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,046
I skipped school to ride
and I ran into her.

237
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,147
Jesus, Alex.

238
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,349
I learned a lot.
It was really cool.

239
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,953
- Well, did you come back with her?
- No.

240
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:52,256
She said she was gonna stay out there
a few more hours and then drive back.

241
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:53,856
Where was she exactly?

242
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:55,993
At the bottom of the Eagle
Head Canyon or something.

243
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:58,128
In the plains,
right around there.

244
00:37:58,262 --> 00:37:59,964
What if her car broke down?
Maybe she needs help.

245
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:01,898
I'm sure she's probably fine.

246
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:05,768
Did he check her motel?
I'm going to go check.

247
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:08,405
No, you're gonna go to school.

248
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,740
No, I'm going to find Elly.

249
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,346
God damn it, Alex.

250
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,947
Real quick, and you're going
directly to school.

251
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:20,351
Open the gate.

252
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:27,757
I haven't seen her,
uh, since we checked in.

253
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,762
See her car come back
last night?

254
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,932
No. I was workin'.

255
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,402
Not sittin' there
starin' out the window.

256
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:42,106
We close up the office
at about 8:00.

257
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:46,043
Oh, you haven't cleaned her room
today, yeah?

258
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:48,646
What time is it?
10:16. No.

259
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:52,483
No, maids don't arrive until
after 11:00 durin' the weekdays.

260
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,820
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

261
00:38:57,955 --> 00:38:59,723
No, we're good. Thank you.

262
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:01,759
Okay, that's good.
Dr. Phil's waiting for me.

263
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:04,361
- All right, we'll lock up. Thank you.
- Okay.

264
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:12,202
All her stuff's still here.

265
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:14,705
I don't think she came back
at all yesterday, Dad.

266
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:16,707
She didn't sleep
in that bed either.

267
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,009
And she doesn't know
the area at all.

268
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,014
All right,
I'm gonna drive out there.

269
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:25,316
I'll come with you.

270
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,451
Nice try.
You're goin' to class.

271
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:31,221
Look, if she turns up,
have Mary try to reach me on the radio.

272
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:33,424
- Dad.
- Alex.

273
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:36,694
Don't worry, okay?
I'm sure she's fine.

274
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,462
See you tonight for dinner.

275
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,098
Okay.

276
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:12,342
We need to get out
of the sun.

277
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:17,080
We need shade.

278
00:43:18,882 --> 00:43:21,752
We're both burning up.
We need to head to those canyons.

279
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,592
That's not the way.

280
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:30,460
We're not gonna make it
to the Salton Sea.

281
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:32,696
It's straight desert
with no shade.

282
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:35,799
Okay, we need to get back
to Borrego Springs.

283
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:36,900
No.

284
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:41,405
If we keep walking this way,
we are gonna die.

285
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:47,110
Okay, that's the only way.

286
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:52,482
We get back to Borrego Springs,
I will find you a car,

287
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:54,885
you can call
whoever you need to call.

288
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:59,089
And we can go into town at night.
No one's gonna see you.

289
00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:02,426
I don't know.
It... it will take a day,

290
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,328
but it will be shaded canyon
most of the way

291
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:06,830
and we can do the rest at night.

292
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:08,298
No. We stay here.

293
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:10,467
No, we'll die here!

294
00:44:15,138 --> 00:44:16,673
He'll come.

295
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,108
Who?

296
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:28,052
Do you see anyone here?
We are alone.

297
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:30,153
No one is ever gonna
find us here, all right?

298
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:32,189
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert!

299
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,439
You really need to wrap your leg.
Put compression on it.

300
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:52,509
Tie it up with your jacket.

301
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:06,657
You have to tie it tight.

302
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:17,467
We're goin' to the canyon.

303
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,782
Everything all right?

304
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,353
- Speak English?
- Oh yes, yes.

305
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,859
What the hell is that?

306
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:26,596
Uh, an abandoned truck.
Just found it.

307
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,465
- No one in there, right?
- No, no.

308
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,534
I think
it's been there for a while.

309
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:34,838
You've seen anyone out there?

310
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,542
No,
there's never anyone out here.

311
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:41,344
We had a bet to see how
far from camp we could get

312
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:43,814
before one of us pussed out
from the heat.

313
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:45,415
It's hot.

314
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:48,585
Saw your truck drivin'
in the distance.

315
00:47:48,718 --> 00:47:51,621
I thought maybe you were
border patrol or somethin'.

316
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:53,657
But you're the opposite of that.

317
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:57,694
Anything good left in there?

318
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,363
Nah.

319
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,902
We should
probably call this in, huh?

320
00:48:11,341 --> 00:48:12,776
No!

321
00:48:14,078 --> 00:48:15,679
No, no, no!

322
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,135
Thank you.

323
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:53,130
How did your plane crash?

324
00:51:58,235 --> 00:51:59,702
Engine stopped.

325
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:02,339
No good plane.

326
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:06,676
Small plane.

327
00:52:08,678 --> 00:52:10,947
No radar on the border.

328
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:24,261
- What is this stuff?
- Hmm?

329
00:52:24,395 --> 00:52:25,862
This stuff, what is it?

330
00:52:30,534 --> 00:52:31,768
Mmm.

331
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:51,288
I need to pee.

332
00:52:56,893 --> 00:52:59,096
- Go.
- I can't do this by myself.

333
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,264
Go! Move.

334
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,679
Thanks.

335
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:23,047
We go.

336
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:16,126
Mary, you there?

337
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:19,363
I need help!
Does anyone read me?

338
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:24,134
I have an emergency.
Does anyone read this?

339
00:56:26,903 --> 00:56:28,605
This is Deputy Sheriff
Jose Gomez.

340
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:32,376
I got a homicide scene with two
bodies and a third missing person.

341
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:34,844
Do you copy?

342
00:56:39,516 --> 00:56:40,551
Hello?

343
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:43,620
Goddamn it!

344
00:57:23,293 --> 00:57:24,962
Does anybody read me?

345
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,265
I need help.
I have an emergency!

346
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:31,901
Anyone?

347
00:58:33,063 --> 00:58:34,631
Hello, does anybody read me?

348
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,401
This is San Diego County
Deputy Sheriff Jose Gomez

349
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:40,103
in need of immediate assistance.

350
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,272
Fuck me.

351
01:03:13,443 --> 01:03:15,645
Pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

352
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:18,749
- <i>Hi, you've reached Jose Gomez...</i>
- Where is he?

353
01:04:25,582 --> 01:04:27,918
Oh my God,
it's growing out here.

354
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:33,390
The path ends.

355
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,359
Where we go?

356
01:04:43,034 --> 01:04:44,634
Up that, I think.

357
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:48,405
We're at the end of the slot.

358
01:04:58,015 --> 01:04:59,116
We need rest.

359
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,452
We can climb this
in the morning.

360
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:03,820
Still light.

361
01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:07,490
We can continue.

362
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:09,526
How far Borrego Springs?

363
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:12,429
I don't know.
Uh...

364
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:17,467
We have to climb to the top, and then
walk through the canyon on the other side,

365
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:19,369
and it's still a long
way back to town.

366
01:05:19,502 --> 01:05:20,871
A really long time.

367
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:27,078
We climb, then rest.

368
01:05:27,211 --> 01:05:29,679
Sleep, finish in morning.

369
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,151
Yeah, we can try.

370
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,652
We go.

371
01:05:36,053 --> 01:05:37,154
You need to untie me.

372
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:40,924
If I fall and I die,

373
01:05:41,058 --> 01:05:42,926
who's gonna carry
your drugs for you?

374
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:42,585
Dad, are you there?

375
01:06:45,122 --> 01:06:46,523
Dad, it's Alex.

376
01:06:47,557 --> 01:06:48,993
Come on.

377
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:50,428
Is someone there?

378
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,662
I'm looking
for Deputy Sheriff Gomez.

379
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:55,799
Please help.

380
01:07:46,317 --> 01:07:48,885
- Whoa!
- No! No!

381
01:08:13,244 --> 01:08:14,278
Tomas.

382
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,251
I'm Elly.

383
01:08:29,692 --> 01:08:32,029
Why you were out...

384
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,299
on the desert?

385
01:08:40,703 --> 01:08:42,206
I'm a botanist.

386
01:08:43,907 --> 01:08:45,742
A plant scientist.

387
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:50,814
I'm doing a survey on that plant
we saw earlier in the canyon.

388
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:55,286
Something that isn't
supposed to be here.

389
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:57,620
Like us.

390
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:06,030
I was a teacher.

391
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:10,900
Who knows how to fly?

392
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:14,305
My father...

393
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:18,875
he was a pilot.

394
01:09:22,346 --> 01:09:25,082
As kid, we fly a lot.

395
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:27,851
He taught me.

396
01:09:29,487 --> 01:09:31,021
I don't like fly.

397
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:36,293
Okay, so why
do you do it?

398
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:43,234
I lost my job.

399
01:09:46,703 --> 01:09:48,105
No work.

400
01:09:52,775 --> 01:09:56,846
My cousin got me a job
in a fishing boat.

401
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,682
Moving gasoline.

402
01:10:02,253 --> 01:10:06,423
I didn't know that the
gasoline was for the cartel.

403
01:10:12,563 --> 01:10:14,298
My father is sick.

404
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:23,040
And the...

405
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:26,943
medicine is...

406
01:10:29,446 --> 01:10:31,048
expensive.

407
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:45,828
Sometimes,
when the monster comes...

408
01:10:47,097 --> 01:10:48,966
you have to say "yes."

409
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:00,244
Yours.

410
01:11:03,414 --> 01:11:06,016
What is buttercup?

411
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:19,263
It's my favorite
wild flower.

412
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,933
Um...

413
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:27,404
That's it.

414
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,609
It was my nickname that my sister
gave me when she was little.

415
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:33,477
She gave me that
a few years ago.

416
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:43,953
She was younger than me.
She was my half-sister.

417
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,426
And she wanted to be just like me.
She...

418
01:11:52,196 --> 01:11:55,366
wanted to grow up
really fast.

419
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:00,170
She...

420
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:03,873
She's not here?

421
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:06,876
No.

422
01:12:10,314 --> 01:12:14,318
She was so funny
and so smart.

423
01:12:14,451 --> 01:12:16,153
And I wasn't. I was...

424
01:12:18,389 --> 01:12:21,891
...awkward and anxious,
and I never felt comfortable.

425
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:30,367
So I started
taking stuff...

426
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,605
for depression
and anxiety.

427
01:12:34,738 --> 01:12:37,441
Stuff to go to sleep,
stuff to stay awake, stuff just to...

428
01:12:39,643 --> 01:12:42,112
just to help me forget.

429
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:47,318
Then one morning,
she asked me to drive her to school,

430
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:49,219
and I...

431
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,023
I had been up
for like three days.

432
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:57,061
But I couldn't
tell her "no."

433
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:04,368
Then I ran a red light.

434
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,010
And I watched her die.

435
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:26,090
And after that I just...
I couldn't be in that town,

436
01:13:26,223 --> 01:13:29,560
and drive down that road,
and see her room.

437
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,535
So I ran.

438
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:42,939
I ran from everything
and everyone.

439
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,276
And I have to keep running.

440
01:13:49,879 --> 01:13:51,615
We can keep running.

441
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:54,077
Father of my father told him,

442
01:14:55,112 --> 01:14:56,513
and he told me...

443
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:15,732
"Never run like a lamb."

444
01:15:18,168 --> 01:15:19,603
"Run like a wolf."

445
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:36,987
We sleep.

446
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,646
Come on.

447
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,811
Dad!

448
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,555
Dad!

449
01:19:35,559 --> 01:19:36,593
Dad!

450
01:19:41,065 --> 01:19:42,299
Dad!

451
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,936
Alex? Alex?

452
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,304
Dad!

453
01:19:49,473 --> 01:19:50,774
Alex!

454
01:19:52,409 --> 01:19:53,978
Dad, where are you?

455
01:19:54,112 --> 01:19:55,779
- Dad!
- Alex, be careful!

456
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:01,852
I can't see you.

457
01:20:01,986 --> 01:20:04,654
It's not safe.
You gotta go now, honey.

458
01:20:04,788 --> 01:20:06,157
Are you okay?

459
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:07,758
Alex, get out of here!

460
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,560
- Tell me you're okay.
- I'm fine, honey. Okay?

461
01:20:10,694 --> 01:20:13,897
I... I'm a little banged up,
but you gotta go now.

462
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:16,067
What's going on?

463
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,035
I don't know.
Bad things.

464
01:20:18,668 --> 01:20:21,605
I found Elly's car
and two dead bodies.

465
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,407
I chased a man up here
who shot at me.

466
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:27,245
Listen to me.
I need you to take my truck

467
01:20:28,012 --> 01:20:30,447
and drive as fast as you can
till you get reception,

468
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,116
and then let 'em know
what's goin' on.

469
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,519
Your radio's destroyed.
Your truck's out in the desert.

470
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:40,757
Okay, listen to me. Then you just
drive back as fast as you can

471
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:42,926
and tell 'em
what's going on, okay?

472
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:46,930
Town is hours away. Then they're hours
away, even when I get back to call.

473
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:49,432
They don't care about us.
You've said that.

474
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:51,568
It's just you and me.

475
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:54,938
I need to get you out of here
and we're going to find Elly.

476
01:20:55,072 --> 01:20:57,941
Listen to me. We can't! Okay?
It's dangerous here.

477
01:20:58,075 --> 01:20:59,676
I don't know
if he's coming back.

478
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:01,745
I need you to get back
as fast as you can.

479
01:21:01,878 --> 01:21:03,713
Try to drive
without the headlights.

480
01:21:03,847 --> 01:21:06,483
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm going to get you out.

481
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:09,853
No, we can't! Listen to me!
Get out of here now!

482
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:12,322
No, I am going
to get you out!

483
01:21:12,455 --> 01:21:14,491
You're the sheriff
and I'm your daughter!

484
01:21:14,624 --> 01:21:17,861
It's just the two of us and you know it!
There's no one else to help!

485
01:21:25,069 --> 01:21:27,337
Do you have any
rope in your truck?

486
01:23:14,979 --> 01:23:17,814
Come on, come on.

487
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:25,156
Okay, this is the number for
the deputy in the next county.

488
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:26,923
As soon as your phone
starts getting reception,

489
01:23:27,058 --> 01:23:28,993
call him and tell him
where I'm heading.

490
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:31,028
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna follow that guy's car tracks

491
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:33,697
into the canyon
and see if I can't find Elly.

492
01:23:34,731 --> 01:23:36,400
- Be safe.
- You, too.

493
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:38,235
Ride fast. Don't stop
for anything.

494
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:39,803
I love you.

495
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,116
Hey!

496
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:42,025
Alex?

497
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:07,950
Elly?

498
01:31:19,863 --> 01:31:21,432
No!

499
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:33,977
Come on. Let's go.

500
01:31:58,836 --> 01:32:00,070
Alex.

501
01:32:27,764 --> 01:32:28,999
Come on.

502
01:32:31,568 --> 01:32:32,603
Come on.

503
01:32:34,638 --> 01:32:35,672
Hang on.

504
01:33:13,011 --> 01:33:14,378
He's coming!

505
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:11,535
No!

506
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,576
Elly! Elly!

507
01:34:20,477 --> 01:34:22,813
Come on. Come on!

508
01:34:26,483 --> 01:34:28,385
Come on.

509
01:34:37,594 --> 01:34:38,695
No!

510
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:41,431
No, no!

511
01:34:42,165 --> 01:34:43,734
No!

512
01:34:45,802 --> 01:34:46,903
No! No!

513
01:35:27,145 --> 01:35:28,679
Hey!

514
01:35:32,315 --> 01:35:34,718
No, no. No, no, no.

515
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:36,520
No, no, no. No, no, no.

516
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:38,588
No! No!

517
01:36:20,263 --> 01:36:21,498
Elly.

518
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:41,918
Alex!
