00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:33,505
Good. Very good.

469
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:35,205
So here's how it goes.

470
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:39,771
We ask the questions,
and you answer 'em. Real simple.

471
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,712
Well, you got my kid,
I'm not going anywhere, but...

472
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,176
But, but, but, but what?

473
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,586
Why is her cheek bloody?

474
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:53,825
Well, had to yank her around a
bit, is all. She don't listen too well.

475
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,922
That's 'cause she can't hear,
asshole.

476
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:58,329
[chuckles] Whoops.

477
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,365
- Well, that explains a lot, don't it?
- [Lola chuckles]

478
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,565
[Scott] Look, just take whatever
you want. Get out of here.

479
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:07,234
[muffled] I got a few
hundred dollars in my wallet.

480
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:08,941
[Lola chuckling
in a normal voice]

481
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,108
You think we're
in these stupid-ass outfits

482
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:14,107
just to rob you off
a couple hundred bucks?

483
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,015
- That's rich.
- Yeah.

484
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,818
What we want from you
is buried underneath the patio.

485
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:21,951
Did you bring
the tools requested?

486
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,988
- Yeah.
- [animal howling]

487
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:26,055
You shouldn't have touched
the walls.

488
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:27,619
Man, we could have
kept this clean.

489
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:30,191
Why are we monologuing?
Let's just cap 'em.

490
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,057
[muffled] Let's just
fucking cap 'em.

491
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:35,693
[Victor muffled speech]

492
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:38,766
[normal voice]
Are you... are you the husband?

493
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:40,236
[Victor laughs]

494
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,304
We needed the cover
of a legit salvage crew

495
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:45,275
before the excavation team
arrives, you see.

496
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:48,979
You fine folks came in
and gave us the necessary tools.

497
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:53,251
Now the neighbors won't bother to investigate
the racket we intend to make out back.

498
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:56,254
- I fucking masterminded this shit.
- Are you done?

499
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:58,717
- I'm fucking talking, ain't I?
- God, why are you talking?

500
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,652
Why are you stalling?
We don't need him anymore.

501
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,854
You don't do the execution
while I'm talking.

502
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,925
Hey!

503
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:06,598
[Jane muffled gasp, cry]

504
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,532
- [Scott] Jesus!
- Whoo!

505
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:11,062
Oh. Oh, shit!

506
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,531
[panting]

507
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,336
- [Scott] Hold on.
- [Victor laughs]

508
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,674
I warned him.
I fucking warned him.

509
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:20,610
- All right, wait, wait.
- All right. That speeds things up a bit.

510
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:23,047
- Wait. Hang on, hang on. Wait, wait, wait!
- Here we go. What?

511
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:24,676
- You're gonna need us!
- [muffled cry]

512
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,578
All right, wait, hold...
Hold on a second, baby.

513
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,748
Let's hear
what the man has to say.

514
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:32,183
You know how superstitious
about this shit I get.

515
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:36,655
Look, I don't know what you
got in there, but I can get you to it.

516
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,397
Hell, we can manage just fine
without you.

517
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:40,866
Yeah?

518
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:44,601
So did you dig that hole
last time?

519
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:46,204
[panting]

520
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:47,899
You guys really know
how to operate them tools?

521
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,205
I mean, what happens when
the jackhammer bucks on you

522
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:51,708
'cause you hit
a rough spot, huh?

523
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:53,442
That ain't shit, daddy.

524
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,606
My man will just cut the wire
and start up again.

525
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:59,146
You guys done with rebar
or steel mesh?

526
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:00,879
What about brick ties, huh?

527
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:02,881
Not to mention all them
power lines you got running

528
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,416
- through this whole property.
- [Victor] Fucking enough!

529
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,559
- [ominous music playing]
- [sighs]

530
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,357
[coyote chittering]

531
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:11,889
[Lola] Why are they
still alive, Vic?

532
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,400
I think the man made
a pretty good point, right?

533
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:17,436
I mean, he's certainly more
experienced at this sort of business

534
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:20,066
- than either one of us.
- No, he's just trying to save his ass.

535
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:23,840
We need to stick to the original
plan and do the digging ourselves.

536
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:26,643
That's why we're wearing this
stupid fucking get-up in the first place.

537
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:30,445
[muffled speech]

538
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,483
It's just gonna be
so fucking hard.

539
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:37,221
[Lola] You said we needed
a jackhammer, a shovel,

540
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:38,416
and a couple hours,
and we'd be outta here.

541
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,159
Yeah, well, I say a lot of shit.

542
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,588
Listen, clearly I underestimated
the gravity and scope

543
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:45,729
of this fucking undertaking,
baby.

544
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:50,529
Now, if you don't recall, we
didn't dig that hole, Lola. No.

545
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:52,433
That was
your motherfucking cousin

546
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,635
who we had to kill afterwards,
okay?

547
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,868
You heard what he said
about all that fucking shit?

548
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:59,736
I ain't about to get
electro-motherfucking-cuted.

549
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,146
It's fucking bullshit,
what it is.

550
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,543
- Put your fucking mask back on.
- It's dark.

551
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:06,783
- We're in the kitchen.
- Oh, God.

552
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:11,586
Baby, in less than two days'
time, they gonna come back here,

553
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:15,655
and they are gonna dig up
what's under the fucking patio.

554
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,260
You wanna risk going at it
fucking alone

555
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,493
and losing
what we came here for?

556
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:24,431
Listen, let's just put his ass
to work.

557
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:28,338
Them jackhammers
are heavy as fuck.

558
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:33,812
You're seriously not considering
keeping them alive, are you?

559
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:35,411
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

560
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,112
[gun cocks]

561
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:40,778
[Victor] All right.

562
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,852
We're gonna do
some spring cleaning.

563
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,618
[distant coyote barking]

564
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,600
That's enough scrubbing,
Brennan.

565
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:59,571
We're gonna wrap him up and move
him into the other room for safekeeping.

566
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,898
[Scott exhales]

567
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:07,474
- Hey, what'd you just say to her?
- Huh?

568
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:10,182
I told her
we're moving the body.

569
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,852
Oh, and I'm supposed
to just trust that?

570
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:15,913
She read lips much, Brennan?

571
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:19,055
Oh, I...

572
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:21,088
Okay, let's try this again.

573
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:25,290
Does she read lips?

574
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,896
[ominous music playing]

575
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:28,998
Yeah, I guess so.

576
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:30,399
You guess so? Okay, good.

577
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,095
Here's what's gonna happen
from now on.

578
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,840
You're gonna say your words
to her loud and clear.

579
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:36,640
Say 'em slow if you have to,

580
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,870
but that's the only way you're
communicating from now on.

581
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:43,479
If I see you sign to her
like you just did,

582
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:46,383
I'm gonna play whack-a-mole
with her hands.

583
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,715
All right.

584
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:53,456
Now, ladies,
we're gonna dispose of, uh...

585
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:56,255
Pablo.

586
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:59,097
Thank you. Pablo.

587
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,926
You two can go
get to know each other,

588
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:03,468
you and me, we gotta go
to the truck to get our gear.

589
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,564
Come on.

590
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:07,602
[ominous music
continues playing]

591
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:15,280
- [thud]
- What's that?

592
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,277
An auger.

593
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,612
Huh. What's it do?

594
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,952
- Dig.
- [Victor chuckles]

595
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:24,520
What do those do?

596
00:36:27,293 --> 00:36:28,953
[Scott] What's gonna happen
to us?

597
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,730
[Victor] Well, that depends
entirely on you.

598
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,632
I mean, I could give a rat's ass
whether you live or die.

599
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:42,872
All I care about
what's under that patio.

600
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,206
All right.

601
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,539
What do you got under there?

602
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,540
[chuckles] None of your beeswax,
buddy.

603
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,744
You let us worry about that.

604
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,516
[Lola] Wow...

605
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:57,751
boys must love you.

606
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
So I get you what you want
and you let us go?

607
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:03,555
Your lives for what's underneath
the ground, all right?

608
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:07,893
I'll even let you keep the money in the
walls 'cause I'm such a good guy. [chuckles]

609
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,501
Am I making you uncomfortable?

610
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,506
What about now?

611
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:20,978
How about now?

612
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:23,513
What about right now?

613
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:27,011
And how do I know
I can trust you?

614
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:30,421
Well, you don't.

615
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:37,928
All right. Let's get to work.

616
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:39,958
No, it... it's late, huh.

617
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:42,761
I got floodlights.

618
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,031
[scoffs] Do I look like a fool
to you?

619
00:37:48,172 --> 00:37:50,270
It's past permit hours.

620
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:54,575
We start drilling now, them
neighbors just bound to call the cops.

621
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:58,945
Nah, we're gonna start
in the mornin'.

622
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:03,916
Yeah, for now I'm kinda...
I'm kinda hungry, uh...

623
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,386
Does that daughter of yours,
does she cook?

624
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:08,193
'Cause my bitch can't.

625
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,659
All she does
is get fucking takeout.

626
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:13,528
Yeah, she...

627
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:16,126
- [gun clicks]
- ...she knows a little.

628
00:38:16,195 --> 00:38:19,769
Good, real good.
Let's start a fire, you know?

629
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,271
And we'll all just camp out
like one big happy family.

630
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:24,706
You know what I mean?

631
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,843
Let's make this a...
a actual fun experience.

632
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:32,384
You know what they call that?
A net positive, all right?

633
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:35,717
[creaks]

634
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,498
Oh, how about some coffee?

635
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:50,831
No thanks.

636
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:54,736
I meant for me.
You'll have your girl do it.

637
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,504
[in sign language]

638
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:02,742
[Scott] Coffee.

639
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:05,417
- [in sign language]
- [Scott] Okay.

640
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:17,053
You must really think I'm some
kind of monster, don't you, Brennan?

641
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,957
I don't know
what the fuck you are.

642
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,258
Well, no, you know,
I'm just like you.

643
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,496
You know, I'm a man
that's trying to survive.

644
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:26,031
I don't kill people.

645
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,640
I'm a businessman.

646
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,674
Bet she got a nice body
under all them bulky clothes.

647
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,472
- Oh, hell yeah, she does.
- How old is she?

648
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,909
She's 17.

649
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:39,177
- Oh, I remember that age.
- Yeah, me too.

650
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:42,451
- She got a boyfriend?
- Eyes off my daughter, okay?

651
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,148
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Whoa.

652
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:47,688
She's just playing around, shit.
Girl, she ain't 18.

653
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:49,994
[Victor] Yeah,
you stay away from her.

654
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:53,862
[indistinct speech]

655
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:57,034
[Victor] Damn, Brennan, I...
I was thinking earlier.

656
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:01,768
You were having your, like, your
little moment of doubt and pain

657
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,102
and you said something,
you said,

658
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,138
"I can't believe
this is happening to us again."

659
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,147
What'd you mean by that?

660
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:13,417
[Scott] I don't think I'm really
in the mood for campfire stories.

661
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:16,488
Well, let's try
and keep this civil.

662
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:22,087
I said talk,
and be tender with the lip.

663
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,455
No thanks...

664
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,964
Vic.

665
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,831
[Victor laughs]

666
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,669
[Victor] Ah, hey.

667
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:39,171
Yup, well... shit, surprise.

668
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,742
- [Victor chucklse]
- [Lola] What the fuck, Vic?

669
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,510
We're supposed to
keep our masks on.

670
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,575
Yeah, well, he fucking knows.

671
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:46,750
Well, if he knows, then why the
fuck we wearing these masks?

672
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,019
Well, you wear fucking masks
when you do this shit.

673
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:51,448
[Lola] Well, if we're doing this shit,
why aren't we wearing our masks?

674
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,492
[Victor] Just shut up
about the fucking masks, baby.

675
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:57,454
Your much prettier
without the mask, okay?

676
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,092
[clinks]

677
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:03,093
[Victor] Now that we're all
intimate and acquainted,

678
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:05,801
I'd sure like to hear
that story.

679
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,001
Nothing to tell.

680
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,270
A year back, I, uh...

681
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,919
got into an incident
and we got held at gunpoint.

682
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,246
[Lola] Oh, shit.

683
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:24,317
How'd you get in that
predicament, Daddy?

684
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:26,354
Yeah?

685
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:27,856
[Scott] I... [sighs]

686
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,930
...we were out looking for Jane.

687
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,026
[Victor] We?

688
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,631
Yeah, my wife, Linda.

689
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,429
- That's a plot twist.
- Wow.

690
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:44,068
We'd tracked her down at
some fucking rich kid's party and...

691
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:46,738
[sighs] ...and I dragged her out
of there

692
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:48,239
kicking and screaming,

693
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:50,813
and on the way home,
that's when it happened.

694
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:56,819
One moment,
uh, we lost Linda and...

695
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:02,154
Jane ended up
the way she is now.

696
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:04,757
[Lola] You miss her?

697
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,759
I miss her every fucking day.

698
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,365
Wow, and now here you are again,

699
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:13,238
held up once more.

700
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:16,101
That is like, that's like...

701
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,803
like lightning
striking in the same spot twice.

702
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,776
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

703
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:25,917
Someone up there
must not like you.

704
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:32,052
If I'm being brutally honest,
you do strike me as a touch...

705
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,621
difficult.

706
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:38,290
Yeah. I am difficult.

707
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:42,161
- Hey, you ever blame her?
- [ominous music playing]

708
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:46,033
Yeah. [sighs]

709
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:48,465
[Scott] But she's just a kid,
you know?

710
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:52,574
Well, no, I mean, if she hadn't
forced you out that night,

711
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:54,510
your wife might still be alive.

712
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,945
Nah, that was all my fault.

713
00:42:58,544 --> 00:43:01,418
The whole goddamn thing
should have never happened.

714
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:04,656
The fucking guy cut me off, I...

715
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:09,456
- I was in a bad mood.
- [Victor] Oh, man.

716
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:14,298
Trying to be a cowboy and you ended
up getting someone you love killed.

717
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,630
[Victor clicks tongue]

718
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:17,196
You ever think what would happen

719
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:21,904
if you ever got your hands on
that man? Argh!

720
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:25,605
I've moved on.

721
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,006
I know what I'd do.

722
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:28,874
Oh, we all know
what you'd fucking do.

723
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,273
Well, yeah, but could he do it?

724
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:32,111
I mean,
it ain't like squashing ants.

725
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,477
Mmm, I don't mean,
I don't know, honey.

726
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:36,981
He don't really look like
he got it in him.

727
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,758
I don't know, baby. Be careful.

728
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,691
People can surprise you.

729
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:48,660
[ominous music fades]

730
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:50,128
[Victor] Oh, oh!

731
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:52,035
[Lola] Ow,
you motherfucking bitch!

732
00:43:52,104 --> 00:43:53,901
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey...
- Hey! Hey! Hey, easy now.

733
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,672
- Take it easy.
- Hey, hey, get back.

734
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,003
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
- That's enough!

735
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:58,334
- Easy, easy, easy.
- That's enough!

736
00:43:58,403 --> 00:43:59,975
- Get your girl back!
- Yeah, yeah...

737
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:01,738
Get your girl back!
I'll kill her right now!

738
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,674
- Take it easy!
- Yo, your girl tries that shit again...

739
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:05,610
- Okay, okay.
- I'm gonna kill her myself, all right?

740
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,385
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, now get in the trailer.

741
00:44:08,454 --> 00:44:09,886
You gonna get some sleep.

742
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:11,581
You got a big dig
in the morning, all right?

743
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,657
- Move.
- Why don't... why don't you guys take the camper?

744
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:15,222
- There's a bed in there.
- Let you run off

745
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,592
in the middle of the night?
Nice try, Einstein.

746
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:19,456
Get in the fucking camper.

747
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:23,432
- [Scott] Go on.
- Go on, go on.

748
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:26,497
Run, Forrest, run.

Were you fucking that
other guy in your dreams?

- No.

I promise.

Yeah.

764
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,752
Yeah, get yourself something
to eat, uh,

765

'cause you're gonna need
your strength.

uh, just working on the property.</i>

932
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:03,863
- You here to mark the lines?
- Yeah, yeah.

933
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:05,399
I got to make sure
they're all marked up

934
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:07,397
before anybody does any digging.

935
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:09,170
Right.

936
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,704
Well, have at it, yeah.

937
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:13,544
[Scott]
I mean, that's a good idea.

938
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:17,107
That's right, we don't want
anybody getting killed.

939
00:56:18,149 --> 00:56:19,175
[rattles spray can]

940
00:56:20,349 --> 00:56:21,982
Where's he going?

941
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:24,218
[Victor over phone]<i> I ain't got</i>

942
00:56:24,286 --> 00:56:25,522
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

943
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:29,319
So, uh...

944
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:31,187
<i>so you gonna go throughout
the whole property or...</i>

945
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:33,530
[utility worker]
Wherever this thing leads me.

946
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:37,501
Yup.

947
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:43,635
<i>[Victor over phone] That fat
motherfucking piece of shit.</i>

948
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:46,543
I almost wanna fucking kill him.

949
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:58,687
[music fades]

950
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:01,723
Camping out?

951
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:03,692
Yeah.

952
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,027
I... camp on site,
it saves me the drive.

953
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:10,961
<i>It's easier than driving in
all the way...</i>

954
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,797
You know, it's...
[Scott laughs]

955
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:15,100
Good answer, Brennan.
[laughs]

956
00:57:15,169 --> 00:57:17,635
[utility worker] You're
the only one out here?

957
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:19,741
[Scott] No, I've got my...

958
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,374
Workers are in town.

959
00:57:22,443 --> 00:57:24,207
They're picking up some
supplies, they'll be back in a bit.

960
00:57:24,276 --> 00:57:26,378
Looks like the line's
leading us over here.

961
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,980
<i>Yeah.</i>

962
00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:32,053
[Victor]
<i>This shit's fucking boring me.</i>

963
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:35,422
- You are a fucking boring...
- Let me clean that up for you.

964
00:57:35,491 --> 00:57:36,853
Motherfuckers, ain't you?

965
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:39,996
I could never have a real job.

966
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:42,427
Yeah, so...

967
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,526
[clatters]

968
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:44,526
Uh...

00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:45,866
[thuds]

00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:48,268
[heavy breathing]

[clattering]

972
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,670
I ain't got all fucking day,
Brennan.

973
00:57:52,738 --> 00:57:54,309
[Victor]<i> Hurry up.</i>

974
00:57:54,377 --> 00:57:55,942
[spray paint hissing]

975
00:57:57,116 --> 00:57:59,077
You ever get some, uh...

976
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,286
criminal activity out here?

977
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,754
[Utility worker]
No, sure don't.

978
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:07,016
Seems like just a place
where anything can happen.

979
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,689
[Victor]<i> Get him the fuck...</i>

980
00:58:08,758 --> 00:58:10,727
...out of here,
we got a fucking dig!

981
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:13,559
I'm just thinking, you know,
you never know what...

982
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,363
Nothing around here, pal.

983
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:16,730
[tense music playing]

984
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,262
Oh, Daddy thinks
he's getting slick.

985
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,939
- Well, you don't need to get inside, right?
- Hey.

986
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:28,610
[Victor]<i> Where's he going,</i>
<i>Brennan?</i>

987
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,008
You don't need to go in here,
do you?

988
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:32,011
It's where the receiver's
leading me.

989
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,850
We're not really working in...
In the house?

990
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:37,247
[Victor]<i> He finds that body,</i>
<i>he joins it.</i>

[utility worker]<i> Yeah, dammit.</i>

[utility worker grunts, groans]

996
00:58:57,808 --> 00:58:59,936
- [utility worker] A mistake.
- [GPS beeps]

997
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:01,711
Looks like we're all done here.

998
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,814
So, what do I do if...

999
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,453
In case there's an emergency?

1000
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:13,891
Everything all right, sir?

1001
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,259
Yeah.

1002
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:18,260
I was just wondering what to do

1003
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:20,059
in case of an emergency.

1004
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:22,163
You mean if you accidentally
hit a line?

1005
00:59:22,232 --> 00:59:23,266
Yeah.

1006
00:59:23,335 --> 00:59:24,597
Call the cops right away.

1007
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:26,201
[Scott]<i> So call...</i>

1008
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,603
<i>9-1-1.</i>

1009
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:30,106
[Utility worker]
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

1010
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,807
9-1-1, huh?

1011
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,475
Fucking 9-1-1.

1012
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:36,608
Like, call the police?

1013
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:38,313
Yeah, that's right.

1014
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:39,742
[Victor]<i> Brennan?</i>

1015
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:41,178
Here's the...

1016
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:42,584
Here's all the
pertinent information.

00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:44,182
[Victor]<i> You hear me, Brennan?</i>

1018
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:47,423
You take care now.

- [car engine starting]
- Yeah.

1021
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:51,854
Oh, fucking police, huh?

1022
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,730
Come on!
Come on!

1023
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:58,735
What was all that dial 9-1-1
talk, Brennan, huh?

1024
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,032
Dangerous neighborhood, huh?

1025
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,973
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fucking bullshit me.

1026
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:05,269
I told you what I was gonna do
if you fucking bullshit me.

1027
01:00:05,337 --> 01:00:07,269
I told you what
I'll fucking do to her, huh.

1028
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:09,944
He's gone. Hey!
[stammers] He... He left.

1029
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:11,513
I'll blow her fucking brains
out right now!

1030
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:14,916
He's gone!
He's gone.

1031
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:17,820
I got rid of him.
What more do you want?

1032
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:29,594
We're on a tight schedule,
get back to fucking work.

1033
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,196
Yeah, sure.

1034
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,001
Yeah, okay.

1035
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:38,174
Come on, Jane, let's go to work.

1036

[panting]

1037
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,176
Calling the fucking police.

1038
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:45,947
Just fucking try that shit
again, man, I'll fuck you up.

1039
01:00:46,778 --> 01:00:48,015
All right.

Cool your jets, what's the
matter with you?

1049
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:00,883
I'm fine, I'm fucking fine.

1050
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:02,252
Bullshit.

1051
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:03,559
You're twitching
like a crack whore.

1052
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:04,993
Well, I needed it, fuck face.

1053
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:08,058
I hate being in this
stupid-ass shithole.

1054
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,725
You think I like being here?

1055
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,462
You know, being here brings
back a couple of memories

1056
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,469
- I'd rather forget.
- Oh, you'd rather forget?

1057
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:15,703
He tried to kill me.

1058
01:02:15,772 --> 01:02:17,102
Yeah, he cut my fucking throat.

1059
01:02:17,171 --> 01:02:19,074
Ain't exactly a massage
and a blow job.

1060
01:02:19,142 --> 01:02:20,875
Well, what if we do
all this hard labor shit,

1061
01:02:20,944 --> 01:02:22,307
and it doesn't end up
working out?

1062
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:24,942
What you mean?

1063
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:26,443
You think you're so smart.

1064
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:28,248
You think you're such
a fucking professional.

1065
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:30,886
What if we dig it up,
and we put it somewhere else

1066
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,021
and some new son of a bitch
finds it?

1067
01:02:33,089 --> 01:02:35,624
Well, uh... Well, ain't you
a Cassandra now?

1068
01:02:35,693 --> 01:02:37,158
You're such a swinging dick.

1069
01:02:37,226 --> 01:02:39,891
Why don't you just own up to
what we did, huh?

1070
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,260
Tell your daddy the truth.

1071
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,693
Of course you won't,

1072
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:46,862
because deep down inside,
you're just a little baby boy.

1073
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:48,565
Right?

1074
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:51,369
Which is why I'm stuck here
cleaning up your mess,

1075
01:02:51,437 --> 01:02:53,536
babysitting daddy
and his deaf daughter

1076
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:56,011
when I should be
drinking Mai-Tai's in Cancun.

1077
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,574
Okay, no more drugs for you,
young lady.

1078
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,176
It's like you're waiting
for them to turn on us.

1079
01:03:00,245 --> 01:03:02,382
And that Brennan, he's a dick.

1080
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,316
And I'm telling you, baby,
you play around with a dick

1081
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:06,221
long enough, you end up
getting fucked by it.

1082
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,624
Watch your mouth, you fucking
janitor-looking-ass bitch.

1083
01:03:08,693 --> 01:03:10,085
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1084
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:11,654
You don't know shit.

1085
01:03:11,723 --> 01:03:14,330
Settle down, before
we gonna visit the dentist.

[sighs]

1088
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:18,698

01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:24,952
I mean, he might have talked
to somebody.

1249
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:27,055
Nobody knows.

1250
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:29,084
[Lola] [muffled voice] Well, that's
good. That makes things easier.

1251
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:36,030
[Victor] Oh! Whoo, shit!

1252
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:39,200
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Looks like
you're gonna have to swipe right

1253
01:11:39,269 --> 01:11:41,100
on some other hero to save you.

1254
01:11:41,169 --> 01:11:42,570
[Lola laughs]

1255
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:45,670
[Victor] Might be a little too
soon, but...

1256
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,844
- you can do better than him.
- Yeah.

1257
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:51,176
Yeah, he's cute, he just didn't
really have that thing, you know.

1258
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:52,342
Yeah, a pulse.

1259
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:54,550
[both laugh]

1260
01:11:54,619 --> 01:11:59,515
In all seriousness, Brennan,
this is on you, man.

1261
01:11:59,584 --> 01:12:01,319
You two see that, right?

1262
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:02,787
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1263
01:12:02,856 --> 01:12:05,020
- Yeah, I see it.
- This death's on you, man.

1264
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:07,727
If you hadn't wasted time
running off,

1265
01:12:07,796 --> 01:12:09,899
we would have
gotten what we came here for

1266
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:13,267
and be long gone before little
fucking Tiger Beat came knocking.

1267
01:12:13,336 --> 01:12:15,634
You know what we call that?

1268
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:19,002
That's called
a "cosmic epiphany."

1269
01:12:20,143 --> 01:12:21,741
Baby, I got goosebumps.

1270
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:28,511
Well, looks like Pablo's got
a little best friend.

1271
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,914
Let's take him out back.

1272
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:32,686
Fucking bullshit.

1273
01:12:35,024 --> 01:12:37,057
[digging]

1274
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:38,092
[Scott grunts]

1275
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,227
Brennan, you were right.

1276
01:12:40,296 --> 01:12:45,433
We would have been lost under this
jungle of dirt and concrete down there.

1277
01:12:45,502 --> 01:12:48,597
Ain't you lucky
we spared your life.

1278
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:53,135
You know, Victor, I've been
thinking about this whole thing.

1279
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:55,874
About why us.

1280
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:58,613
Why this place.

1281
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:02,748
- Have you now?
- [Scott] Yeah.

1282
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:07,850
I figure,
whatever you got down here,

1283
01:13:07,919 --> 01:13:12,988
must have been real important for you
to go through all the trouble to bury it.

1284
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:17,798
Yeah, what you put
in the ground,

1285
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:20,668
you expected it to stay
in the ground, didn't you?

1286
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:25,141
That's enough figuring from you.

1287
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,338
Why don't you get back to work?

1288
01:13:26,407 --> 01:13:29,204
Yeah, you know what?

1289
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:31,342
[thuds]

1290
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:32,845
[Scott exhales]

1291
01:13:34,546 --> 01:13:35,979
I want to know.

1292
01:13:36,048 --> 01:13:39,080
Hey, hey, don't you worry,
Curious George.

1293
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:41,651
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1294
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:43,559
Now get back to work.

1295
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:52,566
Jesus, what's that smell?

1296
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,966
[Victor]
Just keep digging, Brennan.

1297
01:13:59,037 --> 01:14:00,808
Who are we digging up here,
Victor?

1298
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:04,012
What is this, 20 questions?
Just do your job, Daddy.

1299
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,942
Oh, shit.

1300
01:14:06,011 --> 01:14:08,815
All right, look what I got here.

1301
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:10,752
Wrap these around the front
and the back.

1302
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,652
Both of you guys,
wrap the rope around the...

1303
01:14:14,721 --> 01:14:19,056
Brennan, you get your daughter to
tie that or I'm gonna take her hand out.

1304
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,562
Come on.

1305
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:23,566
All right, you guys,
let's tie them.

1306
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:25,766

Oh, my God.

1312
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:04,634
Your brother.

1313
01:15:04,703 --> 01:15:06,103
What can I say, Brennan.

1314
01:15:08,074 --> 01:15:12,242
Family matters are, uh...
complicated.

1315
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:14,617
Victor's family has got a way
of handling things.

1316
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:17,382
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Yeah, that's right.

1317
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:22,119
That's good you stand up to
your older brother, Mr. Texas State.

1318
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:28,763
Even when he tries to kill you,
steal your girl, and the money.

1319
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:32,866
Oh, wait a minute, baby.

1320
01:15:32,935 --> 01:15:36,503
I thought you said
that he tried to kill you?

1321
01:15:36,572 --> 01:15:38,104
Yeah, he did, baby, both of us.

1322
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:39,968
[scoffs]

1323
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:42,172
You gonna believe her, Victor?

1324
01:15:42,241 --> 01:15:45,445
I mean, there's a lot of money
in them walls,

1325
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,910
and I'm willing to bet...

1326
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:49,618
there's a lot more in there.

1327
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:52,353
She don't
seem like the sharing type.

1328
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:55,283
Hey, story time's over.

1329
01:15:55,352 --> 01:15:58,090
Don't you worry
about our demons, Brennan.

1330
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,928
Come on, old man,
you got your own haunting you.

1331
01:16:01,997 --> 01:16:04,365
I tell you what,
I ain't got nothing like that.

1332
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,497
What about your dead wife?

1333
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:07,533
[Victor] Yeah.

1334
01:16:07,602 --> 01:16:10,299
- Oh.
- You know...

1335
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,104
everybody's a killer
if they get the chance.

1336
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:15,405
[Victor] All right.

1337
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:16,811

1338
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:21,618

[crowbar clanks]

1340
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:29,290
Oh.

1341
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:30,726
[Lola] Fuck, Billy.

1342
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:34,990
He looks small.

1343
01:16:35,059 --> 01:16:37,128
Fuck, Billy smells like shit.

1344
01:16:37,197 --> 01:16:39,702
Hey, that's my brother
you're talking about.

1345
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:43,933
All right.

1346
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:46,067
We got four hour till daylight.

1347
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:50,912
Which means we got, like, eight
hours until the excavation crew gets here.

1348
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:54,310
Which leaves us just enough
time to dispose of Billy

1349
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:57,879
and Pablo and Tiger Beat.

1350
01:16:57,948 --> 01:17:00,222
Yeah, but what about...

1351
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:04,959
Not them right now, 'cause we
need to leave this place empty.

1352
01:17:05,027 --> 01:17:07,358
I don't wanna carry
all them bodies on my own.

1353
01:17:07,427 --> 01:17:09,657
So, we'll just lock them up
until we're ready to leave.

1354
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,061
No.

1355
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,495
That's bullshit.
I'm doing it right now.

1356
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:16,506
You gonna make me carry
five fucking bodies on my own?

1357
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:18,002
Why are you being
so fucking lazy?

1358
01:17:18,071 --> 01:17:20,976
[Lola and Victor
speaking indistinctly]

1359
01:17:21,044 --> 01:17:23,544
I'm just saying it's a lot
of fucking bodies, is all.

1360
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:25,548
I'm doing it right fucking now.

1361
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:29,547
All right,
time to do more chores.

1362
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:31,516
Let's go.

1363
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:32,947
Single file.

1364
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,718
I said fucking go!

1365
01:17:34,787 --> 01:17:37,221
Whoa. Yeah, okay, okay.

1366
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:45,999
[Lola] Got a lot more
work to do.

1367
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,232
[Scott] Uh...

1368
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:51,004
All right.

1369
01:17:53,204 --> 01:17:55,708
Get down.
All right, Daddy,

1370
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:57,572
I'm gonna give you a choice.

1371
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,245
You can watch little miss
angel face die first...

1372
01:18:01,313 --> 01:18:03,720
or I can put you out
of your pathetic misery.

1373
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,390
Hmm.

1374
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:09,656
Get your dirty hands off my kid.

1375
01:18:09,725 --> 01:18:11,253
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

1376
01:18:11,322 --> 01:18:13,528
- [Victor] Hey, baby.
- [Lola] What?

1377
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:15,794
Can I borrow you for a second?

1378
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:17,859
[Lola] Jesus fucking Christ.

1379
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:19,428
This dumb-ass.

1380
01:18:25,574 --> 01:18:27,204
- Hey.
- What?

1381
01:18:27,273 --> 01:18:31,143
So, sweetheart,
Brennan got me thinking...

1382
01:18:32,644 --> 01:18:36,181
maybe he awakened a rather
long held suspicion I've had,

1383
01:18:36,249 --> 01:18:39,548
maybe Billy wasn't trying
to "kill" you.

1384
01:18:39,617 --> 01:18:42,523
Maybe the two of you alone
in that room with all that money

1385
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,256
- gave you ideas?
- Oh,

1386
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:47,155
so now you're gonna listen
to complete strangers.

1387
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:50,862
Did he try to kill you, Lola?

1388
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:51,961
It don't matter anymore, baby.

1389
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:53,628
Shit. I killed my brother,

1390
01:18:53,697 --> 01:18:58,437
so I'd say it's sort of
kind of maybe fucking matters!

1391
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:01,976
[Victor] Now, the shit ain't
paranoia if the shit is true.

Now, I'm gonna ask you something

1396
01:19:13,384 --> 01:19:15,891
and I'mma only
ask you once, okay?

1397
01:19:16,988 --> 01:19:18,861
Did you fuck my brother?

and ourselves.

1402
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,623
Hell, I fucked your daddy, too.

1403
01:19:55,692 --> 01:19:59,500
- God, I fucking knew it!
- That money was mine.

1404
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:01,796
