<i>♪ …birthday, dear Franny ♪</i>

00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:40,511
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

4
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,643
- Happy birthday.
- Good job, girls.

5
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh, I love you, baby, so much!

6
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,146
Come on!

7
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,898
I'm gonna get you guys some cake.

8
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,692
- Uh, I'll get some wine.
- Okay.

9
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,319
- Let me do that.
- Oh.

10
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,571
- That way, you can actually eat.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,699
You've been looking so thin,
you're making us moms look terrible.

12
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,536
Mmm. Wow.

13
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,121
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,749
What's the matter, Mom?

15
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,918
It's hot.
Your father can't keep his eyes open.

16
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,088
- Oh, I'm fine.
- It is a four-hour drive from Worcester.

17
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,507
I know. I'm going to make you guys
some coffee.

18
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,847
Can you make a pot of coffee?
And we need another bottle of white wine.

19
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,642
White wine, right. On it.
Mom, can you do the coffee?

20
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,102
I'll be right back.

21
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,960
Everyone, if you all raise your cups.
To Dr. George, huh?

22
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,545
Hear, hear!

23
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,842
- It is official, right?
- Yeah, it is officially official.

24
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,261
Yeah, I'm no longer a PhD widow.

25
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,139
And I have some more good news.

26
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,601
Uh, my dissertation
actually landed me a gig upstate.

27
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,354
- Wow, fast.
- It must be really good.

28
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,772
I haven't read it yet.

29
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,525
- George is very secretive.
- No, I am chickenshit.

30
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,028
Catherine was
top of the class at art school.

31
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,407
- Oh, is the position at Bard?
- No, it's at Saginaw.

32
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,286
It's a small private college upstate.

33
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,873
You're a big city girl now
with your dream job.

34
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,291
You thought this through?

35
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,796
George really wants this.
He hates the struggle here.

36
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,716
It's gotten worse
since his father cut him off.

37
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,222
And I had no idea
he was even taking money from them.

38
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,100
Apparently, it's been happening
since Franny was born.

39
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,227
Moving's expensive, too.

40
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,646
I know, but you can get a lot
for a little up there.

41
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,983
- It's supposedly really pretty.
- Yeah, I've driven through there.

42
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,696
Rich horsey weekenders
and lots of full-time rednecks.

43
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,533
I know, but George has made
some big sacrifices for me,

44
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,911
and I... I owe it to him to at least try.

45
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,467
Hey.

46
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,927
Hey.

47
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,307
I think I've found
the perfect house for us.

48
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,013
Oh, there we are.

49
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,683
This lock is a bit tricky.

50
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,935
Wow, beautiful.

51
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,191
- Okay.
- Huh?

52
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,529
As I told George last week,
it's from the late 1800s.

53
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,447
Mm.

54
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,450
There's definitely
updating that needs to be done.

55
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,077
Yes, certainly could use a paint job.

56
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,830
Yeah, but look at these bones, huh?
Amazing!

57
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,791
You have to have a real vision
for an old place like this.

58
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,629
Well, my wife is a trained art restorer,
so we're in good hands.

59
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,215
Why would someone just leave this here?

60
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,884
This is so beautiful.

61
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,971
Dairy farmers everywhere
are falling on hard times.

62
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,765
It's a... a tough business these days.

63
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,809
So sad.

64
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,606
It is sad.

65
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,108
We'll make it happy.

66
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,280
You wanna see the rest, don't you?
Come on.

67
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,532
Show it to me.

68
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,702
- Show me the upstairs.
- Okay, upstairs.

69
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,120
How big is it?

70
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,928
Hey. Remember this?

71
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm not gonna use all this space for it.

72
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,066
- Here. This is right…
- Okay.

73
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,802
Ah!

74
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,345
Hey, uh, George,

75
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,640
I was gonna put your little seascapes,
you know, above the piano,

76
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,475
- but I... I can't find them.
- Oh.

77
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,727
- Sorry. I packed them for my office.
- Aw.

78
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,187
I love those things.

79
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,566
Yeah, I thought it would show off
a relic of my former life. Oh!

80
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,571
You know, maybe this house is going
to inspire you to start painting again.

81
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,576
Mm, nah, I think, since my dissertation,
I… I really see myself as a writer.

82
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,330
Okay, the cat or the doll?

83
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,456
Which one?

84
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,965
I think she's finally out.

85
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,927
Are you stressed about tomorrow?

86
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,557
Yeah... No. Should I be?

87
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,603
Well, first day jitters
are a normal human reaction.

88
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,442
Are you looking for a reason to de-stress?

89
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,736
- Do I need a reason?
- No.

90
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,654
How do you want me to de-stress you?

91
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,660
What?

92
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,952
What is that smell?

93
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,706
You smell that?
It smells like car exhaust fumes.

94
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,418
- Right?
- Yeah, I… I guess I smell… smell it.

95
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,045
And it's getting stronger.

96
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,258
Do you think ghosts use premium unleaded?

97
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,968
I'm serious, George. Stop.

98
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,821
- Mommy, Mommy, I'm scared!
- Oh God! It's okay. Oh!

99
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,280
- Come here.
- I'm scared!

100
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,242
Tuck in, baby girl. All right.

101
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,618
Wait, really?

102
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,663
Mommy, I'm scared.
I don't wanna sleep in there.

103
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,049
<i>America's Rhine.</i>

104
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,720
Oh, it is a dream setting for a campus.

105
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,097
Full disclosure, Claire.

106
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,351
Your chapter on how Swedenborg
influenced the art of George Inness

107
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,644
is what landed you here.

108
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,814
Swedenborg, really?
That's… that's interesting.

109
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,817
It's the part of my dissertation
I struggled with the most.

110
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
How so?

111
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:21,282
Uh, I-I guess
I'm a bit of a cliché, the New York cynic.

112
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,327
That… How a-a painter
as brilliant as Inness

113
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,623
could fall for some 18th-century mystic
still baffles me.

114
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,001
Well, Swedenborg…

115
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,629
He wasn't just some mystic.

116
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,550
He keenly understood
that everything in the natural world

117
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,094
has a counterpart in the spiritual realm.

118
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,765
And Inness painted landscapes
with this in mind.

119
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,891
I-I get that.

120
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,226
Oh, this is my office in case you need me.

121
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,020
- Wow, beautiful.
- Mh-hm.

122
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:57,651
My... my trouble with Swedenborg is
his communicating with angels and ghosts.

123
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,614
Glorifying death as this…
as this grand passage.

124
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,909
You should know that Swedenborg
still has a devoted following

125
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,661
in this neck of the woods,
myself included.

126
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,707
We even have séances on occasion.
I'll invite you.

127
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,169
I'll... I will bring my wife.

128
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,130
She is the…
the true believer of the family.

129
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,256
Ah, ah.

130
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,759
Well, this is your office right here.

131
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,142
I guess I picked
the wrong welcome gift.

132
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,897
Well, I… I can't argue with the cover art.

133
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,732
<i>The Valley of the Shadow of Death.</i>

134
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,860
Ahh, that is George Inness at his best.

135
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,780
Well, you are now
officially in Inness territory.

136
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,116
Don't be surprised
if you start seeing things his way.

137
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,037
Thank you, Floyd.

138
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,241
- Hi.
- Hello.

139
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,324
Mrs. Claire, right?

140
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,411
Yeah, can I help you?

141
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,954
Uh, yes, ma'am.

142
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,037
Um…

143
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,917
My name's Eddie Lucks,
and this here's my younger brother Cole.

144
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,838
We just wanted to introduce ourselves
in case you're in need of a hired hand.

145
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,965
We do gardening, carpentry, plumbing.

146
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,135
When it comes to painting,
we're regular Leonardos.

147
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,223
- Best part of all is, we come real cheap.
- Hey, like my marble?

148
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,018
Yeah, nice.
You want me to show you how to shoot?

149
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,019
Mm-hmm.

150
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh, I forgot to mention
that Cole is the best babysitter in town.

151
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah, I can see that.
Where do you boys live?

152
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,902
In town with our uncle.

153
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,779
We got plenty of references
if that's what you need.

154
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,907
Okay. Do you have a business card?

155
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,618
A card? Um…

156
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,369
Let me see.

157
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,040
Oh, I left my business cards at home.

158
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,751
- I got a pen.
- Yeah!

159
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,170
I think we should just hire them.

160
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,173
Shouldn't we get one more quote?

161
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,056
There's a lot of other
groundskeepers in town.

162
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,635
I already did, and they…

163
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,470
run like half the price.

164
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,643
Cath, please don't tell me you're back
on the whole salads-only thing.

165
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,519
I ate a big lunch today.

166
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,230
What about the protein shakes
the doctor recommended?

167
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,483
I saw you skipped it this morning.

168
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,195
I am doing them at night now
because it's easier on my stomach.

169
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,743
- Franny, you want some more rice?
- No, I want a pony ride.

170
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,788
- Go, pony, go!
- I am.

171
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,206
Go, pony, go!

172
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,959
You are terrorizing.

173
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,963
Oh, look, there's another pony.

174
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,631
Okay. Ready?

175
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,675
- One, two, three.
- Horsey.

176
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,807
- Pony!
- Gosh.

177
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,143
- You coming?
- Yeah, in a second. I have to do dishes.

178
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,479
Oh, can you get that pot for me, please?

179
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,315
- Thank you. I'll be up soon.
- Okay.

180
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,317
Don't be long. I'm pretty tired.

181
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,007
"Damned."

182
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,177
George.

183
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,971
Hey, George.

184
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,055
George.

185
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,726
I'm a... I'm asleep.

186
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,166
- Where?
- Eight.

187
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,686
- Three pounds is a lot.
- You've got to be telling...

188
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,752
Company.

189
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,172
Hi. Are you the Historical Society?

190
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
Indeed we are.

191
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,010
Um, I don't know if you need volunteers,

192
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,721
but I'm new in town,
and I would love to meet people

193
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,390
and possibly learn more about the area.

194
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,350
Write your information down.

195
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,603
Okay.

196
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,771
We'll send you a schedule.

197
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,482
And also, I was curious

198
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,737
if you had any information
on some of the older homes in the area,

199
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,740
being that I just bought one.

200
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,074
Oh.

201
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,997
Actually, there's a picture
of your house hanging up.

202
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,582
- Really? Where?
- Yeah.

203
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,169
In the other room.
The couple who built it is in it, too.

204
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,087
The original ones,

205
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,298
long before the Vayle family.

206
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,884
I… I'm going to go take a look. Thanks.

207
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,129
- He doesn't look like a cat.
- He does.

208
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,716
- His ears are so little.
- It's called <i>Cat in the Hat</i>.

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,053
- And his nose and stuff like that.
- He's got a normal nose.

210
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,305
But it's so little!

211
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,067
You know he killed someone?

212
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,779
Over a game of tennis.

213
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Who?

214
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,198
Caravaggio.

215
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,411
Oh, well, I'm not surprised.

216
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,247
People get away
with all kinds of horrible things.

217
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,668
Are you speaking from personal experience?

218
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,965
So are you studying art?
I-I teach over at Saginaw.

219
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,341
Oh God. No.

220
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,718
No, I was just…

221
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,387
looking for T-shirt ideas.

222
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,347
I'm all about literature in school.

223
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,431
Which school?

224
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,100
Cornell.

225
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,769
Oh, that's quite a commute.

226
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,813
Just taking a little hiatus.

227
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,441
Riding for rich folk at Crow Hill Stables.

228
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,318
Yeah, I know that place.

229
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,487
It's right next to the tennis club.
I play there sometimes.

230
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,448
Oh. Well, uh…

231
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,783
I hope you're a better loser
than Caravaggio.

232
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,704
George Claire.

233
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,998
Right.

234
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,083
Right. Claire.

235
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,961
Yeah, my friend Eddie does your yard work.

236
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,672
I think your wife hired him.

237
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,721
Is that your little girl?

238
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,931
Yeah, that's Franny.

239
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,432
Oh…

240
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,771
Hi there, Franny.

241
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,438
How's that book?

242
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,524
What does this say?

243
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,568
Let's see.

244
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,488
Okay, it says…

245
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,284
"He should not be here.
He should not be about."

246
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,788
"He should not be here
when your mother is out."

247
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,086
It's nice to meet you, Franny.

248
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,169
Mm-hmm.

249
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,885
Okay, ready to go?

250
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,678
George?

251
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,767
George?

252
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,982
George, you're not going to believe
the picture I just saw.

253
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,100
- Wanna go to the pond?
- Yeah!

254
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,310
You wanna go swim?

255
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,856
- Come on, Franny. Gonna catch you!
- No!

256
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,191
- I'm gonna throw you in!
- No!

257
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,238
Hey Franny, watch out
for the snapping turtles, okay?

258
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,740
All right? It's down my butt!
It's got my butt!

259
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,536
Didn't they say summer's officially over?

260
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
Our seasons play
by their own rules up here.

261
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,791
Who knows? It could snow tomorrow.

262
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,129
Well, I brought some lemonade
to help you guys cool off,

263
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,465
but it looks like you're way ahead of me.

264
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,342
You should come on in. The water's great.

265
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,926
Believe me,

266
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,680
it looks very tempting.

267
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,891
You know what they say about temptation.

268
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,227
Easiest way to kill it's just to give in.

269
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,107
So what does your uncle do?

270
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,568
He's a hearse driver.

271
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,237
I guess every town needs one of those.

272
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,574
Can I ask about your parents?

273
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,370
Um… both dead. Car accident.

274
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,457
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

275
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,712
Yeah, I mean, it was something.

276
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,089
It makes a kid grow up fast.

277
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,969
Cole's on good track for college, though.

278
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,930
And what about you?

279
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,682
Nah, that stuff's not really in my cards.

280
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,894
I mean, I did want to study music…

281
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,188
- Really? What instruments do you play?
- …but…

282
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,233
All kinds.
I... I have a beat-up guitar right now.

283
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,777
We have a piano at the house.
I just got it tuned.

284
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,239
It'd be nice to have someone
who can actually play it. I'm pathetic.

285
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,034
All right.
Well, thanks, Mrs. Claire.

286
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,495
- Catherine. Sorry.
- It's okay.

287
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,164
You'll get used to it.

288
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,668
Yeah. Please do not tell him I said that.

289
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,254
All right.

290
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,924
Okay, so,
the Hudson River School painters.

291
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,177
Landscapes as the realm of the soul.

292
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,473
If you keep reading around the subject,
you'll find it really rewarding. Really.

293
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,475
- Keep going, okay?
- Thank you so much.

294
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,768
- We will.
- Bye!

295
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,103
George Claire?

296
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,272
Yes. Hello. Can I help you?

297
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,567
Justine Sokolov.
Adjunct weaving instructor.

298
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,778
You play tennis with my husband Bram.

299
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,988
Bram?

300
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,783
Oh, Bram, of course. Yes.
He mentioned that his wife teaches here.

301
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:22,247
I hear you've developed a cult-like
following already in our department.

302
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,790
So I… Oh, this you?

303
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,585
I thought I'd invite you
and your wife over

304
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,628
and see what all the fuss is about.

305
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,422
Oh, uh…

306
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,634
That sounds really nice.

307
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:39,014
You know, it'd be nice for my wife to meet
a few more Saginaw folk, too, so yeah.

308
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,601
Excellent.
I have your number in the registry,

309
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,436
so I'll give the missus a call.

310
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,605
- Fantastic.
- George Claire.

311
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,065
Wow. You painted these?

312
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,860
Yeah, a long time ago.

313
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,654
I gave up the whole fine arts thing
to focus on theory.

314
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,615
Realized I wasn't really up to snuff.

315
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I disagree.

316
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,580
These are confidently executed,
and they are…

317
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
quite unique.

318
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,249
Thank you.

319
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,587
Uh, you should see my wife's stuff.
She's the real artist of the family.

320
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,047
Okay, I look forward to it.

321
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,591
I'll be in touch, George Claire.

322
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,602
What's wrong?

323
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,188
That smell. It's... it's getting stronger.

324
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,691
Yeah, I figured it out.
It's 'cause we're above the garage.

325
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,944
I'll get some fans
and air it out in the morning.

326
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,032
But why does it come and go?

327
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,284
Cath, please stop with the ghost stuff.

328
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,914
I'm not gonna let you
put a negative spin on this house.

329
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,451
Mommy, where are you?

330
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,994
Mommy, I'm scared, I'm scared!

331
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,871
- Mommy!
- Hey, hey! Shh.

332
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,415
- What happened?
- What is going on? Where were you?

333
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,668
- What happened? Tell me.
- I saw the lady, Mommy. I'm scared.

334
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,920
It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry.

335
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,632
- Mommy's here. You can sleep with us.
- Oh God. Cath, again?

336
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,137
If we filled out her sedative prescription
like the pediatrician said,

337
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,680
this wouldn't keep happening.

338
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,768
I said to you ten times I don't feel good
giving her unnecessary medications.

339
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,561
It's this house.

340
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,315
Oh God. You two sleep in there.
I'll take Franny's room.

341
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,027
Hey. Hey.

342
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,820
Daddy's mad at me.

343
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,572
No! No, no, no, he's not.

344
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,658
No, sweetheart. Not at you.

345
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,830
It's gotta feel good.

346
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,374
I guess, yeah.

347
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,632
Uh, guess who I ran into the other day?

348
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
Who?

349
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,928
Your boss, George Claire.

350
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,679
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

351
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,891
I haven't met the guy officially yet.

352
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,267
What's he like?

353
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,188
Dishonest.

354
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,606
Deceitful.

355
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,983
How would you know that?

356
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
Because I found him attractive.

357
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,919
Here we go!

358
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,672
Whee!

359
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,841
You wanna watch Eddie chop wood?

360
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,050
Yeah!

361
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,933
Chop.

362
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,643
Chop.

363
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,397
<i>Chop.</i>

364
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,507
"All of us on Earth are associated

365
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,552
with those in the spiritual world
who are like ourselves."

366
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,346
"We are, in a sense, united to them."

367
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,307
<i>United to them…</i>

368
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,380
What do you want?

369
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,416
What are you looking for here?

370
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,254
I… I don't really know.

371
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,682
You're a presumptuous fucker, aren't you?

372
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,217
If you're coming in,
shut the door behind you.

373
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,559
He's got a social life at that school,
and I'm isolated.

374
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,520
<i>Something's wrong.
I can hear it in your voice.</i>

375
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,730
I…

376
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,068
I'm starting… to see things.

377
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,613
And I'm scared to tell George about it.

378
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,159
<i>Catherine, have you been eating?</i>

379
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,412
<i>What's the church like up there?
Have you prayed on any of this?</i>

380
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,123
<i>Try to remember
how he did right by marrying...</i>

381
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:06,002
Oh, I gotta go. Thanks a lot
for the pep talk, Mom. I love you.

382
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,963
That was some run.

383
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,010
Yeah, I guess I went pretty far.
I don't know what came over me.

384
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,764
And then I-I got distracted
by these wildflowers.

385
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,227
Thanks, but now
you're going to be late for class.

386
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,688
Yeah, yeah, I know. I-I'd better hustle.

387
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,774
Whoo!

388
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,899
Look who's home.

389
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,944
Hey.

390
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,243
- What are you doing?
- One sec.

391
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,703
Mr. Claire, right?

392
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,748
It's nice to finally meet you. I'm Eddie.

393
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,168
- My brother and I are about to get...
- The Vayle boys, aren't you?

394
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,171
Not anymore, sir.

395
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,049
We go by Lucks now.
Took our uncle's last name.

396
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,553
Do me a favor. My… my wife
doesn't know that you lived here.

397
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,555
Uh, or what happened.

398
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,932
I think it would be better
if we kept it that way.

399
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,852
Uh, she's a nervous woman and, uh…

400
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,230
well, she wouldn't want you around
if she found out.

401
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,151
Sure, Mr. Claire.

402
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,363
My brother and I are only here
for honest work.

403
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,823
Thank you. I appreciate it.

404
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,119
It seems a…

405
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
little odd, no?

406
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,665
That you'd want to be here at all.

407
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,960
Taking care of this house
comes second nature to us.

408
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
Right.

409
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,466
Did you meet your husband in art school?

410
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,219
Yeah, we were undergrads together.

411
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,722
That's cool.

412
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,020
Were your parents
supportive of you studying music?

413
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,814
Yeah, my mom was the one who taught me.

414
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,652
But when my father found my application,
he, uh… he beat me with a two-by-four.

415
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,072
Are you serious?

416
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,156
Yeah.

417
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,452
Yeah, he actually
bloodied me up pretty good.

418
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,125
Well, if you decide
to reapply to music school,

419
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,086
I will personally write you
a check for your application.

420
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,548
Wow.

421
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,761
You really got me.

422
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,158
Hey, George.

423
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:28,496
Eddie... Eddie was just playing
his favorite Louis Armstrong song for me.

424
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,290
- Called... What's it called?
- "Someday You'll Be Sorry."

425
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,293
That's right.
That's the story of my life.

426
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,256
What a surprise.

427
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,676
Eddie was telling me earlier
how he was here for honest work.

428
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,262
I... I didn't realize that it included

429
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,845
entertainment.

430
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
We finished painting, sir,

431
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:52,061
and, uh, Mrs. Claire asked me
to play something before I left.

432
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,730
- So...
- Wait, Eddie, Eddie.

433
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,317
Come on, please. Don't stop on my account.

434
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,487
I've been called many things before,
but never a party pooper.

435
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,701
Well, the man of the house has spoken,

436
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,912
so finish the goddamn song, Eddie.

437
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,748
Yeah, please.

438
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,494
Shit.

439
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,780
Oh God.

440
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,921
<i>Catherine.</i>

441
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,523
What you do to me, you do not know.

442
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,401
My God.

443
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,488
I've never done
anything like this before, you know.

444
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,830
What's wrong?

445
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,461
What? I'm just talking.

446
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,256
- Sharing.
- What the fuck is wrong with me?

447
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,509
- Why do I keep doing this?
- Hey, Willis, I'm being serious.

448
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,678
It'd be nice to know you a bit better.

449
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,598
Some ordinary, regular things.

450
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,475
That's not what this is about.

451
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,685
Ow! What the hell?

452
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,563
You think because I fuck you,
I'm fooled by you?

453
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,857
I've been around guys like you
my whole life.

454
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,111
- What the hell are you talking about?
- My dad made a fortune defending them.

455
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,989
Thieves, con men, psychopaths.

456
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,368
And they all got off because
that's the way the world works for men.

457
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,705
Okay, look, I see that you have
some pretty awful ideas about men.

458
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,041
I have awful ideas about everything.

459
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,667
Now get the fuck up.

460
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,878
- Come on, Willis.
- No.

461
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,089
I'm done with this.

462
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,216
Willis!

463
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,425
Willis!

464
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
Willis!

465
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,746
- Hi!
- Trick or treat?

466
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,791
- Come in, come in.
- Hello, I'm Catherine.

467
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,335
- Oh, of course you are. Mmm.
- Oh.

468
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,087
George, hi.

469
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,922
- Hi. For you.
- Oh, thank you.

470
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,341
Bram, where are you?
The Claires have arrived.

471
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,676
- Wow.
- I'm here.

472
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,760
Amazing.

473
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,095
- Thanks.
- Hello.

474
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,555
- I'm Catherine.
- Hey, Bram.

475
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,848
- Thanks for having us.
- Look what they brought us.

476
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,684
- Thank you. How are you?
- Very well.

477
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,018
- Come on in.
- Beautiful.

478
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,728
- Thank you.
- I love your artwork.

479
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,315
Ah. Well, yes. We're just enjoying
our tenure here while it lasts.

480
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,067
- Oh, do you rent?
- No, no, no.

481
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,279
He just means
how these old Hudson Valley homes are.

482
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,573
We think we own them,
we're just caretakers.

483
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,324
They outlive us all.

484
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,160
My wife thinks ours is haunted.

485
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,121
Well, she's probably right.

486
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,581
They're all haunted a bit.

487
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,125
After all,
we're in Headless Horseman country.

488
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,835
Let me take your coats.

489
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,755
Oh, actually, we should go outside
and look at the alpacas before they nap.

490
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,841
- Oh, yes.
- This way.

491
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,884
- You'll love it.
- Alpacas nap?

492
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,346
Tell me, Bram.

493
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,724
Where does one buy
such quality weed up here?

494
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,101
- Buy? I grow it.
- Nice.

495
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,480
You know, I came up here
to write the Great American Novel, but…

496
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,693
I spend most of my time
tending to my garden, if you get my drift.

497
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,611
Mm-hmm.

498
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,613
I love your setup. It's amazing.

499
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,157
- Aww, thank you.
- And your work is so unique.

500
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,993
Thanks. It's gonna sound a little strange,

501
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,580
but it's a spiritual thing for me,
weaving.

502
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,542
I tap into something cosmic
when I'm working.

503
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,336
- Its patterns, you know?
- Yeah.

504
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,880
Sometimes I feel guilty
taking credit for it.

505
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,757
Why? You shouldn't.

506
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,468
I would love for you
to make something for my Franny.

507
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,638
- I'd pay you, naturally.
- Don't be silly. I'll do it for cost.

508
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,516
Oh, actually, George already asked
for a scarf for his mother,

509
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,477
so I'll just add it to that order.

510
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,686
Okay.

511
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,770
Wow.

512
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,941
- You guys just have the one child?
- Yeah. Yes.

513
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,445
She's four. And you and Bram?
Do you guys have kids?

514
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,446
No.

515
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,282
No.

516
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,204
Bram and I were conflicted
about that for a while,

517
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,874
and then Mother Nature
made the final decision.

518
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,626
And she made the right one.

519
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,128
It all worked out perfectly.

520
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,008
I was conflicted, too,
but just like that, it…

521
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,177
It happened.

522
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,681
And then we got married,
which I was also conflicted about.

523
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,143
I guess you could say
I'm a conflicted Catholic girl at heart,

524
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,771
dutifully going through the motions.

525
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,940
You know,

526
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,150
the first few years of our marriage

527
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,988
were a complete blur
because of the baby and school.

528
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,951
We're really still trying
to catch our breath up here.

529
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,916
You know, I attend this women's group.

530
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,085
It's an Arts Club… thing.

531
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,129
We meet once a month up in Albany,

532
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,425
and there are so many
creative ladies to meet, Catherine.

533
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,885
I think you should come with me.

534
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,763
I would love something like that.

535
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,306
I don't know anybody up here.

536
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,016
Well, you do now.

537
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,023
It must be so nice

538
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,317
to inherit a fortune

539
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,529
and then spend all day not writing a book.

540
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,409
I really like them, especially her.
She's so interesting.

541
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,581
She's so free with herself and her body.

542
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,001
She can certainly put away some lasagna.

543
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,963
- That's a nasty thing to say.
- Come on, I'm kidding.

544
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,381
I like them, too.

545
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,343
I especially like…

546
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,555
…Bram's weed.

547
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,098
Mmm.

548
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,934
Are you sure you're okay to drive
after smoking so much?

549
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,018
Yeah.

550
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,980
- I'm fine. I'm more than okay.
- Really?

551
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,401
Watch this.

552
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,236
George, slow down.

553
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,821
- Slow down, George.
- Really?

554
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,448
- Really?
- George, slow down!

555
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,824
Slow down!

556
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,494
- Stop, George!
- Whoo!

557
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,581
God, what the hell are you doing?

558
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,375
What? What, I'm just having a little fun.

559
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,920
You remember what that was like,
Cath, huh?

560
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,506
- That's not funny!
- Come on.

561
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,759
Oh, come on, Cath. Cath!

562
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,221
Catherine!

563
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,225
Cath, where are you going?
Come on, get back in the car.

564
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,101
- Cath!
- Get your hands off me!

565
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,270
God, we are two smart people.

566
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,439
- We should've known better.
- Known what?

567
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,026
That I'm only here
for the imaginary book jacket bio

568
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,070
that you have in your fucking head.

569
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,990
The... the... the professor
with the wife and the country home.

570
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,742
I gave up everything for you!

571
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,369
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

572
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,746
I'm so sorry
I fucked up both of our lives!

573
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,916
And the worst part is this is all I have.

574
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,836
Cath, you know what you do have?
Is the crying drunks.

575
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,797
You are a person
who should not drink alcohol,

576
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,383
especially when you do not
fucking eat anything!

577
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:28,011
Oh my God. I am so sick
of everybody blaming everything

578
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,806
in my fucking life on me not eating!

579
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,225
Please, get back in the goddamn car!

580
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,102
- Get off of me!
- Ow!

581
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,395
Fuck!

582
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,438
Oh my God. Cath?

583
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,483
Oh my God. Cath…

584
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,735
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Was that…

585
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,903
Did I… Did I…

586
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,078
Cath?

587
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,833
Cath, are you okay?

588
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,726
Come on, Cole. Get up.
I'll drive you home.

589
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,627
Hey, Cath?

590
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,672
I didn't mean to hurt you.

591
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,554
I would never hurt you.

592
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,559
But I also…

593
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,230
I have not been sensitive
to your needs for some time.

594
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,109
And for that, I owe you an apology.

595
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,862
More than an apology.

596
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,574
One thing I do know…

597
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,119
…is I love you.

598
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,873
What was that?

599
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,333
Oh God. Jesus. What?

600
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,961
It's okay, baby.

601
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,047
Nothing happened. It's okay. It's okay.

602
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,816
"We look at each other,
and we are not ashamed."

603
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,320
"I wearing the face
of the proper marriage,

604
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,032
you the face of the independent woman."

605
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,412
"We cleaved to each other
across that space."

606
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,636
You're back later than I thought.

607
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,720
Am I?

608
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,015
The fridge is empty.

609
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,727
I can go out, pick up some food for us.

610
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,440
- What do you feel like?
- I, uh… I ate with Justine.

611
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,015
Brilliant setting
for a faculty meeting, Floyd.

612
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,186
Yes. I take her out alone a lot,
which would seem selfish.

613
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,982
I used to sail a bit myself.
Grew up on the Connecticut coast.

614
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,777
Oh, that's right.
Do your family own a boat?

615
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,238
I inherited my cousin's. The Lost Horizon.

616
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,322
Ah.

617
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,701
He actually drowned while sailing it.

618
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,286
Oh, how sad.

619
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,370
Yeah.

620
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,664
Only 19.

621
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,084
- Mm.
- Already so sophisticated.

622
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,795
I remember when he died.

623
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:35,175
I stole his diary after the funeral.
Read it repeatedly.

624
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,221
I know it's... it's an awful thing to do,

625
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,474
but I… I think I needed some sort of…

626
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,642
connection.

627
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,853
Did you learn anything from it?

628
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,439
Yeah, a little.

629
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,484
He was gay, unhappy.

630
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,903
Typical tortured artist.

631
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,405
And then all that angst

632
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,826
one unfortunate moment vanishes forever.

633
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,914
We're all so inconsequential, Floyd.

634
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,502
Swedenborg would suggest otherwise.

635
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,922
He'd say death is only the beginning.

636
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,259
Have you read the book yet?

637
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,012
<i>It's on the top of my list.</i>

638
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,229
- Come, come in.
- Ahh.

639
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,564
Cath?

640
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,982
Let me get that.

641
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,776
Hello.

642
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,988
Oh, Catherine, this is Floyd DeBeers,
head of our department.

643
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,323
He also took me
on this magnificent boat ride.

644
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,741
So good to meet you.

645
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,412
So, in return, I invited him to our house,
a very unfair trade.

646
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,331
- I've heard wonderful things about you.
- As I have you.

647
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,294
George, is this some kind of setup?

648
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,504
What?

649
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:59,176
I... I swear to God,
I didn't even tell her you were coming.

650
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,179
You see, George? You see?
There are no coincidences.

651
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,849
I'm sorry. I... I was taken by the artwork
and just started reading it.

652
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,601
Nothing to be sorry for.

653
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,645
You do know what this is, don't you?
The cover art?

654
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,233
It's a soul
transitioning into the afterlife.

655
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,484
Really?

656
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,570
The painter followed Swedenborg,

657
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,449
so he believed that death
is parallel to birth, but divine.

658
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,659
Floyd, believe me.

659
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:29,247
You do not want to get
my wife started on all that, uh, stuff.

660
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,168
Uh, Cath, please show Floyd around.

661
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,253
Um, I'm gonna fix us some cocktails.

662
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,006
May I show you around?

663
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,257
- I can't wait.
- Great.

664
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,470
My daughter's asleep already,

665
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,764
but you can... we can peek in her room.

666
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,808
We actually have four bedrooms,
but we only use two of them.

667
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,269
A young couple can't have too many bed...

668
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,190
You okay?

669
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,858
Shh.

670
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,654
We're not alone, are we?

671
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,115
What do you mean?

672
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,827
She doesn't mean any harm.

673
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,664
She has reasons for lingering.

674
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,379
I've seen her, and so has my daughter.

675
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,465
Because she's here for you.

676
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,009
She wants you to know that.

677
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,513
At first, I was terrified,

678
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,223
of course, but now…

679
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,561
every time I sense her, I... I feel…

680
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,648
comfort.

681
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:40,610
- I know that doesn't make any sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

682
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,492
Her name is Smit, wife of Jacob Smit.

683
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,578
He was a… um, a local minister.

684
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,291
They built this house,
and that's all I can find at the library.

685
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,584
Let me do some digging on campus.

686
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,837
You can't tell George
because he can't know.

687
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,171
He thinks that I'm crazy.

688
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,007
No, of course not.

689
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,967
He's just afraid, you know.

690
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,428
Men at his stage of life often are.

691
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,347
But try and be patient, Catherine.

692
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,392
With love,
he can catch up to you spiritually.

693
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,186
And let us…

694
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,897
Let us hold a séance here.

695
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,067
- With or without George.
- Really?

696
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,112
We can find out
a little more about your housemate.

697
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,323
Bye, Floyd.

698
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,743
Good night, good night,
and thanks for a wonderful evening.

699
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,453
Drive safe.

700
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,209
My God, Cath, he absolutely adored you.

701
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,963
I... I have never seen Floyd
light up like that around anyone.

702
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,010
And you were up there awhile.
Did he say anything?

703
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,596
About what?

704
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,389
About me?

705
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,183
Oh.

706
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,937
He said that you were
an exceptional professor.

707
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,401
And you are an exceptional wife,

708
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,528
which means the world to me.

709
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,327
Ah! I feel like having company
was good for us.

710
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,995
Yeah? We need this.

711
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,000
I, uh…
I want to invite my whole department over.

712
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,960
A... a real party. What do you think?

713
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,801
I think we owe it to Franny
to make this place a happy home.

714
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,598
I'm not against it. I just think
that we need to then also invite

715
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,683
the locals and our neighbors.

716
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,856
Neighbors? Really?

717
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,985
I need to feel like I'm in this community,
George, not just <i>your</i> community.

718
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,490
Okay, let's do it.

719
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,496
Please tell me again
why I'm carrying a Bundt cake.

720
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,416
We're no good at parties.

721
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,875
Speak for yourself.

722
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,254
I am. Nobody wants the sheriff around
when they're drunk.

723
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,344
Uh, more wine?

724
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,933
Hi. Wine?

725
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,977
A little. Just… just…

726
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,229
Oh! Okay, good.

727
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,107
She's a friend of Bram's.

728
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,401
She's also writing.

729
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:31,614
They both have been writing novels… Sorry.
They both have been writing novels.

730
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,908
I first wore glasses when I was 13.

731
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,369
Oh, thank you. Thank you, young man.

732
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,372
Yes. You've done a lot with this place.

733
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,840
I want you to meet my wife Millicent,
the love of my life.

734
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,592
It's incredibly nice to meet you.

735
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,595
I hear we might have
a session in your home.

736
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,180
Yeah, soon, I hope. Thank you.

737
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,057
George? Travis, Mare's husband.

738
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,727
- A pleasure to meet you.
- This is her best cake.

739
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,187
Oh, wow.

740
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,397
Thank you. We'll put it right here.

741
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,941
Travis? Come here.
You've got to hear this.

742
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,025
Yes, dear.

743
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,863
Hm. I almost baked a cake.

744
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,868
Bram insisted there was something
you might appreciate… even more.

745
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,412
Oh…

746
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,664
Oh, fantastic.

747
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,791
Um, shall we?

748
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,585
- Yeah. Why not?
- Why not?

749
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,047
- This place looks marvelous, Catherine.
- Thank you.

750
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,090
Absolutely transformed.

751
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,719
Well, a little paint
goes a really long way.

752
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,349
And it does my heart good
to see Eddie and Cole here.

753
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,685
- You're a saint for having them back.
- What do you mean?

754
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,104
Well, they grew up here.

755
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,068
You... you knew that, didn't you?

756
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,738
I-I-It's just that

757
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:57,951
I told George the whole story
when I first showed him the house and...

758
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,536
What story?

759
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,873
I suppose he... he didn't wanna upset you.

760
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:08,169
- I... I'm going to go find Travis.
- No, no, no. What story, Mare?

761
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,424
He didn't tell you anything
about their parents?

762
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,342
Hm-mm.

763
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:18,054
Well… it's just that…

764
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,142
Dear Ella, she was a friend of mine,
you know, and… and…

765
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:27,355
Sometimes, I can't help
but believe that she…

766
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,399
She's free now.

767
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,151
And... and I know he struggled financially,

768
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:36,864
but that horrible man was cruel in...
in ways that you could never know.

769
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,074
What happened to them?

770
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,203
Catherine, it's not the time.
I don't want to ruin your party.

771
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,287
No, no.

772
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,708
Mare, I'm begging you.
I need to know this.

773
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,752
All right.

774
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,298
The way I… I heard it

775
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,549
was that…

776
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,802
Calvin Vayle

777
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,887
slipped Ella and the boys

778
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,639
a sedative one night.

779
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,723
And…

780
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,851
when they were out cold, he…

781
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,480
He went outside and shot
every one of the cows they owned.

782
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,732
Oh my God.

783
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:16,529
And then, when he was finished,
he went into the garage below their…

784
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,656
bedroom,

785
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,410
started the ignition of two trucks
and closed the windows.

786
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,037
The fumes.

787
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,788
Then he went up and…

788
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,375
laid down in bed with Ella until...

789
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,045
- Oh my God, I was wrong.
- They never woke up.

790
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,588
I had the wrong wife.

791
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,505
I...

792
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,800
- Wrong about what?
- Your friend Ella. She's here, Mare.

793
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,886
Oh my God. Where did you get this?

794
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,804
Wh-what are you doing with this?

795
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,348
She never took this ring off.

796
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,265
You know what?

797
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,269
I've been in this house for three months,
and nobody has said anything to me.

798
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,648
Not the mailman,
not a neighbor, not... not the bank teller.

799
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,650
God, I'm such a fool!

800
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,485
No, no, it's not like that.

801
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,446
- Oh my God!
- Catherine, we're from farm stock up here.

802
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:02,533
It's... it's not our way to get involved
with people's personal business.

803
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,411
You've made this home
so warm and inviting,

804
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,915
and everyone's moved on so well.
I'm sure that George didn't mean...

805
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,376
Do not waste any of your time
on George, Mare.

806
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,798
George Claire always gets
exactly what he wants.

807
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,970
Justine, tell me something
about you I don't know.

808
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:27,266
You don't know anything about me.

809
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,727
I do.

810
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,439
I know you're a weaver

811
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,400
of fabrics.

812
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,526
Huh?

813
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,571
And ideas.

814
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,450
Like the ideas you've been putting
in my wife's head lately.

815
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,619
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

816
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,912
Mm.

817
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,831
Okay.

818
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,626
Here's something about me you don't know.

819
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,463
I get suspicious

820
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,550
when students worship their professors.

821
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,927
Always leads to trouble.

822
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,472
Is that a dig or advice?

823
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,226
Oh, it's just honesty.
You know, like the Good Book says.

824
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,520
"The truth will set you free."

825
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,398
I don't know about that.

826
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,358
People really don't want the truth,

827
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,819
and they certainly
don't want to be set free.

828
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,113
What? Says who?

829
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,073
The Eagles, remember?

830
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,825
"Hotel California."

831
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,454
Yeah. We, uh...
we all choose our own prison.

832
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,790
Here, give me your hands.

833
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,169
I'll show you why they're right.
Here.

834
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,504
- You're going to read my palms now?
- Come on.

835
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,264
Okay.

836
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:50,725
Now,

837
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,644
try to get yourself free.

838
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,118
Okay, that's enough.
You can let go now, George.

839
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,997
Yeah, I know I can,
but are you sure you really want me to?

840
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,875
- I'm very sure.
- Oh.

841
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,132
George, you... you are hurting me now.

842
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,216
Let go!

843
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,554
W-what?

844
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,433
Jesus Christ, George.

845
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,146
Hotel California, Justine.

846
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,024
Hotel California!

847
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,612
Good night.

848
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,030
Drive safe.

849
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,244
Whoo!

850
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:53,913
Well,

851
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,124
that was a success, huh?

852
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,051
Your friend Justine
is a bit of a head case.

853
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,554
Is she trying to start
some trouble or something?

854
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,931
No, I didn't see Justine all night,

855
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,642
but it's interesting that you ask.

856
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,774
Know what's interesting to me?

857
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,071
Is that this party was supposed
to bring you and me together,

858
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,448
and as soon as everyone leaves,

859
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,409
you retreat and ice up.

860
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,830
How could you not tell me
about this house, George?

861
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,834
Jesus.

862
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,965
I was afraid this might happen.

863
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,301
That one of your lies would be exposed?

864
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,431
I wasn't lying to you, Cath. I was trying
to spare you some unpleasantness.

865
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:58,144
I can handle unpleasantness, George, okay?
I lived through childbirth, remember?

866
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,229
I was trying to protect you.

867
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:04,150
Believe... believe it or not,
I-I actually wanted you to be happy here.

868
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,118
What the fuck is that?

869
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,790
Fucking electricity in this house!

870
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,422
What the…

871
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,638
The fuck is going on?

872
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,274
Franny's overdue
for a visit with your parents.

873
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,401
You can finish off the weekend there.

874
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,421
<i>Floyd, it's Catherine.</i>

875
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,966
<i>I'm ready.</i>

876
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:14,553
This is her. This is Ella Vayle,

877
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,226
and this is the article
I found about her death.

878
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,312
But she's trying to…

879
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,065
She's reaching out to me,
and I-I need to know why.

880
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,069
You're saying the spirit
is the most recent resident of your house?

881
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,071
Yes. I was confused before.

882
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:36,659
Well, my research turned up something
interesting about the original owners,

883
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,245
especially for our group here.

884
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,539
What? The Smits?

885
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,125
Reverend Smit's wife

886
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,169
was an early devotee of Swedenborg.

887
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,507
Unfortunately,
it was not a happy marriage.

888
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,301
Smit was a strict Calvinist

889
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:58,139
who strongly disapproved
of his wife's philosophic exploration.

890
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,056
"Damned."

891
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,100
She died in their home

892
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,603
rather mysteriously at age 26.

893
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,981
So much death in my house.

894
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,859
Oh, no, no. Don't think of it that way.

895
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:13,696
We embrace inhabited houses as a blessing.

896
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,657
- Mm.
- Portals between two realms

897
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:20,369
with guides to shepherd us
once our own time comes.

898
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,705
Some religions call them guardian angels.

899
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:26,000
Perhaps it's our Swedenborgian friend
who first opened the portal door.

900
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,293
We are good at that.

901
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:33,007
Because it's the afterlife
where we reach our greatest purpose.

902
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,886
You never see these spirits
as potentially evil?

903
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:41,140
An evil spirit
will only commune with an evil-doer.

904
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,976
Which we will take,
on a leap of faith, that you're not.

905
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,312
And remember.

906
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,315
Evil only thrives
in the house where it is welcome.

907
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,817
- Mm.
- Goodness always triumphs.

908
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,779
Always.
If not in this world, then in the next.

909
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,989
We should start,

910
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,073
yes?

911
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,327
Let whomever the spirit is

912
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,371
speak for herself.

913
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,637
<i>As evil comes to light,</i>

914
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,597
<i>beware!</i>

915
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:08,435
She's making her presence known.
We welcome her, don't we, Catherine?

916
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,312
We do. We… I... I do.

917
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,773
<i>Get back here!</i>

918
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,626
- <i>No!
- Ella.</i>

919
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,380
- What happened?
- She wants to break through.

920
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,321
She's trying.

921
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,949
But something, someone is stopping her.

922
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,910
<i>You're suffocating me!</i>

923
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,375
What was that? Oh my God.

924
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,142
I'm afraid this home has another spirit.

925
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,730
<i>And until that spirit reveals its nature,</i>

926
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:57,193
<i>be careful of those around you, Catherine.</i>

927
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,656
- Mama, Mama!
- Hi, baby.

928
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,451
Come here. Did you have fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's house?

929
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,454
- Yeah.
- Did you look for seashells on the beach?

930
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,748
- Mm-hmm.
- Really? Are they pretty?

931
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:11,707
Yeah!

932
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,500
Keep moving, everyone. Hustle.

933
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,670
We don't wanna get caught in traffic
on the way into the city.

934
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,422
Nearly there, nearly full.

935
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,508
Tommy, good. Thank you for com...

936
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,345
- Justine.
- George.

937
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,514
I, uh, I didn't know you were joining us.

938
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,017
Floyd wanted an additional chaperone.

939
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,479
I'm here!

940
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,565
Right, Katie. You're the last.

941
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,737
Where are we going?

942
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,573
Get in the car, baby.
I'll be there in a sec.

943
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,203
Eddie!

944
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,164
There's something
I have to give you that I, uh…

945
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:56,669
found in the house a while back
before I learned the truth.

946
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,092
It's a little bit tight on me.

947
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,637
- Just leave it.
- No, no, it belongs to you and Cole.

948
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,639
She would want you to have this.

949
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:10,432
I don't want it.

950
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,812
I noticed it on you a couple weeks ago.

951
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,189
Um…

952
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,192
It just seemed right.

953
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,239
You and Mom would have liked each other.

954
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,593
Three on the bottom are on time.

955
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:50,431
I found that overdue one
in my husband's car, I can pay the fine.

956
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,558
It's just on his card.

957
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,728
Actually, this one's checked out
under the name Willis Howell.

958
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,939
Oh, that's odd.

959
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,443
It's unisex, you know?

960
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:04,653
Excuse me?

961
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,780
The name, Willis.

962
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,741
She's a pretty thing.

963
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,951
In here a lot on weekends.

964
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,161
Daddy's friend.

965
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,499
Don't worry. I'll ask her to pay the fine.

966
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,379
I'd like to open a new account.

967
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,049
Of course, Mrs. Claire.

968
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,260
Uh, just… just fill out, um,

969
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,553
this form.

970
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,976
Uh, we will require George's signature
if it's a joint account.

971
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,060
It's not.

972
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,781
Okay, everyone. Here we are.

973
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,798
George Claire?

974
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,050
Good God.

975
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,762
Dr. Warren. Wow.

976
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,180
What an odd coincidence.

977
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,431
Odd indeed.

978
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,393
I was told
that you had moved away for good.

979
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,688
Well, I, you know, couldn't resist
coming back for this exhibit.

980
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,024
You might remember my passion
for Thomas Cole.

981
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:28,320
Yes, I do. I just wish you had shown
the same passion for your dissertation.

982
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:32,699
Excuse me. Professor Claire, um,

983
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:36,412
in the third <i>Voyage of Life</i> painting,
why is the sailor so distraught?

984
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:40,457
Oh, the third one is called, uh, <i>Manhood</i>.

985
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:45,129
Uh, it's when Cole believes
we, uh, we lose the confidence of youth.

986
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:49,091
Uh, go... go check out the sailor's hands.
They're no longer on the tiller.

987
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,680
Thanks, Professor Claire.

988
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,725
Yeah… You know, I'm curious. Um…

989
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:02,980
How did you get a teaching position
without a recommendation?

990
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,275
Oh, I'm, um, I'm just a temp instructor.

991
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,361
Um, one of the professors
took an emergency leave, and I, uh…

992
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,864
I just stepped in to help.

993
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,784
Interesting, then, how the students,
uh, they call you professor.

994
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,579
Yeah, yeah.

995
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,206
Uh, yeah, right. I keep correcting them.

996
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,877
Yeah. I get so tired of correcting them.

997
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,006
Good day, Claire.

998
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,427
What…

999
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:36,722
What was all that about?

1000
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,267
Uh, yeah, I have no idea.

1001
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,189
I kind of think you do.

1002
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,495
I don't think
you should see Justine anymore.

1003
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:07,586
There's a lot of talk about her
at Saginaw.

1004
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,590
What kind of talk, George?

1005
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,302
Well, they say she's a closet lesbian.

1006
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,347
And she's clearly obsessed with you.

1007
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,352
I think she is…

1008
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,065
instigating problems between us
intentionally.

1009
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,535
Floyd, heading home for the holiday?

1010
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,953
What?

1011
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:44,498
Oh, no, no. Not for a while yet.
I-I still have, uh…

1012
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:46,833
- I have work to finish.
- Is something wrong?

1013
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,629
Actually,

1014
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,716
I got a call this morning
from Shelby Warren,

1015
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,010
your advisor from Columbia.

1016
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,094
Oh?

1017
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:03,100
His recommendation letter,
the one submitted with your application,

1018
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,686
he claims he never wrote it.

1019
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,649
Shelby's recollection is
that you asked him,

1020
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,985
but he told you he couldn't do it.

1021
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,821
In good conscience.
I remember the conversation well.

1022
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:19,157
- You forged it, didn't you?
- No. I… I…

1023
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,075
Oh…

1024
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,120
Floyd, I wrote the letter that I deserved.

1025
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,915
I... I... You need to understand why.

1026
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,962
As you know,
I'm quite fond of you, George,

1027
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:36,550
and you're popular with your students,
but this is a serious accusation.

1028
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:39,261
Can't we put a pin in this
until after the holiday?

1029
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,971
- Oh…
- Please, please, Floyd.

1030
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,766
I... I understand your dilemma. I do.

1031
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:50,063
Floyd, I...
I have my entire family up here.

1032
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,899
I'm supposed to be home in an hour.

1033
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:57,154
I... I really deserve the chance
to sit down and be heard.

1034
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,448
Man to man, huh?

1035
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,825
Friend to friend.

1036
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,662
I'll schedule an appointment.

1037
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:17,549
I know you all think that Audrey
is a quite calm, conservative soul,

1038
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,594
but back in the day,
she was absolutely wild.

1039
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,513
- Don't believe a word!
- And then George came along.

1040
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:25,682
And he was always getting into trouble,

1041
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,934
which is why I went gray by 30.

1042
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,018
Oh, stop!

1043
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:33,231
But the real troublemaker
was this cousin that George idolized.

1044
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,192
Turned out to be a first-class homo.

1045
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:39,696
I don't know what was worse for
his parents: that he drowned or was gay.

1046
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,410
That is a truly repugnant thing to say.

1047
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,247
She's right, Tom.

1048
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,876
Henry's death was a family tragedy.

1049
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,796
He was such a talented young man.

1050
01:17:55,879 --> 01:18:00,550
Henry used to do these exquisite
watercolors. Teeny-tiny paintings.

1051
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,595
What were the… the paintings of?

1052
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:07,391
Oh, the shoreline, ospreys, lighthouses.

1053
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,267
Just common seaside things.

1054
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,687
Turkey time, everybody.

1055
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,232
It's the way he presented them
that was unique.

1056
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:19,653
They even wanted to do a showing
of his work after he passed, but…

1057
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,865
they all just disappeared, apparently.

1058
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,326
- What a shame.
- It really was.

1059
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,870
- Nice job on the turkey, George.
- Thank you.

1060
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,622
Please, eat. It's gonna get cold.

1061
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,423
Uh…

1062
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,551
Could you excuse me one minute?

1063
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,316
So you're starting with all this again?

1064
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,153
I happen to be sick, George.

1065
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,864
Throwing up my marriage.

1066
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,075
Now leave me the fuck alone!

1067
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,663
Catherine…

1068
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,749
What the fuck?

1069
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,589
Cath? Catherine?

1070
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,386
George?

1071
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,944
<i>Please.</i>

1072
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,409
<i>Please.</i>

1073
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,582
<i>No one understands us.</i>

1074
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,212
<i>I am here for you.</i>

1075
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,467
<i>We are your friend.</i>

1076
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:07,886
<i>George.</i>

1077
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:11,306
<i>Free yourself.</i>

1078
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,458
How was your holiday?

1079
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,908
Hello, Floyd.

1080
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,910
George.

1081
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,872
I didn't expect to see you till tomorrow.

1082
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:20,208
Taking advantage
of the warm spell we're having, huh?

1083
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:24,462
Yeah, I thought I'd go out one last time
before storing her for winter.

1084
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,048
You're so lucky to have her.

1085
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,719
That last spin you took me on,
it…

1086
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,889
…it really reminded me
how much I... I miss sailing.

1087
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,015
Especially when…

1088
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:38,977
when I'm feeling a little… a little low.

1089
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:41,980
You want to join me?

1090
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,857
Oh, no. I... I…

1091
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,735
- I don't want to in... intrude.
<i>- </i>It's fine.

1092
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,239
The river's as good a place as any
to have our talk.

1093
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,127
Hey.

1094
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,468
What's the matter? Are you okay?

1095
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:21,727
Things…

1096
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:26,274
just aren't great.

1097
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:33,156
It's him,

1098
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,740
isn't it?

1099
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,746
I know his kind all too well.

1100
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:43,625
I grew up with it.

1101
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,464
If I had someone as good as you,
I'd kiss the fucking ground she walked on.

1102
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:50,965
I swear to God.

1103
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,797
I'm eager to tell you the truth

1104
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,258
about the…

1105
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,178
problems I had at Columbia with…
with Shelby.

1106
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:40,849
Look, it's a complicated story, but, um…

1107
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:42,851
essentially,

1108
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,687
I got ostracized…

1109
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:48,815
for reporting misconduct.

1110
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,318
It was… it was sexual misconduct.

1111
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:57,741
Look, I'm willing to listen,
because I... I care about your well-being,

1112
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,700
but forgery,

1113
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,452
regardless of the reason,

1114
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:02,370
is a crime.

1115
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:06,041
I don't want us meeting
on false pretenses here.

1116
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,045
I can't keep this to myself forever.

1117
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,965
Yeah, I-I understand that,
and-and, look, I appreciate your dilemma...

1118
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,049
So…

1119
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,596
So tomorrow, I plan
to bring the situation to HR.

1120
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,433
And we both know the outcome.

1121
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,896
They won't permit you to remain on staff.

1122
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,612
You okay, George?

1123
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:41,576
There, there.

1124
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,537
All things must pass.

1125
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:47,373
Yeah.

1126
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,543
I promise you'll get through this.

1127
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,425
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey.

1128
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,886
I called in a take-out order.

1129
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:01,054
Be right back.

1130
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,903
Excuse me.
Sorry, I just wonder…

1131
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,738
Where did you buy that scarf?

1132
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,281
Oh, um…

1133
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,911
It was a gift.

1134
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:26,787
Oh.

1135
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,207
There you go, $6.57.

1136
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,084
Thanks. Just two back, please.

1137
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:56,401
You're putting in late nights too,
huh, George?

1138
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:03,908
Jesus.

1139
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,660
Look...

1140
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,412
You're soaking wet.

1141
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,789
What... what the fuck, Justine?

1142
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,834
Are you officially stalking me now?

1143
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,460
Officially? No.

1144
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,547
Then why are you suddenly
everywhere I turn?

1145
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,717
Because I really care about Catherine.

1146
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:23,720
Yeah, you've made that perfectly clear.

1147
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,932
Uh, I'm not sure how to take that.

1148
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,143
I... I kind of think that you do.

1149
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:35,190
Tell me, George,
how'd your mom like that scarf I made her?

1150
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:38,943
Uh, yeah, she…

1151
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,446
She didn't really care for it, actually.

1152
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:44,324
She… she said that it felt cheap.

1153
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:47,952
Well, that explains
the neck it ended up on, then, huh?

1154
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,122
Go fuck yourself.

1155
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,000
Do you want to explain
what happened at the Met?

1156
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:02,300
If you got something to say to me,
Justine, you should just spit it out.

1157
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:07,722
I will.

1158
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:16,189
<i>Government said there was no way</i>

1159
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:19,150
<i>they would meet the new demands
for the hostages' release.</i>

1160
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,862
<i>Then it accused the Iranians
of not taking good care of the hostages.</i>

1161
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,699
<i>The Carter Administration
stepped up its pressure</i>

1162
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,953
<i>on the Iranian government
by charging the hostages…</i>

1163
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,344
Oh my God.

1164
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,429
What are you doing?

1165
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,938
Fucking psycho!

1166
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,339
What happened to your clothes?

1167
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,843
I got sick on them.

1168
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:33,182
You and I need to talk.

1169
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:35,476
Not tonight, we don't.

1170
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,270
And why is that?

1171
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,689
Did you not hear me? I said I got sick.

1172
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,194
Sleep down here, then.
I don't wanna catch anything you have.

1173
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,374
If you're really here,

1174
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:01,544
<i>show me a sign.</i>

1175
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,975
Oh my God!

1176
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:19,729
What the fuck is going…

1177
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,330
Have your boyfriend
fix the window in the morning.

1178
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:26,671
<i>Cole.</i>

1179
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,214
Hey, it's George Claire.

1180
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,509
Uh, I have an emergency this morning.

1181
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,679
I was wondering if we could get you here
a little bit early.

1182
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,264
Can I help you?

1183
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:39,183
Oh, uh, I need this filled quickly.

1184
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:42,854
It's for my daughter's night terrors.

1185
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,118
They say she might never come out of this.

1186
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,954
The doctor never met Justine.

1187
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,623
He doesn't know
the force of her personality, Bram.

1188
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:11,299
<i>…Department of Agriculture.
The announcement comes tomorrow.</i>

1189
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:15,344
<i>In other news, police have identified
the body pulled from the Hudson last night</i>

1190
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:19,056
<i>as 68-year-old Saginaw professor
Floyd DeBeers,</i>

1191
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,642
<i>a frequent fixture
of the Hudson sailing community.</i>

1192
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:23,977
What?

1193
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:28,483
Yeah, I guess he went out
for a sail yesterday and…

1194
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,820
They assumed he had a heart attack
and fell overboard.

1195
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,573
Oh… oh my God.

1196
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:39,785
Jesus.

1197
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:40,869
Yeah.

1198
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:44,999
I know you two became very close
very quickly,

1199
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,961
so I-I'll keep you posted
on the memorial service.

1200
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,087
Yeah.

1201
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:57,345
And…

1202
01:31:57,428 --> 01:32:00,431
we're going to be needing
an interim chair.

1203
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,849
Your name came up,

1204
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,309
if you'd be willing.

1205
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,436
Um…

1206
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:08,105
Oh God, um…

1207
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,193
Yeah, yeah.

1208
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:15,655
Whatever the department needs.

1209
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,250
I have some very sad news to report.

1210
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,128
Some of you may have already heard.

1211
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:42,348
Wait. Why... why is this up?

1212
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,226
I-I didn't choose this slide.

1213
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:13,004
What is this?

1214
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:17,258
Huh? Who did this?

1215
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,013
Is this some kind of joke?

1216
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,019
Who did this? Huh?

1217
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,189
Who did this?

1218
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:36,193
Who the fuck is responsible for this?

1219
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:42,783
Well, fuck it.

1220
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,841
You're home early.

1221
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,052
Did you cancel your class?

1222
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,262
Is something wrong, Cath?

1223
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:49,684
Why?

1224
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:50,851
Well, you…

1225
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:53,938
You skipped your protein shake again.

1226
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:56,606
Thanks.

1227
01:34:58,359 --> 01:34:59,610
Where's Cole?

1228
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:03,531
He had to leave

1229
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:06,826
because you had him
come in so early today.

1230
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,202
Right.

1231
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:09,787
Well, that's good. We can…

1232
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,957
We can sit down,
have that chat you've been pushing for.

1233
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,167
I don't think so. Not tonight.

1234
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,837
Why not tonight?
You said it was extremely important.

1235
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,588
I don't think that it is anymore.

1236
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:30,349
- What were you doing upstairs?
- I was putting Franny to bed.

1237
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,686
Oh, what?
I… I can't give her a goodnight kiss?

1238
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:35,771
Yeah, she was very tired, George.

1239
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:47,700
You know? I think I'm gonna
give her a kiss anyway.

1240
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:50,327
No, she's out cold, George. No, she's…

1241
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,332
George.

1242
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:58,835
Why is she dressed?

1243
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,130
I told you. She was tired.

1244
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,260
You know that they're expecting
a deep freeze tonight?

1245
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,305
It's a terrible time to travel.

1246
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:13,517
Hey, where are you going?

1247
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:15,186
Hey!

1248
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,688
- Jesus!
- Get downstairs.

1249
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,272
Get off!

1250
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,443
- Get off of me!
- Hey, Catherine!

1251
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:24,068
Catherine!

1252
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,122
What are you doing, huh?
What the hell is this?

1253
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,752
Let go of me, George!

1254
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:50,012
Where do you think you're going?

1255
01:36:50,095 --> 01:36:52,473
With my goddamn daughter!

1256
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,391
- Home!
- This is your fucking home!

1257
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,727
Nowhere's home with you, George!

1258
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:57,895
Fuck!

1259
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:00,189
I know about Floyd!

1260
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,610
Your clothes were soaked that night!
And Justine? You hated her.

1261
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:06,946
I know you were involved.
I know it in my bones.

1262
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:10,241
And what about that cousin?
That cousin whose identity you stole?

1263
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,869
Oh, you've… you've really
lost your mind, you know that?

1264
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:17,414
You've... you've gone way,
way over the edge!

1265
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:18,791
No, I've woken up.

1266
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:22,378
And so will Franny
when she learns exactly who her father is.

1267
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:25,631
You want to leave? Go! Go, if you want to.

1268
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:30,594
Go. Get up. Leave your daughter
with this, this monster you've conjured up

1269
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:34,014
in your paranoid, food-deprived brain!

1270
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:09,049
Oh, my God.

1271
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,800
No!

1272
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:27,318
Help!

1273
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:29,904
Somebody help us!

1274
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:48,213
Franny!

1275
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,302
Franny!

1276
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,685
Ella, help me.

1277
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,451
<i>Fate.</i>

1278
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:20,411
<i>Catherine.</i>

1279
01:39:21,997 --> 01:39:23,874
<i>On the path of fate…</i>

1280
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,712
<i>…I can gather sharp stones</i>

1281
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:32,591
<i>so you don't feel their pain.</i>

1282
01:39:36,011 --> 01:39:37,554
Oh my God. Franny!

1283
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:40,599
Where did he put you?

1284
01:39:41,225 --> 01:39:43,227
<i>But another's free will…</i>

1285
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,230
<i>is his alone.</i>

1286
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,569
<i>Our essence… united.</i>

1287
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:53,654
Baby?

1288
01:39:57,866 --> 01:40:00,160
<i>I would give my life again</i>

1289
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,081
<i>for the power to stop this.</i>

1290
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,624
Baby.

1291
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:11,755
Where is…

1292
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:27,730
<i>Just know, Catherine.</i>

1293
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:30,774
<i>As she was there for me,</i>

1294
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,445
<i>I am here… for you.</i>

1295
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:37,364
<i>No.</i>

1296
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,409
- <i>Stop this!
- No!</i>

1297
01:41:07,102 --> 01:41:08,520
<i>George.</i>

1298
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,988
<i>George.</i>

1299
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,119
<i>Free yourself.</i>

1300
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:30,042
<i>Those who commune with evil</i>

1301
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:31,919
<i>never win.</i>

1302
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,689
<i>Again!</i>

1303
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:14,044
Mrs. Claire?

1304
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:35,065
<i>Cole, my wife is ill,
so do not disturb her.</i>

1305
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:37,734
<i>Franny should take her usual nap.</i>

1306
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:40,612
<i>Her sippy cup is prepared in the fridge.</i>

1307
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:42,489
<i>Make sure she drinks it.</i>

1308
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,784
<i>Feel free to leave once she's fast asleep.</i>

1309
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,133
Bye, Mrs. Claire.

1310
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:03,218
Feel better.

1311
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:50,473
Laughton residence.

1312
01:43:50,515 --> 01:43:51,808
Yeah. Hello, Travis.

1313
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,895
- It's Sam Pratt.
<i>- Hi, Sam. Everything okay?</i>

1314
01:43:54,978 --> 01:43:58,649
Yeah, well, actually,
we… we do have a bit of a situation.

1315
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,652
I got my neighbor here, you know,
the college professor.

1316
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:05,239
<i>Um, apparently,
something happened to his wife.</i>

1317
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:46,280
It's…

1318
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,327
Is that your ax, George?

1319
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:38,874
<i>29-year-old Catherine Claire
was found brutally murdered</i>

1320
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,834
<i>at her farmhouse here in Chosen, New York.</i>

1321
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:44,254
<i>She was discovered by her husband,
Saginaw professor…</i>

1322
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:46,048
Willis.Willis.

1323
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:47,799
Eddie.

1324
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,009
You've heard.

1325
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:52,763
- I should have done something.
- Okay.

1326
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:57,934
Here it comes.

1327
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:01,104
All right, here we go.

1328
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:15,952
What's your gut?

1329
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,414
Sure seems broken up.

1330
01:46:19,998 --> 01:46:22,125
Robbery gone bad. Really?

1331
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,753
Mmm… Alibi checks out.

1332
01:46:24,836 --> 01:46:27,339
The college says
he was teaching the whole day.

1333
01:46:27,422 --> 01:46:28,422
Mm.

1334
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:32,969
Shall I let him go for the night?
His parents are out front.

1335
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,388
Go ahead.

1336
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:36,431
There's someone else I need to talk to.

1337
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,190
Come on.

1338
01:46:51,988 --> 01:46:54,157
They can't force us to come back tomorrow.

1339
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,745
You are not speaking to anyone
until we secure a criminal attorney.

1340
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:00,664
From Manhattan.

1341
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:15,137
First thing in the morning, we're leaving
this godforsaken place for Connecticut.

1342
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,226
Did you ever see him hit her?

1343
01:47:22,644 --> 01:47:23,644
Threaten her?

1344
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,356
No, no, I never…

1345
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:30,277
She just told me that she hated him.

1346
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:33,029
Lots of wives hate their husbands.

1347
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,782
Lots of husbands hate their wives.

1348
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,952
That doesn't mean
that they'd put an ax in their gut.

1349
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:44,499
Do you know
if he might have been cheating on her?

1350
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:47,878
Or maybe she was cheating on him.

1351
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:50,797
I just know he fucking did it, Travis!
I'm telling you he did it!

1352
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,757
You have to believe me, okay?

1353
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:56,470
I never said I don't, son,
but you're giving me nothing here.

1354
01:47:58,555 --> 01:47:59,764
Fuck, man!

1355
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:06,897
So he has a solid alibi?

1356
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,315
He was at work all day.

1357
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:11,359
Took the art department out for drinks,

1358
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,236
even had the babysitter come.

1359
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,407
But you said
he could have done it earlier.

1360
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,993
The coroner confirmed as much.

1361
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:22,204
Possibly. It's difficult to prove.

1362
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:28,084
Fingerprints? There any fingerprints?

1363
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,920
They're everywhere. He lived there.

1364
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,923
Guess who else's are on the ax.

1365
01:48:33,798 --> 01:48:34,798
Eddie Vayle.

1366
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:35,841
No.

1367
01:48:36,551 --> 01:48:37,552
Not Eddie.

1368
01:48:39,137 --> 01:48:41,264
That boy has his poor mother's soul.

1369
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:45,810
Travis, it's so obvious
George Claire did this.

1370
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:48,188
- You have to arrest him.
- I know.

1371
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:52,150
But I need another person
to connect the dots.

1372
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:53,234
That may take time.

1373
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:59,908
<i>Where is the justice
for the women of that house?</i>

1374
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:15,590
- <i>Guardian angel.
- Wake up.</i>

1375
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:17,592
<i>Goodness always triumphs.</i>

1376
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:19,844
<i>If not in this world, then in the next.</i>

1377
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:22,722
<i>Franny! Somebody help us!</i>

1378
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:26,685
<i>Justine, it's time.</i>

1379
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:43,075
George?

1380
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:47,122
Someone called while you were sleeping.

1381
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:54,629
- Another journalist?
- No, no.

1382
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:57,299
Someone claiming to be an old friend.

1383
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:00,844
They left a message. Very cryptic.

1384
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:02,887
Did you get a name?

1385
01:50:03,763 --> 01:50:04,763
Yes.

1386
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,474
Um…

1387
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:09,144
Sokolov. Justine Sokolov.

1388
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,277
I'll just…

1389
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:33,877
<i>They made this happen.</i>

1390
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:38,590
<i>It's their fault.</i>

1391
01:50:44,929 --> 01:50:47,515
<i>They have always tried to hold you back.</i>

1392
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:51,895
<i>You are envied.</i>

1393
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:56,107
<i>Unrecognized.</i>

1394
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:00,278
<i>Trust in your impulses.</i>

1395
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:03,615
<i>Go.</i>

1396
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:10,538
Hey!

1397
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:12,373
Hey!

1398
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:13,875
I can't let you go out.

1399
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:18,380
- That boat isn't up-to-date on fees.
- Just going out for a minute.

1400
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:20,882
No, can't let it happen.

1401
01:51:24,386 --> 01:51:26,012
I'd really appreciate it, sir.

1402
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:31,851
Mind just giving me a hand?

1403
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:08,971
Travis.

1404
01:52:09,639 --> 01:52:10,890
Good afternoon.

1405
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:12,808
Up for a chat?

1406
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:14,351
Yeah.

1407

<i>The gates of Hell are only visible</i>
