3
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,152
Lainey.

4
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,113
- Lainey.
- I'm coming, mama.

5
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:38,651
Where have you been?

6
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:42,676
I told you I need to see you
at all times, do you understand me?

7
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,524
Yes.

8
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:46,615
Mama, I got you an apple.
It's a good one.

9
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,254
Come on. Get inside.

10
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,933
I told you not to unlock this,
didn't you hear me?

11
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:11,253
I have to pack up and I don't want you
running around up there all by yourself.

12
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:14,435
And stop getting apples.
We don't need them.

13
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,005
He can join his friends in there.

14
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,699
Mommy, it was for you. Eat it.

15
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:23,858
Fine.

16
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,097
That's not the one.

17
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,181
- This one?
- No.

18
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,643
Are you kidding me?

19
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,730
Okay.

20
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,249
I'll get the baby.

21
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:50,530
No, Lainey. I got him, you know the rules.

22
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,833
Yes, ma'am.

23
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:54,882
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:58,750
Well, I'm gonna take off tonight,
so the kids gonna sleep most of the way.

25
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,340
Well, I'm mostly done,
I just need to finish

26
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:10,606
cleaning up the pantry
and pack up the rest to the car.

27
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:14,862
Everything else is clean.

28
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:16,844
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,585
I did. Yes, ma'am.

30
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,788
I already started looking
for job postings.

31
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,541
So it won't be long
before I could start paying the rent.

32
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,403
We really appreciate the help.

33
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,702
Mommy.

34
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,270
There is no chance of that happening.

35
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:44,843
Mommy.

36
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,556
I'm clean since rehab. I told you.

37
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:50,276
Hush, baby, I'm on the phone
to auntie Claire.

38
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,237
Do you want me to take a test?

39
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:02,062
I just used my last minute, so…

40
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,457
I will take a test
if that's what you need.

41
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,584
Okay.

42
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,456
Mommy.

43
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,271
Come on!

44
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,571
Mommy.

45
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:23,992
Mommy!

46
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,712
What do you need?

47
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:26,879
I have to pee.

48
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:31,238
Okay. Come on. Go to the bathroom.
Let's go. Come on.

49
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,817
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G ♪

50
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,257
♪ H-I-J-K-I-…P

51
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:48,286
It's L-M-N-O-P, Lainey.

52
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:49,947
Okay?

53
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,343
Are you almost done?

54
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,169
No.

55
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,614
Well, can you hurry up, please?

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,690
So much fun as it is to wipe your butt.

57
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,274
I got other things to do.

58
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,014
Keep practicing those ABC's.

59
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,306
You almost got them perfect.

60
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,504
Still leaking.

61
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,672
Fuck.

62
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,016
That's a bad word.

63
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:28,942
You're right.

64
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,181
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,247
Nana said that it is the baddest word.

66
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,697
Well, Nana's dead.

67
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,457
I'm done.

68
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,444
Well…

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,433
Can be enough to get us there.♪♪

70
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,262
- Mama.
- What, baby?

71
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,664
Daddy's dead like Nana?

72
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,293
No, baby.

73
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,256
Daddy's not dead.

74
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,228
Nana said he's bad.

75
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,645
No, baby. No.

76
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,960
Daddy's not bad, okay?

77
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:25,976
He's not bad. He's just…

78
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:27,769
He's sick.

79
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,938
Just like mama was sick.

80
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,002
Mommy's not bad.

81
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,056
But I got better.

82
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,178
'Cause I love my little monkeys
too much to stay sick.

83
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,661
I'm not a monkey. I'm a girl.

84
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,670
No!

85
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:50,840
You are a lovely little monkey.

86
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:22,257
What's that?

87
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,367
The rest of our food.

88
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,765
We'll eat it during the trip.

89
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,554
I got Animal Crackers in here.

90
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,821
I don't wanna leave Nana's house.

91
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,290
There's no jobs around here.

92
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:33,141
And I don't have any money for Texas.

93
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:35,346
Or anything else.

94
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:37,566
I could sell apples for money.

95
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,737
The apples are rotten, Lane.

96
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,500
HOLY BIBLE

97
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,106
Oh, shit!

98
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,981
Lainey!

99
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:07,328
Lainey, come here!

100
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,300
<i>Where are my apples, mommy?</i>

101
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,359
Lainey, listen…

102
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,037
I need you to open the door.

103
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:25,418
Okay? You just turn that little latch
real hard.

104
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:28,274
And it's rusted a little bit,
so you need to use your muscles.

105
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:29,938
<i>Mommy, where are my apples?</i>

106
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,558
They're bad, Lane.
Please, just open the door.

107
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,912
<i>Did you throw them outside?</i>

108
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,578
Baby, we can pick more apples, okay?

109
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,017
But mommy needs your help.

110
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:43,698
Can you help me?

111
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:52,131
It's hard to turn, so make sure
it's going the right way.

112
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,342
<i>Are the apples sick?</i>

113
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,012
They're bad, Lane.
They're not worth saving.

114
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:07,788
Okay.

115
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:09,775
Stay in back!

116
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,195
Fuck.

117
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:53,623
Lainey?

118
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,708
Lainey, are you there?

119
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,850
<i>Yes, mama.</i>

120
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,765
Unlock the front door

121
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,018
and go to the red box on the porch.

122
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,285
Open it up

123
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,354
and bring me a long metal tool.

124
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,133
One that has kind of
a little X on the end.

125
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,707
<i>A tool?</i>

126
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,238
Yes.

127
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:21,875
Just bring me what you can.

128
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,858
The red box on the porch.

129
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,139
Bring me anything from inside of it.

130
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,847
- Okay, baby?
<i>- Okay.</i>

131
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,536
<i>Here you go, mama.</i>

132
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,482
Good job.

133
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:54,714
Now try to get one
just like this but with an X, okay?

134
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,234
<i>Okay.</i>

135
00:13:58,431 --> 00:13:59,612
Oh, God.

136
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:26,511
Lainey?

137
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:28,428
Did you find the tool?

138
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,034
<i>Someone's here.</i>

139
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,569
Who's here?

140
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,397
<i>Daddy, he took the red box.</i>

141
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:39,979
Is the front door locked like I told you?

142
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,692
<i>Daddy's leaving.</i>

143
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:53,622
Lainey, go outside and get him. Run.

144
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,450
Got yourself locked in here again, Jess?

145
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,559
Why I'm not surprised.

146
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,643
Thanks.

147
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:08,598
This is yours.

148
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:10,603
Thanks.

149
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,833
I'm just kidding.

150
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:17,060
Calm down, Jess. Hey.

151
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,046
You're hanging out with Sammy?

152
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,812
I needed a place to stay.

153
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:49,340
You could've stayed here if you'd passed
the drug test, you know that.

154
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:52,359
Hey, small fry, you're so biggie.

155
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,202
How old are you?

156
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,680
- Lainey.
- I'm not a fry, I'm a girl.

157
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:57,974
Lainey, come here.

158
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,248
Come here, baby.

159
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,018
Come on, let's go to the kitchen.

160
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:03,836
Just go finish your sandwich, okay, baby?

161
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Hey, sweetie.

162
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,498
You tracked dirt
all over the floor, dammit.

163
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,055
Sorry.

164
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:18,709
Where's the little guy?

165
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,653
He's upstairs taking a nap
before the trip.

166
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:24,262
I don't wanna wake him.

167
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:27,998
So, Texas, huh?

168
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,638
I can't afford to stay here.

169
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:34,034
Can't afford it. Too expensive.

170
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:39,084
Your grandma didn't leave anything?

171
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:41,648
Like money.

172
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:44,620
No. No, just the house.

173
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,774
Look…

174
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:49,993
You're both high.

175
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:51,498
So you should go.

176
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,461
Nah, I think this is good for us.

177
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,665
I'm glad you asked me.

178
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,636
This is our chance to talk.

179
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,340
Talk about what?

180
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,662
I figured out our problem, Jess.

181
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,169
You think you're too good for me.

182
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,806
No. No. I don't. I don't.

183
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:15,651
I just got help.

184
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,687
You can too, you know.
We have kids.

185
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:25,162
You brought Sammy here?

186
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,637
You know what he did
to that little girl.

187
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,427
You're always paranoid about that stuff.
It's called projection.

188
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,155
What did I do, Jessica?

189
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,507
Nothing, I was talking to Rob.

190
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,716
What'd I do?

191
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,298
Say it.

192
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:42,188
I was talking to Rob, okay?
I don't know.

193
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:43,397
You said my name.

194
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,924
Tell me what I did.

195
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,142
Go ahead, tell me what I did.
What'd I do?

196
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,513
I wasn't talking to you,
I was taking to Rob.

197
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:52,969
Look…

198
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,716
I've a lot to do, okay?

199
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,691
Thank you for getting me out
and I'll call you when we get there, okay?

200
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,658
Oh, she's so busy, Rob. She's so busy.

201
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:03,598
I think you've just been dismissed, buddy.

202
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:07,728
I'm tired of getting dismissed by you,
you know that?

203
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:11,069
I mean. These are my kids, too.

204
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:12,853
Yeah.

205
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,317
You haven't changed.

206
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,666
You're still weak and needy.

207
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,639
What would've happened to you if I hadn't
gotten you out of that pantry?

208
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,266
Out here in the boondocks.
Miles from the nearest neighbor?

209
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,139
You're right.

210
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:33,174
I'm sorry.

211
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:35,630
She's lying.

212
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,847
You're a liar.

213
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:39,212
She's not sorry. She's a liar.

214
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,392
Lying.

215
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,780
Yeah, you just pretend
I wasn't here, Jess.

216
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,508
I'll tell you what
you don't have to pretend.

217
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,512
I'll put things back the way they were
before I got here.

218
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,689
Rob, stop!

219
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,449
This is you without me.

220
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,207
Stop! Don't! Don't!

221
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:57,789
Rob, let me go!

222
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,566
Rob, let me go!

223
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,868
Stop!

224
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,271
This is you without me!

225
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,294
Always saving your sorry ass!

226
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,378
Rob, no!

227
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,910
Rob, let me out.

228
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,001
Rob, what are you doing?

229
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,349
<i>…you are learning.</i>

230
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,766
<i>- Mommy, are you in there?</i>
- Lainey.

231
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,486
Go upstairs to my bedroom
and lock the door.

232
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,195
It's a little button on the door.
You turn it. Do you understand?

233
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,738
<i>Why are you in there?</i>

234
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,822
Just go now!

235
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:34,939
Go now!

236
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,525
Good girl.

237
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,256
Rob?

238
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,758
Please let me out. Please.

239
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,546
What are you doing?

240
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, my God!

241
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,299
Oh, my God!

242
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:06,366
You put a nail through my hand,
you asshole!

243
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,664
<i>Here's the deal, Jess.</i>

244
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,800
<i>You got a lot of time in there to think.</i>

245
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:16,065
<i>You've gotten a little too full
of yourself.</i>

246
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,787
Rob, you're high.

247
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:23,634
You're not thinking straight.
Don't do this.

248
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:24,767
<i>Rob.</i>

249
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,537
<i>Should I grab the kids?</i>

250
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,274
<i>We need to bring them to my place.</i>

251
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,237
Don't you touch my kids, you asshole!

252
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,079
Rob!

253
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,310
He's a child molester.

254
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,236
Lainey, lock the door. Turn the button.

255
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,443
Rob.

256
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,139
Please don't let him touch our kids.

257
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:51,421
Please leave them. Please.

258
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,917
<i>Careful with this.</i>

259
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,262
<i>It's pharmaceutical grade.</i>

260
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:57,733
<i>I'll come back when you're back
to your old self.</i>

261
00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:58,817
Rob.

262
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:00,701
Don't.

263
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:04,535
Don't take the kids. Please leave them.

264
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:07,571
Rob?

265
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:09,697
Lainey?

266
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,552
Lainey, are you there?

267
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,722
Mommy loves you.

268
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,164
Rob!

269
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,994
Rob!

270
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:20,714
Lainey?

271
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,226
Lainey?

272
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,591
Lainey, is that you? Are you here?

273
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,241
<i>Mommy, why are you in there?</i>

274
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,817
I got stuck again.

275
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:40,368
Lainey, where's Mason. Is he okay?

276
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,298
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

277
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:46,495
<i>I pushed the button on the door and sang
ABC's to him until he fell asleep.</i>

278
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:50,792
You did a good job, Lane.

279
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,161
Okay.

280
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,974
Lainey, listen very carefully.

281
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,352
I need you to go lock the front door.

282
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:05,870
You already know how to unlock it.

283
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:08,724
You just turn that little
metal thing the other way.

284
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:10,648
<i>Okay.</i>

285
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,111
<i>I turned the lock.</i>

286
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,564
You're a smart girl, Lane.

287
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:36,767
Okay.

288
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:39,196
Now.

289
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,135
What did Daddy do to the door.
Can you tell me what you see?

290
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,482
<i>Daddy messed it up. It's broken.</i>

291
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,687
I know, baby.
But what did he nail over it?

292
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:50,391
<i>All of the Nana's wood.</i>♪♪

293
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,540
The two-by-fours.

294
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:56,394
Crap.

295
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:03,917
Okay.

296
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:05,656
Lainey, listen.

297
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,693
My purse…

298
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:10,903
No. Not my purse.

299
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,561
My cellphone

300
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:15,725
is on the floor in the living room.

301
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,263
I need you to go get it and bring it here.

302
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:20,339
<i>Mommy, please come out.</i>

303
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:26,284
I need to call 911. Just go get my phone.

304
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,781
<i>What's 911?</i>

305
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,811
Just get the phone, please.

306
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,995
Are you sure you looked everywhere?

307
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,677
It was on the floor.

308
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:43,699
<i>Mommy, I can't find it.</i>

309
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,599
And my purse is gone too. You sure?

310
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:49,859
<i>It's not there.</i>

311
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:52,545
He took it.

312
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:54,735
Dammit.

313
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:58,286
<i>Mommy. Come out. I have to pee.
You need to come with me.</i>

314
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:10,155
Lainey, listen.

315
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,054
It's time for Mason's bottle.
There's one in the fridge.

316
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,647
And he needs his diaper changed too.

317
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,980
And Mommy can't help him.

318
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:20,831
<i>Mommy I have to pee.</i>

319
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:22,764
<i>Then go pee.</i>

320
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:26,302
I can't go with you,
I'm stuck in the pantry.

321
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,651
<i>I miss Nana, I want Nana.</i>

322
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,090
I'm sorry, baby.

323
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:48,893
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,690
Mommy wasn't nice.

325
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,482
I miss Nana too.

326
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:03,925
But we have to take of each other now.

327
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,315
Okay?

328
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:18,091
<i>Sorry, Mommy. Please don't get mad.</i>

329
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,550
HOLY BIBLE

330
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,024
APPLE BUTTER

331
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,259
<i>Mommy, Mason pooped.</i>

332
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:08,288
You waited till now?

333
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:12,444
Okay, Lainey.

334
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,611
You remember how Mommy does it.

335
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,417
You take the wipes from the diaper bag.

336
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:20,522
Use those to clean him.

337
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:25,179
Then throw those away with the diaper
and wash your hands after.

338
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:26,669
You got it?

339
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,150
<i>I know what to do.</i>

340
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,501
And he's heavy, okay? He's not a doll.

341
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:32,658
<i>I know.</i>

342
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,277
<i>Mommy. I'm hungry.</i>

343
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,234
<i>I finished it.</i>

344
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,482
I'm gonna need you to feed
Mason now, okay?

345
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,660
There's a plastic spoon is a diaper bag.

346
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,173
Use that to feed the baby.

347
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,900
And make sure you sit him up, okay?

348
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:56,249
<i>Mommy, I'm still hungry and I'm thirsty.</i>

349
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,390
You can drink water from the sink.

350
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,371
Just use the cup there.

351
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:03,313
<i>I don't like water. I want juice.</i>

352
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:09,338
I packed up all our food
and juice boxes in the car.

353
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:11,108
And we need the keys.

354
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,166
And they're in my purse.

355
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,494
And you shouldn't be drinking juice
all the time anyway. It's bad for you.

356
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,087
<i>I'm thirsty for juice.</i>

357
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,574
Drink water.

358
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,077
Don't let him choke.

359
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:33,518
Sit him up, do you hear me?

360
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,325
Mommy. Mommy, wake up.

361
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,333
It's time for bed, Lane.

362
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,320
No. Please come out. I'm scared.

363
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:10,137
I can't get out, baby. You know that.

364
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:12,533
Or else I'd come tuck you in.

365
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,153
You can get out.
You just need to try harder.

366
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:20,453
I'm trying my best.

367
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:23,279
A monster's gonna grab me.

368
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,486
There's no monsters, Lane.

369
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,109
It's in the dark.

370
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:34,824
Mason needs you.

371
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:36,983
He's all alone.

372
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,816
I wanna stay here with you.

373
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,890
It's cold down here.

374
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,239
The heat's on upstairs.

375
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,934
Just shove a towel under the window
where it won't shut.

376
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,280
Put on towels.♪♪

377
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:51,720
I'm not cold.

378
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:53,750
It's just per one night.

379
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:56,131
I'll be out tomorrow.

380
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,424
Daddy will come back.

381
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:00,545
Daddy's bad.

382
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:06,792
Just go to bed, baby.

383
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,783
Okay?

384
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:11,224
Go on.

385
00:31:15,277 --> 00:31:17,105
APPLE BUTTER

386
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:33,128
<i>All done.</i>

387
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:36,256
Good girl.

388
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:43,010
Okay, time to feed Mason.

389
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,405
Be careful, okay?

390
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:50,334
Here you go.

391
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:53,996
Dammit.

392
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:19,995
LARGE KITCHEN MATCHES

393
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:23,949
HOLY BIBLE

394
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:42,883
- Lainey.
<i>- Yes, mama.</i>

395
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:46,547
When the baby falls asleep
I need your help.

396
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,791
<i>Okay.</i>

397
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:49,645
<i>Here you go.</i>

398
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,367
That won't work, Lane.

399
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:53,873
I need something metal.

400
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:57,175
A tool. So I can chip away the wood.

401
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,914
<i>It's a strong stick.</i>

402
00:32:58,998 --> 00:32:59,998
Keep looking.

403
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:14,578
Mommy can't break through a wall
with a green crayon, Lane.

404
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:16,411
You know that.

405
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,656
I need something hard.

406
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,587
I need something metal.
I told you that already.

407
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:39,995
I'm sorry, Lainey.

408
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:43,271
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

409
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:47,062
You're doing the best job. You really are.

410
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,981
I'm a bad mom.

411
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:04,552
Okay?

412
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,435
I just didn't know how to do it.
I never learned.

413
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,745
And you don't know this, but…

414
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:19,307
I was just too young when you came around

415
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,305
and I wasn't ready for all of this.

416
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,733
And then…

417
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:30,507
I left you alone for so long
when I was sick.

418
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:34,928
I messed up real bad.

419
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,597
But I'm trying.

420
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:45,082
Just promise me that you

421
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,782
not gonna grow up…

422
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:52,631
And hate me, like I hated my mom.

423
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,074
Lainey?

424
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,689
Lainey, are you here?

425
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:14,723
Lane.

426
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,298
Who's here, Lane?

427
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:22,125
Answer me.

428
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:31,605
<i>I found it under the leaf,
it's Daddy's tool.</i>

429
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,389
<i>He lost it.</i>

430
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:36,505
Good job, baby, you did it.

431
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,116
This is exactly what I needed.

432
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,356
<i>I did it.</i>

433
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,484
You're a good girl, Lane. I love you.

434
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:46,538
I'm gonna take care of Mason.

435
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,190
I'm gonna get out of here.

436
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:56,227
Just sit tight.

437
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:48,268
Lainey.

438
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,393
You there?

439
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:54,407
I'm almost done.

440
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:59,905
Maybe few more hours
and I can crawl out of the house.

441
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:05,650
What's going on up there?

442
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:06,734
<i>Mason!</i>

443
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:10,158
Lainey?

444
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:11,669
What happened?

445
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,674
<i>I dropped the baby.</i>

446
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:19,343
Oh, God! Oh, God!

447
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,394
<i>I was trying to crawl down the stairs.</i>

448
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:25,098
<i>- Mommy, I'm sorry.</i>
- It's okay. It's okay.

449
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,029
It's okay. It's okay.

450
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:30,340
You need to pick him up and hold him
until he stops crying.

451
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,188
He's alone and he's scared right now.

452
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:37,739
<i>He wants milk, but it's all gone.</i>

453
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,339
You need to make him a bottle.

454
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,748
You remember how Mommy does it?
It's three scoops of formula.

455
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,222
The powder is in the can.

456
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:50,579
You fill it up with water,
put a nipple on tight and shake it.

457
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:52,115
<i>Okay.</i>

458
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:53,896
You can do it.

459
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,372
Lainey?

460
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,065
Almost there.

461
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:37,518
I can do this.

462
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:40,268
It's gonna be fine.

463
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
Lane?

464
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:57,636
Mommy, someone's here.

465
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,890
Who's here?

466
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:02,812
Is it Daddy?

467
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:04,759
It's that man who called my a fry.

468
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:07,604
Okay.

469
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:11,202
Lainey, please tell me
you locked the front door.

470
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:12,319
<i>He's coming in.</i>

471
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:14,679
<i>Hello?</i>

472
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:17,057
<i>Hello?</i>

473
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,569
<i>Anybody home?</i>

474
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:21,387
Lainey, run upstairs to the bedroom
and lock the door.

475
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:23,147
<i>Maybe that man can get you out.</i>

476
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,031
He's bad, Lane. Run!

477
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,484
<i>Hello?</i>

478
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:45,283
<i>Anybody home?</i>

479
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,803
<i>Little girl?</i>

480
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,452
<i>Jessica.</i>

481
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,689
Where's Rob.

482
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:16,021
Is he with you?

483
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,436
<i>Rob is busy.</i>

484
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,648
<i>So I thought I'd come in</i>

485
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:24,557
<i>babysit for you.</i>

486
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,153
We don't need a babysitter.

487
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,966
I'm fine.

488
00:40:29,782 --> 00:40:31,096
Please leave my house.

489
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:35,248
<i>You really like to dismiss people,
don't you, Jessica?</i>

490
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:38,452
<i>You know…</i>

491
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,299
<i>Your daughter…</i>

492
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,163
<i>She's very pretty.</i>

493
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:47,366
<i>Very pretty.</i>

494
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:49,494
<i>Where is she?</i>

495
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,919
<i>Is she upstairs?</i>

496
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:54,213
Rob's gonna be pretty pissed
at you if you mess with his kids.

497
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:56,868
<i>…go upstairs, Jessica.
Is that where she is?</i>

498
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,472
Stay away from them!

499
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,089
<i>Rob owes me money.</i>

500
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,725
<i>And I'm here to collect
the payment, Jessica.</i>

501
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,966
No, stop! Wait! Wait!

502
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:13,920
<i>Little girl?</i>

503
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:16,816
<i>Little girl? Where are you?</i>

504
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,443
LARGE KITCHEN MATCHES

505
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,534
HOLY BIBLE

506
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:26,403
I have Rob's meth.

507
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,847
It's yours, I haven't used it.

508
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,838
I got probably three grams down here.

509
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,840
Come on, don't let it go to waste.
Rob just gonna take it back.

510
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:01,921
<i>He gave you three grams?</i>

511
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,846
<i>- And he owes me money?</i>
- Yeah.

512
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:08,293
And it's all yours, if you want it.
It's all yours.

513
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:09,377
<i>Okay.</i>

514
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:11,785
<i>Send it under the door.</i>

515
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:14,635
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Let me out.

516
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:16,444
And it's all yours.

517
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:17,944
<i>Let you out.</i>

518
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,467
<i>No can do, Jessica. No.</i>

519
00:42:23,246 --> 00:42:26,198
<i>I don't get involved in domestic dispute.</i>

520
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,118
Well, call the police.

521
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:30,998
Or let me use your phone, please.

522
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:35,329
<i>Not calling the police.</i>

523
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,892
<i>Not getting you out.</i>

524
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,970
<i>Send it under the door, Jessica.</i>

525
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,299
If I give you the meth
will you leave us alone?

526
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,620
You have to leave the house.
And you can't go back.

527
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:52,676
<i>Of course, Jessica. I'll go. I'll leave.</i>

528
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:55,457
<i>You have my word.</i>

529
00:42:58,128 --> 00:42:59,588
<i>Put in under the door.</i>

530
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:26,389
<i>Jessica.</i>

531
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:30,851
<i>Put it under the door, Jessica.</i>

532
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,987
<i>- Jessica.</i>
- Sorry, I just…

533
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,289
I'm injured.

534
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:41,225
I'm too weak to get close enough.

535
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,553
Reach under the door
and I'll drop it in your hand.

536
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:47,765
<i>You sound fine to me, Jessica.</i>

537
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:49,680
<i>Just push it under the door.</i>

538
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:50,927
I can't reach that far.

539
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:53,377
<i>Push it under the door, Jessica.</i>

540
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:55,948
I'm stuck over here on the other end,
I can't move much.

541
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:00,869
Have you tried it yet?

542
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:04,829
Rob said it's good stuff.

543
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:11,465
If you can't decide I'm gonna dump it out.

544
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,032
<i>Hey. Hey, hold on.</i>

545
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,365
<i>Okay.</i>

546
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,414
<i>Where is it?</i>

547
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:30,125
<i>Can you reach my hand?</i>

548
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:31,704
Almost.

549
00:44:31,788 --> 00:44:32,788
Just…

550
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:35,659
Just can you stretch out
a little bit more?

551
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,988
<i>Okay, that's as far as I can go.</i>

552
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,149
<i>Can you reach my hand?</i>

553
00:44:48,233 --> 00:44:49,506
I can just reach it.

554
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,214
<i>Okay. Drop it in my hand.</i>

555
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,630
Here it comes.

556
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:01,145
Jessica!

557
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,565
Jessica? What have you done?

558
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,859
Take it out! Take it out, you bitch!

559
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,685
What did you do to me?

560
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:16,120
I'm getting out of here.
I swear. I'll leave now.

561
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:18,691
- You'll get out when I get out.
- Take it out. I'm so scared.

562
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:21,631
Keep your other hand out of her
or I will cut it off!

563
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,320
I've got your kids.
Now free me, you whore.♪♪

564
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:27,277
<i>Get it out of my hand!</i>

565
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:30,030
<i>Get it out of my hand, you bitch!</i>

566
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,492
<i>Get it out!</i>

567
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:34,599
<i>What did you do? Get it out!</i>

568
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,547
<i>Get it out! Get it out now!</i>

569
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:40,673
<i>Please!</i>

570
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:43,506
<i>Please. Okay. Okay.</i>

571
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,634
<i>Please.</i>

572
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:46,760
<i>Take it out. Take it out.</i>

573
00:46:11,991 --> 00:46:13,784
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

574
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:17,342
<i>It smells like liquor.</i>

575
00:46:17,847 --> 00:46:19,251
<i>Wow.</i>

576
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:21,669
<i>No liquor, doc?</i>

577
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,433
<i>You little bitch!</i>

578
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,390
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

579
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,133
<i>Jessica, please.</i>

580
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:41,021
Let go.

581
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:42,829
I was freezing.

582
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:46,520
There's a storm coming in.

583
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:50,067
I just heard on the news
it's gonna be freezing.

584
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:51,244
Please.

585
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:55,098
I get cold. I get cold easy.

586
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,218
I don't like the cold weather.

587
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:59,187
You left my front door open.

588
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:01,510
I hope you freeze to death.

589
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:03,876
What?

590
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:08,087
What did you say?

591
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:10,336
You hope I freeze to death?

592
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:14,289
Oh, you hope I freeze to death?

593
00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:25,949
Hope? You hope I freeze to death?

594
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:28,178
You're an idiot.

595
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,515
People who use hope are desperate.

596
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,839
They're desperate people.
Weak people.

597
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:37,023
Shut up.

598
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,667
I heard you went to rehab, Jessica.

599
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:43,354
Oh, yeah, Rob told me.
He told me all about it.

600
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:46,057
Oh, yeah. Jessica went through rehab.

601
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:49,018
Did they teach you hope at the rehab?

602
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:51,408
That's what they taught you?
They taught you to hope?

603
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,456
Right after they tool all of your money.

604
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:58,230
Oh, yeah. I know that routine, Jessica.

605
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,875
I went through rehab.

606
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:03,582
Oh, yeah.

607
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:06,395
I was clean and sober

608
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,712
for a long time, Jessica.

609
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:10,013
I got a job.

610
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:11,914
I took college courses.

611
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,664
I even filed a tax return.

612
00:48:15,987 --> 00:48:16,987
And then,

613
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:19,174
After my mother died…

614
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:22,978
I realized that

615
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,941
No one in the whole world…

616
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,226
Gave a shit about me anymore.

617
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:35,002
That's what they didn't teach me in rehab.

618
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:37,426
They didn't tell me when I got sober

619
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,580
that I would go back
to the same miserable life

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,194
I used drugs to get away from.

621
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,696
Jessica.

622
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:57,644
You still got the three grams
in there with you?

623
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:01,515
Yes.

624
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:07,198
You ain't gonna last long, Jessica.

625
00:49:07,908 --> 00:49:11,205
- Stop talking to me.
- You know it. I know it.

626
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,150
You know something?

627
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:21,455
I can smell the weakness from here.

628
00:49:22,071 --> 00:49:23,657
I can smell it.

629
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,919
The stink from weakness.

630
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:29,169
You and I…

631
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,774
We understand.

632
00:49:32,866 --> 00:49:35,848
I don't molest little girls. I hate you!

633
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,433
And I hate everyone like you!

634
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,096
How many people do you know

635
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,237
like me, Jessica?

636
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:45,354
Did somebody touch you?

637
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,999
You were a little girl?

638
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:55,001
But their hands on you, Jessica,
when you were a little girl.

639
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:57,588
- Stop talking to me! Stop talking to me!
- Little Jess.

640
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:58,949
Did you like it?

641
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,651
I said stop talking to me!

642
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:18,950
<i>Please, Jessica. Please.</i>

643
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:21,231
<i>It's freezing in here.</i>

644
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:22,668
<i>I'm cold.</i>

645
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:24,189
<i>I'm cold.</i>

646
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,322
<i>What are you doing, Jessica?</i>

647
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:38,543
I'm getting out.

648
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,672
You'll scratch your way out
like a little mouse?

649
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,187
You know I…

650
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,360
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

651
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,526
- Or your kids.
- Yeah, right.

652
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:53,239
I like it.

653
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:56,032
I'm not a bad guy.

654
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,419
You're a monster.

655
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:05,874
Dammit.

656
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,223
Power's outage, top bitch.

657
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:13,998
- Lainey.
<i>- Mommy.</i>

658
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,226
Lainey! Lainey!

659
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:20,752
Lainey, stay upstairs,
do not come down here!

660
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:23,452
<i>- Mama.</i>
- Lainey!

661
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:25,173
Lainey! Go back!

662
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:27,837
Go back upstairs, do not come down here!

663
00:51:29,404 --> 00:51:31,304
<i>- Mommy, are you in there?</i>
- Lane...

664
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:34,099
- Lainey run! Run away!
<i>- Mommy.</i>

665
00:51:34,635 --> 00:51:36,235
<i>I got her! I got her!</i>

666
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,235
<i>Take it out!</i>

667
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:39,324
Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!

668
00:51:39,408 --> 00:51:42,094
<i>Take it out now or I'll crush her leg.♪♪</i>

669
00:51:42,178 --> 00:51:43,816
I'll pull it out. Do not hurt her!

670
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,363
<i>Mommy he got me!</i>

671
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:49,283
Hold on. I need to find
a way to get it out!

672
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:50,414
<i>Mommy, help!</i>

673
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,040
Okay, hold on.

674
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,259
<i>Dammit! What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

675
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:01,715
<i>What are you doing?</i>

676
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:12,789
<i>Put it out!</i>

677
00:52:12,873 --> 00:52:15,023
Run, Lainey! Run!

678
00:52:15,107 --> 00:52:17,070
Get away from him!

679
00:52:17,154 --> 00:52:18,154
<i>What did you do?</i>

680
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:19,238
Lainey, run!

681
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:22,424
- Lainey!
<i>- Stop! Put it out now!</i>

682
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:24,621
<i>Now! Put it out!</i>

683
00:52:24,705 --> 00:52:26,368
<i>Put it out! Put it out!</i>

684
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:29,705
<i>Please! Please!</i>

685
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:35,010
<i>Put it out!</i>

686
00:54:10,283 --> 00:54:11,476
Lainey?

687
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,682
Let me know you're okay.

688
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:29,798
Put a blanket on a baby.

689
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,649
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I lack nothing."

690
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:30,555
"Watch out for false prophets."

691
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:32,733
They come to you in sheep's clothing,

692
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:35,611
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

693
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:37,949
By their fruit you will recognize them.

694
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:40,520
Do people pick grapes from thorn-bushes,

695
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,420
or figs from thistles?

696
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,482
Likewise, every good tree
bears good fruit,

697
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,410
but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

698
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:54,576
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,

699
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,039
and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

700
00:56:58,034 --> 00:57:01,398
Every tree that does not bear good fruit
is cut down and thrown into the fire.

701
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:04,636
"Thus, by their fruit
you will recognize them."

702
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,297
HOLY BIBLE

703
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:19,276
HOLY MATRIMONY

707
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:42,153

APPLE BUTTER

709
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:03,405
FOR JESSICA

710
00:58:21,903 --> 00:58:23,553
What good is this to me now?

711
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:31,341
Sammy?

712
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:38,457
You're alive, Sammy?

713
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,037
Okay.

714
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:10,489
Lainey?

715
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,469
Lainey?

716
01:03:18,553 --> 01:03:20,350
Mason, I'm coming.

717
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:25,558
Lainey, I'm out of the pantry now.
Come on in!

718
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:34,062
Mommy! Mommy!

719
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,192
Baby.

720
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:39,020
Mama's here.

721
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:41,860
Let me get a look at you.

722
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,529
Let me look at you.

723
01:04:45,044 --> 01:04:46,190
Mama's here, Mason.

724
01:04:50,013 --> 01:04:51,204
Come here, Mason.

725
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:53,079
Mommy's here. Hello.

726
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:57,541
You did a good job.

727
01:04:59,436 --> 01:05:01,409
You did such a good job. Thank you.

728
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,891
Thank you. You did so good.

729
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,814
Mama, I'm hungry.

730
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:08,768
Can I have Animal Crackers, now?

731
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:10,591
They're in the car, remember?

732
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:51,995
Okay.

733
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,137
Hold Mason, okay?♪♪
Good girl. Good girl.

734
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:00,390
Thank you. Keep him warm. Thank you.

735
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:22,368
Mommy, I'm hungry.

736
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,228
Mama, I wanna go back inside.

737
01:07:33,312 --> 01:07:34,528
Come on. Come here.

738
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:36,265
Come here.

739
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,642
I'm cold.

740
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:43,971
Hold your brother.

741
01:07:44,055 --> 01:07:46,383
Hold him tight, baby.
Hold your brother. Hold him.

742
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:06,618
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

743
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:13,300
The Animal Crackers.

744
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:15,349
Leave it. Leave it.

745
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:16,780
Come on, baby. Let's go.

746
01:08:17,379 --> 01:08:19,899
Staying here is dangerous.
Come on. Let's go, come on.

747
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,507
Can I have Animal Crackers now?

748
01:08:46,387 --> 01:08:47,623
Okay.

749
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,827
I'm gonna go get them.

750
01:08:51,642 --> 01:08:52,956
Okay, here.

751
01:08:54,386 --> 01:08:55,741
You take Mason, okay?

752
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,482
You got him?

753
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,308
Hold him tight.

754
01:09:00,195 --> 01:09:01,488
And keep him warm, baby.

755
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:05,931
Okay.

756
01:09:35,111 --> 01:09:36,325
Lainey!

757
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:40,936
Lainey, let me in!

758
01:09:48,991 --> 01:09:50,206
Lainey!

759
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,290
Lainey!

760
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,212
Lainey!

761
01:09:57,296 --> 01:09:58,400
Lainey!

762
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:02,088
Lainey!

763
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:05,526
Sit down! Sit down!

764
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:07,029
No, no!

765
01:10:07,556 --> 01:10:08,449
Let them go!

766
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:11,170
Stop crying! Stop crying!

767
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:12,187
Mommy's here!

768
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:13,740
Let them go, please!

769
01:10:13,824 --> 01:10:17,090
Please. Please. Please, let them go.

770
01:10:17,174 --> 01:10:20,284
I said please 12 times, Jessica!

771
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:22,638
Remember? Please? Please?

772
01:10:22,722 --> 01:10:24,722
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

773
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:26,666
Please. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

774
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:29,453
- Let them go!
- Mommy? You want Mommy?

775
01:10:29,537 --> 01:10:30,396
You want Mommy?

776
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,984
Mommy, I wanna go.

777
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:35,135
- Just sit tight, okay, baby?
- What did you do to my hand?

778
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:39,225
Stop! Stand there! Don't move!

779
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:42,100
The meth is still in the pantry,
downstairs, you can have it, okay?

780
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:43,655
You can have it. Just let them go.

781
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,015
Yeah?

782
01:10:45,684 --> 01:10:48,153
There's money in there, too.
There's like a thousands of...

783
01:10:48,237 --> 01:10:50,197
There's a lot of money.
It's my grandma's money...

784
01:10:50,266 --> 01:10:52,148
You can have it, just...
Just give me the baby.

785
01:10:52,232 --> 01:10:53,932
I'm gonna cut your baby!

786
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,467
- Stop! Stop! Let them go!
- Don't cry.

787
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:58,757
Don't cry. Don't cry.

788
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:02,511
Please, just please stop.
Please let them go.

789
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:05,968
Don't move! Move again and I'll cut him!

790
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,757
Drop the knife, Sammy.
Drop the knife!

791
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:10,862
What the hell are you doing
here with my kids?

792
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,454
That bitch put a screwdriver
through my hand...

793
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:15,940
I don't wanna hear it now.
Drop the knife!

794
01:11:16,024 --> 01:11:19,201
- She put a screwdriver through my hand!
- Drop the knife, man! Drop it!

795
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:21,558
You owe me money, Rob!
You owe me money!

796
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:25,283
Drop the knife on the floor!
Drop the knife!

797
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:27,437
- All right. It's down. It's down.
- Drop the knife!

798
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:29,011
It's down.

799
01:11:29,095 --> 01:11:30,095
That's good.

800
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:34,081
Let go off my kids. That's good.
Don't worry, baby. You go with mom.

801
01:11:36,252 --> 01:11:37,492
You didn't answer my question.

802
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:41,496
- Look what she did to my hand.
- What're you doing here with my kids?

803
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,263
- What, are you some kind of pedophile?
- You owe me money!

804
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,994
What is that?

805
01:11:47,078 --> 01:11:48,718
The tree branch fell, baby.

806
01:11:49,761 --> 01:11:51,488
Jessica, where are you going off to?

807
01:11:52,882 --> 01:11:54,328
Thank you for coming back.

808
01:11:55,298 --> 01:11:57,143
I just wanna get the kids outta here.

809
01:11:57,683 --> 01:11:59,278
I just need my car keys.

810
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,429
The kids are safe.

811
01:12:01,327 --> 01:12:03,307
Sammy won't hurt them now.
I took care of it.

812
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:05,255
- Come on.
- So…

813
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:08,675
Was this about your Nana's money?

814
01:12:16,507 --> 01:12:18,707
I think that was easier
to pull up than to take down.

815
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:22,730
I need to get the kids to the doctor.

816
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:26,109
Well, they look fine to me.

817
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,003
Don't be such a helicopter parent.

818
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,916
They're hungry. We need to eat.
It's freezing. And my hand is infected.

819
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,110
Yeah, uh…

820
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,890
Looks like you had a little fun in here.

821
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:55,883
I didn't. I'm still clean.

822
01:13:01,234 --> 01:13:04,158
Holy shit, you weren't lying.

823
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:10,356
Holy shit balls!

824
01:13:10,973 --> 01:13:13,575
Fuck! Baby.

825
01:13:17,595 --> 01:13:19,315
Do you know what this will buy us?

826
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,693
You can take it, okay?
Just have all of it.

827
01:13:22,254 --> 01:13:24,068
Just go and leave us alone.

828
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:30,952
You never shot it?

829
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:37,181
Wanna try?

830
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,394
Come on, we'll do it together.

831
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:48,772
Okay.

832
01:13:51,914 --> 01:13:53,101
Okay?

833
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:54,452
Yeah, I'm ready, let's do it.

834
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:01,839
There's food out in the car.
I wanna feed the kids first.

835
01:14:03,209 --> 01:14:04,705
We should eat something too.

836
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,555
It's important to eat or we'll get sick.
You know that.

837
01:14:14,734 --> 01:14:15,787
Yeah.

838
01:14:16,294 --> 01:14:18,128
Yeah. All right. Let's eat first.

839
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,427
I'll get the food, you stay here.

840
01:14:38,571 --> 01:14:40,348
Can I have some?

841
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:41,581
No, baby.

842
01:14:41,665 --> 01:14:43,281
This is for Daddy.

843
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:46,009
He's bringing our food in from the car.

844
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:49,212
Daddy's bad.

845
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:52,334
Yeah. He is.

846
01:15:02,058 --> 01:15:03,058
Jess, you're ready?

847
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:05,506
I've got some better stuff here.

848
01:15:06,052 --> 01:15:08,292
I just picked it up on my way over.

849
01:15:10,082 --> 01:15:11,382
Better than what you gave me.

850
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:14,442
You said it was pharma-great.

851
01:15:15,992 --> 01:15:17,392
Yeah, well, I was wrong.

852
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:20,506
That shit's got heavy.
I took one hit and lost it pretty bad.

853
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,275
That's why I got here so like…

854
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:23,899
So it wasn't my fault.

855
01:15:24,843 --> 01:15:26,583
I'm glad you didn't take it.

856
01:15:27,097 --> 01:15:28,604
I'm sticking to crystals for now.

857
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,773
I'm not hungry, don't worry about it.

858
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,890
You need to eat first.

859
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:44,554
You saw the way Sammy was,
just wasted away.

860
01:15:48,135 --> 01:15:49,649
You have to make yourself eat.

861
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,973
Even when you don't feel like it.

862
01:15:56,829 --> 01:15:57,882
Yeah.

863
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:00,256
Yeah, you're right.

864
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:03,106
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

865
01:16:23,106 --> 01:16:24,106
That's good.

866
01:16:26,424 --> 01:16:27,651
What is this crap?

867
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:30,482
Looks like little old crap, you know?

868
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:33,102
It's my Nana's apple butter.

869
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,460
Eat up.

870
01:17:06,675 --> 01:17:08,799
Can we do that in the living room, please?

871
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,109
I don't want the kids to see.

872
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:15,748
Yeah, sure.

873
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:34,644
Your turn.

874
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:38,659
Here.

875
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,688
I'm not ready yet.

876
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,015
I'll do it later.

877
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:56,235
No way.

878
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,027
Come on, we're doing this together.

879
01:18:00,504 --> 01:18:01,504
Hurry up.

880
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:04,773
I got one more hit in this needle.

881
01:18:06,673 --> 01:18:08,028
Well, I wanna clean needle.

882
01:18:11,879 --> 01:18:12,883
You tie yourself off.

883
01:18:19,548 --> 01:18:21,381
It's for your own good.

884
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:27,761
Hey. Hey.

885
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:29,767
I don't wanna hurt you, Jess.

886
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,050
I never did.

887
01:18:43,021 --> 01:18:44,101
Come on.

888
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,389
My hand is hurt.

889
01:18:48,117 --> 01:18:49,144
Come here.

890
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:52,953
Bitch!

891
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:56,413
Get up and tie yourself off
before I shoot you in your face!

892
01:18:58,830 --> 01:18:59,830
That's right.

893
01:19:03,468 --> 01:19:04,751
Come on.

894
01:19:04,835 --> 01:19:06,268
Go ahead and kill me.

895
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:11,958
Tie yourself off!

896
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:19,886
Hey. Hey.

897
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:21,379
Where are you going, Jess?

898
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:24,019
Where are you going, Jessica?

899
01:19:25,163 --> 01:19:26,736
Where are you going, Jess?

900
01:19:31,818 --> 01:19:32,924
Get back here!

901
01:19:35,588 --> 01:19:36,843
Come on, Jess!

902
01:19:39,144 --> 01:19:40,784
Why are you running away from me, huh?

903
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:44,612
I'm gonna stick this needle
in your arm. I'm doing it.

904
01:19:46,066 --> 01:19:48,393
Shit, you gotta make this
so hard on yourself?

905
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,829
You got to rehab one time.

906
01:19:50,913 --> 01:19:54,306
You think you're better than everyone
and you cut me out like I'm nothing?

907
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:57,318
Like I said,

908
01:19:57,402 --> 01:20:00,678
the only problem between us is that
you think that you're better than me.

909
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:03,107
But you're not.

910
01:20:03,191 --> 01:20:05,067
All right? We're the same.

911
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,230
We're the same.

912
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:17,533
Goddamnit.

913
01:20:26,902 --> 01:20:28,296
You're OD'ing.

914
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:30,715
What'd you give me, Jess?

915
01:20:30,799 --> 01:20:33,042
I gave you three grams
of your shitty-cut meth.

916
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,845
The stuff that you locked me up with.

917
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:38,919
While my babies cold and alone.

918
01:20:39,003 --> 01:20:40,509
And in danger.

919
01:20:41,029 --> 01:20:43,742
And I was rotting away
in the fucking pantry.

920
01:20:44,978 --> 01:20:46,151
You're nothing!

921
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:48,634
I'm not nothing.

922
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,616
I'll break you, Jess.

923
01:22:11,852 --> 01:22:13,273
APPLE BUTTER

924
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:55,006
Oh, really? Oh, really?

925
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,742
Mommy, I got you an apple, it was hiding.

926
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:02,645
You did? Let's take a look at it.
Come here.

927
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:05,989
Hey.

928
01:23:08,768 --> 01:23:10,413
I got some good news.

929
01:23:10,497 --> 01:23:13,644
Cafe in town ordered 20 jars
of Nana's apple butter.

930
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:16,120
They gonna put it
on their pecan waffles.

931
01:23:16,236 --> 01:23:18,181
- Isn't that cool?
- Is it good? Is it good?

932
01:23:19,155 --> 01:23:20,215
Is the apple good?

933
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,011
Well…

934
01:23:24,553 --> 01:23:26,867
Just one little brown spot here.

935
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,091
We cut it out.

936
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:35,140
These are good parts, remember?

937
01:23:49,217 --> 01:23:51,909
Okay, baby, let's practice
the ABC's, okay?

938
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,626
Ready?

"If the apples have turned don't throw
them out unless they're completely rotten.

945
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:23,511
Otherwise, cut out the bad spots
and keep the good parts.

946
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:25,309
Not many people know this secret,

947
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:29,036
but these apples
make the best apple butter."
