2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,869
Mommy!

3
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,236
What brings you to the center?

4
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,953
Complete tear of the anterior
cruciate ligaments in my right leg.

5
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,669
That must hurt.

6
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,514
Yes, it hurts.

7
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,915
Can you talk me through your accident?

8
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,630
l was going downhill, too fast I guess.

9
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
My skis got tangled and...

10
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,594
I went flying.

11
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,118
Why did you fall that particular day?

12
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,909
I don't know.

13
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,355
Most likely,
I was going too fast and l...

14
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,956
My skis got tangled...

15
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,510
Why did your skis get tangled?

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,956
Sometimes we lose sight of things.

17
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,510
We don't know where we're going,
we're running, we're rushing,

18
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,750
we're looking ahead, never behind.

19
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,109
We trip and fall.

20
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,115
Right?

21
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,229
Sometimes
we can't get back on our feet.

22
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,278
Say "my knee," will you?

23
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,270
Slowly.

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,670
Please.

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,154
"My knee."

26
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,590
"Me-ll

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,876
"We."

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,993
What if I'd said shoulder?

29
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,071
- What then?
- It doesn't work every time.

30
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,675
But I'll read you something

31
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,871
and you tell me what you think.

32
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,918
"The knee
signifies the capacity to let go,

33
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,355
"give way

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,515
"or even retreat,

35
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,150
"since it is a joint
that allows only backward flexion.

36
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,158
"Pain in the knee

37
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,516
"suggests that one has difficulty

38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,035
"accepting an event in one's life,

39
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,632
"and healing proceeds
along the same psychological path."

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,716
It may be pop psychology,

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,190
but think it over

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,435
and come back to talk again.

43
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,116
Sure.

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,839
What happened?

45
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,635
Recognize me?

46
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,350
No.

47
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,957
- Can't you go eat together?
- No, not without you.

48
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,992
We need you to defend us.

49
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,835
You look like death warmed over.
Who'd hassle you at this time?

50
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,516
Dream on!

51
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,394
Who'd hit on two zombies

52
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,552
coming out of a club?

53
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,755
I'm going to bed.

54
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,792
I did recognize you earlier.

55
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,075
Just not right away.

56
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,229
Tony, we're gone.

57
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,231
Now it's all coming back.

58
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,550
Tony.

59
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,914
Your name's Tony.

60
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,675
Right?

61
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,513
- I knew it was a man's name.
- Where'd we meet?

62
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,636
Faces before names.
You remember me?

63
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,552
You remembered my face.

64
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,156
Earlier, you rock up
and flick water in my face.

65
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,675
- You don't remember my face.
- I do.

66
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,239
Love you, Tony.

67
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,835
How about breakfast?

68
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,557
Let's go have breakfast.
Look me in the eye and say no.

69
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,955
- See?
- Wait a second, I can do it.

70
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,155
- Wait for what?
- I'll do it.

71
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,957
Go on.

72
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,319
2, 3, you lose!

73
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,238
Come on, breakfast!

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,512
No, come on, please!

75
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,635
Jeez!

76
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,034
Check out the mural.

77
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,155
Mind-boggling.

78
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,350
So, we have a foosball table.

79
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,275
Overgrown teen.

80
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,230
Out of tune.

81
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,558
Nice place you have here.

82
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,276
Check out the rest if you want.

83
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,548
I won't be long.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,796
What?

85
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,829
Can I just say...

86
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,390
Rich or poor, your feet still stink.

87
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,030
A hint of truffle in hot chocolate.

88
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,158
You don't shave it, just grate it.

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,231
It's not cheese, it's a truffle.

90
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,710
The simplest things are the best.

91
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,879
What do you do?

92
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,275
| make food.

93
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,550
You're a cook?

94
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,156
Not anymore. I own a restaurant.

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,118
- You did business or culinary school?
- Neither.

96
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,033
I realized I enjoyed
making people happy.

97
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,072
If it's partly down to me,

98
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,115
| feel like I serve a purpose.

99
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,396
Magnificent.

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,353
What about you guys?

101
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,834
| sell clothes.

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,274
That I choose.

103
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,548
A bit like you,
I enjoy making people happy.

104
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,513
Giving them style, allure, personality.

105
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,229
Solal?

106
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,958
My thing in life
is making myself happy.

107
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,078
So, I do nothing.
That's when I'm happiest.

108
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,990
Right.

109
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,389
And you, Tony?

110
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,715
I'm a lawyer.

111
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,678
You don't run with intellectuals?

112
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,512
It's not that, it's...

113
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,198
- Criminal lawyer?
- Sure.

114
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,236
Criminal law?

115
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,675
- Not only, but some.
- Foosball time.

116
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,832
- You're sick of me talking shop.
- I'm interested.

117
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,708
Make an effort or else it's boring.

118
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,108
If it makes you happy.

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,391
So, where did we meet?

120
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,919
We met at

121
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,509
Le Pulp.

122
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,159
- The club?
- Long ago.

123
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,550
l tended bar when l was a student.

124
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,516
Stop.

125
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,638
And I think
you were a solid regular.

126
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,279
Hanging around the bar,

127
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,000
dipping your hand in ice buckets
and doing that...

128
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,669
To the girls.

129
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,517
As if to say, you...

130
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,392
You're going to bed with me.

131
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,555
It worked?

132
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,233
Pretty good, yeah.

133
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,959
So you imitated me.

134
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,873
I thought you'd remember
that we met back then.

135
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,836
Cute.

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,276
- But you didn't.
- Not at all, but it worked. Look...

137
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,639
- What?
- What you wanted.

138
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,113
- Breakfast with you is what I wanted?
- Sure.

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,519
No, I wanted...

140
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,070
See you.

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,395
See you...

142
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,952
Very soon, I hope.

143
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,518
Can I give you my mobile?

144
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,749
If you want.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,035
Catch.

146
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,835
The code

147
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,997
is 1-7-7-6.

148
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,509
He's fantastic.

149
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,028
Yeah, fantastic.

150
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,350
I love him.

151
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,159
You want my mobile?

152
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,670
Catch.

153
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,035
Solal!

154
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,750
How come it works for those guys?
And with me, never!

155
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,118
When you throw her your phone,
she's like...

156
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,591
And you're like...

157
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,633
That's so not true!

158
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,231
Prop your knee back on here.

159
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,670
There.

160
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,756
You want to finish up on your own?

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,796
Here, take the shower.

162
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,038
I'm in the next room, okay?

163
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,030
Sit down.

164
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,030
Hey.

165
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,909
You okay?

166
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,035
Good, and you?

167
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,639
Not bad at all.

168
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,552
- Your mobile.
- Thank you.

169
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,994
You didn't miss it?

170
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,079
You didn't miss me?

171
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,071
What's this?

172
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,912
The list of people who called.

173
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,992
Can I get an espresso?

174
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,354
No, sorry, don't.

175
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,755
- We don't have time.
- How come?

176
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,550
I want you to see something, like now.

177
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,274
My dear friends,

178
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,558
we can be fearless

179
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,869
before God.

180
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,594
Whatever we ask,
we shall receive from Him...

181
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,835
Recognize me?

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,830
Take a seat.

183
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,079
| see that everybody's here.

184
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,151
lf everybody's in position,

185
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,514
we can go on.

186
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,710
Thanks.

187
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,234
If you'd all please stand...

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Marie, before God and your witnesses,

189
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,714
| invite you to take your vows.

190
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,673
Do you take as your husband, Slim,

191
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,116
to love and to hold
till death do you part?

192
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,109
I do.

193
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,874
And you, Slim,

194
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,952
do you take Marie

195
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,275
as your wife,

196
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,433
to love and to hold
till death do you part?

197
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,516
I do.

198
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,192
You don't put it on!

199
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,076
Here.

200
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,834
- Done.
- The kiss!

201
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,390
| now pronounce you husband and wife.

202
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,994
What is it?

203
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,711
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

204
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,154
Tell me what's wrong.

205
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,159
You didn't feel that l was...

206
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,709
too...

207
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,995
Too what?

208
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,548
Too open.

209
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,069
Too open?

210
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,709
Minded?

211
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,198
What are you talking about?

212
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,679
Too open where?

213
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,159
Too open inside.

214
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,635
Your pussy?

215
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,716
No.

216
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,114
Not at all.

217
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,999
It was wonderful.

218
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,435
It was perfect, I promise you.

219
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,759
Why'd you say that?

220
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,039
That's why you're crying?

221
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,709
What's wrong?

222
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,038
Somebody told you that?

223
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,194
Who told you that?

224
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,589
Tell me. I'll punch his lights out.

225
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,875
Who said that?

226
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,549
Who's the idiot who told you that?

227
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,150
Only a guy with a small dick
says that, babe.

228
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,879
Your pussy is...

229
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,793
It's like a mouth.

230
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,908
Without teeth.

231
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,149
Just ideal.

232
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,351
A pussy like an old lady's mouth.

233
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,115
- No, seriously.
- Who told you that?

234
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,909
My...

235
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,990
Tell me, which asshole said that?

236
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,189
My ex-husband.

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,994
Before he left?

238
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,428
As grounds for...

239
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,316
separation.

240
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,077
Your pussy's like that, ciao.

241
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,673
I gotta go, I found a chick
with one like that.

242
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,955
Right?

243
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,719
- Cool guy.
- Exactly.

244
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,677
You married a great guy.

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,878
You've gotta stop
meeting jerks, you know.

246
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,634
You're not a jerk, are you?

247
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,370
No

248
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,598
Huge hesitation.

249
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,637
I'm not a jerk, l'm...

250
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,959
the king of jerks.

251
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,514
Get it?

252
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,079
I thought as much.

253
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,868
I'm the captain, | send them along...

254
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,316
I love you.

255
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,231
You can't love me so soon.

256
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,516
Can't I?

257
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,150
No.

258
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,029
What time is it?

259
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,913
I'll wait ten minutes.

260
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,072
I'm not asking for that much.

261
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,709
Five?

262
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,110
We'll just rotate your leg a little.

263
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,352
You can't extend it further?

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,959
That's as far as it goes?

265
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,599
We'll make do with that.

266
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,079
Hold still.

267
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,435
Here we go. Stay very still.

268
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,709
Yes, | see.

269
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,352
The knee's swollen again.

270
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,432
There we are, 60.

271
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,278
Rémi has some work to do.

272
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,553
First to get the swelling down.

273
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,631
Then to recover mobility.

274
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,230
What's up?

275
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,952
- l was passing by.
- You said not to expect you.

276
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,836
Wendy!

277
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,074
- Hey there!
- Hello.

278
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,559
Show the lady...

279
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,195
to table 4.

280
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,550
Evening.

281
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,753
Fire me up another king prawns, please.
For table 8.

282
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,352
We'll take good care of you.

283
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,276
Remember me?

284
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,598
Sure, at the wedding.

285
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,029
And the nightclub.

286
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,315
You smoke?

287
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,271
No.

288
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,557
There's a smoke shop opposite.

289
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,959
You stole my man.

290
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,199
You could at least
buy me a pack of cigarettes.

291
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,950
- What are you doing?
- Chatting.

292
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,075
You need sugar?

293
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,355
On the bar.

294
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,357
| see. I'm not welcome.

295
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,231
Well spotted.

296
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,197
Excuse me. Do your thing.

297
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,956
Cheers!

298
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,829
Who is that girl?

299
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,836
Agnes.

300
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,189
But to you?

301
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,756
We were together five years,
broke up three years ago.

302
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,115
She's a bit strange.

303
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,510
She's not well, on antidepressants.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,797
I've become a kind of brother.

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,638
Or mother, I don't know.

306
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,676
She sensed someone new in my life

307
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,751
and she came to stir shit.

308
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,151
It's the first time there's someone new
since you broke up?

309
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,236
Yes.

310
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,949
What's that mean?

311
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,873
You don't meet someone new
every five minutes.

312
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,429
Or I don't.

313
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,675
You, maybe.

314
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,910
On a lighter note,

315
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,350
the chef has prepared for you, miss,

316
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,112
king prawns
roasted in armagnac, Catalan style.

317
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,669
Sound good?

318
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,313
That pot, there.

319
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,192
Gentlemen, you're done. Finished.

320
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,430
- Nearly done.
- No, you're done.

321
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,789
Thank you.

322
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,996
- Enjoy your evening.
- You too.

323
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,519
I want this place tidy!

324
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,917
- Fast.
- What are you doing?

325
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,115
Tidy!

326
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,389
Georgio!

327
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,155
Joseph!

328
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,714
I'd like you to meet

329
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,074
the love of my life!

330
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,039
Welcome to my humble dispensary, miss.

331
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,997
As far as your eye can see,

332
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,912
take whatever you want.

333
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,274
- It's yours.
- Is this yours?

334
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,793
- No, all yours.
- All mine?

335
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,200
Joseph and I

336
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,558
make it our gift to you.

337
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,679
Help yourself.
To creams, to toothbrushes.

338
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,712
To venom pumps!

339
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,752
I'll add it all to his tab.

340
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,875
As usual.

341
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,669
Some Xanax.

342
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,799
Please. Two boxes.

343
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,912
For you? You're on that?

344
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,069
'Course not!

345
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,559
Why do you take that?

346
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,109
Tell me, what about Viagra?

347
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,868
Yes, Viagra.

348
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,078
We have some, naturally.

349
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,580
- I'd like to try.
- Cut it Out.

350
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,715
You want some fun?

351
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,518
- Dangerous for the heart?
- No.

352
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,591
No risks? The liver?

353
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,590
No problem.

354
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,315
- I'll take one box.
- You don't need it.

355
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,511
- How long's it last?
- 12 hours.

356
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,795
12 hours!

357
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,671
- You're getting it?
- I want to try.

358
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,308
- I hear it's...
- Totally. lt's radical.

359
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,751
Puts a spring in your step.
Out in the street, oh, sorry.

360
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,751
You hear about the new one?

361
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,194
It's called Viazac.

362
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,592
A combo of Viagra and Prozac.

363
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,069
You can't get it up,
but you don't care.

364
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,077
For now, just Viagra.

365
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,559
You dated her?

366
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,870
I didn't date her. I met her once...

367
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,439
Georgio, you can tell me.

368
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,516
Yes!

369
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,238
Yes, I slept with her!

370
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,277
But I can't remember her name.

371
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,431
That has to tell you something.

372
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,634
I don't get it.

373
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,076
Besides me, or before me,

374
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,039
you only dated models?

375
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,230
No.

376
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,996
You dated normal girls?

377
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,235
What's normal?

378
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,516
A girl like me. A normal girl.

379
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,513
You think you're normal?

380
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,671
- Sure I am.
- You're not at all normal.

381
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,956
I am. You know what I mean.

382
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,108
Look, l was young, l was stupid.

383
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,875
I wanted to date beautiful women
to feel good about myself.

384
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,913
Some folks, it's cars.
Me, it was models.

385
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,513
That's all, it's no...

386
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,839
It's pretty shallow.

387
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,276
See...

388
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,874
Listen.

389
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,915
- I prefer a girl like you.
- Yeah, I bet.

390
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,071
To a whole harem of them.

391
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,434
- Really?
- Yes.

392
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,913
Are you comfortable there? Need a hand?

393
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,352
I'll bring you the menu.

394
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,836
- What are you doing?
- lroning.

395
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,228
What's going on?

396
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,949
I need to relax.

397
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,439
I'm on edge, can't sleep.

398
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,675
Anything wrong?

399
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,232
I want a baby from you.

400
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,832
Don't laugh when I say that.

401
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,949
Don't laugh!

402
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,997
I want a baby from you, seriously.

403
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,359
I want a little guy or girl,
whatever comes along.

404
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,158
With your face, your eyes.

405
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,958
With your crappy moods.

406
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,397
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

407
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,592
- It's not an urge, it's a need.
- It is an urge.

408
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,313
I never wanted one.

409
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,273
It meant nothing to me.
Now, I'm ready.

410
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,908
We'll see
if you're still ready tomorrow.

411
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,791
You're out of your mind!

412
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,796
- You're not laughing now.
- You madman!

413
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,952
You're gonna make me a baby?
Make me a baby!

414
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,513
Come to bed.

415
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,279
You go. I'll do some shirts.

416
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,998
No, come to bed with me.

417
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,750
Come on.

418
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,070
- Sure you'll sleep?
- I think so, yes.

419
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,435
- You think so?
- Yes, with Iron Man.

420
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,436
Oh yeah?

421
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,069
- Okay, sure.
- Sure what?

422
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,435
- Hand back my shorts.
- Okay.

423
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,834
On the subject,
"Must You Ruin Everything?"

424
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,152
the next speaker is Ms. Tony Jezequel

425
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,313
for the opposition.

426
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,518
Hypocritical Secretaries,

427
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,032
friends and brothers,

428
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,358
must you ruin everything?

429
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,756
As if the world were new?

430
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,118
As if it were the ﬁrst morning?

431
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,712
As if it were still dawn ?

432
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,233
Can he still catch up?

433
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,232
Let me get into the horse's head.

434
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,990
The truth, honorable Secretaries,

435
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,636
is that what has already been ruined,

436
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,516
our founding disillusion,

437
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,908
is our freedom.

438
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,355
We won!

439
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,435
You must have nothing to lose
to love heart and soul.

440
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,868
You must eclipse the giddiest heights
to dare to plunge headlong.

441
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,035
You must endure the fall of empires
and the greatest storms

442
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,396
to be together in that moment.

443
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,278
You must have lived,

444
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,033
you must have lost,

445
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,679
o i/er and again,

446
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,637
to triumph with you.

447
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,989
Love is nothing
when it’s new, clean and pure.

448
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,355
Love before the storm
is not a decision.

449
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,390
It’s a decree.

450
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,270
When the event,
accident or opportunity occurs,

451
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,395
be there.

452
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,629
Standing.

453
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,716
Find the word, action or look.

454
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,869
Yes, my love,

455
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,753
in that moment,

456
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,639
rely on me.

457
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,673
I won't go missing.

458
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,553
At that minute,

459
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,754
I'll be there.

460
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,549
And so,

461
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,599
I predict,

462
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,991
we shall be the winners.

463
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,837
All is lost, for nothing is won.
Where are you?

464
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,716
My love,

465
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,957
a mouth, a second, a touch.
I'll be there.

466
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,874
I saw your aside to Georgio.
Where are you?

467
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,950
Here!

468
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,075
There.

469
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,639
Was I so ridiculous?

470
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,959
Not ridiculous, theatrical.

471
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,795
Listen. It wasn't ridiculous,
it was super moving.

472
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,316
I felt I was seeing
a part of you for the first time.

473
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,315
It was magnificent, beautiful even.

474
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,190
- I had you in tears too?
- Quit poking fun at her!

475
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,148
It's beautiful, she gave of herself.
She took a risk in life!

476
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,116
Your caviar.

477
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,074
With an egg?

478
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,959
Maybe with the beluga.

479
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,269
The beluga!

480
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,670
This is the best caviar
or there's better?

481
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,595
Best doesn't mean anything in caviar.
It's the size of the eggs

482
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,239
that makes the difference.

483
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,073
Fact is,
caviar comes from saltwater sturgeon...

484
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,990
Not only.

485
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,710
- They're freshwater fish?
- They're both.

486
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,711
Wanna bet?

487
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,632
Sir, we need your expertise.

488
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,790
500.

489
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,868
Okay, tell me...

490
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,515
Sturgeons live in the sea, right?

491
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,351
Actually, in both habitats.

492
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,152
Salt water and fresh water.

493
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,436
Fine.

494
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,311
Here...

495
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,398
You big fat tart.

496
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,554
You take his money?

497
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,119
Of course. I won it.

498
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,713
It's a game, Solal.

499
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,119
Are you not feeling well?

500
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,794
Fat tart's cute, like sweettart.

501
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,918
No, it means what it says.
Big fat whore.

502
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,038
I'm not smart enough
to understand the difference.

503
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,992
Chug that caviar!

504
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,995
I didn't say that.
| just said your style's medieval.

505
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,950
I'd love to be someone's big fat tart.

506
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,759
Don't come crying to us.

507
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,110
C'mon, you play sex games
with your wife or...

508
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,713
- I doubt it.
- Sure they do.

509
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,790
She coats my...

510
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,439
hair with sunflower oil.

511
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,195
She's not my fat tart.

512
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,554
What's that ring?

513
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,755
A gift from Babeth.

514
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,313
What's written on it?

515
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,111
I had it engraved
with a sublime letter he wrote me.

516
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,430
- The whole letter? The full text?
- Yes.

517
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,709
Beautiful.

518
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,312
Babeth and l are going...

519
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,316
Up the aisle?

520
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,829
Not going up the aisle,
rolling in the aisles!

521
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,315
- Let's look together.
- No, I'm looking!

522
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,269
We look together.

523
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,714
It says you're pregnant?

524
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,069
How many lines?

525
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,636
Two lines.

526
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,631
- You're pregnant?
- I'm pregnant?

527
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,915
I'm pregnant.

528
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,748
I'm pregnant!

529
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,953
Thank you, you're pregnant.

530
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,515
You're pleased?

531
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,030
Yes.

532
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,989
You okay?

533
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,595
Are you okay?

534
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,352
I can feel my ribcage

535
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,679
constricting.

536
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,039
How old is it now?

537
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,758
Maybe one month.

538
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,309
One month old?

539
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,996
Hold on, it's this big.

540
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,195
A marble.

541
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,153
Sweetheart,

542
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,959
I never said I wasn't happy with Daddy.

543
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,510
We were very happy, your dad and me,
we had a lot of fun.

544
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,078
We did crazy things.

545
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,439
But, at some point,
it all stopped being fun.

546
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,319
Yes, grownups are complicated.
That's why I tell you to enjoy it.

547
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,511
Make the most of your childhood.

548
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,750
Later, it starts getting complicated.

549
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,793
Okay, in that case,

550
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,037
hang up like Daddy said
and we'll talk tomorrow.

551
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,831
I love you.

552
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,550
Bye.

553
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,512
Georgio Milevski,

554
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,875
do you take
as your lawful wedded wife

555
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,032
Marie-Antoinette Jezequel?

556
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,431
I do.

557
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,392
Marie-Antoinette Jezequel,

558
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,674
do you take
as your lawful wedded husband

559
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,274
Georgio Milevski?

560
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,269
I don't.

561
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,995
I do.

562
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,076
I hear you came without rings.

563
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,916
- Us?
- You're the bride and groom.

564
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,639
We didn't want any.

565
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,233
l pronounce you

566
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,992
husband and wife.

567
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,516
What were Georgio and Tony
doing on top of the cake?

568
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,159
Naughty newlyweds!

569
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,274
To the happy couple!

570
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,832
I'd love some salami.

571
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,832
Does Georgio Milevski,

572
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,758
to whom I give my sister...

573
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,709
Bullshit.

574
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,755
Temporarily.

575
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,354
I'd like to know, how come no rings?

576
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,358
We don't need rings, this is the future.

577
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,515
It's called
consumm-eating your marriage!

578
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,591
Tony! Cut the damn thing.

579
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,630
Agnes!

580
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,199
Agnes, dammit!

581
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,195
Holy shit!

582
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,433
Sir, leave this to us.

583
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,078
We have the tablets here.

584
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,629
Miss, if you hear me, squeeze my hand.

585
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,952
- Fuck!
- I told you to keep an eye on her.

586
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,909
She's breathing?

587
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,035
- Is she breathing?
- Just a second, sir.

588
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,679
Watch out, the knife.

589
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,315
Okay, she's breathing.

590
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,034
She's breathing.

591
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,398
Ready? Lift!

592
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,638
- Where'll you take her?
- Cochin.

593
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,597
No, the American Hospital.

594
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,034
I know a guy there.

595
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,434
You're family? A friend?

596
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,629
A friend.

597
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,233
Do you know
if she's on antidepressants or anything?

598
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,914
Abilify, 5 mg. Three times a day.

599
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,991
- l'll pack a bag for her.
- Please.

600
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,509
- Her doctor prescribed it?
- Dr. Ménes.

601
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,674
Various narcotics, happy pills.

602
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,912
- Such as?
- Cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy.

603
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,996
Amphetamines.

604
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,709
I'm okay.

605
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,278
You know why she did it?

606
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,035
Do you?

607
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,436
Yes.

608
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,670
Why?

609
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,113
I told her you were pregnant.

610
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,955
So the baby is head down,
which is favorable.

611
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,236
Can you put the heart on again?

612
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,994
It won't be long now. Here it comes.

613
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,997
See?

614
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,388
Abdomen, a limb, brain...

615
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,109
Everything's fine. Nothing to report.

616
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,918
Everything's just fine.

617
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,954
He's a little bit emotional because...

618
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,190
That's a good thing. It's good.

619
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,595
Shimon Peres.

620
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,320
The first ever ultrasound
by Shimon Peres.

621
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,238
- You know, don't you?
- Yes.

622
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,393
We don't want to know. No telling, okay?

623
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,675
Big nose...

624
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,629
Say it.

625
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,631
With your head. Nod yes or...

626
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,675
- Was that a wink?
- You don't want to hear.

627
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,955
Don't say it.

628
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,515
Mime it.

629
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,711
Don't tell me if you know.

630
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,518
At any rate, he's...

631
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,314
It's very beautiful.

632
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,549
Our baby.

633
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,112
Can we circumcise immediately?

634
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,319
Who knows
if there's anything to circumcise?

635
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,272
- What makes you think it's a boy?
- I don't know. He said he.

636
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,634
He said it. The baby.

637
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,233
That's it, baby.

638
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,750
Sorry.

639
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,673
No, I think it's wonderful. Very good.

640
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,834
She's awake?

641
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,995
Is she conscious?

642
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,033
What's the doctor say?

643
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,512
What does the doctor say?

644
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,918
Has she eaten anything?

645
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,709
No, you go.

646
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,155
Call me after.

647
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,518
So it's just a matter of options.

648
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,954
And design.

649
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,799
The color's not an issue.

650
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,831
Wheels, rocking or standard.

651
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,989
Okay.

652
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,869
Well?

653
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,034
Like she said...

654
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,399
Which do you prefer?

655
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,029
If it's too deep, you hurt your back.

656
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,713
The height's adjustable.

657
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,159
Look, honestly...

658
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,669
I don't care. Get whichever you want.

659
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,070
Seriously, wheels, rocking...

660
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,916
Right, that one.

661
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,149
There you go.

662
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,509
What about...

663
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,675
You're awake?

664
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,716
Give me a second, I'll call you back.

665
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,198
Get the one you want.

666
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,150
You choose.

667
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,958
I'll be on the phone.

668
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,549
Georgio!

669
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,309
lt's Agnes.

670
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,913
You took your pills?

671
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,673
Why? What's wrong?

672
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,429
Sleep. I'll be back.

673
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,953
Just practice flexing it.

674
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,509
Go as far as you can without pain.

675
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,592
If it hurts,
you let it straighten up again.

676
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,952
I'm here for six weeks, all in all.

677
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,436
You?

678
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,433
Five.
But I'll go mad cooped up here.

679
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,873
When I leave here,
you think I'll be walking?

680
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,677
Sure.

681
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,599
You're nuts.

682
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,751
You'll never walk in 5 weeks.

683
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,670
She will.

684
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,035
Cruciate rehab?
6 months to 4 years.

685
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,030
What?

686
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,037
If she's lucky, Nabil.

687
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,997
It's at least 2 years. Seriously.

688
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,152
- The doctors are bullshitting me?
- They're kidding you!

689
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,789
She's no athlete,
she's not 20 anymore.

690
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,748
Hold on, I'm not saying you're old.

691
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,396
Straight up, it's true about your knee.

692
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,350
The minimum?

693
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,597
To walk as if nothing had ever happened?

694
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,309
Now that's...

695
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,518
That'd be freaky.

696
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,955
Man overboard!

697
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,591
Know who I had dinner with yesterday?

698
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,836
No.

699
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,115
Your father.

700
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,757
He calls me every Sunday.

701
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,158
To see how I'm doing. If I'm holding up.

702
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,035
He always said he likes you a lot.

703
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,838
We like each other a lot.

704
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,032
He'd really like

705
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,838
to see you more often.

706
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,355
I take note.

707
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,597
I'll do all I can
to rectify the situation,

708
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,832
which I would rather
not have neglected in recent months.

709
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,831
You mean me or him?

710
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,117
In this instance, my father.

711
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,508
It's becoming a habit.

712
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,596
To?

713
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,272
To have to rectify situations
neglected for months and months.

714
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,549
Where are you?

715
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,829
Okay.

716
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,549
Bye.

717
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,549
Please...

718
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,633
It's okay, I give up.

719
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,711
I give up looking after her.

720
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,995
No more.

721
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,955
Hear me?

722
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,711
I had to look after her one last time.
Now, no more.

723
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,149
Tony, please.

724
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,953
Listen to me.

725
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,512
l have a right to your attention.

726
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,114
No, your credit's run out. It's over.

727
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,032
Finished. I'm leaving you.

728
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
You can't leave me like this.

729
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,232
- Just because I'm a bit late.
- Just because you're late?

730
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,439
- You're shitting me?
- No.

731
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,599
You don't think I'm leaving you
because you're late? Seriously?

732
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,433
I think
you're deciding this tonight...

733
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,868
Or decided tonight...

734
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,359
l'm deciding tonight

735
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,030
after it's escalated
for many long weeks and months.

736
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,792
And l was very patient.

737
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,310
Look".

738
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,393
I won't look after her anymore.

739
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,717
It's too late.
I don't give a damn about her.

740
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,909
I couldn't leave the girl to croak.
Get it?

741
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,195
Don't go.

742
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,319
Stop, please.

743
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,796
Stop!

744
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,792
You have to eat something.

745
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,678
Look on the bright side.

746
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,149
Right now...

747
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,555
you're sad.

748
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,110
But, and there is a but,

749
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,394
you're better off alone.

750
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,831
It's like in the Leo Ferré song.

751
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,195
"As time goes, everything goes.

752
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,435
"The lost years have left you gray.

753
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,995
"You're alone but...

754
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,956
"At peace!"

755
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,071
l was upset, I'm sorry.

756
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,035
I got that.

757
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,150
And?

758
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,868
And I apologize.

759
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,276
Thanks, but it makes no difference.

760
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,876
To what?

761
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,838
l have to look after her.

762
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,273
So last night
when you said you'd stop,

763
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,032
it was just to calm me down?

764
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,389
No.

765
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,355
Last night l'd no idea
you could treat me like shit.

766
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,154
- l was upset. I apologize.
- You're often upset.

767
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,548
l have to look after her.

768
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,711
You don't have to look after her.

769
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,910
I understand, she's in a bad way.
It's horrible.

770
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,389
But I don't see
why you have to look after her.

771
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,034
She'll go to a facility
where they'll look after her.

772
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,959
Subject closed.

773
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,875
The subject is closed.

774
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,432
l have to look after her.

775
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,868
And nothing will stop me.

776
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,435
Is that clear?

777
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,395
I cry for no reason, I...

778
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,836
I can't sleep anymore.

779
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,918
I lose my temper easily.

780
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,196
I'm scared the baby will feel it.

781
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,592
I want him to feel
his mom's in a good place.

782
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,194
I mean, happy, calm...

783
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,793
In that case,

784
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,430
from your description
of these moods' duration and intensity,

785
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,959
I think it's...

786
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,437
It's preferable
that I should intervene medically,

787
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,518
with solutions
that involve medication, of course,

788
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,875
to allow you to feel better.

789
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,554
We're talking medication
that's absolutely harmless for the child.

790
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,514
What do you think?

791
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,996
I don't know.

792
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,388
How about we try it?

793
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,758
For a pregnant woman

794
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,391
to have these ups and downs
in her behavior,

795
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,874
is that the baby blues?

796
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,792
No, that comes after the birth.

797
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,757
There's more afterwards?

798
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,918
Baby blues is a depression

799
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,672
that occurs after the birth.

800
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,194
That'll be fun.

801
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,348
- Can I see you a moment?
- Of course.

802
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,515
Be right there.

803
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,551
I love you. I want this child.

804
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,956
But 24/7 with you is beyond me.

805
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,792
So I've found a little place,

806
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,032
just there, right there,

807
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,232
maybe three doors down,

808
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,919
on the same block.

809
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,111
No need to cross the street even.

810
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,270
Furnished.

811
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,033
I'll take some underwear
and a toothbrush,

812
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,270
for when I've no time to come by.

813
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,873
I'll be here all the time.

814
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,554
But when I need space or we fight,

815
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,995
when we get in each other's faces...

816
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,796
The doctor says it's a good idea.

817
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,077
That it's pointless
creating stress for no reason.

818
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,113
When are you leaving?

819
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,799
I think the landlord can give me the keys

820
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,313
early next week.

821
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,396
It'll be better.
For you, me and most of all the baby.

822
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,389
We'll only have
the good times together.

823
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,669
We'll be happy to see each other,
we'll laugh. We've lost that.

824
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,996
You okay?

825
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,870
No, not okay.

826
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,875
This is it.

827
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,788
Basically, it's an office,
with a bedroom back there.

828
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,033
Look, check it out.

829
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,311
For if you ever
sleep over with the baby.

830
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,354
Or if you're at the office
and | stay here to work,

831
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,675
I look after the baby.

832
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,635
There you go.

833
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,793
For me to stay here
it had to be offices,

834
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,396
and I met a guy
who's got a lot of talent

835
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,350
and wanted
to go into business with him...

836
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,436
Win-win.

837
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,990
Not bad, huh?

838
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,991
A kitchenette over there.

839
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,997
And this is my brother-in-law.

840
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,271
Solal.

841
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,879
You stocked up on wine.

842
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,839
Stocked up?
l have a few bottles of wine...

843
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,670
You know,
for business meals and stuff,

844
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,432
I need the bare minimum.

845
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,192
And all these glasses and plates?

846
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,311
If you're in a bad mood,
come back later.

847
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,670
I'm in a bad mood?

848
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,670
Who knows...

849
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,119
I'm in a bad mood?

850
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,311
Quit fucking with me!

851
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,069
Let me go!

852
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,877
Stop it.

853
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,951
Quit fucking with me!

854
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,948
Can't you stop a second?

855
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,519
Check her hand!

856
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,079
Let go of me!

857
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,355
You cut your hand?

858
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,709
Let me go!

859
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,075
Give her a break, you jerk!

860
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,919
Come on, let's go!

861
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,192
Good morning, Mr. Larcher and Mr. Colin,
here on orders of the court.

862
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,868
Do Mr. and Mrs. Milevski live here?

863
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,079
May I come in, please?

864
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,036
Mr. Milevski is legally bound
to repay a considerable sum

865
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,272
and we're here
to proceed with repossession.

866
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,197
Come in.

867
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,072
The locksmith and movers.

868
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,272
Could we just close the door?

869
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,432
Mr. Colin will repossess
the items of furniture listed here.

870
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,438
We'll start right away.

871
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,638
Please take a seat, ma'am.

872
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,955
Please...

873
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,797
We'll start with the inlaid table.

874
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,079
Wrap it up a little.

875
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,554
That table's mine.

876
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,837
- In what sense?
- lt belonged to my great-grandmother.

877
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,232
Ma'am, by decision of the court,
both spouses are liable for the debt.

878
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,038
l've inventoried the furniture.

879
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,158
Unfortunately,
all the furniture will have to go.

880
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,439
I'm sorry, but it's the law.
l have no choice.

881
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,834
Go ahead, gentlemen.

882
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,679
Bubble-wrap it.

883
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,676
Those two cabinets and the dresser.

884
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,795
And the table.

885
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,435
Let's start on the bedroom now.

886
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,789
The television, please.

887
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,869
Shit!

888
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,192
The little fuckers!

889
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,511
I'm sorry.

890
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,558
I know it can't be
very easy for you right now

891
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,830
to have stuff like this happen.

892
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,711
| signed the documents, I...

893
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,031
I thought it was an empty threat.

894
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,389
You see?

895
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,429
I'm sorry.

896
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,396
You're mad about your furniture?

897
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,195
Stuff you liked?

898
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,230
It's all in a warehouse
and we have a month to buy it back.

899
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,391
I'll pay and we'll pick it up.

900
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,313
They'll give it back.

901
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,272
The rest was mine, so screw that.

902
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,715
I kind of like this Japanese vibe.

903
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,991
You need to save your skin.

904
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,109
I didn't wait all these years

905
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,113
to have a child,

906
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,753
only to bail out

907
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,118
just when I'll have a family at last.

908
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,398
Call that a Kleenex?

909
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,032
It's a sponge.

910
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,989
Blow.

911
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,428
Blow!

912
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,875
Not so hard.

913
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,436
You'll blast it everywhere. Blow.

914
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,268
That's disgusting.

915
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,431
I don't believe this.
I've totally got a...

916
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,870
Worse than a hospital case.

917
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,270
Thanks.

918
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,878
Where do you want to sit?

919
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,190
There.

920
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,674
- Here?
- Sure.

921
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,988
Make some room.

922
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,558
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

923
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,996
Folks fresh off the slab
are here in post-op.

924
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,639
- Zombies.
- That's phase 1.

925
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,392
They sleep all day long.

926
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,160
- Then comes semi-renfo.
- Phase 2.

927
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,117
You have limited mobility.

928
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,032
- Then renfo.
- Phase 3.

929
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,071
- You're phase 3?
- Phase 2.

930
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,757
- l'm phase 2.
- He's terminal phase.

931
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,153
He's nearly done.

932
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,151
He'll head back to his village.

933
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,959
Know his zip code? 7-1.

934
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,795
You live in 7-1?

935
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,829
In the provinces?

936
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,877
- Where are you from?
- Burgundy.

937
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,199
- Dude, Burgundy's in the provinces.
- Provinces is down south, fool.

938
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,395
lt's down south?

939
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,034
The provinces
is the bit around Marseille.

940
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,872
So what do you call up north?

941
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,911
That's Metropolis.

942
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,149
Wassup, nigga!

943
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,635
I'll put him on.

944
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,835
Francois Hollande.

945
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,836
We're gonna hang out together.

946
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,159
For sure. Dope.

947
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,436
How come you're Arab with straight hair?

948
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,278
- I'm not Arab.
- You're not?

949
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,999
- What are you?
- French.

950
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,114
He says I'm Arab.

951
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,714
- You look Arab.
- Spanish, I'd say.

952
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,393
See? Spanish, Portuguese...

953
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,431
His hair and body are out of sync.

954
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,757
Yours is in sync with your body?

955
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,355
l have kinky hair and I'm proud of it.

956
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,709
It's like a sponge.

957
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,438
Arabs have kinky hair.

958
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,315
He's got whitey's hair.
Call his hair Francois, his body Omar.

959
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,358
Call his hair Francois!

960
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,273
I prefer my tuft to that.

961
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,673
Keep strutting, little man!

962
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,035
- I got you down.
- You see a woman and floss.

963
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,233
What are you doing here?

964
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,359
You want something from me?

965
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,551
No, nothing, don't worry.

966
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,151
- Something to tell me?
- Not either.

967
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,158
Happy your furniture's back?

968
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,270
What?

969
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,953
Hello, beautiful beloved.

970
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,348
How are you?

971
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,352
I missed you terribly.

972
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,314
I missed everything.

973
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,275
Your laugh.

974
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,556
I even missed your sulking.

975
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,994
This isn't very...

976
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,518
It's not very sensible.

977
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,268
My waters have broken.

978
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,679
The child's coming?

979
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,109
- Is it moving?
- I'm not having contractions.

980
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,236
- There have to be contractions?
- Yes.

981
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,789
Let's go.

982
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,873
Let's go to the clinic.

983
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,236
Come on...

984
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,829
I'll call them.

985
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,069
Don't make any...

986
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,836
- Sudden movements.
- No, not in black.

987
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,036
- Don't start.
- I know what I'll wear.

988
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,033
Screw that,
we don't have time. Hold still!

989
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,558
No dresses today.

990
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,596
Please.

991
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,193
- Get dressed.
- Calm down.

992
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,110
You calm down.

993
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,031
He said hello.

994
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,952
Look, he's looking at you!

995
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,076
Holy shit!

996
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,071
It really is a boy.

997
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,269
Welcome to you.

998
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,513
It's Mommy and Daddy.

999
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,075
- Welcome, my love.
- Mommy and Daddy.

1000
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,798
Welcome, sweetheart.

1001
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,197
He is so cute.

1002
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,594
He has your eyes.

1003
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,633
Support his head.

1004
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,915
I'm not sure how.

1005
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,229
- Like that.
- Like that?

1006
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,150
I can't see the baby's face.

1007
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,670
There we are.

1008
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,070
How about I take one
of you and baby?

1009
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,149
The camera's complicated.

1010
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,837
You won't starve to death.

1011
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,116
Mom came by yesterday with Solal.

1012
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,838
She already came?

1013
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,231
Tasty. What else is there?
Chocolate, coffee, lemon?

1014
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,875
Lemon pie.

1015
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,714
- No, lemon macaroons.
- They're lemon pie.

1016
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,792
- The flavor's lemon pie?
- Lemon meringue pie.

1017
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,917
- Lemon meringue?
- That's right.

1018
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,950
You're right.
Tastes of lemon inside.

1019
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,756
And a hint of meringue outside.

1020
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,109
The whole point...

1021
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,829
of macaroons.

1022
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,989
- How's the mommy feeling?
- Okay.

1023
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,990
He has a name?

1024
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,275
- Yes.
- Not yet.

1025
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,712
- He has a name.
- We haven't decided.

1026
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,837
We chose Simbad.

1027
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,389
I need to think it over.
Can we tell you later?

1028
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,397
- I'll come back.
- Thank you.

1029
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,430
See you later.

1030
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,915
Didn't we agree yesterday on Simbad?

1031
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,196
Simbad's the sailor, Simbad's...

1032
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,597
lt's mythology, it's...

1033
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,598
It's travel. Simbad's great.

1034
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,830
Eliot sounds like
a dumbass intellectual.

1035
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,399
You like Simbad, dad?

1036
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,116
No.

1037
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,628
That's not a name.

1038
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,110
And Marie-Antoinette is? Right?

1039
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,958
Simbad's great.

1040
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,349
Simbad then?

1041
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,354
What's the plan?

1042
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,117
There's a superb boat that picks you up
at the dock down there, if you call them.

1043
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,555
I found a merry, muscular sailor

1044
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,233
with bulging biceps for you.

1045
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,310
You'll come with?

1046
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,636
No. Today, we're going to see Agnes.

1047
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,756
We're going to introduce Simbad
to Agnes today.

1048
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,638
"We're going"? She's not coming?

1049
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,870
Don't worry,
l'll drive down, meet her...

1050
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,832
- And you...
- I'll come with you.

1051
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,958
I'm not going to take my car
to meet up with you.

1052
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,429
Stop. Give it a rest.

1053
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,036
Enough.

1054
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,199
Just one more.

1055
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,035
There you go.

1056
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,594
It's over.

1057
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,630
Okay?

1058
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,869
Check him out.

1059
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,830
How are you?

1060
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,838
Hey, beautiful beloved.

1061
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,755
Well then?

1062
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,353
- Isn't he cute!
- See that?

1063
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,994
Who's the lady?

1064
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,915
Is it Auntie?

1065
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,869
Auntie Agnes?

1066
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,553
You're looking at me?

1067
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,754
- He's so fragile, be careful.
- Of course.

1068
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,751
Hold still, there you go.

1069
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,235
With his godmother. He'll love it later.

1070
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,198
You're beautiful, aren't you?

1071
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,029
He wants a feed.

1072
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,877
You think?

1073
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,874
- I don't think, I know.
- It's been a while.

1074
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,540
He feeds every 3 hours.

1075
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,192
You'll love your godmother?

1076
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,640
Come on, you want to see Mommy.

1077
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,233
Don't you want to see Mommy?

1078
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,152
He was happy with Auntie, too.

1079
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,753
Let's give you some food.

1080
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,796
Dessert?

1081
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,712
What do you guys want? Clafoutis?

1082
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,915
No dessert for me.

1083
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,911
Raspberry clafoutis. You love it.

1084
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,513
I'm going to the bathroom.

1085
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,714
She's happy now.

1086
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,914
Thank you, my love.

1087
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,996
Say, where she's staying,
she's bored, I can tell.

1088
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,991
Can she move in with us a while?

1089
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,519
Marguerite Duras!

1090
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,949
I love you.

1091
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,756
We saw you!

1092
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,273
That is so fine!

1093
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,118
Beautiful jellabah.

1094
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,352
But bad news.
We're not going out. Get your pajamas.

1095
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,309
You can go out.

1096
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,551
We'll have a quiet night in.

1097
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,558
Tell us another one!

1098
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,280
- Nobody believes you.
- You can't go out alone?

1099
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,352
Classy, Georgio!
Staying in with wife and baby.

1100
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,515
Great guy!

1101
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,155
He is so young.

1102
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,275
Respect.

1103
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,591
It's alien to you.
Marriage, a family, you've no idea.

1104
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,033
Tonight, I'm grounded.

1105
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,519
I'm staying home.

1106
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,830
Unless...

1107
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,990
Unless

1108
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,556
my love is kind enough

1109
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,392
to set me free.

1110
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,914
Like a bird of paradise.

1111
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,590
To flutter off with his friends.

1112
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,390
It's up to you, I'm not your mother.

1113
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,835
There we go!

1114
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,229
To Tony!

1115
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,753
To my long-lost freedom!

1116
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,676
Thanks, Tony.

1117
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,754
Return to the space center.

1118
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,430
ls macaroni okay with you?

1119
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,711
Whatever. I'm not staying for dinner.

1120
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,438
l have a business meeting.

1121
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,000
Tonight,
the day we get back from vacation?

1122
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,836
Yes.

1123
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,359
You're not sleeping here?

1124
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,189
No.

1125
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,433
I don't want to wake you
if I get in late.

1126
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,077
I'll drop Simbad off at 9
on the way to the gynecologist's.

1127
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,516
No, at 9, I'm signing off
on the sale of a building.

1128
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,035
So?

1129
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,391
So, next time, tell me earlier.

1130
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,228
My love, you okay?

1131
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:00,916
Who's she?

1132
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,429
I don't know.

1133
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,873
Are you nuts!

1134
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,832
I told you, I don't know her.

1135
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,992
I swear I don't remember.

1136
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,593
Okay, look, here's your son.

1137
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,238
- Wipes, diapers.
- I swear!

1138
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,635
Everything you need.

1139
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,438
I don't know who she is.

1140
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,715
I didn't cheat.

1141
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,069
I did not cheat on you.

1142
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,992
No, I know, I was with a girl in bed.

1143
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,908
But nothing happened.

1144
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,834
l was drugged up.

1145
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,516
- Since when have you...
- Always.

1146
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,951
I've always got strung out.

1147
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,430
And then...

1148
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,315
| get over it.

1149
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,793
And back on the attack.

1150
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,318
Why didn't you ever say?

1151
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,509
Because for me,

1152
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,995
the husband and father is supposed...

1153
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,235
not to falter.

1154
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,073
He holds things together.

1155
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,429
He stays strong in all circumstances.

1156
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,590
He's not the guy who trembles
or shits himself, see?

1157
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,831
I wanted you to see me that way.

1158
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,431
| always thought
those moments belonged only to me

1159
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,392
and concerned only me.

1160
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,156
Those moments

1161
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,550
were when I could behave like a shit.

1162
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,828
Because deep down...

1163
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,871
| feel that's what I am.

1164
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,712
I don't know you, in fact.

1165
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,912
We don't know each other.

1166
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,835
Forgive me.

1167
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,634
Please.

1168
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,153
You move back in here.

1169
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,559
Or else we divorce.

1170
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,593
I can't go on like this.

1171
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,709
Okay.

1172
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,590
But before that, I need therapy.

1173
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,197
l have to get rid of this.

1174
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,393
Then I'll come back.

1175
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,559
Know what we'll do?

1176
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,110
We'll have a party to celebrate.

1177
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,397
We'll go away for a weekend
and invite all our buddies.

1178
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,552
Have you ever spoken
to couples who go way back?

1179
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,438
How come they're still together?

1180
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,115
They haven't got over cheating?

1181
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,078
They haven't got over doubts and drugs?

1182
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,629
They've got over everything together.

1183
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,518
Now, couples split up like that.

1184
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,915
First sign of trouble, let's split up.

1185
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,355
A kid, let's split up.
Let's have another.

1186
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,437
We'll split up again anyway.

1187
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,790
To split up, you have to be together.

1188
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,518
You guys aren't together.

1189
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,872
We're together separately.

1190
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,359
- Right.
- I love him.

1191
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,754
Leaving his wife sobbing...

1192
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,354
You judge from the outside.
What do you know?

1193
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,879
- I don't.
- You do.

1194
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,235
You've never liked him.
You've condemned him from the start.

1195
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,152
You never give him a chance.

1196
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,117
| always said he's wrong for you.

1197
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,993
Quite honestly,

1198
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,798
putting your son through this...

1199
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,392
Through what?
I want my son to live with both parents!

1200
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,953
- You can't do it.
- I can.

1201
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,076
You'll see.

1202
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,117
You'll see that I can do it.

1203
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,599
Keep going like this

1204
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,593
and, one day,
you'll have an accident. For real.

1205
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,559
A brother has to say
what he thinks of a situation.

1206
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,676
It's my responsibility. What's that?

1207
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,955
My tranquilizers.

1208
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,071
He's the dopehead
and you're on a cure? Of tranquilizers?

1209
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,717
Look, this is how you eat it.

1210
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,359
You're jealous?

1211
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,039
- No.
- As if!

1212
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,073
I saw those jealous eyes.

1213
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,269
You think I'd steal your man?

1214
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,919
I don't steal other people's men.

1215
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,911
Look at me, I'm talking to you.

1216
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,191
I don't steal other people's men.

1217
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,591
- Fine.
- l have the man I love!

1218
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,672
Georgio, the man you love!

1219
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,397
My love!

1220
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,950
Come on!

1221
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,315
Dammit!

1222
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,316
Calm down.

1223
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,919
Where's my glass?

1224
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,431
Calm down.

1225
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,950
- l have an announcement to make.
- Without the glass.

1226
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,630
Listen to me!

1227
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,229
Sit down, you!

1228
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,393
You know what the party's for tonight?

1229
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,594
I'll leave it to Georgio to tell you.

1230
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,428
Stand up!

1231
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,358
Go on, tell them.

1232
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,790
I'll tell you what the party's for.

1233
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,910
Georgio is going to start therapy.

1234
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,670
Because he has addictions.

1235
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,751
Because he's hooked on alcohol.

1236
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,152
Because he runs away,
abandoning his wife and child.

1237
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,951
Because he's sick.

1238
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,111
And because he hurts people.

1239
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,635
Tony, stop.

1240
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,995
Tony, stop?

1241
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,832
No, Tony won't stop.

1242
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,960
Tony is sick of it!

1243
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,070
Sick, sick, sick of it!

1244
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,869
Drink some water.

1245
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,516
Come on.

1246
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,715
Come on, I said.

1247
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,550
I'm not good enough
to be with your friends?

1248
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,199
All your friends

1249
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,237
from beauty and fashion!

1250
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,355
From youth!

1251
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,949
From drugs!

1252
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,194
You have to be on drugs
to be accepted into your circle.

1253
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,749
It's true!

1254
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,794
Nine euros.

1255
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,191
- Your two boxes.
- Thanks.

1256
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,679
- Hi, Joseph.
- Evening, Tony.

1257
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,670
- Okay?
- And you?

1258
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,989
Cute little flower!

1259
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,594
To brighten the place up for Christmas.

1260
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,352
One Prozac, one Xanax.

1261
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,959
Okay, one of each.

1262
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,633
- All good?
-Great.

1263
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,790
Right.

1264
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,555
Coming right up.

1265
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,831
Christian.

1266
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,869
Law school.

1267
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,597
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

1268
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,115
You've gone bald. A total train wreck.

1269
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,713
Taken a real hit.

1270
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,636
There you go.

1271
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,119
- On your tab?
- On my tab.

1272
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,190
As usual.

1273
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,316
Anyway, I'll be back in the week.

1274
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,669
You've had a baby?

1275
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,909
Wonderful.

1276
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,391
Simbad...

1277
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,397
Christian, an old friend.

1278
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,029
- What's your husband do?
- My husband's...

1279
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,799
Did I take my pills?

1280
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,188
Yes, I put them there.

1281
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,198
I saw you put them in your bag.

1282
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,355
There they are.

1283
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,950
It was cool running into you.

1284
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,115
Big kiss.

1285
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,709
Be strong.

1286
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,634
| forgot my little Simbad!

1287
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,758
How could I forget you?

1288
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,832
Dad, was he a shaken baby?

1289
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,958
Shaken babies are babies
that are shaken very hard

1290
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,111
by frazzled mothers who sob and howl,

1291
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,874
Shut up! Will you shut up!

1292
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,349
That's a shaken baby.

1293
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,955
- It's underestimated.
- And after-effects?

1294
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,678
- After what?
- After-effects.

1295
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,795
Look at Babeth.

1296
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,634
She could be an example.

1297
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,075
That's Georgio.

1298
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,639
Sweetie, it's Daddy.

1299
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,314
- He doesn't care about Daddy.
- He's across the world.

1300
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,919
Come on, baby.

1301
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,191
- Look who it is.
- Who’s this?

1302
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,349
Hi, Daddy.

1303
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,757
Look at you/ Aren't you gorgeous!

1304
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:36,995
Where are you?

1305
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:37,956
Australia.

1306
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,519
Guess who can stand up.

1307
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,072
Show Daddy you can stand up.

1308
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,591
You ’re fabulous!

1309
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,272
/ called to say Merry Christmas.

1310
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,355
You okay?

1311
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,155
I've got to go, we're going to eat.

1312
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,150
Miss you both.

1313
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,834
Ciao, Simbad

1314
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,675
Ciao, buddy.

1315
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,592
My love! My baby./

1316
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,394
You see your father?

1317
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,716
What's he doing? Island-hopping?

1318
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,715
No, he's...

1319
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,154
He's had a breakdown.

1320
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,833
He's in a bad way.

1321
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,319
It's understandable.

1322
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,953
He lost his father.

1323
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,678
Obviously, he needs to be away
from his wife and son,

1324
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,990
on a boat in Australia to think.

1325
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,669
That raises the bar for when you die.

1326
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,519
Where will we go?

1327
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,240
Japan maybe?
The Great Wall of China?

1328
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,436
Slow down.

1329
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,709
Look at him.

1330
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,030
He was nice and calm.

1331
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,031
After your Skype, he's agitated.

1332
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,758
Sure, he saw his daddy.

1333
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:48,993
No, he saw something on a computer,
not his father.

1334
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,674
Young babies don't understand mirrors.

1335
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,149
They can't understand Skype
because it's flat.

1336
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,316
Okay, Lila.

1337
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,750
New subject maybe, we're done with that.

1338
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,110
Excuse me.

1339
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,877
| feel like a parrot,
endlessly repeating itself.

1340
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,792
Except she never wakes up.

1341
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,079
The day he remarries,

1342
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,993
she'll say
it's to understand his first marriage.

1343
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,116
Apparently, love's like that.

1344
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,995
Shit!

1345
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,309
Can you hear me?

1346
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,755
Okay, sir.

1347
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,194
She's breathing.

1348
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,550
- She ever attempt suicide?
- Never.

1349
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,438
- We have a pulse.
- She took that.

1350
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,159
Okay, I'll keep the tube.

1351
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,389
Look at me.

1352
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,878
You took the whole tube?

1353
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,955
Can you hear me?

1354
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,712
Tell me what happened.

1355
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,154
Her husband called.

1356
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,992
I'd like your sister to tell me.

1357
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,070
She can't talk.

1358
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,878
Tell me, I'm listening.

1359
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,316
l'll pack a bag for her.

1360
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,590
Solal.

1361
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,234
Yes, I'm here.

1362
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,152
Get in, it'll reassure her.

1363
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,068
What can I get you?

1364
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,273
Sparkling water, please.

1365
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,399
Lightly sparkling.

1366
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,079
You're looking better.

1367
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,429
That's not hard.

1368
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,873
I want a divorce.

1369
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,195
You love me?

1370
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,316
Yes.

1371
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,079
So, that's settled.

1372
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,195
The check!

1373
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,588
It's not settled.

1374
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,712
The problem isn't you or me.

1375
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,598
The problem's us together.

1376
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,838
Isn't that a Phil Collins song?

1377
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,996
What are you after? Tell me.

1378
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,998
Live apart and never see you.

1379
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,396
You'll be able to do whatever, whenever.

1380
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,114
Nobody will scream at you,
there'll be no tears...

1381
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,233
You hit on me, remember.

1382
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,789
- I hit on you?
- You saw me with my crew.

1383
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,439
Out drinking. You saw it.

1384
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,519
You sized me up, right? You're a lawyer.

1385
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,879
I wasn't some guy you met in a library.

1386
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,514
You leave people for the same reasons...

1387
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,793
- Exactly.
- The same thing that first attracted you.

1388
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,228
Precisely the same reasons.

1389
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,150
Okay.

1390
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,029
So the next guy will attract you
for a reason, then you'll leave him.

1391
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,078
- When do you build something?
- We're building nothing.

1392
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,595
- Really?
- We destroy each other, that's all.

1393
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,589
Not you.

1394
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,191
- Not me?
- You're indestructible.

1395
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,315
In any case...

1396
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,198
Modesty, ever heard of it?

1397
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,633
When you love someone,

1398
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,199
it hurts, it's not easy.

1399
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,238
- You don't hurt much.
- Don't tell me what I feel.

1400
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,799
You're a pain in the ass.

1401
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,870
What the hell!

1402
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,634
I've got to burst into tears
all the time?

1403
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,791
How do you know what I feel?

1404
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,393
You want me to...

1405
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,034
- What do you want?
- You fought for us?

1406
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,030
- Yes.
- No.

1407
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,315
- Yes.
- Not one second.

1408
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,995
What's "fighting" mean?
Screaming, bleeding...

1409
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,832
That's not how I fight.

1410
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,877
| find a way to stop you leaving.

1411
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,758
That's how I fight for us.

1412
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,430
Why must I be
what you want me to be?

1413
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,918
You came over to me

1414
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,150
precisely because I am what I am.

1415
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,151
Why not accept what you have?

1416
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,792
I can't go on like this.

1417
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,072
Monday, we're together.
Wednesday, we're not.

1418
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,071
Thursday, you'll move back in.

1419
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,639
Friday, no you won't.

1420
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,837
Next Monday, you cheat on me.
Next Wednesday, you love me.

1421
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,388
I can't take any more.

1422
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,068
I prefer...

1423
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,349
I prefer this

1424
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,237
to that...

1425
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,750
That's called an electrocardiogram.

1426
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,558
Like that, you're alive.

1427
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,073
Like that, you're dead.

1428
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,832
I prefer not to be in love,
and not get hurt.

1429
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,434
That's what you want?

1430
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,198
Yes, that's what I want.

1431
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,352
What about our boy?

1432
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,233
Until the divorce settlement,
alternate weekends.

1433
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,039
The nanny brings him over,
so we don't meet.

1434
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,676
No.

1435
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,594
What do you want?

1436
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,556
No divorce.

1437
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,153
- Not an option.
- Okay.

1438
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,550
If we divorce,
I keep him, you visit...

1439
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,517
That's not going to happen.

1440
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,035
We'll both hire lawyers and the judge...

1441
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,633
I hire you as my lawyer.

1442
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,599
No, I won't do it.

1443
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,116
Sorry, I want you to be my lawyer.

1444
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,874
- Not possible.
- It's what will happen.

1445
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,433
I'll pay you a fortune.

1446
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,432
I don't want your money.

1447
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,959
It's Agnes's money.

1448
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,030
Take it.

1449
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,195
What is this!

1450
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,079
We'll have to explain to Simbad.

1451
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,556
Let him be. He's suffered enough.

1452
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,076
For you, letting people be
means not explaining things.

1453
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,193
- You do talk crap.
- We have to tell him.

1454
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,793
- Shut up!
- We tell him.

1455
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,393
At 1 year old! Tell him what?

1456
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,556
What the hell! He can't talk!

1457
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,711
He understands, he senses it.

1458
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,278
We tell him.
We sit down and talk to him.

1459
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,159
We tell him it's over
and we're separating.

1460
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,639
You live with Daddy.

1461
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,314
Then with Mommy.
Your parents have split up.

1462
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,637
Make an appointment,
see when he can fit us in.

1463
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,916
So?

1464
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,271
I say we tell him. How's best?

1465
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,277
- How do we do it?
- Yes, how?

1466
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,869
Like this.

1467
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,189
Stop it, Georgio.

1468
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,875
Listen up.

1469
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,110
I'll see my son as much as you.

1470
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,799
Or I'll start talking.

1471
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:16,995
Let go of me!

1472
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:29,994
If you think your lawyer tricks
will keep my son from me,

1473
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,639
you're kidding yourself.

1474
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,788
Don't forget
the pills you popped pregnant,

1475
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,235
and constantly freaking out
in front of him.

1476
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,150
Remember?

1477
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,370
I've got witnesses.

1478
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,192
And you'll lose custody.

1479
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,590
Use your head for once in your life.

1480
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,309
Got me?

1481
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,999
Take your weight.

1482
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,988
Easy does it.

1483
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,719
Very slowly.

1484
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,196
There you go, very good.

1485
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,828
That's great.

1486
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,269
Give me five.

1487
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,513
My beauty!

1488
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,796
I missed you so much!

1489
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,911
Let me take a look at you.

1490
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,431
You decide what I juggle.

1491
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,911
Kiwi, orange, spoon, you choose.

1492
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,548
Kiwi, orange and open yogurt.

1493
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,228
An open yogurt?

1494
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,069
Sneaky!

1495
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,514
Here we go.

1496
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,668
Move back.

1497
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,075
Hold on, we're taking cover.

1498
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,748
See? I can still make you laugh.

1499
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,798
Sex!

1500
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,792
Now we're divorced,
I can propose to you again.

1501
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,793
Yes, you can.

1502
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,670
I can't guarantee the answer.

1503
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,029
Hold on...

1504
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,035
l was looking for my teddy bear, dammit.

1505
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,914
She's such a pain!

1506
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,237
You've had dental work?

1507
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,674
Had them whitened?

1508
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,909
Just go!

1509
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,719
Your bitch act! So annoying!

1510
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,953
Enough, get up.

1511
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,111
Listen! The little boy!

1512
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,909
Hide in there.

1513
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,595
He's my son.
He can see his dad in bed with his mom.

1514
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:37,991
We're separated and you're dating.
lt'll confuse him.

1515
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,554
Mommy!

1516
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,836
On one condition. Tonight we fuck.

1517
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,238
Or I stay here.
Here he comes!

1518
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,874
- Tonight we fuck?
- Yes.

1519
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,189
Touch my balls.

1520
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:49,670
I'm going.

1521
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,395
Hippopo!

1522
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,438
Bring Hippo. You slept well?

1523
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,591
Morning, my love!

1524
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,439
Morning, sweetheart.

1525
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,709
I'm hungry.

1526
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,154
I'll go get breakfast.

1527
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,996
She's reunited with her true love.

1528
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,953
Dropped it.

1529
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,874
Give it to Hippo.

1530
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,110
Who's that?

1531
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,392
Look who's popped out! Da...

1532
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,356
Daddy!

1533
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,599
Come here, you!

1534
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,228
You've changed.

1535
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,149
You're serene.

1536
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,756
I'm back to how I was before.

1537
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,155
Before what?

1538
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,149
Before I met you.

1539
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,670
- Have you changed?
- I'm off everything.

1540
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,556
One coffee's exceptional.
For me now, it's a psychotropic.

1541
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,870
- Stop.
- | drink camomile, don't smoke.

1542
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,109
I'm on nothing.

1543
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,510
Damn.

1544
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,589
What about Agnes?

1545
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,396
I'm done with her. She's on her own.

1546
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,833
As my father used to say,

1547
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,594
abandon those who abandon themselves.

1548
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,595
I didn't get what happened last night.

1549
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,591
Why all of a sudden, yes?
Now all of a sudden, no?

1550
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,711
That was last night.
Today's real life.

1551
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,279
Last night wasn't real life?

1552
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,873
No, it was a parenthesis.

1553
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,355
It wasn't a parenthesis.

1554
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,113
The rest is a parenthesis.

1555
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,718
Finished your coffee?

1556
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,675
Drink up and...

1557
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,196
You changed your batteries recently.

1558
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,519
Come on, stop.

1559
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,113
We can go away together.

1560
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,909
We can go eat mussels in Deauville.

1561
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,998
No, because Simbad...

1562
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,874
Waffles in Brussels.

1563
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,191
Couscous in Marrakesh.

1564
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,954
They do lemon tagine?

1565
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,279
Where's my phone?
I'll call Mohamed at La Mamounia.

1566
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,796
They set sail for Marrakesh

1567
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,592
to eat couscous with their son, Simbad!

1568
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,038
All aboard for adventure!

1569
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,679
Who wants to start today?

1570
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,750
Me first!

1571
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,275
Go on.

1572
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,430
Today, I'd like to ask forgiveness.

1573
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,989
Ask forgiveness?

1574
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,835
What for?

1575
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,276
For the pain I may have caused Tony.

1576
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,114
And you, Simbad.

1577
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,033
| ask your forgiveness.

1578
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,355
Do you forgive me?

1579
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,079
You heard him, Simbad?

1580
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,433
Do you forgive him now?

1581
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,677
- It's not me.
- What's not you?

1582
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,599
lt's Mommy.

1583
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:27,795
There!

1584
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,393
What about you, Tony?

1585
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,239
How do you take that?

1586
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,351
I hope he means it.

1587
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,672
Of course I mean it.

1588
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,109
lt's giving me...

1589
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,115
It's like pins and needles, don't worry.

1590
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,588
That's too strong.

1591
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,557
- Try to relax first.
- Me?

1592
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,956
No stress. Life's cool.

1593
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,110
Go with what feels right.
Stronger up top, less below.

1594
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,913
- How about 15?
- Sure.

1595
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,911
And another thing...

1596
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,069
Check that out!

1597
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,798
It's cool, I love it.

1598
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,309
Kissy kiss!

1599
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,828
Tony, look.

1600
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,994
Look at your thighs,
compared to mine.

1601
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,514
Here we go.

1602
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,272
That's an obese muscle.

1603
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,597
You're making it do that.

1604
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,909
No, I'm not.

1605
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,233
The noise it makes.

1606
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,557
- You're kidding me.
- Like it?

1607
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,320
You didn't think
I'd forget my son's 7th birthday?

1608
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,274
You're happy to see me?

1609
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,518
- You're happy to see me?
- Yes.

1610
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,113
She's happy to see me!

1611
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,919
You want me to ride him?

1612
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,993
Excuse me, watch out.

1613
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,834
He'll collapse under you.

1614
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,278
Welcome to my estate...

1615
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,109
Put your arm down.

1616
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,310
Take that!

1617
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,555
Get him back!

1618
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,115
Help!

1619
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,237
Can't you take off your jacket?

1620
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,392
People will think you're a waiter.

1621
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,994
You look like a waiter.

1622
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,673
That's lucky because...

1623
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,795
I'm a waiter.

1624
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,998
We have Pouilly de Chantemarais.

1625
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,311
1978, if you'd care to taste.

1626
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,598
Very attractive color.

1627
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,034
Sir, of course.

1628
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,834
May |?

1629
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,359
- A drop.
- lt's alcohol.

1630
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,391
Won't do sir any harm.

1631
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,035
Sir

1632
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,397
is celebrating his 77th year.

1633
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,354
Just wet your lips.

1634
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,149
Drink up.

1635
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:33,715
Today's special offer is
Monbouillet St. Sylvestre Roche Foucault.

1636
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,916
We're multitasking here.

1637
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,593
Sorry, excuse me.

1638
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,630
That's great.

1639
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,592
- Which table?
- There but...

1640
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,670
I've got it.

1641
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,311
l'll guess. Gut instinct.

1642
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,552
Clear table 10, please.

1643
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,908
Table 8, please.

1644
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,149
Hurry.

1645
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,234
Watch out!

1646
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:06,950
Excuse me.

1647
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,919
Sorry, I'm a beginner.

1648
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,678
It's the birthday of sir...

1649
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,795
Simbad!

1650
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,509
For me?

1651
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,592
Yes, for you.

1652
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,159
Put it to good use.

1653
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,279
Not the one you wanted?

1654
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:52,676
It is?

1655
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,150
Let me see.

1656
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,629
Look!

1657
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,597
- What?
- Let me say thank you.

1658
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,954
Please do.

1659
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,389
Good Lord, the child is ill.

1660
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,796
He's infected.

1661
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,552
Time for bed.

1662
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,593
Come on, let's go.

1663
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,638
Can I sleep with Dad?

1664
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,715
Sure, why not?

1665
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,110
- All his stuff's in...
- It's not far.

1666
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,551
Don't get mad. I won't steal him.

1667
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,153
I'm not mad at you.

1668
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,715
I can see
why it would make you happy.

1669
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,949
It's not my choice.

1670
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,680
The child expressed the wish...

1671
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,750
You see?

1672
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,153
Your toothbrush is in the bag there.

1673
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,955
Not a word for me?

1674
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,235
Goodnight, Mom.

1675
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,309
Goodnight, my love.

1676
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,798
Let's get our pajamas on.

1677
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,871
Let's take our vest off fast,

1678
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:07,072
then let's take off our shirt.
Hurry, hurry.

1679
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,830
Open up.

1680
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,034
What do you want?

1681
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,556
To bone you.

1682
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:36,915
Open up.

1683
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,035
Please.

1684
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,273
- Leave me alone.
- It's dangerous.

1685
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,793
In case of fire or flood,

1686
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,075
you'll be trapped.

1687
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,878
Don't worry about me.

1688
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,194
You bust the...

1689
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,953
I wanna see my chick.

1690
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,594
You bust the lock?

1691
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,112
- That's not all I'll bust.
- Stop.

1692
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,110
I want to talk.

1693
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,556
I think I caught something. Look!

1694
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,109
- I don't want to look.
- Touch it!

1695
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,429
- I swear.
- I won't.

1696
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,158
- No violence.
- Get out!

1697
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,231
- Get out of my room.
- Okay, your room, my room...

1698
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,278
- You're bored, that's all.
- No, missing you.

1699
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,910
Go to bed. I want to read.

1700
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,274
I do what I want.

1701
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,628
You're cute, you know.

1702
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,509
Straight up.

1703
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,828
Dumb you're a dummy.

1704
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,234
That's not pata negra. lt's shit.

1705
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,512
- Real pata negra...
- It isn't.

1706
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,035
- Real pata negra...
- It's not as good.

1707
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,391
What?

1708
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,272
It's not as good as pata negra.

1709
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,755
It's nothing like it.

1710
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:50,356
This is crappy serrano
cured maybe three months.

1711
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,236
- Why do they call it pata negra?
- Pata negra, jabugo, bellota...

1712
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,436
- They chose the wrong guy.
- Exactly.

1713
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,354
Bellota, you know,
been there, done that.

1714
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,595
Duckie!

1715
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,632
That's not bellota.

1716
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,709
- It's from Auvergne.
- Auvergne?

1717
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,190
Why call it pata negra then?

1718
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,878
They get a lot of Germans and Russians,
so they rip those guys off.

1719
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,711
They think we're tourists.

1720
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,410
There is something Polish about you.

1721
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,549
Sorry.

1722
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,354
In a restaurant.

1723
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,033
Yeah, go ahead.

1724
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,034
You're kidding?

1725
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,158
Does Bouvet know?

1726
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,191
Hold on, I'll be right there.

1727
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,078
I'll call him from the office.

1728
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,834
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1729
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,792
Okay, see you in a second.

1730
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,036
That's nuts! See you.

1731
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,555
Bricourt, ring a bell?
The CEO accused of killing his wife,

1732
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:56,835
all over the news.

1733
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,833
He chose me to defend him.

1734
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,589
- Just imagine!
- Wonderful.

1735
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,228
A huge trial in the high court.

1736
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,356
A juicy case, as they say.

1737
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:09,916
Right?

1738
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,915
- Right.
- That's good. Great.

1739
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,351
- You're not happy for me?
- Super happy.

1740
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,154
You're defending a motherfucker.
Fantastic.

1741
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,591
I've got to get back.

1742
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,992
For our firm, it's huge.
You have no idea.

1743
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,151
We've ordered. Let's eat first.

1744
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,872
We can have dinner anytime,

1745
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:38,429
but this could be once in a lifetime.

1746
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,319
Come along if you want.

1747
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,633
Don't I get a "Have fun"?

1748
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,869
Have fun.

1749
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:11,749
Tony!

1750
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,038
- What?
- Are you coming down?

1751
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:17,997
I'll be there in a minute.

1752
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,434
We're waiting here.

1753
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,915
- Where you going?
- Shopping in Hossegor.

1754
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,958
- Why?
- I've got a date.

1755
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,229
Jibril!

1756
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,070
What's up?

1757
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,037
More noise than back in the hood.

1758
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,270
Drive us to Hossegor to go shopping.

1759
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:39,159
- Were you sleeping?
- Save it for later!

1760
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,793
- This isn't Boyz n the Hood!
- Go back to bed!

1761
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,428
It's Saturday!

1762
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,718
l was dreaming of naked chicks.
You ruined it.

1763
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,189
It was a dream. Wake up now!

1764
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,077
Greg! Take your photo!

1765
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,589
Cut it out!

1766
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:31,713
- Jibril...
- Damn!

1767
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,830
Excuse me, can I buy you a coffee?

1768
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,275
Special offer.

1769
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,309
- Can I buy you a soda?
- Snooty ass.

1770
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,238
I got an Audi.

1771
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,119
You're hot, shortie!

1772
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,829
Tony, why do you hang with us?

1773
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,676
We're not the same age,

1774
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,910
not the same social background.

1775
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,832
You're not as smart as us.

1776
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,553
And you hang out with us.

1777
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,271
- Seriously, how come?
- You got an ulterior motive?

1778
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:05,716
I don't need one.
I like you guys. You're fun.

1779
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,839
You're real clowns.

1780
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,314
Who's your favorite?

1781
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,919
Out of all of you?

1782
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,718
Not counting Arabs and Blacks.

1783
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,109
What brings you here?

1784
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,154
- We don't have an appointment.
- Sure we do.

1785
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,835
Just a second.

1786
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:42,590
I'm listening.

1787
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:44,034
"I'm listening"?

1788
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,879
That's you listening?

1789
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:50,034
We're not in court. Chill out, counsel!
You talk to me as if...

1790
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,918
So tell me what you want.

1791
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,589
Am I allowed to say I miss you?

1792
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,636
What?

1793
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:00,790
It's allowed?

1794
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,632
- Or banned?
- So?

1795
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,592
You miss me,
so I come running?

1796
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,320
I'm just saying I miss you.
Maybe I messed up.

1797
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,956
Maybe I see you dropping out of my life
and it drives me nuts.

1798
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:13,509
It's dumb you only realize that now.

1799
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,348
You know, in a few days, it's 10 years.

1800
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,671
Reason enough to have dinner.

1801
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,719
You want to see me
because it does you good.

1802
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,678
So you just drop by
but what about me?

1803
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,593
Fact is, I want to see you
because I love you.

1804
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,115
And you love me, so you avoid me.

1805
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,191
- Understand the difference?
- So?

1806
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,998
What can you give me now

1807
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,230
that you couldn't ten years ago?

1808
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,515
It'll be different?

1809
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,749
- Better.
- Better?

1810
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,751
You see the daylight,

1811
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,990
you love reading under a tree?

1812
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:50,277
You don't need 30 hangers-on
to be happy?

1813
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:53,989
- It's about wanting to read books.
- About wanting the same things.

1814
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,720
Great!
We could read under the same tree.

1815
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,509
The same book.

1816
01:51:58,680 --> 01:51:59,749
Alright...

1817
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,639
We buy two copies, so we can discuss it.

1818
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,998
It's been ten years
of you threatening me,

1819
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,674
and, next day,
proposing to me again.

1820
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:12,196
The day after, you promise
to square up your tax situation.

1821
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,591
Years later, nothing's changed.
You run with the same crowd.

1822
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,557
It's just hot air.

1823
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,640
I want to be happy. Let me be happy.

1824
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:24,155
If you love me,
you'd want me to be happy.

1825
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,833
Let me be happy!

1826
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,035
I can't make you happy?

1827
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,156
You know
you can't make me happy!

1828
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,675
Me neither.
I didn't make you happy.

1829
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,195
Let's stop this charade!

1830
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,155
You've got a man. Is that it?

1831
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,229
Is that it?

1832
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,194
Yes, I've got a man.

1833
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,508
You know that...

1834
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,437
You leave Simbad out of that.

1835
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,798
I don't want this man...

1836
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,876
I don't want this man living with Simbad.
You know that?

1837
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,156
You know
you have no say in my life?

1838
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:12,799
I don't care who you bang,

1839
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,872
but my son
is not to have any relationship

1840
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,871
with a man I've never met.

1841
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,190
Hold on, you're out of your mind.

1842
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,793
I'm not out of my mind.

1843
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,754
I don't know this guy.

1844
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,036
My son does not
go anywhere near him.

1845
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,599
You hear me, Tony?

1846
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,753
If your man
goes anywhere near my son, honey,

1847
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:36,556
I'll take care of your shit
and not in a lawyer's office.

1848
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,598
You can start right now.

1849
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,917
My son has met my man
and they get on just fine.

1850
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,958
Defying me, are you?

1851
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,989
You decide right and wrong?

1852
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:02,230
You decide for him?

1853
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,550
What did you do to me for years?

1854
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,278
I never laid a hand on you.

1855
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,159
You want a medal
for not laying a hand on me?

1856
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,515
What about the psychological abuse?

1857
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:14,035
You don't think it hurts
more than a punch?

1858
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,315
Tony, stop it!

1859
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,313
He's leaving, cut it out.

1860
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,034
Leave, Georgio.

1861
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:21,950
Stay there.

1862
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,430
Calm down.

1863
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,675
Sit down.

1864
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,199
I'll miss you guys.

1865
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,754
Stay in touch.

1866
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,799
Look after your knee.

1867
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,389
Take care.

1868
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,391
- Love ya, wallah.
- Same here.

1869
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,670
See you, guys.

1870
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,034
Drive safely.

1871
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,798
Go ahead, take a seat.

1872
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:57,795
How's your leg?

1873
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:02,556
I'm still limping,
but I'm happy to be walking again.

1874
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:05,759
Let's start with Simbad's drawings.

1875
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,751
They've progressed nicely over the year.

1876
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,354
- These are the older ones?
- That's right.

1877
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:13,839
The progression
from the start of the year is...

1878
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,274
We'd chosen a theme.

1879
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,192
The theme was the sea.

1880
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,353
A slight problem with...

1881
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,028
Traffic.

1882
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,069
Even on a motorcycle,
it's tricky, the bike lanes...

1883
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:29,798
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1884
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,356
Hello.

1885
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:33,109
How are you?

1886
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,349
Hello!

1887
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:38,028
We started with his drawings.
Very interesting.

1888
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,189
We were discussing them
with the doctor here.

1889
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,353
He did these? All of them?

1890
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,357
Yes, he did. They're Simbad's.

1891
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,996
They're learning to tell the time?

1892
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,514
Have learned.
Ask him the time, you'll see.

1893
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,954
He never talks about it.

1894
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:56,628
Sure he does.
I ask him and he tells me.

1895
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,269
He even reads the time on my watch.

1896
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,319
He applies himself well.

1897
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,236
Really?

1898
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,512
- Seriously?
- Very well.

1899
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:16,114
Remarkably so for a boy.

1900
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,235
For a boy?

1901
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:20,518
Generally, boys take more time

1902
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,194
to write neatly.

1903
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,391
Girls tend to be

1904
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:27,280
better at applying themselves
to handwriting.

1905
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,159
He gets it from his mother.
The elegance...

1906
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,598
is perhaps from my father.

1907
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,357
My father was very elegant.

1908
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,149
I'm delighted you both could make it

1909
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,880
because we have very good news for you.

1910
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,879
He will be promoted to the next grade.

1911
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,753
So we're very happy,

1912
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:37,037
after the tricky start he made.

1913
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,192
Congratulations to you both.

1914
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,590
You helped him to progress.

1915
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,990
You can be proud of him.

1916
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,149
Thank you.

1917
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,236
- Is that all for today?
- I think so.

1918
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,276
Okay.

1919
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:54,159
Thank you very much for your patience.

1920
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,269
Thanks again.

1921
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,429
You're welcome.

1922
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:58,670
Good bye.

1923
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:00,516
Good bye?
