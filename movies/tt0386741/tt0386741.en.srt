2
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,750
Come on, Farfella, come on.

3
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:42,170
Go!

4
00:03:56,858 --> 00:04:00,523
I can't, Karas. I can't pull you.

5
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,990
Get out of here. Run. Run!

6
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:39,024
<i>I like being beautiful.</i>

7
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,226
<i>I like to stay fit.</i>

8
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:44,362
<i>That's why I like Avalon.</i>

9
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:47,858
<i>With Avalon, I know I'm beautiful.</i>

10
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,068
<i>And I'm going to stay that way.</i>

11
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:54,865
<i>Avalon. For a better world.</i>

12
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:59,792
<i>Health. Beauty. Longevity.</i>

13
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,334
<i>Avalon. We're on your side, for life.</i>

14
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,650
I already paid you.

15
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,611
Give it to me.

16
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,203
I'm sorry, beauty.

17
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:22,370
I had some operating expenses.

18
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:36,094
Ilona is here.

19
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:39,061
Don't mess with me.

20
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:46,318
- You want it, you pay my price.
- Let her go!

21
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:49,279
- Baby...
- Get lost.

22
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,238
Out!

23
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,326
What the hell are you doing here?

24
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,782
- Hi, Bislane.
- Don't start, Ilona.

25
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:08,038
- What's up with Dimitri?
- Heard you missed work today?

26
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:10,083
Cut the crap!

27
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:12,887
- I find you a cushy office job...
- Oh!

28
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:16,678
The least you could do
is show up two days in a row.

29
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:20,473
- They will fire you.
- Oh, my God. Not that!

30
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:23,177
It's impossible to talk to you, Bislane.

31
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,022
You're not even trying.

32
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,779
You better go. Your patients
must be waiting.

33
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,155
Ilyich?

34
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,952
Ilyich?

35
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,399
Hi.

36
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,250
Section K, positions.

37
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,870
Go, go.

38
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:22,846
Abort. Hostage in danger.
Fall back.

39
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,941
Can you believe this? Fall back now.

40
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:36,148
<i>Hostage is in danger.
Karas, what the fuck...?</i>

41
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,795
You think I'm worried about him?

42
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:00,798
- I'll take you out.
- Well, aren't you a big boy?

43
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,386
What about you?

44
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:14,691
It's nearly over, Theo.

45
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,484
Just close your eyes and don't open
them again until I tell you.

46
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:22,150
Close you eyes.

47
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:48,884
Go. Go!

48
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:23,178
Hey, Amiel,
how's that wife of yours?

49
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:26,009
Well, when I'm not home, she's angry.

50
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:30,090
But when I'm there, it's worse.

51
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:33,146
I can't wait for her to have the baby.

52
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,606
Captain.

53
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,731
Prosecutor Reparaz
is waiting for you outside.

54
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:02,425
Ilona Tasuiev. One of Avalon's
young researchers.

55
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:07,297
Highly intelligent. Recruited
in Caucasia at the age of 13.

56
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:10,349
Top protégé of the Vice-President,
Paul Dellenbach.

57
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:14,391
Avalon wants her found.
And found alive.

58
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,896
Do whatever it takes,
but bring her back.

59
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,728
Do you really never talk,
or is this for show?

60
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,089
<i>Ilona Tasuiev,</i>

61
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,297
<i>a 22-year-old woman
with a bright future,</i>

62
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:56,139
<i>was abducted on her way to one
of our clinics for the underprivileged.</i>

63
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,186
<i>Can Avalon just accept that?</i>

64
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,854
<i>No. We view such a crime,</i>

65
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,572
<i>an attack on one of our most
valued employees...</i>

66
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:13,782
<i>...as an attack
on our entire corporation.</i>

67
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,669
Ilona's sister.

68
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:25,376
Bislane Tasuiev. She works at Avalon
too, but in the records department.

69
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,594
Ilona went to see her before her shift
at the clinic.

70
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:34,060
Doctor Jonas Muller, her superior,
made the initial report.

71
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:38,135
Around Club 71, total jungle -
four homicides, 32 muggings...

72
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,069
- Does any of this interest you?
- Huh?

73
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:49,146
- I'll see her after the briefing.
- Maybe you want to tell her that.

74
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:57,290
I want to know everything -

75
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:01,830
her habits, her vices, her obsessions,
weaknesses, fantasies.

76
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,668
The names of her friends,
lovers, co-workers.

77
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,260
We've asked Avalon for her business
address files, calendars, research.

78
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,510
Get the list of her patients, too.

79
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,091
Any bumps in their co-operation,
take it to Reparaz.

80
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:18,430
Vice and Narcotics will give us a list
of regulars at The 71.

81
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,434
Unless we get a ransom demand,
it's one of three -

82
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,271
industrial espionage, theft or sex crime.

83
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,442
The crime fits neatly
between regular patrols.

84
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,898
We have no visual records.

85
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,821
Now this guy is quick,
calculating, organized.

86
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,908
This might not be his first kidnapping.

87
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,872
Amiel, look for similar priors -
psychos, recently released cons.

88
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:44,834
Montoya, you're on Ilona's car.

89
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:47,456
See Gavary and Lionet in the Casbah.

90
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,214
If the car turns up, he'll tip us off.

91
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,421
First, we find her.

92
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,429
And then we sleep.

93
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,945
Somebody wanna tell me
where she went?

94
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,960
<i>- Woeller.
- Walking shoes, size eight.</i>

95
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,389
<i>Judging from the depths of the prints,
he weighs no more than 140 pounds.</i>

96
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,723
<i>- A woman?
- Or a teenager.</i>

97
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,719
<i>Picked up a lot of junk
and sent it for DNA.</i>

98
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:46,556
<i>50 cigarette butts,
junk food wrappers...</i>

99
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,899
<i>I've got info
on Doctor Muller.</i>

100
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,943
<i>Used to be a big shot at Avalon
researching genetics. Their top guy.</i>

101
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,150
On my way.

102
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,906
<i>When his brother died,
he gave it all up to treat the needy.</i>

103
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,160
<i>He's been head of the clinic
for almost 40 years.</i>

104
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,037
<i>Yes, some more dogs hair over here.
And I found an old pair of underwear...</i>

105
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:27,064
<i>Mostly she works at Avalon's lab.</i>

106
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:32,566
Ilona Tasuiev does regular shifts here,
whenever she has time.

107
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:35,485
<i>Strange way to relax.</i>

108
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:40,528
Contact with the real world
gives you perspective.

109
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,746
<i>Genetic research is fraught with peril.</i>

110
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,284
<i>I can think of more dangerous jobs.</i>

111
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,500
Research is a constant battle, Captain.

112
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,670
Lose sight of your goal,
you lose your way.

113
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,756
I always advise young researchers
to get their hands dirty.

114
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,801
<i>That why you gave up
research yourself?</i>

115
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,939
You've done
your homework.

116
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:14,067
I realized I could do more good here
than in a lab.

117
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,525
And yet you stayed on at Avalon.

118
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:22,080
You don't just leave Avalon.

119
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,417
You called the police at 12:34.

120
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:32,630
<i>A 22-year-old is a half hour late
for work.</i>

121
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:35,758
<i>That's pushing the panic button
a little quick.</i>

122
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,637
Looks like what I did was right.

123
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:45,513
She was never late. Not once.
Not one minute.

124
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:51,104
<i>Ilona made a lot of sacrifices
to get where she is today.</i>

125
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:53,856
<i>Nothing could distract her.</i>

126
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:57,605
<i>- She's an exceptional young woman.
- And gorgeous.</i>

127
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,817
<i>She's fascinating.</i>

128
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:03,407
<i>Surgery get you nervous?</i>

129
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:08,330
Only hospitals. We all have
our bad memories.

130
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:12,831
- That's it, Cecilia, I'm done.
- Very good, Doctor Muller.

131
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,420
Thank you.

132
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,799
<i>One more thing.</i>

133
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,764
<i>What is Ilona working on?
Her research?</i>

134
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:27,179
<i>She's preparing a doctoral thesis
in biogenics.</i>

135
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:30,811
<i>On progeria,
a class of genetic anomaly</i>

136
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:34,226
characterized by premature aging.

137
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:37,030
Mostly in children.

138
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:41,485
A long, hard battle
I used to fight myself...

139
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,862
...ages ago.

140
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,504
Oh...

141
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,605
- Miss me?
- Fucking Karas!

142
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:45,233
- I hate you coming here.
- So do I. Talk.

143
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:50,367
Nobody knows anything about the girl.

144
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:53,368
But her sister hangs out at Blitz
and The 71.

145
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,208
Tell me something I don't know.

146
00:20:55,335 --> 00:21:00,128
I have jack shit, nothing, not a clue,
zilch. Your blonde just vanished.

147
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:03,708
- You're the magician, Goran.
- I'm doing what I can.

148
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:06,880
<i>- Do more.
- OK. OK.</i>

149
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:09,587
Just for you, cut-rate.

150
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,473
A friend of mine, psychic,
sees things in his crystal ball.

151
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:17,601
<i>- He can...
- I don't...</i>

152
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:25,564
<i>Tail the sister.</i>

153
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,857
And get me something solid.

154
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,368
My pleasure.

155
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,920
My sweetest pumpkin.

156
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,555
Champagne?

157
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,357
Mmm...

158
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,525
Where is she, Dimitri?

159
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:15,655
What have you done with her?

160
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,039
You think I got her?

161
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:29,418
But what would I do
with that tight-ass bitch?

162
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:37,635
- And I thought you came to see me.
- Don't fuck with me, Dimitri!

163
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:40,606
I saw you with her last night,
remember?

164
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:44,940
You did? Hmm...

165
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:50,948
- What did you see?
- I haven't told the cops yet.

166
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:18,429
That is what she wanted.

167
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:30,528
- She asked me to steal it for her.
- Steal it?

168
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:32,733
What is this?

169
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:42,331
She hasn't made the final payment yet.

170
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:51,625
<i>Health, beauty, longevity.</i>

171
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:57,800
<i>Avalon. We're on your side, for life.</i>

172
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:03,744
Oh!

173
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:08,004
- Let me go. Let me go!
- Calm down.

174
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,044
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You already have.

175
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,548
Argh!

176
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:21,391
- Where the hell have you been?
- What do you care?

177
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,353
- You think I kidnapped her?
- You tell me.

178
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,721
You're the cop.

179
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:33,441
- I can't waste time chasing you.
- Well, you found me.

180
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:37,283
What is it with you?
You always like this?

181
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,778
Only on days when they kidnap
my little sister.

182
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:55,041
We've always had our differences.

183
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:59,590
Even when we were kids.
Before our parents died in...

184
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:02,012
They died in the war?

185
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:12,807
I was 15. Ilona was only 10.

186
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:16,271
I took care of her after that.

187
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:20,658
We're close, but it's complicated.

188
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,923
When Avalon discovered her,
she must've been about 13.

189
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:38,969
They brought us here.

190
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:41,966
If it wasn't for her,
we'd still be over there.

191
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,144
- Dellenbach?
- He changed her.

192
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,105
She's so confident now.

193
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,307
And what about Doctor Muller?

194
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,230
She met him when she started
her thesis.

195
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:02,529
He promised to help her if she took
three night shifts a week at the clinic.

196
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:06,196
They really admire each other.

197
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,949
Can you think of anyone with a motive?

198
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:26,515
Look, you know your sister
better than I do.

199
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:31,554
If you have anything,
don't hesitate, call.

200
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:37,269
Can I stay here tonight?

201
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,938
That way I'll know where to find you.

202
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:11,449
<i>She's an exceptional
young woman.</i>

203
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,618
<i>She's fascinating.</i>

204
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:22,542
I know you can hear me.

205
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:26,211
I know you're there.

206
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,965
Answer me!

207
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:41,899
My name...is Ilona Tasuiev.

208
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,689
I am 22.

209
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:52,401
<i>I want to live.</i>

210
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:09,346
Huh?

211
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:12,275
Good morning, Captain.
Welcome to Avalon.

212
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,115
Would you mind?
Your weapon and your E-call.

213
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,711
Hmm...

214
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,713
The famous Captain Karas.

215
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,558
Good to meet you. I've heard
great things about you. Please.

216
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:58,199
- Any progress?
- No, nothing...so far.

217
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,407
It's an unbearable situation.

218
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:05,209
If there's anything...

219
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:08,790
Is Ilona working
on something confidential?

220
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:15,544
Like all our scientists, she's working
on improving everyone's quality of life.

221
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,054
Hmm...

222
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,976
Anything else?

223
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:29,194
Tell me if you and Ilona Tasuiev
are lovers.

224
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:41,325
They said you were to the point.

225
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:52,706
I sleep with my secretary,
I sleep with my wife.

226
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:55,880
I even sleep with my sister-in-law.

227
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:59,715
But with my researchers...never.

228
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:10,141
<i>Karas, Goran's looking for you.
Something's going on with the sister.</i>

229
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:35,438
Poor kid. You raise them, give them
love, and this is how they turn out.

230
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,612
Just shut up.

231
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:42,494
Hey, yours is gonna be much worse.

232
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:45,575
I need Karas to sign off on this.

233
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,376
Be my guest.

234
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:52,587
There was a Japanese man.

235
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:56,332
And the kids were lined up,
like for a school picture, you know?

236
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,545
There was a date on the cover. 2006.

237
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,799
- That's all.
- He only let me look for a second.

238
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,766
I need to trust you, Bislane.

239
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,817
If I find you've been
holding out on me again...

240
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,531
Captain. We've got him.

241
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:39,840
Pursuing Ilona's car. Driver unknown.

242
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:45,426
Suspect's car is heading for the center.

243
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:51,514
Karas?

244
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:06,574
Repeat, he's heading for central Paris.

245
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,298
Fuck! Get out of the way!

246
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,549
Cut him off by the Pont des Arts.

247
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,147
Come on, Karas. Move it!

248
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,747
Fuck!

249
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,648
Oh!

250
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:09,922
That's one
of Farfella's henchman.

251
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:12,807
Farfella?
What's he got to do with it?

252
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,807
Well?

253
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,606
Nine and a half.

254
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,605
- It's not him.
- Shit!

255
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,936
- How did he get the car?
- He'd rather die than turn snitch.

256
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,442
Karas. He's lawyered up, Karas.

257
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,648
Karas!

258
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:37,363
Don't leave me with this psycho!

259
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:43,830
- I don't know shit about that girl.
- Come here.

260
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,084
I didn't do nothing. God is my witness.

261
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:51,589
Then let's go and visit Farfella.

262
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:52,404
<i>- Salaam alaikum, Farfella.
- Alaikum salaam, Karas.</i>

263
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:57,325
Once every 20 years.
You don't come often.

264
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:01,037
Put on a little weight.

265
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,704
I always did wanna be just like you.

266
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:24,311
There's my part of the deal, Farfella.
Let's see yours.

267
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:27,227
How nice.

268
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,977
You brought me a gift.

269
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,989
You and I both know
Naghib had nothing to do with the girl.

270
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,494
We both know Naghib stole the car.

271
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:48,129
Where, when, how? I want
all the details and I want them now.

272
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:53,338
You forgot to say please.

273
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,444
Surveillance tape
from the parking lot I own.

274
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,862
Should interest you.

275
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,448
May the prophet be with you, Farfella.

276
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,544
Ah!

277
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,868
Oh, yes.

278
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,787
32 usable parameters for comparison.

279
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,670
We're online for visual ID.

280
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,921
- Run the prior convictions bank.
- Sure.

281
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:32,066
Try all other files. Informants,
suspects, acquittals.

282
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,734
- Damn.
- I can't believe this.

283
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,407
General identification.

284
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,622
Send the picture to Avalon,
copy Muller at the clinic.

285
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,669
If you're still empty, lift any database
you can think of. Military, whatever.

286
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,715
Nora, take over.

287
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,892
- Are you lying again?
- No, I have never seen him.

288
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,279
No, he wasn't in those pictures.
And yes, I'm sure.

289
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:24,737
Who did Dimitri steal that album from?
What was Ilona searching for?

290
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,540
How many more times?
The answers won't change.

291
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,127
Look, I know I shouldn't have
covered for Dimitri,

292
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:40,420
but I didn't want to mention him before
I was sure. You can understand that.

293
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,672
That you tried to protect a scumbag?

294
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,299
He wasn't always like that, you know.

295
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,357
Have you got any more old friends
like him? This could get complicated.

296
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,438
Well, how about you?

297
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:04,191
I bet you meet a lot of flawless women
in your line of work.

298
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,200
No.

299
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:09,448
Then why are you wasting your life
in that world?

300
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,210
Because it's the only one I know.

301
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,841
You got a better one, lead the way,
I'm there.

302
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,930
Right, we must've
missed something.

303
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:35,225
Let's re-examine the files. It's there.
We just have to find it.

304
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,366
That's him. Move!

305
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,977
Argh!

306
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:21,319
Don't move!
Let me see some hands!

307
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,853
Don't move!

308
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,109
- Igor Vord, you're under arrest.
- Not Igor!

309
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,160
Igor Vord. Where?

310
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,079
Igor.

311
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,804
<i>We've got two other names.</i>

312
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,858
<i>Both use the same faces,
both on Metro cards.</i>

313
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,934
<i>No doubt. We're dealing with
identity theft.</i>

314
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,833
- That's right, Captain.
- Hey.

315
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,714
Vord, Novalis and Hemmen,
yes, all cremated here.

316
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,213
Igor Vord, ten years ago, in March '32.

317
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,803
Thomas Hemmen, five years ago.

318
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,219
Alfred Novalis is scheduled
one or two months from now.

319
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,975
You see, it's all in here.

320
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,182
The cremations weren't declared.

321
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:46,477
My report claims the hospital
made the declaration.

322
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,856
Take a look for yourself.

323
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:55,151
The cremation permit was issued
by the Avalon Clinic. All nice and legal.

324
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,450
The same doctor signed off
on all three. Doctor Muller.

325
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:10,215
Nora, get on to Reparaz.
We're going to Muller's house.

326
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,394
If we don't go in now, we lose him.

327
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,776
We sent him the kidnapper's picture.
He knows we're close.

328
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:31,281
<i>- This is nothing but theory.
- He signed for all three bodies.</i>

329
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,030
<i>He must sign 300 of those a year.</i>

330
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,495
<i>If we slip up, his lawyers
will have a field day.</i>

331
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,699
I need a warrant.

332
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,378
<i>It's 5:00 in the morning.
I'll need an hour at least.</i>

333
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,134
<i>Karas! Go in without a warrant,
I'll bust you!</i>

334
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,973
<i>Karas!</i>

335
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,571
Police!

336
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,538
Argh!

337
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:59,026
Amiel, check on Muller and Avalon,
the year 2006.

338
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,946
Dig up everything you can.

339
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,082
Why don't we get to wear
this kind of thing?

340
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,140
Just calm down. It will be fine.

341
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:31,355
He hacked my E-call
and he got me shot.

342
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,103
I want a warrant for Dellenbach.

343
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,524
You've got no proof, Karas.

344
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,227
They were Avalon security!

345
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:44,026
You went in without a warrant
and you killed two men.

346
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,368
You want a medal for that?

347
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,908
Muller is behind the kidnapping
and Avalon's covering for him.

348
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:54,744
One question remains.
What's in it for you?

349
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:59,000
What?

350
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,675
It's over, Karas. You're suspended.

351
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,462
Well, nice move.

352
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:49,016
- Go to hell.
- Helping you...

353
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,096
...that's exactly where I'm headed.

354
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,318
The Metro cards confirm
what you suspected.

355
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,818
Mostly used
around Muller's neighborhood.

356
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,788
Everything you asked for is in there.

357
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:15,120
Muller was one of Avalon's best
and brightest.

358
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:19,961
He gave it all up in 2006
when his little brother died.

359
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,167
He tried everything to save him,

360
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:25,884
but Claus had some kind
of incurable disease.

361
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,884
Progeria.

362
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:36,179
Muller? Impossible. It makes no sense.

363
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:41,061
He used his position at the clinic to forge
IDs. It was his album that Dimitri stole.

364
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,656
- Muller was behind the abduction.
- But why Ilona?

365
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:50,528
She must have found something
concerning his research on progeria.

366
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,158
I have to find out what really happened
in 2006.

367
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,962
Why Ilona wanted that album.

368
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:03,461
But to do that...I need you.

369
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,630
What? Avalon's files?

370
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,172
You hate your job.

371
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:14,013
That's too dangerous.

372
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,303
That's never stopped you before.

373
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:05,021
- Where are you?
- Headed for Archives.

374
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:15,198
Oh, I got you.

375
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,858
<i>- I'm in.
- Good luck.</i>

376
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,907
OK. I've got everything Ilona looked at
on 2006.

377
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:45,961
<i>- Narrow it to progeria. Muller.
- OK.</i>

378
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:49,208
Oh, damn. It's an Alpha file.

379
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:51,418
A what?

380
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:56,428
- I can get us in but it will be flagged.
- Forget it. It's too dangerous.

381
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,965
I'm here to lose my job, remember?

382
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,397
There's...

383
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:11,101
...children.

384
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:14,358
Children with something at the back
of their heads.

385
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:20,195
Triangular scars.
What have they done to them?

386
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:25,496
<i>The Muller protocol
has been terminated.</i>

387
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:30,456
It's the Japanese man. That is the man
in the album. Doctor Nakata.

388
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:35,337
<i>With this death our patient pool
is exhausted.</i>

389
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:41,888
<i>Attempts at treatment through genetic
manipulation have failed.</i>

390
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:49,150
Violation. Room 464. Access violation.

391
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:52,562
<i>- Maximum alert!
- On our way.</i>

392
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,321
Bislane, break it off.

393
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:58,529
<i>All authorization requests
have been aborted</i>

394
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:04,581
<i>and the results gathered
and destroyed</i>

395
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:06,666
<i>by Doctor Muller.</i>

396
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:10,412
<i>We lost our nine children.</i>

397
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:13,751
<i>Five began to mutate before expiring.</i>

398
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,636
Get out of there! Now!

399
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:27,936
<i>They suffered from degeneration
of the heart, lungs, brain.</i>

400
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,272
Room 464 clear.

401
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:35,696
Code black.

402
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,203
<i>I repeat, move to code black.</i>

403
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:46,454
<i>Remain still
for the duration procedure.</i>

404
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:57,670
<i>Remain still
for the duration procedure.</i>

405
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:04,678
They've cut
the power. I can't see.

406
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:18,066
Karas? Karas?

407
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:28,000
- Oh!
- Who is it? Who's there?

408
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,429
Oh!
Ssh! It's me. It's me.

409
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:44,225
They killed all the children.

410
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,470
I heard. Calm down.
We're getting out of here.

411
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:06,245
Find them, and don't lose them again.

412
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,830
If you get a chance, dispose of the girl.

413
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:08,467
We'll wait till daylight.

414
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:17,017
Try to get some sleep.

415
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,457
Like Farfella...

416
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:45,675
...I grew up in the Casbah.

417
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:54,976
What do you think, I was born a cop?

418
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,822
I need to trust you, Karas.

419
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:20,627
If I find you've been holding out
on me again...

420
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:55,576
Stop!

421
01:04:02,507 --> 01:04:04,962
You're sick!

422
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:10,843
You don't scare me, you know.

423
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,723
<i>You're afraid to come in here.</i>

424
01:04:29,534 --> 01:04:33,745
You don't choose the gangs.
you're born into them.

425
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:39,869
Me, Farfella...we were just kids.

426
01:04:41,004 --> 01:04:43,495
It was a game for us.

427
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:49,463
One night...

428
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:53,134
...we were carrying for some thug.

429
01:04:55,977 --> 01:04:58,053
Got caught by another gang.

430
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,102
Locked up. Knocked around.

431
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,112
Get out of here. Run!

432
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:24,287
Farfella got away.

433
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:38,928
So, what do we arrest her for?

434
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:42,097
What the hell?

435
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:45,435
I have no other choice for now.
It's for your own protection.

436
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:49,946
Go fuck yourself! Sleeping with me
gives you no right.

437
01:05:50,073 --> 01:05:52,149
Where's Amiel?

438
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,609
His wife had a baby boy.

439
01:05:54,744 --> 01:05:57,152
- Funny thing is...
- What?

440
01:05:57,288 --> 01:06:01,785
...he was thinking of calling him Karas,
but he's afraid it would be bad luck.

441
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:13,342
Anything on Nakata?

442
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:16,045
What I wouldn't do for you.

443
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:21,102
This is off the record.

444
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:24,396
He was Muller's assistant till 2006.

445
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:31,025
The only member of the team still alive.
Get this...93 years old.

446
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:56,005
You are here to talk about
Jonas Muller, right?

447
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:20,073
There's no need to judge me.

448
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:23,122
I'm not ashamed of what we did.

449
01:07:24,209 --> 01:07:28,456
You killed all those children.

450
01:07:28,588 --> 01:07:30,746
We tried to help them.

451
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:33,800
They had progeria.

452
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:37,679
We weren't murderers.

453
01:07:37,806 --> 01:07:41,056
Those children were condemned.

454
01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:44,470
We tried everything.

455
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:51,984
When his brother died,
it was too much for Muller.

456
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:54,400
He quit his research.

457
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:58,487
Destroyed all his papers.

458
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:04,532
20 years up in smoke.

459
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:12,041
The clinic became his salvation.

460
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:19,136
Ilona understood that.

461
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:22,930
You know her?

462
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:43,865
She came here about a year ago.

463
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:51,123
Wanting to understand
Doctor Muller's past.

464
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:57,545
To understand our failure.

465
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,797
And how did Avalon react?

466
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:05,347
Avalon wanted him to continue,
of course.

467
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:08,968
They offered him a fortune.

468
01:09:11,983 --> 01:09:13,857
Captain...

469
01:09:14,986 --> 01:09:21,523
...do you have any idea
what the Muller protocol was?

470
01:09:24,204 --> 01:09:27,324
Progeria was the means to an end.

471
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:33,253
Oh, our protocol was simple.

472
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,621
Very simple.

473
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:42,131
Our goal was immortality.

474
01:10:06,246 --> 01:10:08,784
So tired.

475
01:10:13,128 --> 01:10:15,204
<i>Immortality.</i>

476
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:31,476
It's vital your research
remain a secret.

477
01:10:31,605 --> 01:10:35,733
What's the matter, Jonas? Afraid?

478
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:37,935
It would be too dangerous.

479
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:42,447
Come on. Shoot.

480
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:58,415
To think I admired you all these years.

481
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,717
You're nothing but a coward, Jonas.

482
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:12,260
You always have been.

483
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:01,560
Don't move, Karas!

484
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:09,858
Where is she, Doctor?

485
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:15,833
Your gun. Your E-call.

486
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:20,039
- Back-up, now.
- Karas!

487
01:12:20,171 --> 01:12:23,172
What are you going to do,
Doctor Muller, kill me?

488
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,254
To the edge.

489
01:12:28,638 --> 01:12:30,880
Cuff yourself to the railing.

490
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:42,981
She's alive, isn't she?

491
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:46,943
Unfortunately. I am no killer.

492
01:12:47,073 --> 01:12:49,944
I couldn't convince her.

493
01:12:50,076 --> 01:12:54,157
For years I've been trying to show her
how dangerous they were, but...

494
01:12:54,289 --> 01:12:58,334
Tell me where she is, Doctor.
I understand.

495
01:13:00,003 --> 01:13:03,787
- I know what you've been through.
- You know nothing.

496
01:13:03,924 --> 01:13:07,127
You've been wrong all along, Karas.

497
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,131
She's the danger! Ilona is the danger,
you hear me?

498
01:13:10,263 --> 01:13:12,552
What are you talking about?

499
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:14,971
She pieced it together.

500
01:13:15,101 --> 01:13:19,598
Just like I did 40 years ago.
She found the answer.

501
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:22,139
The protocol for immortality.

502
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,933
And Avalon knows.

503
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:38,867
I know you want to save her,

504
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,212
but if you save her, you'll give Avalon
unlimited power.

505
01:13:43,338 --> 01:13:46,956
The power over life and death forever.

506
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:49,586
No!

507
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:52,008
We have no time, Muller.

508
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:56,140
I've been keeping immortality from them
for 40 years

509
01:13:56,268 --> 01:13:58,391
<i>because it would be madness.</i>

510
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:02,266
Without death, life is meaningless.

511
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:05,602
- Where is she?
- You're not listening!

512
01:14:07,237 --> 01:14:10,653
Ilona isn't just another victim.

513
01:14:10,782 --> 01:14:14,614
If Avalon find her, we'll all be victims.

514
01:14:22,627 --> 01:14:24,869
No, don't do this.

515
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,759
You are our last chance.

516
01:14:36,558 --> 01:14:40,805
I was never born. I have failed.

517
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:43,309
I go back to ashes.

518
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:50,398
No!

519
01:15:56,221 --> 01:15:59,804
- What did Muller want with you?
- He told me what you really are.

520
01:15:59,933 --> 01:16:04,180
- Come on, Karas, quit playing the saint.
- I don't know anything about saints.

521
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:08,180
But I have an uncanny instinct
for sniffing out a son of a bitch!

522
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:14,562
For someone with instinct, you let a lot
of people die when you're on the case.

523
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:17,652
Dimitri Ostrovski.

524
01:16:17,784 --> 01:16:20,987
Jonas Muller.

525
01:16:21,121 --> 01:16:23,956
Hishiro Nakata.

526
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:28,293
You didn't know.

527
01:16:41,683 --> 01:16:43,842
- Get fucking down!
- Argh!

528
01:16:46,813 --> 01:16:49,648
He said down, you shit!

529
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,317
Everything has its price, Captain.

530
01:17:02,704 --> 01:17:04,863
You cash in or you pay out.

531
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:11,419
I'm gonna make sure you pay
a very high price.

532
01:17:15,592 --> 01:17:17,668
I'll break you.

533
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:45,906
I was gonna beat the hell out of you.

534
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:48,115
But I see someone got there first.

535
01:18:53,482 --> 01:18:58,724
<i>Doctor Muller worked
tirelessly for the benefit of mankind.</i>

536
01:19:00,781 --> 01:19:03,865
<i>The man was a genius.
A true visionary.</i>

537
01:19:03,992 --> 01:19:07,776
<i>...a number of interesting
elements concerning his death...</i>

538
01:19:09,206 --> 01:19:14,544
<i>...officer of Police Section K,
Captain Karas, is the main suspect.</i>

539
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:23,006
People around me disappear.

540
01:19:25,055 --> 01:19:27,131
We do have something in common.

541
01:19:27,265 --> 01:19:29,970
You're not safe with me.

542
01:19:33,438 --> 01:19:35,514
We'll get over this.

543
01:19:37,651 --> 01:19:40,356
It's just one more scar adding up.

544
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,284
What is it?

545
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,499
The scar.

546
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:05,501
- It's Claus. Muller's little brother.
- Oh, my God.

547
01:20:08,181 --> 01:20:10,257
He's alive.

548
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:19,722
<i>Muller had discovered
immortality,</i>

549
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,896
<i>but he wanted to keep it from Avalon.</i>

550
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,521
<i>So he destroyed every trace
of his research,</i>

551
01:20:25,657 --> 01:20:29,785
<i>except for one piece of vital evidence.
Claus himself.</i>

552
01:20:30,954 --> 01:20:34,904
<i>Muller stole the identity of people
who died at his clinic</i>

553
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:37,711
<i>so Claus could remain anonymous.</i>

554
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:42,502
<i>For 40 years he's been stuck
in the body of a sick boy.</i>

555
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,171
And Ilona discovered his secret.

556
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:56,302
If Dellenbach gets to Ilona before I do,

557
01:20:56,438 --> 01:20:59,143
everything Muller did

558
01:20:59,274 --> 01:21:01,350
will go to waste.

559
01:21:06,782 --> 01:21:10,530
- You already gave up on her.
- I will find her.

560
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:14,111
But she can't go back
to the life she had.

561
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:19,783
Promise me you'll save her, Karas.

562
01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:24,496
Promise me.

563
01:21:24,633 --> 01:21:27,041
I promise, Bislane.

564
01:21:29,638 --> 01:21:31,963
You can't stay here, you have to hide.

565
01:21:32,099 --> 01:21:35,100
Dellenbach will stop at nothing
to get to us.

566
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:53,319
Hmm?

567
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:02,003
Come back or I'll kill you.

568
01:22:02,713 --> 01:22:05,120
After 20 years...

569
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:08,209
...now we're even.

570
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:13,092
May the prophet be with you, Karas.

571
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:17,638
<i>Salaam alaikum, Farfella.</i>

572
01:22:42,294 --> 01:22:44,963
I loved him, too, Claus.

573
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,256
I know what you went through.

574
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:54,672
I grew up alone.

575
01:22:54,806 --> 01:22:58,674
When I got here,
Jonas took care of me.

576
01:23:00,521 --> 01:23:02,643
He gave me hope.

577
01:23:04,608 --> 01:23:06,850
<i>He was like a father to me.</i>

578
01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:09,607
I need you.

579
01:23:27,422 --> 01:23:29,498
Hi, mummy.

580
01:23:44,064 --> 01:23:47,480
Well, you are a wanted man, Karas.

581
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:53,565
I've got the footage from the surveillance
cams around Muller's neighborhood.

582
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:56,071
And?

583
01:23:56,201 --> 01:23:59,701
Now you really owe me one.
Our friend gave us his best smile.

584
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:02,155
Look at that.

585
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:10,206
Show it again.

586
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:15,675
Closer.

587
01:24:15,804 --> 01:24:18,509
Left.

588
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,717
Closer.

589
01:24:24,855 --> 01:24:26,931
Freeze.

590
01:24:29,651 --> 01:24:31,525
Got you!

591
01:24:31,653 --> 01:24:33,895
That's where he is.

592
01:24:36,658 --> 01:24:39,944
- Let's go.
- I have to go alone.

593
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:42,914
I can't tell you why.

594
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,076
- You go home to your wife and son.
- Wait, Karas.

595
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,671
<i>Good luck.</i>

596
01:24:58,514 --> 01:25:00,257
Take care, Karas.

597
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:08,974
Argh!

598
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:17,275
- Come on!
- Come on.

599
01:25:17,408 --> 01:25:19,199
Karas!

600
01:25:19,326 --> 01:25:22,410
Karas!

601
01:25:36,176 --> 01:25:39,794
Where is your Captain?

602
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:42,088
I'm getting a little impatient.

603
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:44,513
You got any place to be...

604
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:58,611
Hmm. Eight pounds, six ounces.

605
01:25:58,741 --> 01:26:02,110
Isn't that sweet?

606
01:26:04,788 --> 01:26:07,873
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

607
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:11,543
No...

608
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:14,920
What a shame it would be
if anything happened to you.

609
01:26:17,051 --> 01:26:21,380
But don't worry, Avalon knows
how to take care of children.

610
01:26:59,593 --> 01:27:01,669
<i>It's just the two of us now.</i>

611
01:28:46,283 --> 01:28:48,359
Claus, I...

612
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:36,659
Let him go!

613
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:39,627
Let him go!

614
01:29:46,093 --> 01:29:48,762
He tried to kill me.

615
01:30:00,024 --> 01:30:03,227
- But...
- Come with me. I'm...

616
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,061
I know who you are. You're the one
that killed Muller.

617
01:30:07,197 --> 01:30:09,274
- It was an accident.
- He'd gone mad...

618
01:30:09,408 --> 01:30:14,450
- He was protecting you from Avalon.
- What are you talking about?

619
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,118
What do you want?

620
01:30:17,249 --> 01:30:20,499
- Let me go!
- That's enough!

621
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:24,708
I promised Bislane I'd save you
and I will, whether you want me to or not.

622
01:30:42,983 --> 01:30:44,442
Help!

623
01:30:46,487 --> 01:30:49,607
One more word and I will kill you.

624
01:30:55,788 --> 01:30:58,030
Find them!

625
01:31:18,477 --> 01:31:22,345
Leave me alone. I'm begging you.

626
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:52,422
Go!

627
01:32:00,769 --> 01:32:02,845
Argh!

628
01:32:13,532 --> 01:32:15,074
Go on.

629
01:32:34,553 --> 01:32:37,305
They're coming, Ilona.

630
01:32:37,431 --> 01:32:39,673
You have to disappear.

631
01:32:41,185 --> 01:32:44,186
Forever.

632
01:32:44,313 --> 01:32:47,148
Go on. Run.

633
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:52,773
Ilona, please. You are our only hope.

634
01:32:52,905 --> 01:32:54,981
Our only hope?

635
01:32:57,576 --> 01:33:00,363
Who do you think you are?

636
01:33:00,496 --> 01:33:03,865
The world is waiting for my discovery.

637
01:33:03,999 --> 01:33:06,490
It always has been.

638
01:33:06,627 --> 01:33:09,628
Avalon will turn your dream
into a nightmare.

639
01:33:09,755 --> 01:33:14,049
- What do you know about my dreams?
- Ilona...

640
01:33:14,176 --> 01:33:19,004
You can't understand this anyway.
You haven't got the brains.

641
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,057
Ilona, Bislane is safe.

642
01:33:22,184 --> 01:33:24,260
You can have a new life.

643
01:33:27,022 --> 01:33:29,311
I can have everlasting life.

644
01:33:29,442 --> 01:33:32,478
Ilona, no. Don't do this.

645
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:35,281
Ilona, please!

646
01:33:35,406 --> 01:33:38,241
I'm begging you, don't.

647
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:45,454
Yes.

648
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:51,454
<i>Our goal was immortality.</i>

649
01:33:51,589 --> 01:33:54,839
<i>Without death,
life is meaningless.</i>

650
01:33:54,967 --> 01:33:59,179
<i>Promise me you'll save her.
Ilona is the danger!</i>

651
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:01,630
<i>Promise me.</i>

652
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:14,100
No!

653
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:03,783
Karas.

654
01:35:06,163 --> 01:35:08,833
Karas.

655
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:11,531
I gave her the new ID.

656
01:35:13,796 --> 01:35:16,916
She had already made up
her mind, Bislane.

657
01:35:18,801 --> 01:35:21,374
She knew she had to end it.

658
01:35:24,807 --> 01:35:27,215
She's gone forever.

659
01:35:28,644 --> 01:35:30,720
To save herself.

660
01:35:31,814 --> 01:35:33,890
To save us all.

661
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:37,185
I can't leave her alone.

662
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:41,562
I can't just abandon her.

663
01:35:44,243 --> 01:35:46,319
I have to find her.

664
01:35:53,836 --> 01:35:56,541
You have to respect her choice.

665
01:35:59,633 --> 01:36:01,709
You'll never see her again.

666
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,256
But you can be proud.

667
01:36:07,308 --> 01:36:09,384
Proud of your little sister.

668
01:36:57,984 --> 01:37:00,735
<i>I like being beautiful.</i>

669
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:03,483
<i>I like to stay fit.</i>

670
01:37:03,614 --> 01:37:06,070
<i>That's why I like Avalon.</i>

671
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,569
<i>With Avalon, I know I'm beautiful.</i>

672
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:13,286
<i>And I'm going to stay that way.</i>

673
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:16,619
<i>Avalon. For a better world.</i>

674
01:37:16,752 --> 01:37:21,628
<i>Health. Beauty. Longevity.</i>

675
01:37:21,757 --> 01:37:27,796
<i>Avalon. We're on your side, for life.</i>

675
01:37:28,305 --> 01:38:28,640
