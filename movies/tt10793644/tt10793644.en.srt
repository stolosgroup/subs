3
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:11,364
For thousands of years, religious Jews have praticed the ritual of "the vigil"-

4
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:16,122
When a member of the
community dies, the body is

5
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,666
watched round-the-clock
in shofts by a Shomer, or

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,210
watchamn, who recites the
Psalms to comfort the

7
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,722
deceased's soul and protect it from unseen evil.

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,887
This watchman is typically a family member
or friend, but there are paid Shomers...

9
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:40,322
Hired to sit the vigil when no one else can.

10
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,051
This is about
giving you the tools

11
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,687
to make new lives
for yourselves.

12
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:41,598
And like anything else, it takes
time. It's not always easy.

13
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,274
Hey, Adinah.

14
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,081
You wanted to tell the group...

15
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,752
..about something
you experienced recently?

16
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:55,123
Oh, this is gonna be good.

17
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,930
- Oh, wait.
- Um, yeah.

18
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:00,968
Uh, so, uh, I was
on the subway going to work

19
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:04,310
and this man approached me
in such a way.

20
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:08,985
You know, like making small
talk, commenting on my skirt.

21
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,689
It was obvious what he wanted.

22
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,157
And I don't know,
I was just like...

23
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,198
Stop acting crazy!

24
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,530
He was hitting on you.

25
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:16,700
I wish that'd happen to me.

26
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,507
Yeah, but this guy, he looked

27
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,276
like a person on TV looks like.

28
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:23,314
- Ohh.
- You know, the jaw, so perfect.

29
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,318
Like so... Whatever.

30
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,754
What I'm saying is

31
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:28,825
he wasn't even trying
to hide his intentions.

32
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:31,964
That's how it is -
they see a shaina maidel,

33
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,934
and they just can't help
themselves, right?

34
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,767
Hmm. That's just...
That's the culture.

35
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:37,708
You know what I mean?

36
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,881
Yeah. It's crude.

37
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,517
- It's different.
- Exactly.

38
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,356
I mean, life's different
out here. It's, uh... This is...

39
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,030
This is exactly what the rabbis
try to protect us from. Right?

40
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:50,702
- I mean...
- Not protect us from.

41
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,137
To keep us from.

42
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,807
I'm saying
maybe they're...

43
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,797
Some things they're right
to keep us from.

44
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,316
- No?
- Yeah, like what?

45
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:59,801
An old, fat Goy with terrible teeth?

46
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:00,964
Drunk on the street.

47
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:08,505
So, tell us. How was last week?

48
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:10,976
The job interview.

49
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,619
Oh. Um, I didn't...
I didn't get the job.

50
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:19,427
Oh, sorry to hear that, Yacov.
Can we talk about it?

51
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,066
I did the interview.

52
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,706
I thought it went pretty well.

53
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:31,183
Um... they were wanting me to
bring in a resume and I... I...

54
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,401
I was writing the resume
on a piece of loose paper.

55
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:43,974
That's what I've been saying.

56
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,945
We need more classes on this,
you know?

57
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,850
- And basic living.
- Yeah.

58
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,553
And your rent?

59
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,928
Uh... I mean, I'm struggling.

60
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:57,970
I don't... know what to say.
Um...

61
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:01,311
The money's never enough. Uh...

62
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,389
I'm having to choose
between medication and meals.

63
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,160
It's not so easy.

64
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,833
I guess it's a journey.

65
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,671
And being here struggling,
the way you are,

66
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,675
is only one stop
on that journey.

67
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,417
If we get bogged down
and see this as the destination,

68
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,053
we lose hope.

69
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:27,062
I... just want to be normal.

70
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,469
And a big part of that
is letting go.

71
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,305
Letting go of the pain.

72
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,345
The trauma that holds you back.

73
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,149
What matters is we left. Right?

74
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,993
No. What matters is
we're moving forward.

75
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,063
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

76
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:49,105
Oh, OK, be good.

77
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,773
Oh, great...

78
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,063
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

79
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

80
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:08,644
- Want to go out for coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.

81
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,114
Tea?

82
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:12,452
- Um...
- One hot chocolate?

83
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,523
- Right now?
- No.

84
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:16,226
Tomorrow or...

85
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,033
OK.

86
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,369
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:23,941
- You sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

88
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:26,913
Good. Wanna take my number?

89
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,550
Oh! Um...

90
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,986
Take my number.

91
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,656
It's 917...

92
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,226
Wait, I just got the phone.

93
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,765
It's OK. The green... Yeah.

94
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,202
And then Contacts.

95
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:39,973
No, no. Can I?

96
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,610
Oh, please.

97
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,282
It's so cool, though, 'cause
I was looking around on the net

98
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:45,918
and I found a flashlight.

99
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,588
And it's, like,
it's my favourite.

100
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,193
And, I mean, having anything
you find, it's unbelievable.

101
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:52,163
- You get text, right?
- Yes. Yes.

102
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,402
OK, cool. Text me tomorrow.

103
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,908
And then we'll just take it
from there, yeah?

104
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,310
OK.

105
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,848
- Cool. 'Bye.
- Cool. OK.

106
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,323
- Oh. Good.
- It's al... It's OK. Alright.

107
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,992
Sorry, I'm still
learning the rules.

108
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,862
It's OK. We all are. It's good.

109
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:09,031
- Good.
- Alright.

110
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,302
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

111
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,438
- See you next week.
- Yeah, it looks so natural.

112
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,409
One day...

113
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,624
He's here again?

114
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:23,428
Ah...

115
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:37,822
Hey!

116
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,094
Hey, excuse me!

117
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,232
Excuse me.

118
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,638
I thought we discussed this.

119
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,842
You coming here
and harassing our membership.

120
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,277
I don't wanna call
the police again.

121
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,506
It's OK, Lane. It's fine.

122
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,024
I want to talk to him for just a minute.

123
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:55,089
If Yacov wants to talk,
he knows where to find you.

124
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:57,160
It's OK, really.
It'll be OK.

125
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,603
I only want to ask him something.

126
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,033
Yacov, you come and get me

127
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,338
if this turns into
something uncomfortable.

128
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:05,544
Thank you, Lane.
Tonight was great. OK?

129
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,982
Yeah. I'll see you.
Call me, yeah?

130
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:09,285
Yeah.

131
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:15,517
How are you?

132
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:17,561
You look a little exhausted...

133
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,438
I'm good.

134
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,527
How are things going
with this new lifestyle?

135
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,380
I'm OK. I made my choice.

136
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:26,487
Really, OK? I have my reasons
for leaving, and that's it.

137
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,198
Listen, I didn't...

138
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,368
I didn't want to push you away or anything.

139
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,122
I'm not trying to pry or get
into your business either.

140
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:39,125
It's just that I think about you
all the time. You understand?

141
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,710
You said you had a question.

142
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:45,540
I need you to be a Shomer. Tonight.

143
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,173
Ah, no.

144
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,010
I will pay you.

145
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,134
No.

146
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,473
- Hmm?
- No. I don't think I will.

147
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,351
I know you could use the money.

148
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:59,853
And I know you have trouble with rent...

149
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,481
- And I know you have trouble with rent...
- How do you know that?

150
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,150
How do you know that?

151
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,403
Why's it matter? I'll give
you $200 dollars, cash.

152
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:08,946
Right now.

153
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,781
For how long?

154
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,408
For how long?
Five hours.

155
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,701
From now until the morning.

156
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,164
We had someone.

157
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:22,543
But he changed his mind and left suddenly.

158
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,735
200?

159
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,574
I'll do it for 5.

160
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,342
$300.

161
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:32,344
You came to me?

162
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:33,429
Right?

163
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:34,513
Right?
Yeah.

164
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,223
You're desperate, right? You need me.

165
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:37,308
Right?

166
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:39,685
Ok. So $500.

167
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,914
I used to do this all the time.

168
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,714
People in the community
that don't have any family,

169
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,249
and no friends.

170
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:50,856
It's me, OK?
I'm watching the body.

171
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,493
I'll give you $400. Not a dollar more.

172
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,941
- OK.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:04,550
- A deal?
- OK. Yeah, a deal. Deal.

174
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,142
I knew right away you'd take this job.

175
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:27,899
And I know you're doing it for the money
but it's nothing to be ashamed of.

176
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:31,862
I honestly wanted to ask
you because sitting the

177
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:35,532
vigil, it brings you
closer to the community.

178
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,452
Wow. This is...

179
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:41,288
It is truly God's plan.

180
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,464
Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:50,922
It's just that when you sit the vigil,
it's holy. It brings you back to us.

182
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,801
You've been feeling down.
We can talk things

183
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,388
through. Maybe tonight
will even help a bit...

184
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,180
So Shulem, who is the deceased?

185
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:06,397
He's Rubin Litvak, did you know him?

186
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,149
- He's Rubin Litvak, did you know him?
- No.

187
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,442
He was a good man, a little weird.

188
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:13,279
He was a Holocaust survivor
who made it through

189
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,697
the war but lost his
entire family there.

190
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:18,697
After the war, he started a family here...

191
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,039
But then he became a recluse,
estranged from his kids and grandchildren.

192
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,683
He hadn't left his home in years.

193
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,714
- It's a really sad story.
- I never saw him out.

194
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,087
He used to say that
whenever he stepped out of

195
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,505
his house, it was like he
was in absolute agony.

196
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:33,774
And the other Shomer,
why was he leaving?

197
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,343
The other Shomer just ran out.
I trusted him, he's

198
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,929
family, but he left the job
because he was afraid...

199
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,013
Afraid?

200
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,265
Afraid?
That's what he said.

201
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,975
Why was he afraid?

202
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:54,361
Mr. Litvak's wife suffers
from Alzheimer's and is quite frail.

203
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:58,407
She'll likely sleep through the night.

204
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,412
It'll be quiet.

205
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,584
Here we are.

206
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:51,950
Mrs Litvak?

207
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:56,660
Reb?

208
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,397
Hello, Mrs Litvak.

209
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,166
I'm extremely sorry
for your loss.

210
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:09,852
Who is this man? I thought
you were getting a Shomer.

211
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:12,955
He will be the Shomer tonight.

212
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:13,597
No.

213
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,361
He's an experienced Shomer. He sat the
vigil for Moshe Kellner, Chaim Sturman...

214
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,039
He won't work.

215
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:27,371
I know that you had a very
difficult and upsetting day.

216
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:29,651
But this will be good, it'll be good...

217
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,228
He needs to leave now!

218
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,145
You have to leave now.

219
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,811
She'll sleep, don't worry about it.

220
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,900
The mortuary guys will be here at dawn.

221
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,139
The mortuary men will be here in...

222
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,725
...five hours.

223
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,796
If you have any problems, my house...

224
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,247
There's not going to be
any problem.

225
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,649
I'm saying that if there is
a problem, I'm close by.

226
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,192
It'd be nice if you'd join
us for the morning prayers.

227
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,358
Rebie, I'm coming here because I
need a little bit of money, OK?

228
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,821
I'm agreeing to that and let's
just leave it at that. Please.

229
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,410
Look I'm not trying to push you.
All I'm saying is

230
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,203
that it might be difficult
being here all night and...

231
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:33,484
...if you want to chat about it later,

232
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,142
come to synagogue.

233
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,480
Okay. No problem. I hope
everything goes well.

234
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,720
- Um... OK.
- OK.

235
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,490
- Oh, yeah?
- OK.

236
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,193
OK.

237
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,261
See ya later.

238
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:02,264
OK.

Hmm.

247
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,571
Mrs Litvak?

248
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:06,591
Is anyone there?

249
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:28,244
Is anyone here?

Mazzik July 271979

251
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:23,776
You told me Lieb could do magic.

252
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,486
He couldn't do anything!

253
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,698
- He couldn't do anything!
- I never said he could really do magic!

254
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:29,473
Yes, you did!

255
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,787
No, no, no. They're only tricks.

256
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,785
I'll show you someday.

257
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,370
Promise?

258
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:35,997
God willing.

259
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:45,275
Boing!

260
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,780
Oh!

261
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:58,835
Hey! Hey, little man!

262
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:01,608
- A little Jew boy.
- Look at this asshole.

263
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,578
What the hell
you're ignoring me, man?

264
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:07,153
I'm just trying to ask you
a question. Slow down.

265
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:50,271
Ouch!

266
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:26,066

Hey.

New message from Sarah

Sarah What're you doing?

270

Working.

271
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:40,591
- Working.
- I'm Shomer for the night.

272
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:53,569
I should not be on my phone.

273
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:55,867
Sarah Ok. Sorry :(

274
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:18,553
No. It's ok.

275
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:34,444
What are you...

276
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:38,364
Sarah It's a pretty night.

277
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:39,769
The moon is out.
You ever see the rabbit in it?

278
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,348
What?

279
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:45,913
Rabbit?

280
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:53,379
Sarah The nose is facing up,

281
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:55,881
little tail at the bottom.

282
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:58,134
It's silly.
I should let you go.

283
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:36,964
Not silly.

284
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:43,804
Talk soon.

285
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,769

Pull yourself together.

294
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:06,674
I'm losing my mind.

295
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:18,518
I'm going crazy.

296

Hi, Dr Kohlberg.

305
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,755
Um, this is Yacov Ronen
and, um...

306
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,360
..I'm sorry to call you
in the middle of the night.

307
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:51,166
I don't want to bother you,
but I...

308
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:56,910
I'm having a little bit
of trouble right now.

309
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,114
Um... I'm seeing things...

310
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:02,087
..and... and I'm hearing things.

311
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:05,060
Um, it's... it's worse
than it's ever been before.

312
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:06,830
And, um...

313
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:09,469
I, uh...

314
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,540
..I'm... I'm almost
out of the pills.

315
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:15,046
So, I... was really hoping
to talk to you.

316
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,987
I don't think that I need
to go back into the hospital.

317
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,491
Um...

318
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:23,530
But... I would like to talk
to you as soon as possible.

319
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:25,668
So if you please could
just get back to me,

320
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,772
I'd really appreciate it,
thank you.

321
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,239
Ahhhh.

322
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:36,108
Argh!

323
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:40,485
Ahh...

324
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,557
They're not nightmares.

325
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,828
Oh.

326
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:41,073
They're memories.

327
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,512
Not your memories, but...

328
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,918
Sorry about the mess,
Mrs Litvak.

329
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:50,057
I'm gonna clean this up
right now.

330
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,604
Why did you come here?

331
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:59,509
I'm Yacov, Mrs Litvak.
I'm the Shomer.

332
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,951
I'm here to protect
and comfort your husband's soul.

333
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:06,022
Protect it against what?

334
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,614
Do you know my children?

335
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:42,160
I drove them away
as far as they could go.

336
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,934
They think they left...

337
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,708
..on their own accord.

338
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:51,581
That it was their choice.

339
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:54,018
Hmm.

340
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,557
But I drove them away.

341
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,974
I drove them away.

342
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:14,959
You know why...

343
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:18,434
..I made them leave?

344
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,548
This is not a place
for children.

345
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:30,157
It was a... bunker.

346
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:32,895
In a wilderness.

347
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:39,309
A place that you go to,
but never return from.

348
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,260
Do you know my husband?

349
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:53,169
He was broken by memories.

350
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,240
Hmm.

351
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,578
Those kind of memories
that you saw.

352
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,152
They bite.

353
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:03,657
They bite
and the biting never stops.

354
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:14,412
He was so lost,
he didn't know what to do.

355
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,255
Mrs Litvak, I'm very sorry
for waking you up.

356
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:22,429
We should get you
back to sleep now.

357
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,238
- Mrs Litvak, your hand.
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

358
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,076
- You've got to let me help you.
- No!

359
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:31,946
You're bleeding. Please. Wait.

360
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,188
No, no. No.

361
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:40,664
Wait, Mrs Litvak,
let me help you.

362
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,475
<i>..once told me...</i>

363
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:26,422
<i>..that these demons
who destroy us...</i>

364
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:33,202
<i>..who are born
between the days of creation...</i>

365
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,343
<i>..given life...</i>

366
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:41,320
<i>..but no soul and no form.</i>

367
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:53,444
<i>These are not beings
in the true sense of the word.</i>

368
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,417
<i>They do not have a... a will,</i>

369
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,057
<i>a connection
to the higher power,</i>

370
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,831
<i>but they are animalistic.</i>

371
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:06,068
<i>These demons...</i>

372
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,611
<i>..they are parasites.</i>

373
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:17,791
<i>In tractates Berakhot...</i>

374
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:21,232
<i>..the Mazzikim
are interchangeable</i>

375
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:22,902
<i>with the shedim.</i>

376
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,379
<i>But I've spent
the last five decades</i>

377
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:34,525
<i>studying the one who followed me
home from Buchenwald.</i>

378
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,498
<i>I do not know
where it came from originally,</i>

379
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:43,242
<i>but what it has shown me,
it is very, very old.</i>

380
00:42:44,177 --> 00:42:47,216
<i>I suppose it was lying in wait,</i>

381
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,087
<i>hibernating in its way,</i>

382
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,457
<i>in the forest.</i>

383
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:56,435
<i>Dormant until my pain
awakened it.</i>

384
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:00,878
<i>The Mazzik appears as a figure</i>

385
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,450
<i>with its head turned</i>

386
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,186
<i>like so.</i>

387
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:08,225
<i>But all the way around.</i>

388
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,632
<i>It is damned to look backwards</i>

389
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:15,473
<i>to stare in the past.</i>

390
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,942
<i>This demon,</i>

391
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:20,752
<i>it showed me dreadful things.</i>

392
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:23,956
<i>10 years ago,</i>

393
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:30,102
<i>I found an inscription
in a text by Moses ben Shem-Tov.</i>

394
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:34,979
<i>It says the only way
to escape the Mazzik</i>

395
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,453
<i>is to burn its true face</i>

396
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:41,192
<i>the first night it appears.</i>

397
00:43:41,225 --> 00:43:44,566
<i>But if you do not do this
by dawn...</i>

398
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:47,638
<i>..it will never leave you.</i>

399
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:51,779
<i>For me...</i>

400
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:55,721
<i>..this time has long passed.</i>

401
00:43:59,327 --> 00:44:01,265
<i>When I am gone...</i>

402
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:08,646
<i>..the Mazzik will
find another broken person.</i>

403
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,318
<i>Someone else chained</i>

404
00:44:11,352 --> 00:44:14,993
<i>to some terrible pain
they cannot let go.</i>

405
00:44:15,025 --> 00:44:18,265
<i>When it finds its next host...</i>

406
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:22,441
<i>..it will slowly
consume their soul</i>

407
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:25,146
<i>just as it did to me.</i>

408
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,252
<i>Chewing.</i>

409
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:32,227
<i>Gnawing down
through the spiritual aspects.</i>

410
00:44:33,262 --> 00:44:36,436
<i>The five essences of us all.</i>

411
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:43,583
<i>It worms its way through
Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah</i>

412
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:44,419
<i>and Chayah.</i>

413
00:44:45,821 --> 00:44:48,793
<i>And finally
to Yechidah.</i>

414
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:53,235
<i>The direct link to Hashem.</i>

415
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:55,874
Behind you.

416
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:02,787
<i>And so I make
these tapes,</i>

417
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:06,663
<i>I write it down,
put it on the walls,</i>

418
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:09,033
<i>explain it,</i>

419
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:14,444
<i>in the hopes that whoever
finds the Mazzik next</i>

420
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,616
<i>won't be doomed...</i>

421
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:22,293
<i>..consumed... as I was.</i>

422
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,093
Hello?

423
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:14,197
<i>Yacov.</i>

424
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,201
<i>It's Dr Kohlberg.</i>

425
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:19,375
Dr Kohlberg! Baruch Hashem.

426
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:23,315
I'm, uh...
I'm not doing so great.

427
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:26,489
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

428
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:31,366
I'm seeing things

429
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:35,540
and I'm hearing, um...

430
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:38,212
It's a lot. It's a lot.

431
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:41,852
And I, uh... I took a tablet,

432
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,327
one of the Ativan,
a little while ago, but I...

433
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,962
<i>Seeing who, Yacov?</i>

434
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:48,734
<i>Who are you seeing?</i>

435
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:54,244
I don't know.

436
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,850
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

437
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,692
I'm in Boro Park. I, uh...

438
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:06,569
I took a job as a Shomer
for the night.

439
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,839
Reb Shulem is paying me, so...

440
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:12,948
<i>Are you safe?</i>

441
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,420
I don't know. I think so.

442
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:21,798
<i>These things you're seeing,
do you think that they're real?</i>

443
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:23,937
No, they can't be.

444
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:34,224
Dr Kohlberg, the... the man
who was living here,

445
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:36,094
um, and his wife,

446
00:47:36,127 --> 00:47:40,369
I think that they went crazy
together, living in the house.

447
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:41,706
Um...

448
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:45,314
She's...
She's got very bad dementia.

449
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:46,949
It's very sad.

450
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:48,654
And he...

451
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,928
..um... was obsessed with demons.

452
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,365
<i>Demons?</i>

453
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:56,167
Something called a Mazzik.

454
00:47:56,201 --> 00:48:01,479
<i>And is this what you think
you've been seeing? A demon?</i>

455
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:03,850
Shadows, shadows.

456
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:07,056
<i>Yacov, we talked about what
happened to your little brother,</i>

457
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:11,165
<i>about post-traumatic stress
and your fears.</i>

458
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:16,641
I know. I know.

459
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:19,781
<i>Tell me, Yacov,
is your heart racing?</i>

460
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,954
<i>Ferocious?
Like it's gonna break your ribs?</i>

461
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:25,327
Yes.

462
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,996
<i>And you're sweating?</i>

463
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:30,604
Uh... Uh-uh.

464
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:33,142
<i>You are shaking?</i>

465
00:48:33,174 --> 00:48:35,012
I'm trying to calm down.

466
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:42,594
<i>Yacov, tell me what it is
that you're seeing.</i>

467
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:46,835
I... um...

468
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,881
<i>You said that it's a person.</i>

469
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:56,154
It's shadows. Like someone
in... in the shadows.

470
00:48:56,187 --> 00:48:57,591
I've... I've... I don't...

471
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:59,293
<i>The person that you're seeing,</i>

472
00:48:59,328 --> 00:49:01,231
<i>this one
that's in the shadows...</i>

473
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:06,342
<i>..do you think that he's
really there, watching you?</i>

474
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,680
No, of course not.
I know he's not.

475
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,384
<i>Excellent. Excellent.
That's good.</i>

476
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,187
<i>Now, Yacov, I want you to...</i>

477
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,762
<i>I want you to take your time
and think about this.</i>

478
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:21,606
<i>Can you describe this person?</i>

479
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:25,279
Blurry. It's...

480
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,051
It's always...

481
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:33,160
I... I don't... I don't...

482
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,065
It's blurry.

483
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:37,937
<i>I understand. That's fine.</i>

484
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:41,546
<i>Is his head turned backwards?
Can you tell me?</i>

485
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,615
What?

486
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,220
<i>Is his head turned around,
Yacov?</i>

487
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:57,944
<i>Yacov, what do you see?</i>

488
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,557
<i>Yacov, what do you see?</i>

489
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,596
Uh...

490
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,399
What? What?

491
00:50:09,768 --> 00:50:12,239
Dr Kohlberg, can you hold on
for one second, please?

492
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:21,425
Hello?

493
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:22,928
<i>Yacov, hi.
It's Dr Kohlberg.</i>

494
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,430
<i>Look, I just got your message</i>

495
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:27,404
<i>and I'm sorry it's taken me
a little bit to call you back.</i>

496
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:29,173
<i>I hope everything's alright.</i>

497
00:50:32,914 --> 00:50:34,585
<i>Yacov?</i>

498
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:39,729
Dr Kohlberg, can you hold on
for one second, please?

499
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,440
Hello?

500
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:47,176
<i>Yacov.</i>

501
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:49,982
Who is this?

502
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:53,689
<i>Yacov.</i>

503
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,029
I need you to leave me alone.

504
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:00,837
<i>Why did you let me die?</i>

505
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,086
Mrs Litvak.

506
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,025
Mrs Litvak?

507
00:51:12,058 --> 00:51:13,528
Mrs Litvak!

508
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:21,076
Do you want some tea?

509
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:32,700
It won't let you leave.

510
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:35,271
We have to go. Now.

511
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,523
I've left many times.

512
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,826
But where is there for me to go?

513
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,967
My obligation is to my home,
my Rubin.

514
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,406
I can suffer.

515
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,647
My pain was not his.

516
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,323
Mrs Litvak,
what won't let me leave?

517
00:52:02,526 --> 00:52:04,731
The Mazzik.

518
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,242
It's playing with you.

519
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:14,184
The way a cat
plays with a mouse.

520
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:21,031
It wants your pain.

521
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:23,803
And it will make you see things.

522
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:26,709
Terrible things.

523
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:30,114
Me, I am not enough for it.

524
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:34,425
But your agony...

525
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,850
We're leaving.

526
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:50,956
We have to go now.

527
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:55,734
There is something
very, very wrong here.

528
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:02,580
If you run out,

529
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:06,956
the Mazzik will make you
crawl right back.

530
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:16,841
Come on! Let's go!

531
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:20,015
You've already been
in this house too long.

532
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:22,619
I'm gonna call Reb Shulem, OK?

533
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:25,024
We're going to come back
and get you.

534
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:27,964
Just five minutes.
I'll be back.

535
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,247
Ohhh!

536
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:28,552
Ohh.

537
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:31,324
Oh!

538
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:40,477
Oh!

539
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:21,832
Hey, what the hell's
your problem?

540
00:57:21,865 --> 00:57:23,936
Just trying to ask you
a question.

541
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:26,072
Yo, yo, yo,
stop messing around.

542
00:57:26,106 --> 00:57:28,444
Relax.

543
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:31,149
Got a tough guy here,
the way he comes off.

544
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,186
Tough guy, hey.

545
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,964
Look at the little
Jew girl. Huh?

546
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:45,613
Relax, you little brat.
We're just messing around.

547
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:48,719
- Alright, alright, alright...
- Burech!

548
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:50,356
Burech!

549
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:08,110
Oh!

550
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:31,530
I let them hurt you...

551
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:40,664
I couldn't...

552
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:42,917
I couldn't move.

553
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:46,670
I couldn't move.

554
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:50,716
I let them hurt you...

555
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:06,815
Of course.

556
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:29,674
Ahhh.

557
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,718
<i>Hello.
You've reached Sarah Feldman.</i>

558
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:39,393
<i>I can't come to the phone.
Please leave...</i>

559
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:53,779
INCOMING FACETIME Sarah

560
01:00:55,392 --> 01:00:59,099
Um... I'm so sorry
to wake you up.

561
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:01,770
- I'm so sorry.
- <i>What time is it?</i>

562
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,879
4:30.

563
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:08,116
<i>Where are you, Yacov?</i>

564
01:01:08,149 --> 01:01:10,655
Sarah, I'm, uh...

565
01:01:14,763 --> 01:01:17,034
There's something evil
in this house.

566
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:18,638
It was...

567
01:01:18,671 --> 01:01:23,715
It was following Mr Litvak and
then it was feeding off of him.

568
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:25,719
<i>What?</i>

569
01:01:25,752 --> 01:01:27,255
I...

570
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:29,826
I think it wants me now.

571
01:01:31,195 --> 01:01:33,702
<i>Have you tried to leave?</i>

572
01:01:33,734 --> 01:01:37,207
Um... yeah, I... I...

573
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:38,845
<i>The house,
have you tried to leave?</i>

574
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:42,618
Yes. It won't let me.
It won't let me leave. I...

575
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,393
<i>You need to go upstairs, Yacov.</i>

576
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:52,739
What?

577
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:55,799
You need to go upstairs, Yacov.

578
01:01:56,675 --> 01:02:00,263
There is no point in fighting.

579
01:02:04,295 --> 01:02:07,335
Sarah?

580
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,731
You watched Burech scream.

581
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:13,859
- Don't s...
- Watched him cry for you.

582
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,611
And you didn't move.

583
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:19,177
You just let him die.

584
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,338
Sarah.

585
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:37,428
You just watched him die!

586
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:40,266
Sarah!

587
01:03:17,308 --> 01:03:19,613
Yacov.

588
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:28,898
Yacov.

589
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:33,608
Why did you let me die?

590
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,667
I know.

591
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:00,841
I was scared...

592
01:04:03,466 --> 01:04:05,136
I wasn't...

593
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:07,943
I wasn't strong for you, Burech.

594
01:04:07,975 --> 01:04:10,146
I was lost in my weakness.

595
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:15,648
Please forgive me.

596
01:04:16,224 --> 01:04:18,062
Please.

597
01:04:18,096 --> 01:04:20,101
I'm so sorry, Burech.

598
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:24,740
Please forgive me.

599
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:31,557
I've failed you. I...

600
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:33,916
I was...

601
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,460
I was...

602
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,422
I was scared.

603
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:34,749
Mrs Litvak.

604
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:38,624
Thank you for the bandage.

605
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:42,398
I didn't do it.

606
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,502
My Rubin did.

607
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:47,175
Mrs Litvak,
where is your husband now?

608
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:49,880
He's down the hall.

609
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,662
Wait a minute.

610
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:13,995
Here.

611
01:06:19,506 --> 01:06:21,209
It may help.

612
01:06:57,615 --> 01:07:00,053
In 1919,

613
01:07:00,086 --> 01:07:05,999
my grandfather saw his parents
murdered in Kiev.

614
01:07:07,768 --> 01:07:10,641
Neighbours smuggled him out.

615
01:07:14,749 --> 01:07:16,954
I loved my grandfather.

616
01:07:19,023 --> 01:07:20,227
I remember most

617
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:26,072
that he davened with tallis
and tefillin every day.

618
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,814
It is when he was truly...

619
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:35,090
..at ease with the world
and himself.

620
01:08:57,254 --> 01:08:59,692
If you find my Rubin...

621
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:58,162
Let him go.

622
01:15:58,963 --> 01:16:00,701
Let him go.

623
01:16:13,893 --> 01:16:15,763
Let him go.

624
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:18,603
Let him go!

625
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:24,382
Let him go!

626
01:16:27,753 --> 01:16:29,592
Let him go.

627
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,644
Are you ok?

628
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,439
My poor Rubin.

629
01:18:18,309 --> 01:18:21,147
I often wonder
what he would have become.

630
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,555
The father he would have been...

631
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:28,697
..had life happened differently.

632
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:43,726
Oh.

633
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,900
My dear.

634
01:18:50,973 --> 01:18:53,012
I miss you so.

635
01:19:04,434 --> 01:19:07,441
I'm gonna go out
into the sunlight now.

636
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,998
So did you have a good night?

637
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,959
Any problems? Anything come up?

638
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,421
Sure?

639
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:39,839
Of course.

640
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:44,844
Well, let me give you what I promised you.

641
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:46,888
Mrs. Litvak?

642
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:49,711
She went out for a morning walk.

643
01:20:52,683 --> 01:20:54,321
Hmm.

644
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:56,090
OK.

645
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:01,528
As I mentioned yesterday,
I truly hoped this

646
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:04,447
experience might give you a
new perspective on life.

647
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:07,575
I hoped we could talk about it.

648
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:10,412
Come with me to morning prayers.

649
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,914
