1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,666
Welcome...

3
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,957
Ladies and Gentlemen.

4
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,749
My name is Israel

5
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,624
and I'm here
to take you to a fantastic world

6
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,707
filled with bizarre
and mythological characters.

7
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,541
Returned from a successful tour
across Europe

8
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,999
meet extraordinary creatures

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,666
capable of memorable and stupefying feats!

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,499
Because only at the Half Penny Circus

11
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,749
does imagination become reality.

12
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,374
And nothing

13
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,666
is as it seems.

14
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,166
Mommy!

15
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,416
Herr Franz...

16
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,957
My Lord...

17
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,416
My Lord.

18
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,082
It's your turn.

19
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,249
They are waiting for you.

20
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,624
Half of Rome came to hear you play.

21
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,041
I was in the future.

22
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,374
You must stop it with the ether.

23
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,874
I will stop only after I've found them.

24
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,416
They have extraordinary powers.

25
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,791
It will be my gift to the Führer.

26
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Come.

27
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,750
Herr Franz...

28
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,999
Your trousers.

29
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,582
Irina, you do realize
it's the only hope of winning the war?

30
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,791
War has no winners, my Lord

31
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,582
only defeated.

32
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,332
Where are they hiding Irina?

33
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,499
Where are they hiding?

34
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,666
Rome!

35
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,374
- What the fuck are you saying?
- We don't say "fuck".

36
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,499
New York, America.

37
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,457
We're leaving.

38
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,707
- And us?
- You'll come with me.

39
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,874
Once we arrive in Sicily
we'll sell the cart and set sail.

40
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,291
What do you mean?
And the circus?

41
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,957
And the circus...

42
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,499
- I don't know.
- What the fuck are you saying?

43
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,332
All we'll need are travel papers

44
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,332
but with 300 liras apiece the Spizzichino
can make them better than the originals.

45
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,999
- 300 liras?
- Eh.

46
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,124
With 300 liras I can fuck
the best whores in Rome for a year.

47
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,874
I'll put them all in a row
and screw them.

48
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,791
In what world?

49
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,416
They'll be waiting for me
tomorrow morning in Via Caetani.

50
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,207
With 300 liras.

51
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,166
Just so I understand

52
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,457
once we arrive in America

53
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,124
without a circus

54
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,832
what are we going to do?
The freaks show?

55
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,707
I'm tired. How many years
can I go on doing this?

56
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,041
- The audience loves us.
- What audience, they're all dead!

57
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,707
Not even the tent is left.

58
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,499
But the war is ending.
Badoglio signed the armistice...

59
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,874
- And the worst is still to come!
- The king declared...

60
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:10,457
Who "King Little"? He's a coward.
He fled like a rabbit.

61
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,707
That's exactly what
you're asking us to do.

62
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,207
Since when are we responsible for
an entire country?

63
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,499
What are you talking about?

64
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,707
So let's join the German circus

65
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,753
they have a full house every night.
They say this Franz guy is incredible.

66
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,624
Yeah, the six fingered Nazi.
He's a crazy drug addict.

67
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,832
And what am I going to do at
a German circus?

68
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,916
A Jew at the German circus.

69
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,832
- Are you joking?
- What am I supposed to do?

70
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,916
Have you seen me?
Where do I go?

71
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,249
In America they wouldn't even
let me wash dishes.

72
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,832
You could be a sheep dog.
You'd be rich!

73
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,832
Shut up you filthy freak, you're so dirty
they wouldn't let you off the boat.

74
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,249
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Mamma mia you're ugly.

75
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,041
And you're Greta Garbo.

76
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,916
It's easy for you

77
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,416
because you're normal.

78
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,791
And you too.

79
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,624
What are you talking about?
I can't even touch you guys.

80
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,957
But for us it's different

81
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,915
without the circus we're finished.

82
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,332
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is goddammit!

83
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,832
Without the circus we're only
a pack of freaks!

84
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,999
Calm down Fu.

85
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,082
I'll wash your dishes in New York.

86
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,416
Good evening Rome

87
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,291
welcome to Zirkus Berlin.

88
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,042
Matilde!

89
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,249
Matilde, what's wrong?

90
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,832
It's nothing, it's nothing.

91
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,999
I've told you a thousand times
not to touch me.

92
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,124
You didn't hurt me.

93
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,082
- It's dangerous.
- I didn't get hurt.

94
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,832
Don't touch me!

95
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,249
Come here!

96
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,458
Matilde!

97
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,041
I didn't get hurt,
come here.

98
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,499
You didn't hurt me.

99
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,957
Understand?

100
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,457
You are a special girl,
you should be proud.

101
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,374
"Special" at what?

102
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,374
At turning on light bulbs?

103
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,832
You have a gift.

104
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,582
Well I don't want it.

105
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,791
I hate it. I hate myself.

106
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,541
And on this Fulvio is wrong
because I'm the only real freak.

107
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,582
I don't want to hear that anymore.
That's enough.

108
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,416
You just have to make peace
with the past.

109
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,874
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

110
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,374
Anyway I know how things will
end up once we get to America.

111
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,624
- How will it end?
- Everyone will go his own way.

112
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,582
And how will I do without you?

113
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,332
I won't let you go.

114
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:22,499
You all are the best misadventure
that's ever happened to me.

115
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,791
So we won't split up?

116
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,874
No one will tear us apart.
Not even the war.

117
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,082
Now let's go inside
because my ass is frozen.

118
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
Let's go.

119
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,166
- Aren't you tired?
- No, we're hungry.

120
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,166
So we'd better fuck off
and get some sleep.

121
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,333
America.

122
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,291
America.

123
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,874
America.

124
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Here.

125
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,416
Once we arrive

126
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,707
we're putting the circus back on its feet.

127
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,791
See you tonight.

128
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,624
Be careful.

129
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,541
Shalom.

130
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,249
Fulvio! There's a pig,
I swear. Fulvio!

131
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,874
A pig!

132
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,041
There he is!

133
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,625
Damn it!

134
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,166
Little black pork

135
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,916
with flour

136
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,999
with beans
and sheep's ricotta.

137
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,791
Maybe he stopped to get provisions
from some peasant.

138
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:01,666
That caciotta cheese
that I like

139
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,374
with a quart
or half a liter when possible.

140
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,332
- What if he was arrested?
- "Arrested" my ass.

141
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,957
That piece of shit fooled us
and went to America on his own.

142
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,041
- I gave him 300 liras...
- And me no?

143
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,416
- I gave him 300 liras...
- What are you talking about?

144
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,832
That damned vile jew,

145
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,666
tricked us with his little smile.

146
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,499
You're talking about Israel here,
he promised me.

147
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,874
If you say so...

148
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,082
Say what'?
He's like a father to us.

149
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:33,999
- Now you're going and trusting fathers.
- My father always used to beat me.

150
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,291
Mine locked me in a cage for 10 years.

151
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,291
At least I had some books.

152
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,041
Mine left me in front of a church

153
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,124
under a beehive full of bees.

154
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,291
The stings!

155
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,874
I was one big boil.

156
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:51,041
And who saved you without
expecting anything in return?

157
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,249
Israel saved you

158
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,332
and if it weren't for him
who knows where we'd be now.

159
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,416
- But who knows where he is.
- With my 300 liras goddammit.

160
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,999
That's enough!
You'd think you're talking about a bandit.

161
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,541
Worse... worse.

162
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,082
Israel is a good person
and he cares about us.

163
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,582
That's the tragedy of war kid.

164
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,832
It takes the best men
and turns 'em into the worst.

165
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:19,291
And so let's take care it won't
happen to us.

166
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,666
Let's go look for him.

167
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:38,499
Okay, but if we don't find him
we're all going to Zirkus Berlin

168
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:39,792
to Franz.

169
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,082
He isn't the strongest

170
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,291
but this son of a bitch

171
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,166
is one of the four.

172
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,166
I'm telling you.

173
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,291
Do you see the gills?

174
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,166
He can breathe underwater.

175
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,999
I'm sure it's him.
He has super powers!

176
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,916
He's drowning.

177
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:24,541
That's impossible!

178
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,249
Yesterday he did it for 20 minutes.

179
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,124
Breathe!

180
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,124
Breathe!

181
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,374
Breathe.

182
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,582
Breathe.

183
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,541
Breathe, please.

184
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,207
Hello!

185
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,916
Breathe.

186
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,999
Breathe, hey!

187
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,791
Hey, breathe!

188
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,916
Hey, breathe!

189
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,332
Amon, hey, Amon.

190
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,707
I swear, he did it yesterday.

191
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,582
It's over.
Next week you return to Berlin.

192
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,207
Give me another month, please.
I'm almost there.

193
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,749
You've been looking for them
for three years

194
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,749
- and I can't cover your ass anymore.
- But this time it's different.

195
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:35,207
It's getting embarrassing.
The fort is needed to transfer soldiers.

196
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:37,999
What do you need it for
if you're going to lose the war.

197
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,582
I am our only hope.

198
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,166
They are our only hope.
We must get them on our side.

199
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,332
The ether has melted your brain.

200
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,874
Germany will be razed to the ground.

201
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,541
There will be a trial in Nuremberg,
you'll be condemned to die.

202
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,541
I see the future, Amon!

203
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:56,082
Me too. And I'm telling you that
yours is 1500 kilometers from here.

204
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,624
You're going home Franz.

205
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,999
I've already arranged a series
of concerts for you.

206
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,499
Fuck the music.

207
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,124
I want to be on the front lines with you.

208
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,666
Take care of yourself my brother.

209
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:12,374
- Hitler will kill himself.
- You've gone crazy, lower your voice.

210
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,874
He will shoot himself in the head.

211
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,957
Goodbye Franz.

212
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,332
- Do it for our mother.
- Stop that!

213
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,499
Amon.

214
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,166
Please, you can't do this to me.

215
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,749
Please, Amon.

216
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,916
Try to maintain a shred of dignity.

217
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,666
- You are a German!
- But you are my brother.

218
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,249
You can't do this to me.

219
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,082
You can't do this to me.

220
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:53,207
I'll give you exactly one week
until the big show.

221
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,749
After that, if you haven't found them

222
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,166
you'll close down your shanty
and puppet show and go away.

223
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,124
- Got it?
- Yes.

224
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,582
And play something new.

225
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:08,207
Kesselring is all over my ass about
wanting to come and hear you play.

226
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,292
Okay.

227
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,249
Man, look how run down it is.
It's falling apart.

228
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,458
Let's go!

229
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,707
- Shut up.
- What's that, a party?

230
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,957
Come on, get in.
Let's go.

231
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,332
You on the truck!
Come on!

232
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:05,707
Forward.

233
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,457
On the truck, let's go!

234
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,499
Come on!

235
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,082
- Leave them alone!
- What are you doing?

236
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,582
What's going on?

237
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,166
They're combing the area.

238
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,416
- What do you mean?
- They're taking the Jews away.

239
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,999
All in a single line.
Come on, come on, come on!

240
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,333
Are you ready?

241
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Hey!

242
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,999
- Can we load them up?
- Yes, everything's ready!

243
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,041
Come on, come on!
On the truck!

244
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Hey!

245
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,457
Shit.

246
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,457
Another bullet wasted.

247
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,082
Move! Go, go!

248
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,166
Let's get out of here, come on, go!

249
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,791
Halt! Halt!

250
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,291
Anna!

251
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:19,916
Anna!

252
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,207
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

253
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,707
We're street artists.

254
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,457
- Buskers?
- Yes.

255
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,082
You look like a fleabag to me!

256
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,082
- Have you seen anything like it?
- Look at him!

257
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,082
- What are you laughing at?
- Shut up!

258
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,999
They laugh because he looks like a dog.

259
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,582
- It's crazy, look at it!
- Do you see it?

260
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,374
Please, let us go.

261
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,499
No, no, no, little doggie!

262
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,791
Look at him.

263
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,249
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

264
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,041
Halt!
Or I shoot you.

265
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,405
- I shoot you!
- Did it hurt you?

266
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,999
Did it hurt you?

267
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,457
- Now get in the truck.
- Asshole!

268
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,707
I said move!

269
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,791
- On the truck, fast!
- I said move, walk!

270
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,416
- Go, Fulvio.
- I said move!

271
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,749
- Go, Fulvio.
- Go, move along!

272
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,332
Hurry up, get in line.

273
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,957
- Halt!
- Get in line or I'll shoot.

274
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,791
Cencio! Fulvio!

275
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,332
- It's mine...
- Come on!

276
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,707
He's my son, she is the nanny...

277
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,666
- What happened?
- He's my son.

278
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,166
- What?
- He's my son.

279
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,374
- What?
- I'm not Jewish!

280
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,041
She isn't Jewish and this
is her son, she says...

281
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,416
Give her the baby, come on!

282
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,541
Give her the baby, come on!

283
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,249
Thank you. Thank you.

284
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:40,124
Why is it taking so long?
Come on, I told you to go!

285
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,166
- Come on, up.
- Come on.

286
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,791
- Line up! Walk!
- Walk! Walk!

287
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,624
- Hurry up!
- Move, get in line.

288
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,166
Fulvio!

289
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,916
Have you ever seen such a thing?

290
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,207
- So what?
- Little dog!

291
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,916
- So?
- Sit!

292
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,541
- What about this one?
- Move, get in!

293
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,667
Everyone in!

294
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,457
Move! Get in!

295
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,791
Out of the way!
Go there!

296
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,541
Go away! Go! Disappear.

297
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:23,332
Shut up, we won't touch you.
Why the fuck are you yelling?

298
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,291
Don't worry.
Fulvio, break his fucking face.

299
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Are you hurt?

300
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,874
I guess he's not well, eh?

301
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,624
I killed him.

302
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,499
I told you not to touch me.

303
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,957
Look at what you've done.

304
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,582
Everyone out, come on!

305
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,416
- Get down! Quick!
- They are getting away!

306
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,124
Halt! Halt!

307
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,624
Give it here.

308
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:30,791
Fulvio!

309
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:31,916
Cencio!

310
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,832
Matilde! Matilde...

311
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:35,457
Shock! Shock!

312
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,707
- Hello!
- Hello.

313
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:38,999
How are you?

314
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:46,041
- I don't talk to rabbits.
- What could I do?

315
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,291
You could've electrocuted
them all for starters.

316
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,374
Donkey head, they're people
not insects.

317
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,541
But when they fry
they make the same smell.

318
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,041
- How is it you do?
- You're disgusting.

319
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,332
- Coward.
- Brute!

320
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,582
That's enough damn it!

321
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,457
Enough my ass!
Al least I distracted them with flies.

322
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,666
You didn't do anything!

323
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,332
- Again with this?
- Yeah, why? It's not okay by you?

324
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,791
- Come off.
- You come off "mudlark."

325
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,332
Mudlark?
Who you calling mudlark?

326
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,874
You're a rag man okay?
A rag man!

327
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,332
Get off.
You're hurting me.

328
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:15,999
Give me a kiss and I'll move.

329
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,291
Don't run off, just one.

330
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,041
I'd rather kiss a dead rat
than a filthy freak like you.

331
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,874
You don't just have rubber gloves
you have a rubber heart, do you?

332
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,874
No. The normal kind.

333
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,499
- So stay away.
- Watch out, you'll hurt yourself.

334
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,499
Nothing hurts me Fu.

335
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,583
Don't you dare...

336
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,791
What a spark!

337
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:37,124
- I told you.
- You suck at kissing.

338
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,408
- Don't you dare ever again.
- You're the one who dared.

339
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,707
What did I dare?

340
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,791
I've had enough!

341
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,374
Maybe we'll see each other,
maybe we won't.

342
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,166
Bye!

343
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,832
- Fu!
- Fulvio!

344
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,499
- Where are we going Fu?
- To Tiburtino Fort.

345
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,749
- Where?
- To Zirkus Berlin. To Franz.

346
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,541
- And Israel?
- Fuck Israel!

347
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,041
I have to get back on track.

348
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,791
What if the Germans arrested him?

349
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:06,957
- Again with this whinging.
- Please, let's look till tomorrow.

350
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,582
No, I've got things to do.

351
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:09,541
What?

352
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,707
You only think about yourself.

353
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,582
It's you who only thinks
about herself

354
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,332
you who can't get by without Israel.

355
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,541
And you, who immediately has to find
himself another master?

356
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,166
I have only one master:
People who buy tickets to see me.

357
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,916
Ok, but if we separate
what do we do alone?

358
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,249
In fact, come with me!

359
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:30,749
- But let's be clear: We do what I say.
- Ah puppy,

360
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,166
lower your fur,
you're not ordering anyone around.

361
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,333
So don't come.

362
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,082
In fact, who's going!

363
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,207
I'm volunteering to defend the homeland.

364
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,041
Right, we'd be better off
surrendering immediately.

365
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,416
Take care.

366
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,792
Go, go.

367
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,791
Who needs you!

368
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,082
He can't...
Fulvio wait!

369
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,458
Come on!

370
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,125
Let's go?

371
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,332
Come on it's getting dark.

372
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,166
I'm not coming.

373
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,124
Matilde...

374
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,916
Matilde...

375
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,582
Come on, me with Matilde...

376
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,457
Come on, Mario...
It's dangerous for us to be outside.

377
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,624
Matilde with Mario.

378
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,249
Mario with Matilde.

379
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,791
Matilde...

380
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:36,541
Israel was right about one thing...
make good use of your powers.

381
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,833
And you?

382
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,249
So you can see the way girlie.

383
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,916
Shalom.

384
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,666
Please! Please!

385
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,333
Italy...

386
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,999
Shithole country
full of Italian shitheads.

387
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,041
But the wine isn't bad.

388
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,416
And the whores are even better.

389
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,582
Ahhh look at this.

390
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,791
Who do we have here?

391
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,999
Don't you know there's a curfew?

392
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,291
Answer!

393
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,457
Where are you going?

394
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:36,833
Hey!

395
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,999
What's your name?

396
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,832
Can't you hear us?

397
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,457
What's your name?

398
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,207
- How old is she you think?
- I don't know.

399
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,832
Fourteen or fifteen.

400
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,291
Do you think she's still a virgin?

401
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,999
I'll tell you right away.

402
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:06,332
We'll just play a little bit.

403
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,749
- Don't worry...
- No, no, don't touch me.

404
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,082
We'll just play a little bit, okay?

405
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,457
- Please don't touch me.
- My little sweet Italian.

406
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:41,667
Moritz!

407
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,291
Is she dead?

408
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:18,958
Dunno.

409
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,541
- If she stays here she'll surely die.
- No, you think? What a genius!

410
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,957
Pick her up.

411
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,166
- What's wrong?
- Damn it to hell, she's electric.

412
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,749
What? Electric?

413
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,749
Your head is electric!

414
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,333
Electric...

415
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,999
- Pick her up.
- We can leave her here...

416
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,999
And leave a little girl
alone in the woods? Come on.

417
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,999
What are you laughing about?

418
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,332
What the fuck are you laughing at idiot?

419
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,582
Osvaldo!

420
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,749
Pick her up.

421
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,583
Come on!

422
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Heil!

423
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:17,624
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Zirkus Berlin.

424
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,041
What'd I tell you?

425
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:21,365
Is it or is it not the most
beautiful place in the world?

426
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:23,457
It's beautiful, Fulvio.
You like it?

427
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:29,666
Let me do the talking.

428
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,124
Please...

429
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,457
We're looking for work...
we're artists.

430
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,291
- Thanks.
- I'm Mario.

431
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,916
Lions! Lions!

432
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,124
Look! How beautiful.

433
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,957
- Hello.
- Look!

434
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,541
Look!

435
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,582
I fought a hippopotamus one time.

436
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,957
I pulled his tail
and kicked him in the balls.

437
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,999
- Of course!
- A camel!

438
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,541
I touched his hump!

439
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,291
Hello.

440
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,957
Look at her! How talented.
Hi dancers!

441
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,499
Come on, let's go in!

442
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,916
Oh wow!

443
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,207
There he is.
That's Franz.

444
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,874
Look at that stage.

445
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,916
- But what's this music?
- It's beautiful.

446
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,624
Beautiful my ass.

447
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,957
- It's beautiful.
- No, Mario, it's shit.

448
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,666
I've heard beautiful music,
this is garbage.

449
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,499
He wrote it.

450
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,707
Wow, what a hottie!

451
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,957
Beautiful!

452
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,457
It's sublime.

453
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,374
A light. Please.

454
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,249
Et voilà.

455
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,916
Your fur is wonderful.

456
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,541
Don't be ashamed of it.

457
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,957
You kidding?

458
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,041
I never joke about fur.

459
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:46,249
- Me neither.
- Will you shut up?

460
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,166
You're such an asshole!

461
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:56,624
What did I say?

462
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,207
- Are you the new ones?
- Yes.

463
00:48:58,417 --> 00:48:59,957
Come with me.

464
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:04,499
I told you! Back on track!
You should always listen to me.

465
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,749
- Always!
- We're gonna make so much money.

466
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,749
Wow...

467
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And these?

468
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,791
Were you born with them?

469
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,166
I'm good, eh.

470
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:50,082
Nice to meet you, I'm Cencio

471
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,916
I work with all the insects
of the world except bees

472
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,374
which piss me off.

473
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You.

474
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,375
You.

475
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,583
And you.

476
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,499
- You 3, come with me.
- Fulvio...

477
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,583
Let's go.

478
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,916
- I'm with them.
- The others with me, this way.

479
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,624
- Let's go.
- Fulvio!

480
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,832
Fulvio!
They're my friends.

481
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,249
- Come on.
- Where are you going Fulvio!

482
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,166
- Come here.
- I'm with them...

483
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,791
- Come here.
- Fulvio!

484
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Thanks.

485
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,208
Thanks.

486
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,625
Thanks.

487
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,582
I could've washed myself on my own.

488
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,749
You know how many tits
like yours I've seen?

489
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,457
They're like two camel humps, right?

490
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,750
Is that milk?

491
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,999
Shall we bathe together?

492
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,666
Come take a bath with me?

493
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:14,666
Please, let me touch them.
Please.

494
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,124
Damn you sweet tits.

495
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,166
Fulvio!

496
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,416
Fulvio!

497
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:25,458
Mario!

498
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,291
Hi Cencio.

499
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,499
You, come, come.

500
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,499
Who are you? Where are we?

501
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,791
You're with the Crippled Devils.

502
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,332
- Who?
- You're safe.

503
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,374
It's a pleasure, Hunchback.

504
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,749
Matilde.

505
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,582
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, like a wolf.

506
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,457
Didn't you hear?
Goddammed good for nuthin.

507
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,207
Our guest is hungry.
Go get some rations!

508
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:58,124
You haven't resolved a damned thing!
Get outta here, mongoloid!

509
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,874
You pissant.

510
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,332
Excuse him...
They're a bit rough.

511
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,291
- What happened to me?
- You fainted.

512
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:12,249
What's a young girl doing
wandering around Rome alone?

513
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:13,791
I'm looking for someone.

514
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,333
Who?

515
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,707
- His name's Israel.
- Your dad?

516
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:18,707
Yes.

517
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:20,041
No... more or less.

518
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,291
The food's arrived, eat.

519
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,707
Have a seat.

520
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:27,832
Go away, get, clear out.

521
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,291
Eat.

522
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,957
She's hungry, eh?

523
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:39,249
Listen, girl...
not to mind your business

524
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,874
but to straighten out mine...

525
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,791
How the fuck d'ya do it?

526
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,541
- Do what?
- The shock, the lightning.

527
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:48,916
The shock?

528
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,207
When we found you,
you almost shocked us.

529
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:55,666
- Why, did anyone get hurt?
- Bumleg almost bought the farm.

530
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:58,207
- But no, he's fine now.
- I'm fine.

531
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,666
Don't worry, he's always
been a little messed up.

532
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,374
If I were electric!

533
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:07,457
You know how many Nazis
I'd have killed? Tons.

534
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,124
I don't kill anyone.

535
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:14,791
You know how many I annihilated myself
since the beginning of the war? 35!

536
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:18,832
24 Nazis
and 11 fascists.

537
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,916
One just yesterday, right Osva?

538
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:24,582
A shot in the forehead and boom.
He fell just like a wild pig.

539
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:28,707
Girlie why don't you join us?

540
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:32,291
I'll make you into a guerrilla.
You know how much fun we'd have?

541
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,999
Killing people?

542
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,166
War is war.

543
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:44,957
That's enough, you'll frighten her.
Don't you see she's just a girl.

544
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,041
Listen...
Israel, right?

545
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,124
Yes.

546
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,916
You'll find him, you'll see.
Don't worry.

547
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:57,166
When Germans catch Jews,
where do they take them?

548
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:01,082
They put them on trains
and deport them to Germany.

549
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,499
What if all goes well?

550
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,916
- They kill them.
- Stop it.

551
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,541
Don't listen to him, the polio
virus melted his brain.

552
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:09,832
The polio my ass!

553
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,916
I'll bring you a little bread.

554
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,874
Listen, this electricity you've got,
can you shoot it far? How far can it go?

555
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,832
- With this again?
- Let me see.

556
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,166
There's nothing to see.

557
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:23,332
If you show me, I swear I'll
help you find your friend.

558
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,624
- Really?
- My word as a hunchback.

559
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,332
Come on, shoot.

560
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:31,249
No.

561
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:34,624
You really are thick headed. You're crude,
smelly, but fucking hell!

562
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,707
- And you're an arrogant jackass.
- And you're special.

563
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,332
You have a gift.

564
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,291
It isn't a gift.

565
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,624
It's a curse.

566
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,749
Come on, you afraid of killin' somebody?

567
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:52,749
The first kills hurt, I know, but you
get used to it and the guilt disappears.

568
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:57,082
But I know how to expiate your sins.

569
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,332
- How?
- On the battlefield with us.

570
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:04,624
- I'm just a circus performer.
- And I'm just a poor hunchback.

571
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:31,291
...A pocket full of posies,

572
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:35,499
Ashes, ashes.

573
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,666
We all fall down.

574
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,249
What the fuck is this?

575
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:46,874
Ring a round the rosie,
A pocket full of posies,

576
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,999
Ashes, ashes.

577
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,249
We all fall down.

578
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:56,666
- Bastards!
- Fulvio!

579
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,166
Let me out of this cage.

580
01:00:58,542 --> 01:00:59,957
Oh, bastards!

581
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:02,041
You miserable fucks.

582
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,749
Where are you?
Bald bastard!

583
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,624
Come here. Oh!

584
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,457
Baldy!

585
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,749
Come here.
Baldy.

586
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:16,374
Oh! Come on...

587
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,124
Oh! Let me out of here.

588
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,457
I swear I won't hurt you.

589
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:26,457
What the fuck you laughing at?
I'll kill you.

590
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:29,999
Laugh, laugh at this you fuck.
I'll kill you, you fucking Nazi.

591
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:34,916
- I'll kill you, I'll kill all of you!
- Bye!

592
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,666
Mommy!

593
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,749
Let me outta this cage!

594
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,249
Let me outta this cage!
Bastards!

595
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:59,582
They are special, but not exceptional.

596
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,124
I'll kill all of you!
Bastards!

597
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:18,207
With this ugly situation with the jews

598
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:21,666
there's a coming and going of Krauts
that's a beauty to behold!

599
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,791
You like fireworks?

600
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:33,041
- Yes.
- Cause tomorrow the boom'll be so loud

601
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,791
even that psycho asshole
Hitler's gonna hear it.

602
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,457
- What boom?
- A boom.

603
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,624
Imagine a boom.

604
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,416
Now ten times bigger.

605
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,082
And all the Jews?

606
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:49,999
Give me the binoculars.

607
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,082
What's happening?
Let me see.

608
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,666
Angle it.
Otherwise they'll see the reflection.

609
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,624
What do you see?

610
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,124
Oh, where are you going?

611
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,499
Stop, oh.
Wait, Matilde!

612
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,499
She's crazy.

613
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:29,082
- Where the fuck's she goin'?
- She's after her father.

614
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,167
Look at this.

615
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,499
- Israel!
- Matilde.

616
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,041
What are you doing here?

617
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,249
- I knew you hadn't abandoned us.
- Go away.

618
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:49,124
- I told Fulvio, he wouldn't believe me.
- Go away, they'll kill you.

619
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,207
- I'm getting in.
- No! Don't get in, no!

620
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:53,957
Look at that.

621
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,374
She's really stupid.

622
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:56,832
Where are they taking you?

623
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,499
- To Tiburtina station.
- Go Away. Don't worry about me.

624
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:00,624
Go back to them.

625
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,374
- Go to them.
- They are going to Zirkus Berlin.

626
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:06,624
Stop them. Franz is crazy.
He's a killer.

627
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,124
Honk the horn! Come on!

628
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,957
Get down.
Don't get in, no!

629
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,457
No!

630
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:14,667
Matilde!

631
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,499
God damn...

632
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,291
Cesira! Cesira!

633
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:26,707
Where the fuck's she going? Why
does no one do what I say goddammit.

634
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:28,374
Stop.

635
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,249
What are you doing you little whore?
What are you doing here?

636
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,082
I just wanted to go with them.

637
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,874
- What happened?
- She tried to climb on the truck.

638
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,166
She tried to give him something.

639
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,874
- What did you give him?
- Calm down.

640
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,832
I'm Jewish! I'm Jewish!

641
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:47,749
- Take me away, I want to go with him.
- Her hat fell off.

642
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:53,082
- What did you give him?
- Jewish. Jewish. Jewish.

643
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:55,416
Stay calm, she's just a girl.
No!

644
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,082
Nazis!

645
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,416
Nazis?

646
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,249
Who's she?

647
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,332
What's going on here?

648
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:17,957
Nazis...

649
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,791
My my how bad you are.

650
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,417
So?

651
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:27,624
- Shall we play war?
- What?

652
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,332
I don't understand you.

653
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:33,582
- What did you say?
- I don't know... Hold this a second.

654
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,582
Come on!

655
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,832
Fuck.

656
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:53,374
Die, you son of a bitch!

657
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,999
No! No! Israel!

658
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:12,542
No!

659
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,249
Israel! No!

660
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,625
No!

661
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,207
Fuck.

662
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,832
- Take this. Eat.
- Thank you.

663
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:23,916
Drop that bone. Like hell
you'll eat our rations.

664
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,291
You ruined my attack
and my jacket too. Fuck you, fuck you!

665
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:32,207
- I just wanted to go with Israel.
- You could've saved him you whiner.

666
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,332
Why didn't you zap all them Nazis?

667
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,999
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- Well then, fuck you!

668
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,207
Get out.

669
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:40,916
You're no use
to the war effort. Get out!

670
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,499
Don't meddle.

671
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,374
Come here.

672
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,124
- You're hurting me.
- I'm hurting you?

673
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,291
So then react. Come on.
Shock me.

674
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:54,541
Defend yourself.
Defend yourself.

675
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:55,999
Defend yourself. Shock me.

676
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,166
- Show some grit.
- No.

677
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,957
- Why?
- Why not.

678
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,999
- Why?
- You're hurting me.

679
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:05,124
- Chickenshit, are you scared?
- You're hurting me, stop!

680
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:07,666
- React then. Stop me, shock me.
- Please stop.

681
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,666
- Let me see.
- No.

682
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,707
Why? Answer me!
Come on, talk.

683
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,082
Tell me why!

684
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,249
Why?

685
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,374
Because I killed my mother.

686
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:24,207
I killed my mother.

687
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,707
I didn't do it on purpose.

688
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:56,999
I didn't do it on purpose.
I didn't do it on purpose.

689
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,624
Clean her up
and take her to One-Eye.

690
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:41,374
Light!

691
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,624
He's One-Eye.

692
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:58,999
- Hello.
- Go away.

693
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,374
Raus.

694
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,832
Don't worry.

695
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,457
Bring him something to eat.

696
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Go.

697
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:22,041
You know the Zirkus Berlin, don't you?

698
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,582
Never heard of it.
I don't know anything. Leave me alone.

699
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,457
And Franz?

700
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,541
Who the fuck is Franz?

701
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,249
Franz is the pianist.

702
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:37,957
The pianist... The pianist...

703
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:40,167
Oh yes.

704
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:41,625
Franz...

705
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:44,041
Thanks.

706
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,457
Everyone knew him in Berlin.

707
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:51,749
They would've listened to him
play for days at a time.

708
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:55,457
Poor bastard.
He just wanted to be a soldier

709
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,124
like his father and his brother.

710
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:01,124
Instead he became a freak show.

711
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:04,124
I'm a freak show too,
what's wrong with that?

712
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:08,332
Yes, but you don't have 6 fingers.
Franz has 6 fingers

713
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,707
and he wanted to fight
for his country.

714
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:23,749
- And...
- And they wouldn't let him do shit.

715
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,457
I was there...

716
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,624
at the military medical exam.

717
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:32,082
The doctors laughed
when they saw his hands

718
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,416
I still remember it.

719
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:36,999
Since that day, god knows why,

720
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,749
he's been convinced that freaks
of nature like him exist

721
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:42,416
with special powers.

722
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,291
When they don't meet his expectations

723
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:47,374
he kills them.

724
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:49,916
It's his gift to Hitler:

725
01:11:50,417 --> 01:11:53,249
A small squad of super men
with him in command.

726
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,416
Can you imagine?

727
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,124
Not me. I can't imagine it.

728
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:00,999
My friends are with him.

729
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,167
With who?

730
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:07,207
- With Franz.
- What do you want from me?

731
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,499
UNKNOWN

732
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,541
ANSWER

733
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,832
A dark shadow has fallen
on the movement...

734
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,999
...To give the German people a new idea.

735
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,999
Welcome to Zirkus Berlin.

736
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:21,708
Fire!

737
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:30,393
No, my Führer!

738
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:31,666
No, my Führer!

739
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,916
Excuse me.

740
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:33,791
Who are you?

741
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:37,541
- Nice to meet you, I'm Matilde.
- Really? You look like Dorothy.

742
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:40,291
- Are you searching for the Wizard of Oz?
- Who?

743
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,082
This is for Franz.
Give it to him immediately.

744
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,791
- All right here?
- Yes.

745
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,332
Anything suspicious?

746
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:48,499
Who's she?

747
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:51,916
...Cencio's an albino, filthy,
he always whines, unmistakable.

748
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:54,874
- Have you seen him?
- Halt! Hey, you!

749
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,268
Who let you in?
Come here.

750
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:56,999
Who let you in?
Come here.

751
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,041
No, I haven't see them, sorry.
Bye!

752
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,291
You can't come in.
It's forbidden, understand?

753
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:06,457
Come. Come here. Come here.
You, get out of the way!

754
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,124
Halt! Halt!

755
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,124
Get out of here. Go away!

756
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:25,499
Halt!

757
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,207
Where are you?

758
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,374
Damnit!

759
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,416
Welcome to Zirkus Berlin.

760
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:11,166
Ring a round the rosie,

761
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:15,499
A pocket full of posies,

762
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,582
Ashes, ashes,

763
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:23,707
We all fall down.

764
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:40,416
You're givin' me a headache.

765
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,249
Ring around the rosie.

766
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,124
Feels round and cozy.

767
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:47,957
Just like a donut...

768
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,374
Mario! What the fuck are you doing?

769
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:53,457
You filthy bastard. You're sick!

770
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,457
- What are you doing?
- Shut up a moment...

771
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:57,625
What is it?

772
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
No, nothing.

773
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:04,541
What do you mean nothing?

774
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,791
What do you mean... Mario stop!

775
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:10,707
I'll chop off that eggplant of yours,
don't you dare...

776
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,416
What the fuck is it?

777
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,666
Matilde!

778
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:20,582
They've killed her!

779
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,749
These bastards've killed her.

780
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,625
Matilde!

781
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:29,499
How is Matilde?

782
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,666
Why...

783
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:36,917
Damn you.

784
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:39,541
- Bastard!
- Damned bastard.

785
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:43,499
What do you want from us?
What do you want?

786
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,999
Finally home.

787
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:48,166
My fantastic 4!

788
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,666
The time has come...

789
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:56,499
to put out the lights
and illuminate your dreams.

790
01:23:57,917 --> 01:23:59,207
You murderer.

791
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:02,916
- No.
- Murderer!

792
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,624
Nooo...

793
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,457
Smile!

794
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,916
- Go, go.
- Forward, forward.

795
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,833
Come on.

796
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,332
Move it.

797
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,457
The luggage remains here.

798
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:53,875
Keep calm.

799
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:56,666
Push.

800
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:00,124
Come on! Come on!

801
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:10,332
Get in line, damnit.

802
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,624
Have a safe journey.

803
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:16,416
Go!

804
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,957
Heil Hitler!

805
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:02,874
Field Marshal.
It's an honor to welcome you.

806
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:05,499
- Good evening.
- If you'll follow me please.

807
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,624
I'm positive the show will be
to your liking.

808
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:17,957
Heil!

809
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,582
This time we go home Irina

810
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,957
but as winners.

811
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:58,375
Heil!

812
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:01,749
When we return to Germany,

813
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,041
I'm going to marry you.

814
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,249
Don't tell me you've seen
our future?

815
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:14,374
The future starts now Irina.

816
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,082
Right now!

817
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:53,999
Heil Hitler.

818
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:55,582
Heil Hitler.

819
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:05,832
Ladies and gentlemen,

820
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:09,124
tonight you won't hear me play.

821
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,916
Tonight I submit something to you
much more important than music.

822
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:17,957
Something that will allow us
to win the war.

823
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,082
I see the future

824
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:25,124
and what I see
is not reassuring for us

825
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:28,207
or for Germany,

826
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,707
but the strength of our dreams

827
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:36,957
can change the future
and I have many dreams.

828
01:28:38,292 --> 01:28:41,582
Many of you didn't believe me.

829
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,416
Starting with my brother.

830
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:51,041
Amen, you've tolerated me here only
so as not to displease our mother.

831
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:53,791
But you were wrong.

832
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,666
You all were wrong.

833
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,416
The future of tomorrow
will not be that of today

834
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:07,124
thanks to me and me alone
because it is I who found them!

835
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:12,666
Three men and a girl

836
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:16,249
will bring the Third Reich
into the future.

837
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,082
He'll play, I assure you.

838
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:40,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

839
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,541
it is with great pleasure
that I present to you...

840
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:59,332
The Wolf Man, the Human Magnet,
Insect Boy...

841
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:01,458
and...

842
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:05,791
The Electric Girl!

843
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,374
She's alive. She's alive!

844
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:10,332
- Matilde!
- Matilde!

845
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,041
Fulvio!
Cencio! Mario!

846
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:14,916
I found him!

847
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:18,416
I found Israel!
I know where Israel is. Fulvio!

848
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:20,666
- Really? Where is he?
- Matilde.

849
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:22,667
Mario...

850
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:24,999
- Cencio.
- ...She found Israel.

851
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:28,082
Whether you believe it or not

852
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,207
this little girl and these three vagrants

853
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,374
are our only salvation.

854
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:05,041
Shock it.
Show everyone what you're capable of.

855
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:09,457
Show them I'm right.
That it's all true.

856
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:16,207
The gloves. Take off your gloves.

857
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,749
Matilde!

858
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,999
- Get those fucking gloves off!
- Matilde zap that tiger.

859
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,332
- Zap the tiger!
- Take off your gloves.

860
01:31:28,542 --> 01:31:36,542
Matilde!

861
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,916
Hey! Shock it.

862
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:39,249
I said shock it.
Show off your super powers.

863
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:42,874
Show them to me!

864
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:46,875
No!

865
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,332
No! Mario!

866
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:49,832
Do as I say

867
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:53,041
or I swear to god I'll shoot
this asshole in the head.

868
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,291
No, please.

869
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:55,791
And then the others.

870
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:58,374
- Mr. Franz, please, no! I beg you.
- One...

871
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:04,582
Shoot me if you're a man.
Shoot me you nazi shit.

872
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:06,249
- Two...
- ...No really?

873
01:33:06,417 --> 01:33:10,582
- Are you going to shoot me?
- Shoot me. Oh! Coward.

874
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:11,833
Coward!

875
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:14,749
Shoot me, you fucking bastard,
I'll kill you.

876
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:17,916
- I can't.
- I'll kill all of you, fucking Nazis!

877
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,541
- Three.
- Bastard, shoot!

878
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:39,916
You're standing in piss you ugly shit.

879
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:11,082
- Matilde.
- Matilde.

880
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,541
You're so beautiful.

881
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:21,249
What do we do with the four?

882
01:34:24,417 --> 01:34:25,832
Burn them!

883
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,042
Yes sir.

884
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:37,749
What do you want from us?

885
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:45,249
What do you want from us?

886
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,500
Why?

887
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:50,125
Why?

888
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,666
Bloody hell!

889
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:04,291
Screw you!

890
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:35,749
They're gonna burn us alive.

891
01:35:36,917 --> 01:35:38,791
Open up, let us out!

892
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,791
Please let us out.

893
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,499
Son of a bitch, open the door.

894
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:45,666
Piece of shit, open the door.
Do something Fulvio.

895
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:48,874
It's my fault... it's all my fault.

896
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:52,166
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

897
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:55,749
- You stuck on repeat? Do something!
- Spit in my face.

898
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,957
What the fuck are you saying?
Knock the door down!

899
01:35:59,042 --> 01:36:01,957
Aren't you the Wolf Man? Smash
the door down with a punch.

900
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:05,416
- Give this Nazi shit door a punch!
- Move Mati.

901
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:10,041
Ugly son of a bitch,
piece of shit, open the door!

902
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:12,666
Cencio can't die in here.

903
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,082
Cencio the Great can't die this way.

904
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:19,916
- I'll do it.
- I don't wanna burn to death!

905
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,874
Come on!

906
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,707
It won't open.

907
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,207
Do something Fulvio.

908
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:50,207
Franz.

909
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,083
Franz.

910
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:30,416
Well, let's go, shall we?

911
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:34,082
- Let's go.
- Yes.

912
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,582
Go Mario.

913
01:39:50,042 --> 01:39:51,249
Oh my god.

914
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:53,666
It's all true!

915
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:58,374
I am "the Cassandra" of the Third Reich.

916
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,832
- Like hell I'm gettin' in there.
- Come on.

917
01:40:02,917 --> 01:40:06,916
- Trust me. You wanna get shot?
- Maybe it'll hurt less.

918
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,124
Hurry, we've got to get that train.

919
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:11,791
- Go, go get shot.
- Cencio, come on!

920
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:15,291
Can't you blow something up again
and we'll walk out nice and easy.

921
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:17,957
"Nice and easy", you think
I'm an anti-aircraft gun?

922
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:19,541
I don't know how it works.

923
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:21,416
If you're afraid, I'll go alone.

924
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,457
He's afraid.

925
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:26,666
- I'm not afraid.
- So come on.

926
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,499
You know how many cannons I've seen?

927
01:40:28,583 --> 01:40:30,416
- Then come on.
- We'll land down there.

928
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,541
- Just don't shock me.
- I really won't touch you.

929
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,083
- Hey Fu.
- Eh?

930
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,874
- Warn us before you shoot.
- Okay.

931
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:41,249
We need a countdown done well.
From 10 to 0, count all the numbers.

932
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:42,333
Yes.

933
01:40:53,792 --> 01:40:54,916
Come on Fu shoot.

934
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:58,416
- Ready?
- Eh?

935
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,374
- Yes.
- No!

936
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:00,458
One.

937
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:47,291
- Come on Fulvio, hurry up, go.
- I'm going.

938
01:41:47,417 --> 01:41:49,041
- Come on, fast.
- Okay.

939
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:55,124
There they are!
Halt! Halt!

940
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:57,832
The soldiers are coming.
They're coming!

941
01:41:58,458 --> 01:41:59,624
Get in, Mario!

942
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:03,874
Bon voyage my friend.

943
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:17,374
Here's the dwarf.

944
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,832
What a crazy flight!

945
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:23,124
Are you trying to shoot me
with a dwarf?

946
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Go.

947
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,791
Fuck.

948
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,332
- Little Mario!
- He's dead!

949
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:35,499
Here I am!

950
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:38,957
I'll kill you with my hands.

951
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,957
What a blowhard you are.

952
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,999
I told you I'd kill you.

953
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,791
Bye bye.

954
01:43:18,333 --> 01:43:19,333
Hey!

955
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:30,374
Come.

956
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,832
That damned son of a bitch.

957
01:43:43,042 --> 01:43:45,416
Sooner or later you're going
to give me a heart attack.

958
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,207
Come on, let's go!

959
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:47,082
Franz, where are you?

960
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,791
What the fuck were you doing?

961
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:51,624
Do you realize the shit I'm in?

962
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:54,791
- I only told the truth. As always.
- Kesselring is livid.

963
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:58,041
You're a loser. You've failed
your entire life. You're scum.

964
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,541
You think you're a German
but you're not, you're just scum.

965
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:02,166
- It's a...
- Don't touch me.

966
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,124
It's really a nice jacket.

967
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:06,082
It's over, Franz.

968
01:45:06,792 --> 01:45:09,332
You're going back to Berlin,
I'm telling you right now.

969
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:25,582
Goodbye, my brother.

970
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:39,582
Come on!

971
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:48,166
Fulvio!

972
01:47:49,042 --> 01:47:50,291
Come on, fast!

973
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:52,124
- No, Fulvio!
- Come on.

974
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:55,374
- Fu, stop!
- Come on!

975
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:58,957
- They'll hit us!
- Come on!

976
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,291
Shit!

977
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:09,249
You're a dead dog Fu.
God damn you.

978
01:48:10,167 --> 01:48:12,207
Did you see what I did, Mario?

979
01:48:12,375 --> 01:48:14,416
Almost shit yourself eh?

980
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:19,791
- What now?
- Perfect! Come on!

981
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,082
What's perfect Fu? Eh?

982
01:48:25,417 --> 01:48:27,041
Where the fuck are we going?

983
01:48:45,417 --> 01:48:47,166
Attention! Yessir!

984
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:56,207
Who is the highest rank?

985
01:48:58,542 --> 01:49:00,332
Sergeant Bern Schmidt, sir!

986
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:05,291
Why don't you have a helmet?
Put it on immediately!

987
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:09,249
Gather your men.
We have 4 fugitives.

988
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:12,499
But we're on patrol.

989
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:14,499
That's an order!

990
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:16,332
Yessir! Lieutenant!

991
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:19,957
- Come on, didn't you hear?
- Let's go!

992
01:49:20,917 --> 01:49:22,041
Move!

993
01:49:28,583 --> 01:49:31,416
- Move, come on.
- Move! Let's go.

994
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,457
Franz. Wait for me.

995
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,082
So listen.

996
01:50:14,542 --> 01:50:15,791
Here's the plan:

997
01:50:16,292 --> 01:50:18,707
We jump on the train,
we find Israel,

998
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:20,166
we grab him and go.

999
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:21,541
Where do we jump?

1000
01:50:21,625 --> 01:50:22,625
- I'm in.
- Me too.

1001
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:24,041
Of course you are.

1002
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:26,249
Laugh. Laugh. I want to see
where you land now.

1003
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:29,707
Come on, get ready.

1004
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:31,082
What a shitty plan.

1005
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:34,249
3, 2, 1...
Go!

1006
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:12,999
Bravo, eh?

1007
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:23,332
Miscreant!

1008
01:51:23,792 --> 01:51:25,291
Get off me! Get off me!

1009
01:51:25,375 --> 01:51:26,541
Voilà!

1010
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:36,499
No.

1011
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:40,624
- Oh God!
- No! Stop.

1012
01:51:41,833 --> 01:51:45,041
- We're just circus performers.
- We're circus performers.

1013
01:51:58,625 --> 01:51:59,499
Hello.

1014
01:51:59,583 --> 01:52:00,583
Assholes!

1015
01:52:54,167 --> 01:52:55,791
Up there. Come on!

1016
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Yummy!

1017
01:53:26,083 --> 01:53:28,874
- Finally something to eat!
- Let's tuck in.

1018
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:58,416
Everything is exactly
as I've seen it.

1019
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:06,875
Yes!

1020
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:12,457
Come on.

1021
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:39,582
Come on. Get down, come on.

1022
01:54:39,917 --> 01:54:40,749
Get down.

1023
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:42,332
Come on, everyone out.

1024
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:45,374
Is there anyone named Israel here?
Is Israel there?

1025
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:50,041
Cencio, give them a hand,
I'm going to open over there.

1026
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:58,291
Come on, come on down.
Everyone out.

1027
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:04,291
Israel... is there anyone named Israel?

1028
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:07,582
- Fulvio...
- Israel...

1029
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,166
- Israel! Israel!
- Fulvio!

1030
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:14,916
Mario!
How did you do it?

1031
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,916
Cencio!
Where's Matilde?

1032
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,707
She's there.

1033
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:19,166
- Where?
- There she is.

1034
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:21,042
Matilde.

1035
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,541
Stop! No!

1036
01:55:30,625 --> 01:55:31,666
Fire!

1037
01:55:34,792 --> 01:55:35,792
No!

1038
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:37,458
Matilde!

1039
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,166
Matilde!

1040
01:55:41,292 --> 01:55:42,292
No!

1041
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:43,791
Matilde!

1042
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:48,291
Matilde...

1043
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:55,457
Are you deaf? Go inside.

1044
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:56,999
Matilde!

1045
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:02,624
I would hug you if only I could.

1046
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:09,916
How sad a life it must be
not being able to touch anyone.

1047
01:56:11,167 --> 01:56:12,499
Come with me.

1048
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:15,582
I swear to you, with me

1049
01:56:15,667 --> 01:56:19,499
the future will be much better
than how we imagined it.

1050
01:56:21,167 --> 01:56:22,207
Come with me.

1051
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:26,458
Yes?

1052
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:28,374
Climb on, pigs!

1053
01:56:28,917 --> 01:56:30,249
Bring her up.

1054
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,666
Those three as well.

1055
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:34,832
The hairy one, the albino
and the dwarf.

1056
01:56:34,917 --> 01:56:37,957
- Come on, freaks.
- Step back.

1057
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:42,041
Come on! Come on!

1058
01:56:44,167 --> 01:56:46,416
What are you doing?
Leave him!

1059
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:49,249
That's an order.

1060
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,957
Leave him! Leave him!

1061
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:54,374
- No.
- Halt! Halt!

1062
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:57,999
Halt!

1063
01:57:08,292 --> 01:57:10,124
- Where is she?
- I don't know, sir.

1064
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,041
- Where is she?
- Move!

1065
01:57:12,417 --> 01:57:13,582
Where is Matilde?

1066
01:57:14,292 --> 01:57:15,624
Where is Matilde?

1067
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:17,999
In your mother's ass!

1068
01:57:30,125 --> 01:57:33,457
Forward! Burn these shitheads!

1069
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,541
Come on! Burn, go burn!

1070
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:37,916
Take this!

1071
01:57:39,042 --> 01:57:41,082
Hit 'em with the grenades!

1072
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:45,166
Go! Go!

1073
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:50,082
Burn!

1074
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,999
- Which way Fulvio?
- Here!

1075
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:04,041
- Go, Mario!
- Get under there.

1076
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,166
Shoot!

1077
01:58:13,875 --> 01:58:17,124
Forward you fucking nazis, come here!

1078
01:58:24,083 --> 01:58:25,457
Bravo.

1079
01:58:27,042 --> 01:58:28,042
The tank!

1080
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:29,708
The tank!

1081
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:32,082
Hit the tank!

1082
01:58:32,167 --> 01:58:33,167
Shoot!

1083
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:43,082
- Franz!
- Take cover!

1084
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:46,249
Shoot into the trees!

1085
01:58:48,875 --> 01:58:50,041
Sniper!

1086
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,124
Shoot into the trees!

1087
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,208
Fire!

1088
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:59,166
Come on!

1089
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:01,707
Shoot! Shoot!

1090
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:04,457
Come on, Bumleg!

1091
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,416
Come on, guys!

1092
01:59:07,375 --> 01:59:09,291
Bastards!

1093
01:59:12,917 --> 01:59:14,582
Die, you assholes!

1094
01:59:14,917 --> 01:59:15,917
Medic!

1095
01:59:41,917 --> 01:59:42,917
Fulvio!

1096
01:59:43,667 --> 01:59:47,124
Matilde, come here...
Stay here. Stay here.

1097
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:52,041
- Stay here.
- I'm here.

1098
01:59:53,667 --> 01:59:54,957
Come on!

1099
01:59:59,458 --> 02:00:00,458
What do we do?

1100
02:00:06,042 --> 02:00:07,042
Mario!

1101
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:15,207
I'm okay. Go!

1102
02:00:26,833 --> 02:00:27,833
Don't panic.

1103
02:00:29,333 --> 02:00:30,916
Cover fire!

1104
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,083
Fire!

1105
02:00:33,917 --> 02:00:35,832
Let's go! Let's go!

1106
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:47,208
Burn!

1107
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:53,416
Take out the catapult.

1108
02:00:58,167 --> 02:00:59,374
Sons of bitches.

1109
02:01:01,792 --> 02:01:02,792
No!

1110
02:01:05,292 --> 02:01:06,541
Take cover!

1111
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,207
Shoot at that machine gun!

1112
02:01:09,542 --> 02:01:11,332
Take down that machine gun!

1113
02:01:11,625 --> 02:01:13,957
The grenades are ready.

1114
02:01:14,125 --> 02:01:15,207
Go to hell!

1115
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:16,500
God damn it!

1116
02:01:28,625 --> 02:01:31,249
I'm tired of this shit.

1117
02:01:36,958 --> 02:01:38,082
I'm sorry, guys...

1118
02:01:59,167 --> 02:02:00,167
Fire!

1119
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:06,332
There, in the trees, fire!

1120
02:02:07,458 --> 02:02:08,749
Fire!

1121
02:02:12,292 --> 02:02:13,582
They're coming!

1122
02:02:14,417 --> 02:02:17,707
Bumleg, don't let it through!
The Killer Cow, go!

1123
02:02:17,792 --> 02:02:19,374
The Killer Cow, go!

1124
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,457
Where are you shooting?

1125
02:02:28,125 --> 02:02:30,332
Stop the tank!

1126
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:35,375
Sara!

1127
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:37,583
No!

1128
02:02:38,708 --> 02:02:41,374
Fuck these bastards.

1129
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:44,624
- Bumleg, the Killer Cow!
- Go with the Cow, go!

1130
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:50,957
Surprise, assholes!

1131
02:02:51,167 --> 02:02:52,832
Quiet! Keep quiet!

1132
02:02:55,792 --> 02:02:56,957
Hold your position!

1133
02:02:57,042 --> 02:02:58,291
Let's go, now.

1134
02:02:58,625 --> 02:02:59,874
Don't panic!

1135
02:03:11,292 --> 02:03:13,082
Look! Look!

1136
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,249
Well done, Cencio!

1137
02:03:15,375 --> 02:03:16,416
Come on!

1138
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:21,499
Come out, come on!

1139
02:03:23,875 --> 02:03:26,749
There was a boy on the train
that kept crying, poor thing.

1140
02:03:29,542 --> 02:03:31,582
He reminded me of you
when I found you.

1141
02:03:34,542 --> 02:03:35,791
You remember?

1142
02:03:37,833 --> 02:03:39,332
Fuck, you were wailing!

1143
02:03:47,833 --> 02:03:48,999
Mati...

1144
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:52,249
you shouldn't be afraid of anything.

1145
02:03:53,333 --> 02:03:54,457
Understand?

1146
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:58,374
You shouldn't be afraid of anything.

1147
02:03:59,333 --> 02:04:02,416
"Next year we'll meet..."

1148
02:04:06,458 --> 02:04:08,832
"...in Jerusalem".

1149
02:04:11,708 --> 02:04:13,207
No! No!

1150
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:28,707

Israel! Please, no!

1152
02:04:43,833 --> 02:04:44,999
Be calm.

1153
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:48,249
Shoot!
Hit the tank!

1154
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,041
Go!

1155
02:04:52,708 --> 02:04:54,249
Start it up!

1156
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:57,541
- It won't start!
- What do you mean it won't start? Fuck!

1157
02:04:57,708 --> 02:04:59,374
It won't start!

1158
02:05:00,917 --> 02:05:01,559
Shoot!

1159
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:02,583
Shoot!

1160
02:05:13,167 --> 02:05:14,624
Company, fire!

02:05:20,375 --> 02:05:21,375
Come on!

1162
02:05:28,375 --> 02:05:31,582

1166
02:06:12,042 --> 02:06:13,707
Take cover, Antonio!

1167
02:06:15,042 --> 02:06:16,166
Stay down!

1168
02:06:22,375 --> 02:06:24,041
Stay down!

1169
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:25,707

1170
02:06:26,458 --> 02:06:28,291

Why do you never listen you fool!

1172
02:06:32,125 --> 02:06:33,916

1174
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:42,041
- Halt!

1175
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:48,250
What...?

1176
02:06:50,583 --> 02:06:51,666
She's a monster!

1177
02:06:54,167 --> 02:06:55,249
What's happening?

1178
02:07:01,375 --> 02:07:02,375
Fire!

1179
02:07:02,625 --> 02:07:03,749

So listen...
Can we be together now?

1184
02:15:14,458 --> 02:15:16,957
Just to know,
cause I gave a half-answer to...

1185
02:15:17,042 --> 02:15:19,499
- To who!?
- Mind your own business.

1186
02:15:19,875 --> 02:15:21,541
Come here.

1187
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:26,707
What are the two of us
doing to do, Fulvio?

1188
02:15:27,583 --> 02:15:29,457
We'll be a third wheel, Mario.
