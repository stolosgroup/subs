2
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,072
First time in lndia, Miss Quested?

3
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:19,534
- First time out of England.
- l envy you. New horizons.

4
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:28,085
Those are the Marabar Caves,
about 20 miles from you at Chandrapore.

5
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,004
l see.

6
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,593
<i>Mrs Moore returns on the Rawalpindi
on May 12th and your return is open.</i>

7
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,762
That is correct?

8
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,223
l'll be staying on... probably.

9
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,269
lf you decide to return with Mrs Moore,
let us know as soon as possible.

10
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,396
l will.

11
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:52,859
Now, labels, stickers,
your ticket, Mrs Moore's ticket.

12
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:00,033
You should have an interesting voyage.
The viceroy's on board.

13
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,994
Tends to liven things up.

14
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,298
Ugh.

15
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,728
l do think it's too bad of Ronny
not to be here to meet us.

16
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:55,941
- lt is nearly a thousand miles.
- We've come 5,000 miles to meet him.

17
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:04,992
''No more than two annas each.''

18
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,787
Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,373
Now... Victoria Station.

20
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,264
- Oh, dear.
- Don't worry.

21
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,810
- Mrs Moore?
- Yes.

22
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,438
l'm Mrs Turton.

23
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,607
My husband's the collector.

24
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:39,943
Oh... We gave our tickets
to the lndian gentleman.

25
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:45,157
The chief administrator of Chandrapore.
Ronny's ''Burra Sahib''.

26
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,367
You must be Adela.

27
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,244
Yes.

28
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:52,664
Please forgive us, Mrs Turton.
We've had a very trying day.

29
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,752
We just wanted to welcome you
to the fold and to say... We're off.

30
00:06:56,877 --> 00:07:01,798
We must have a drink or something later,
when you've recovered. Goodbye.

31
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:21,860
l believe you and Ronny met
in the Lake District, Miss Quested?

32
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,488
- Yes, we did.
- You must forgive me.

33
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:29,409
We have very few secrets in Chandrapore.
And l'm an incurable romantic.

34
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,959
Miss Quested was with her aunt
and l was with Ronny.

35
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:42,714
You know, Mrs Moore, Ronny's
doing splendidly. You'll be proud of him.

36
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,634
l'll second that.
He's become a proper sahib.

37
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,136
Just the type we want, if l might say so.

38
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:13,245
You know, Mr Turton,
when we get settled in,

39
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,999
we look forward to meeting some of
the lndians you come across socially

40
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,167
as friends.

41
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:23,422
Well, as a matter of fact,
we don't come across them socially.

42
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:27,592
They're full of all the virtues,
no doubt, but we don't.

43
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:33,890
East is East, Mrs Moore.
lt's a question of culture.

44
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:48,780
Could Ronny really have become a sahib?

45
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,284
He could.

46
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,579
But that's why you've come here.

47
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:58,206
You'll find out soon enough.

48
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,961
She's a dreadful woman.

49
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,130
Yes.

50
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:09,509
We'd better go to sleep, my dear.

51
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,999
Hello, Mother! Where's Adela?

52
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,418
Here.

53
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,380
l can't believe it.

54
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,346
Antony!

55
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:45,314
Antony will see to the baggage. Forgive
me, l'm part of the reception committee.

56
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,186
Guards! Attention!

57
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:29,524
Sorry to desert you. We had to
welcome the great man back.

58
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,820
- l'd no idea he was so important.
- You hadn't?

59
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:59,137
Look out!

60
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,486
- That was Turton.
- Turton?

61
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:25,539
McBryde. When he first came, Hamidullah
said he was quite a good fellow.

62
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,586
But they all become exactly the same.

63
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:35,090
l give any Englishman two years.

64
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:39,678
- The women are worse.
- l give them six months.

65
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:23,305
Ronny, is that a body?

66
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,600
Yes. l'm sorry.
We'll soon be out of this.

67
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,373
Why do we spend so much time
discussing the English?

68
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:51,625
Because we admire them, Doctor Sahib.

69
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,794
That is the trouble.

70
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,174
Tomorrow night!

71
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,022
English!

72
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:54,396
- Here we are, then.
- Very nice, dear.

73
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:04,740
- Are those the Marabar Hills?
- That's right.

74
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,534
- With the caves?
- l suppose so.

75
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:11,330
Look, you've got a busy day tomorrow.
Then we have a show at the club.

76
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:13,498
- Come on. Let's have tea.
- Yes.

77
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,256
<i>Good night, Mother.</i>

78
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:26,094
<i>- Yes?</i>

79
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:29,139
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

80
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,387
Having listened to the evidence,
l find you guilty of cheating

81
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:11,265
under Section 415
of the lndian Penal Code

82
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,643
and sentence you
to two months' hard labour.

83
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:18,689
You may take the prisoner down.

84
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:30,284
- Well, how did it all go?
- We must have seen everything.

85
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:35,539
Yes, the church, the hospital,
the war memorial, the barracks.

86
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:40,002
- Mr Hadley was most thorough.
- Splendid. And now you're off to the club.

87
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,559
Cucumber.

88
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:02,524
My dear, life rarely gives us what we want
at the moment we consider appropriate.

89
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:07,779
Adventures do occur,
but not punctually.

90
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:32,054
Doctor Sahib, when are we
going to get you married?

91
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,057
l have enough responsibilities, Auntie.

92
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:39,353
We ask the poor fellow to dinner,
avail ourselves of his professional skills,

93
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,981
- and you always bring up this question.
- lt is the least l can do.

94
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,150
This should put a stop to the trouble.

95
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:50,238
And, Begum Sahiba, l beg you once more
not to drink water out of a tap.

96
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,200
Please to boil it, boil it, boil it!

97
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,203
And now we can eat. Selim!

98
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,461
Why must you always bring up
this question of marriage?

99
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:08,465
He sends the children nearly all his salary
and lives like a low-grade clerk.

100
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,008
What more do you require?

101
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,393
This chitty has just arrived for you
from Major Callendar.

102
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:28,151
l am to report to his bungalow posthaste.

103
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,533
And my bicycle has a puncture.

104
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,212
The major sahib left half an hour ago.

105
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,549
- And left no message?
- No message.

106
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:58,890
Mrs Lesley, it is a tonga. Come!

107
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:01,059
Oh, how splendid.

108
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,940
l suppose this is all right?

109
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:11,612
My dear, never look a gift-horse in
the mouth, particularly in this country.

110
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:13,697
Club!

111
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:16,867
Club, tonga wallah! Club!
Why doesn't the fool move?

112
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,954
l pay you tomorrow.

113
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,878
Will you please...

114
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:29,249
Madam, this is a mosque.
You have no right here.

115
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:33,003
- You should have taken off your shoes.
- But l have taken off my shoes.

116
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:35,464
l left them outside.

117
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:41,261
Then l... l ask your pardon.

118
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,807
- Let me go.
- Madam.

119
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,900
l am right, am l not?

120
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,277
lf l remove my shoes, l am allowed?

121
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,948
Of course.
But so few ladies take the trouble.

122
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:04,409
Especially if thinking
no one is here to see.

123
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,870
God is here.

124
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,165
God is here.

125
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:14,169
That is very fine.
May l know your name?

126
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,880
Mrs Moore.

127
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:23,845
Oh.

128
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:27,182
l came from the club.

129
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:32,521
They're doing a rather tiresome
musical play l'd seen in London.

130
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:36,650
- lt was very hot.
- l think you ought not to walk alone.

131
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:40,362
There are bad characters about,
and leopards may come from the hills.

132
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:43,156
- Snakes also.
- But you walk alone.

133
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:48,370
- l come here quite often. l'm used to it.
- Used to snakes?

134
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:52,457
l'm a doctor, you see.
Snakes don't dare bite me.

135
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,961
Please.

136
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:03,093
Mrs Moore, l think you are
newly arrived in lndia.

137
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,679
Yes. How did you know?

138
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:08,098
By the way you address me.

139
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,683
Look.

140
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:19,359
Sometimes l have seen a dead body
float past from Benares.

141
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:22,195
But not very often.

142
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:24,615
- There are crocodiles.
- Crocodiles?

143
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:27,159
How terrible.

144
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,163
What a terrible river.

145
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:34,916
What a wonderful river.

146
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:40,505
Please may l ask you a question now?
Why do you come to lndia?

147
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,842
l come to visit my son.
He's the city magistrate.

148
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:47,638
Oh, no. Excuse me.
Our city magistrate is Mr Heaslop.

149
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:51,642
He is my son all the same.
l was married twice.

150
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,603
And your first husband died?

151
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,773
He did. And so did my second.

152
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:00,984
Then we are in the same box.

153
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:04,947
And is the city magistrate
the entire of your family now?

154
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:13,080
No. l have a daughter in England by my
second husband. Stella. She's an artist.

155
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,415
Ah.

156
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,544
Mrs Moore, like yourself,
l have also a son and a daughter.

157
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:22,756
ls not this the same box
with a vengeance?

158
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,717
But not called Ronny and Stella, surely?

159
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:30,055
No indeed. Akbar and Jamila.
They live with my wife's mother.

160
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,224
And your wife?

161
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,978
ln giving me a son, she died.

162
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:43,694
You have the most kind face
of any English lady l have met.

163
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:53,245
l think l'd better go back now.

164
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:58,834
? l've got this strange feeling
l've fallen in love

165
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,462
- ? She's fallen in love?
- ? While l was freewheeling

166
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:04,840
And...

167
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,134
? Hooray, hooray, hooray

168
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,636
? lt's a wonderful day today

169
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,930
? But l know that at this juncture

170
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,182
? l can't afford a puncture

171
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:16,727
? And here is my Michael...

172
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:25,694
l wish l were a member.
l could have asked you in.

173
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:29,990
lndians are not allowed.

174
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,243
Oh.

175
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,412
Good night.

176
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:54,514
There you are.
What have you been up to?

177
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,808
l'll tell you about it later.

178
00:25:56,934 --> 00:26:01,688
l had a small adventure,
and saw the moon in the Ganges.

179
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:16,036
Ah, Mrs Moore, Miss Quested,
have a drink. Have two drinks.

180
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,705
- lt's very kind.
- My wife's on stage,

181
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,793
and Ronny's still holding
the fort for Major Callendar.

182
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:27,923
His wretched lndian assistant didn't
turn up in time, but l got my own back.

183
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:32,219
l'm sorry about the show.
But what else can we do for you ladies?

184
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,349
Mr Turton, l'm longing to see
something of the real lndia.

185
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:42,187
Fielding, how is one to see the real lndia?

186
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:44,606
Try seeing lndians.

187
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:48,652
- Who was that?
- Our schoolmaster. Government College.

188
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,821
As if one could avoid seeing them.

189
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:53,865
Well, l've scarcely spoken to
an lndian since we landed.

190
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:56,368
Lucky you!

191
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:59,997
lf you really want to meet
some of our Aryan brothers,

192
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:02,708
how about a bridge party?

193
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,127
- Not the game.
- Oh...

194
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:08,130
No. A party to bridge the gulf
between East and West.

195
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:14,052
We can produce almost any type you like:
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, even a Parsee.

196
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:23,812
? God save our gracious king

197
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:28,567
? Long live our noble king

198
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:32,487
? God save the king

199
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:38,910
? Send him victorious

200
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:43,624
? Happy and glorious...

201
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:33,173
To work, Molly. To work.

202
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:38,553
l never thought so many would turn up.
They hate it as much as we do.

203
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:55,862
Ronny.

204
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:23,390
Very nice of you to come.

205
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:27,144
Would you please tell these ladies
l wish we could speak their language?

206
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:31,732
- Perhaps we speak yours a little.
- Why, fancy, she understands!

207
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:37,738
- Piccadilly, Hyde Park Corner.
- Yes, indeed.

208
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,782
- Rotten Row.
- Marble Arch.

209
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:44,995
- She knows Paris also.
- They pass Paris on the way, no doubt.

210
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,718
My only consolation

211
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:05,390
is that Mrs Turton will soon be retired
to a villa in Tunbridge Wells.

212
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,027
Who is that man talking to Adela?

213
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:21,281
Oh, that's Fielding.
Runs Government College.

214
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:29,247
l don't understand people inviting guests
and not treating them properly.

215
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:34,920
You and Mr Turton are the only people
who've made any attempt to be friendly.

216
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,256
lt makes me quite ashamed.

217
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:40,092
lt's awkward, l agree, here at the club.

218
00:30:40,217 --> 00:30:42,928
l envy you being with lndians.

219
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:46,765
lf you and Mrs Moore would care
to meet one or two, it's easily arranged.

220
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,102
l'd love to. l'm sure she would too.

221
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:56,441
We've an old Hindu professor who'll tell
you all about reincarnation and destiny.

222
00:30:56,566 --> 00:31:00,237
- He might even be persuaded to sing.
- l'd like that.

223
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:04,783
- Tell me, do you know a Dr Aziz?
- l know of him. l've never actually met.

224
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,411
Mrs Moore says he's charming.

225
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,871
- Good. We'll invite him too.
- Good.

226
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:15,127
Oh, dear. This is for Mrs Turton.

227
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:28,640
This is one of the most unnatural affairs
l have ever attended.

228
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,351
Of course it's unnatural.
Now you see.

229
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:35,689
l do not see why you all behave
so unpleasantly to these people.

230
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:40,527
- We're not out here to be pleasant.
- Ronny, what do you mean?

231
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:48,368
lndia isn't a drawing room. We're out here
to do justice and to keep the peace.

232
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,954
l'm not a missionary
or a sentimental socialist.

233
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,042
- l'm just a member of the civil service.
- As simple as that.

234
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:59,421
What do you and Adela want me to do?
Sacrifice my career?

235
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:02,341
Lose the power l have
for doing good in this country?

236
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:06,261
Good? You're speaking about power.

237
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:09,890
The whole of this entertainment
is an exercise in power,

238
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:13,769
and the subtle pleasures
of personal superiority.

239
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:27,783
God has put us on earth
to love and help our fellow men.

240
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,495
Yes, Mother.

241
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,433
Mr Fielding?

242
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,376
- Mr Fielding.
- Oh, hello. ls that Dr Aziz?

243
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:23,088
Yes. l'm afraid l am early.

244
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:27,718
That's fine. l won't be a jiffy.
Please make yourself at home.

245
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,889
May l really, Mr Fielding?
lt's very good of you.

246
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,833
- Mr Fielding!
- Yes?

247
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,544
l have long been wanting to meet you.

248
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:07,341
l have heard many times about
your kind heart and your sociability.

249
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,509
My dear fellow!

250
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,680
And l have seen you in the bazaar.

251
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:16,058
Ah.

252
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:41,375
? The sun, whose rays are all ablaze
with ever-living glory

253
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:47,214
? Does not deny his majesty,
he scorns to tell a story...

254
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:50,008
- l say, Mr Fielding.
- Yes?

255
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,095
Before you come out,
guess what l look like.

256
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:58,684
Well, let's see.
You're about 5ft 9in tall.

257
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,896
- Jolly good!
- l can see that much through the glass.

258
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:06,233
Blast!

259
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:11,113
- Anything wrong?
- l've just broken my back collar stud.

260
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:13,615
Oh. Take mine.

261
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:15,909
Have you a spare one?

262
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:18,078
Yes. Yes, one minute.

263
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,581
- Not if you're wearing it.
- No, no. Here in my pocket.

264
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,918
But nobody carries
a spare stud in his pocket.

265
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:28,130
l always, in case of emergency.

266
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:32,301
Here it is.

267
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:37,180
Many thanks.
Oh, and how do you do?

268
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:42,728
Sit down while l finish dressing,
if you don't mind the unconventionality.

269
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:51,320
l always thought Englishmen
kept their rooms so tidy.

270
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:55,157
Everything arranged coldly
on shelves is what l thought.

271
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:01,955
There are two English ladies
coming to tea to meet you.

272
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,791
- Oh.
- Oh, l think you know one of them.

273
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:08,629
- l know no English ladies.
- Not Mrs Moore?

274
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:11,882
- Mrs Moore?
- And Miss Quested, her companion.

275
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:14,176
Oh. ls she an old lady?

276
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:16,970
She's a young lady,
and she wants to see lndia.

277
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,185
They're here,
or will be in a few seconds.

278
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:30,901
l've also asked our professor
of philosophy, Narayan Godbole.

279
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:34,071
Oh, the inscrutable Brahmin.

280
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:37,658
l hope to goodness his food'll be
all right. He's orthodox, you know.

281
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,040
<i>Good afternoon. Welcome.</i>

282
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:49,878
<i>- How kind of you to ask us.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

283
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:51,296
Oh.

284
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,715
lt must have been a small audience hall.

285
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,718
Mrs Moore, do you remember
the tank in our mosque?

286
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:59,721
- l do indeed.
- Please come and see.

287
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,978
By a skilful arrangement of our emperors,
the same water comes and fills this tank.

288
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:09,564
My ancestors loved water.
We came out of the desert.

289
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,317
We came over from
Persia and Afghanistan.

290
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:16,029
And wherever we went, we created
fountains and gardens and...

291
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:21,952
Ah, Godbole! You know Dr Aziz,
and here are our new visitors.

292
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:26,540
Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Professor
Godbole. We didn't realise you were here.

293
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:29,626
The sun will soon be driving us
all into the shade.

294
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,170
And l was enjoying the water.

295
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:38,260
Now, Mrs Moore, would you like
to have our tea served inside or out?

296
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:48,895
Dr Aziz, l wonder if you could explain
a disappointment we had this morning.

297
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:52,441
Ah, yes. l'm afraid we may have
given some offence.

298
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,152
That is impossible. May l know the facts?

299
00:37:55,277 --> 00:38:00,115
Yes. An lndian lady and gentleman, whom
we met at the club party the other day,

300
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,493
were to collect us in their carriage
this morning at nine.

301
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:06,705
We waited and waited.
They never came.

302
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,333
They even put off
going to Delhi to entertain us.

303
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,419
- l wouldn't worry about it.
- Well, it is very worrying.

304
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:15,797
l think perhaps, young lady,
they grew ashamed of their house

305
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:19,927
- and that is why they did not send.
- That's very possible.

306
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:23,639
- l do so hate mysteries.
- We English do.

307
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:28,018
l rather like mysteries,
but l do dislike muddles.

308
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:31,480
l think a mystery is only
a high-sounding term for a muddle.

309
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:34,274
The professor, Aziz and l
know that lndia's a muddle.

310
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,027
Agreed, l'm sorry to say.

311
00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:40,238
There will be no muddle
when you come to visit me at my house.

312
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:42,449
That would be very nice. Yes, Adela?

313
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:46,286
Yes, indeed. Do please give me
your address, Doctor Aziz.

314
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,375
- Yes?
- One moment. l have a better idea.

315
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,461
Let me invite you all
to a picnic at the Marabar Caves.

316
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,506
Ladies, this will be
a most magnificent outing.

317
00:38:57,631 --> 00:39:01,593
One is transported by mountain railway
2,000 feet above the plain.

318
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,055
And the caves, Mrs Moore,
are a wonder of lndia.

319
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,475
- Yes, Professor?
- They have a reputation.

320
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,439
Doctor, how many caves are there?

321
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,945
l'm not exactly sure. Unfortunately,
l've never been there myself.

322
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:23,407
My dear chap!

323
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:26,576
Professor Godbole,
have you seen the caves?

324
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:28,578
Oh, yes.

325
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:33,166
Well, could you tell us
something about them?

326
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,378
With pleasure.

327
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:44,595
Only a few have been opened.
Perhaps seven or eight.

328
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,140
And?

329
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,934
There is an entrance which you enter,

330
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:56,523
and through this entrance, manmade,
there is a circular chamber.

331
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,861
- Big?
- Not big.

332
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:04,364
- lmmensely holy, no doubt?
- Oh, no, no.

333
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,200
Ornamented in some way?

334
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:11,747
They are all the same. Empty and dark.

335
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:22,174
Well, there must be something
to account for their reputation.

336
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:24,343
lndeed.

337
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,727
Well, well.

338
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:38,190
Mr Fielding, l should like
to see something of the college.

339
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:42,027
Don't you come, Adela.
l know you hate institutions.

340
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:53,580
You know, Miss Quested, when l first
saw Mrs Moore it was in the moonlight.

341
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,959
l thought she was a ghost.

342
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,837
- A very old soul.
- An old soul?

343
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:04,049
The professor is using
the expression in its Hindu sense.

344
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:06,677
Someone who has been here
many times before.

345
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:10,013
- Mrs Moore - a reincarnation?
- Quite so.

346
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:14,393
- Please go on, Professor.
- Ah, yes.

347
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:18,563
- lt is philosophy of some complication.
- But in simple terms...

348
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,985
ln simple terms, Miss Quested,
life is a wheel with many spokes.

349
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,116
A continuous cycle of life:
birth, death and rebirth

350
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:31,868
until we attain nirvana.

351
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:36,164
l have contrived a dance
based on this philosophy.

352
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,333
Do you dance, Professor?

353
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,712
- Adela.
- Oh, Ronny, you're early.

354
00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:44,756
Let me introduce to you
Professor Godbole and this...

355
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:49,052
What's happened to Fielding?
And what on earth are you doing?

356
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:52,973
They're seeing the college and
we're eating water chestnuts. Have one.

357
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,475
No, thank you. We're leaving at once.

358
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:59,896
- But we can't leave like this.
- lt's perfectly all right.

359
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:02,691
Bearer! Bearer!

360
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:25,047
You can take it from me
that picnic will never come off.

361
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:28,634
Just like that fiasco this morning.
He'll forget he invited you.

362
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:31,929
- You're wrong.
- Notice the collar climbing up his neck?

363
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:34,932
l like Dr Aziz.

364
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:45,067
Aziz was dressed in his Sunday best,
but he'd forgotten his back collar stud.

365
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,319
And there you have the lndian all over.

366
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,072
l bet he forgot the caves
are miles from the station.

367
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:52,950
- Have you been to them?
- l know all about them, naturally.

368
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:56,745
- Naturally.
- l really cannot have this quarrelling.

369
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,996
Sorry.

370
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,297
l don't know why l get so het up.

371
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:11,385
Actually, l was taking us all
to see a game of polo. Should be good.

372
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,388
Not for me, dear. l'm going to rest.

373
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:17,307
You and Adela can watch the polo.

374
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:36,785
- Ronny.
- Yes?

375
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:41,540
- l want to say something.
- Yes?

376
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:43,709
Something important.

377
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:48,672
Ronny...

378
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:54,011
l've finally decided...

379
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:56,680
we're not going to be married.

380
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,399
You never said we would be married.

381
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:12,613
But you were quite right to come out.
lt was a good idea.

382
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:22,831
We're being awfully English
about this, aren't we?

383
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:25,584
l suppose that's all right.

384
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:28,962
As we are English, yes, l suppose it is.

385
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:40,307
Let's go for a little drive.

386
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:43,894
- Oughtn't we get back to the bungalow?
- Why?

387
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:47,564
l think we should tell your mother,
talk about what we're going to do.

388
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:49,900
lf you don't mind,
let's leave it a day or two.

389
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:52,277
l don't want to upset her
any more than l have.

390
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:55,405
And besides,
you're going on that expedition.

391
00:45:00,744 --> 00:45:03,455
And why did you undertake
such an extravagance?

392
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,624
To avoid asking them to my house.

393
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:08,877
Which you had already done.

394
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:12,297
Now we must all put
our shoulders to the wheel.

395
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:15,884
My wife will supply plates,
knives and forks.

396
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,679
And then there is the question of alcohol.

397
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:21,848
Whisky-sodas for Mr Fielding,
ports for the ladies.

398
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:26,353
And food. The English are big eaters.

399
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:29,523
- And Professor Godbole?
- He eats more than the English.

400
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:33,777
- Nothing but vegetables, fruits and rice.
- And only if cooked by a Brahmin.

401
00:45:33,902 --> 00:45:37,364
And if there is a slice of beef
in the vicinity, he will throw up.

402
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:40,075
The English can eat mutton.

403
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,706
- Even ham.
- Ham? Are you suggesting l offer ham?

404
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:48,250
Enough, enough.

405
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:52,170
English ladies cannot sit upon the ground.
Not even on a Persian carpet.

406
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:55,924
- You must take chairs and tables.
- So you will need servants.

407
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,886
Then there is also the question
of transport after the train journey.

408
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:03,432
The caves are a considerable
distance from the station.

409
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:07,019
l've just been to the station.
The train leaves before dawn.

410
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:10,856
Then you must take precaution
against lack of punctuality.

411
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:13,442
Better spend the night there.

412
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:22,993
- What was that?
- Nothing.

413
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:28,123
lt always happens before the hot weather,
generally with dust and thunder. Coffee?

414
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:32,002
No, thank you. l'm off to bed.

415
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:35,005
l know l made myself
rather ridiculous this afternoon.

416
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,259
But the truth is, l wasn't
quite sure of myself, and l'm sorry.

417
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:42,930
Very nicely said. Thank you, dear.

418
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:48,101
Of course, l have no earthly right to tell
either of you what you can or cannot do.

419
00:46:48,226 --> 00:46:51,355
See lndia if you like and as you like.

420
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:57,235
Sometimes l think too much fuss
is made about marriage.

421
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:01,823
Century after century
of carnal embracement,

422
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:05,077
and we're still no nearer
understanding one another.

423
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:07,537
Good night.

424
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,764
Adela, are you all right?

425
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,683
Yes, of course.

426
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:17,355
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing.

427
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:24,529
l want to take back what l said at the polo.

428
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:27,907
Oh, Ronny... l'm such a fool.

429
00:53:48,886 --> 00:53:52,014
lt's a funny thing,
but l don't feel a bit excited.

430
00:53:53,391 --> 00:53:57,770
Well, nothing's really changed, has it?
l feel perfectly ordinary.

431
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,108
lt's much the best feeling to have.

432
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,695
l suppose so.

433
00:54:09,198 --> 00:54:11,451
l'm sorry to have been so difficult.

434
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:13,828
Oh, l shouldn't worry.

435
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:20,501
lt's partly to do with this country
and the odd surroundings.

436
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:26,382
Do you mean that my bothers
are to do with lndia?

437
00:54:28,009 --> 00:54:32,805
lndia forces one to come
face to face with oneself.

438
00:54:34,182 --> 00:54:37,143
lt can be rather disturbing.

439
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:41,981
Odd.

440
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:45,026
lt must be very cold in England.

441
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:55,995
Now we must go back
and you must dance with Ronny.

442
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,957
Apart from anything else,
it will serve as a notice of intent.

443
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:07,840
Hello.

444
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:58,868
Hassan.

445
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:55,425
- lt's going to be hot.
- Your famous hot weather.

446
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,010
- Mother?
- You two go ahead.

447
00:58:05,977 --> 00:58:07,353
Ah!

448
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:10,022
Congratulations.
We've just heard the good news.

449
00:58:10,148 --> 00:58:12,400
Allow me to shake your hand.

450
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:47,018
Mr Fielding, l'm Dr Lal.

451
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:50,897
- Ah, yes. How do you do?
- Just making check on doctor sahib.

452
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:54,609
- Major Callendar's orders.
- And?

453
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:57,570
A slight fever, perhaps.
Change of season.

454
00:58:58,154 --> 00:59:03,493
- You must get well quickly.
- Yes. There is talk of cholera in the city.

455
00:59:03,618 --> 00:59:06,120
There is always talk of cholera in the city.

456
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:08,581
Hello! Can l come in?

457
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:12,627
Mr Fielding. Yes, please come in.

458
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:17,632
Ah.

459
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:21,594
- Hamidullah.
- Mr Fielding, how nice of you to come.

460
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:28,434
- And how's the patient?
- lt is very good of Mr Fielding

461
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,437
to condescend to visit our friend.
We're deeply touched.

462
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:34,565
Don't talk to him like that.
He does not want it.

463
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:39,529
And he does not need three chairs.
He's not three Englishmen!

464
00:59:43,324 --> 00:59:46,160
Well, are you ill or aren't you?

465
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:48,746
No doubt Major Callendar
told you l'm shamming.

466
00:59:48,871 --> 00:59:50,915
Well, are you?

467
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:55,420
The hot weather is coming.
l have a fever.

468
00:59:57,547 --> 01:00:00,091
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, all of you!

469
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:05,596
Mr Fielding, excuse. A question, please.

470
01:00:05,722 --> 01:00:08,474
- Carry on.
- Nothing personal.

471
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:11,936
Personally, we're all delighted
that you should be here.

472
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:14,981
But how is England
justified in holding lndia?

473
01:00:15,106 --> 01:00:17,567
- Unfair political question.
- No, no.

474
01:00:18,568 --> 01:00:22,822
- l'm out here because l need a job.
- Qualified lndians also need a job.

475
01:00:22,947 --> 01:00:25,199
l got in first.

476
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:31,956
And l'm delighted to be here. That's
my answer and that's my only excuse.

477
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:35,626
- And those who are not delighted?
- Chuck 'em out.

478
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:40,506
lndians are also saying that.

479
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:57,356
- Mr Fielding...

480
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:02,737
What are you doing out here?

481
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:05,406
Please come back.

482
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,575
Of course.

483
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:17,752
Here you see the celebrated
hospitality of the East.

484
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:24,675
Look... look at the mess.
Look at the flies.

485
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:28,513
- Look at the plaster coming off the wall.
- Oh, please.

486
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:31,307
Here is my home,

487
01:01:31,432 --> 01:01:34,102
where you come to be insulted
by my friends.

488
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:37,897
That was fair enough.
And you'd better get back into bed.

489
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:41,234
- And then you'll have to be off.
- You should rest.

490
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,155
l can rest all day thanks to Dr Lal,
Major Callendar's spy.

491
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,949
l suppose you know that.

492
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:53,204
Major Callendar doesn't trust anyone,
English or lndian. That's his character.

493
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:57,041
l wish you weren't under him.
But you are, and that's that.

494
01:01:59,127 --> 01:02:02,880
There we are. Try sleeping for a bit.

495
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:07,719
Before you go, will you please open
that drawer under the clock?

496
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:14,100
There's a grey cardboard folder.

497
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:16,310
That's right. Open it.

498
01:02:19,814 --> 01:02:22,024
She was my wife.

499
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:35,580
You are the first Englishman
she has ever come before.

500
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:40,877
Now put her away.

501
01:02:41,002 --> 01:02:44,797
l don't know why you pay me this
great compliment, but l do appreciate it.

502
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:50,720
Oh, it is nothing. She was not a highly
educated woman, or even beautiful.

503
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,848
But l loved her.

504
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:57,018
Now put her away.
You would have seen her anyhow.

505
01:02:57,727 --> 01:03:00,480
- Would you have allowed me to see her?
- Why not?

506
01:03:00,605 --> 01:03:04,484
l believe in the purdah, but l would
have told her you were my brother.

507
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:07,528
- Would she have believed you?
- Of course not.

508
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:12,116
Put her away. She is dead.

509
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:16,662
l showed her to you because
l have nothing else to show.

510
01:03:24,128 --> 01:03:28,674
<i>Mr Fielding, why are You not married?</i>

511
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:32,887
The lady l liked wouldn't marry me.
That's the main point.

512
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:36,724
That was a long time ago.
Before the war.

513
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:40,019
- You haven't any children?
- None.

514
01:03:40,812 --> 01:03:44,399
Excuse the following question.
Have you any illegitimate children?

515
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:46,442
No.

516
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:49,362
- Then your name will die entirely out?
- Right.

517
01:03:51,906 --> 01:03:54,951
This is what an Oriental
will never understand.

518
01:03:55,076 --> 01:04:00,456
- There are far too many children anyway.
- Why don't you marry Miss Quested?

519
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:02,917
- Good Lord!
- But she's very nice.

520
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:07,630
l can't marry her even if l wanted to.
She's engaged to the city magistrate.

521
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:10,174
Oh.

522
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,719
So no Miss Quested for Mr Fielding.

523
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:18,641
However, she is not beautiful,
and she has practically no breasts.

524
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:20,810
For a magistrate they may be sufficient.

525
01:04:20,935 --> 01:04:24,063
For you l'll arrange a lady
with breasts like Bombay mangoes!

526
01:04:24,188 --> 01:04:26,357
No, you won't.

527
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:30,987
You must not tell Callendar, but last year
l took sick leave and l went to Calcutta.

528
01:04:31,112 --> 01:04:35,199
- There are girls there with breasts...
- You've made a remarkable recovery.

529
01:04:35,324 --> 01:04:38,703
- l have, l have.
- Please tell your chap to bring my horse.

530
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:42,999
- He doesn't seem to understand my Urdu.
- l told him not to.

531
01:04:43,124 --> 01:04:47,211
But now l will release you. Hassan!

532
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:56,054
By the way, about this Marabar
expedition. lt's going to cost an awful lot.

533
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:59,265
Would you like me to help you call it off?

534
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:01,934
No, no. Arrangements
are almost complete.

535
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,270
l shall know exact date tomorrow.

536
01:05:04,395 --> 01:05:06,939
Well, good. Don't leave it too long.

537
01:05:08,399 --> 01:05:10,443
Phew.

538
01:05:27,668 --> 01:05:30,046
Hassan?

539
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:56,406
You've come after all! l was afraid...
How kind, how very kind!

540
01:05:56,531 --> 01:06:00,868
l'm sorry, Dr Aziz, but l've never been
at my best at this time of the morning.

541
01:06:00,993 --> 01:06:04,205
- We're here anyway.
- Yes. Excuse me. Please come.

542
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:21,889
- This isn't all for us?
- For this great occasion

543
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:24,434
l've had help from all my friends.

544
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,729
l think you will not need your servant.

545
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:31,941
- No, indeed.
- Then we shall all be Muslims together.

546
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:34,777
Antony...
l don't like him at all.

547
01:06:34,902 --> 01:06:38,531
Antony, you can go now.
We won't need you any more.

548
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:41,409
Master told me to stay.

549
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:43,953
Mistress tells you to go.

550
01:06:44,078 --> 01:06:47,582
Master says
''Keep near ladies all morning.''

551
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,169
Please go.

552
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:13,441
- What's that for?
- A surprise. You will see.

553
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:16,611
Come, come, come. Please, come.

554
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,241
You are travelling purdah.
You will like that?

555
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:25,661
- lt will certainly be a new experience.
- Yes.

556
01:07:27,497 --> 01:07:29,665
Where's Mr Fielding?

557
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:34,003
He'll be here.
Englishmen never miss a train.

558
01:07:53,147 --> 01:07:55,441
Mr Fielding! Mr Fielding!

559
01:07:55,566 --> 01:07:57,610
l'm most awfully sorry, Aziz.

560
01:07:58,361 --> 01:08:02,573
Oh, Mr Fielding, you have destroyed me.

561
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:05,743
lt was Godbole's prayers.
They went on for ever.

562
01:08:06,035 --> 01:08:08,413
- Jump on! Jump!
- No, no.

563
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:11,999
- l must have you.
- l'm sorry, Aziz, but it really is no good.

564
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:16,629
We'll join you... somehow.

565
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,508
Mrs Moore, our expedition is a ruin.

566
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:23,886
Nonsense.
We shall now all be Muslims together.

567
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:28,433
- Dear, dear Mrs Moore.
- Go back to you carriage, Dr Aziz.

568
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:30,601
You make me quite giddy.

569
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:36,941
Poor Aziz.
We must try and get hold of a car.

570
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:40,111
Can you think of anyone?

571
01:08:40,236 --> 01:08:42,113
ls anything the matter?

572
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,283
- You saw the gates shut against us?
- Yes.

573
01:08:45,408 --> 01:08:48,953
- Today is Tuesday.
- Go on.

574
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:51,748
Not a wise day
to undertake such a journey.

575
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:54,667
Extremely inauspicious, Mr Fielding.

576
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:56,836
Godbole.

577
01:09:12,268 --> 01:09:14,937
l wouldn't have missed this for anything.

578
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,066
- Memsahib.
- Oh, thank you.

579
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:20,234
- Tea coming.
- Yes.

580
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:23,279
What a relief after Antony.

581
01:09:24,322 --> 01:09:26,574
Rather a strange place to do the cooking.

582
01:09:31,704 --> 01:09:35,333
l always feel rather embarrassed
when people l dislike are good to me.

583
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:38,252
And l really don't care for Mrs Callendar.

584
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:41,923
But she's visiting a clinic and
the road goes up to just below the caves.

585
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:45,510
We'd better leave in half an hour.
Would you care for a coffee?

586
01:10:38,646 --> 01:10:41,149
- Miss Quested!
- Oh, no.

587
01:10:45,486 --> 01:10:47,989
ls Mrs Moore awake?

588
01:10:48,114 --> 01:10:51,492
Yes. But please... go in!

589
01:10:51,826 --> 01:10:58,207
Don't worry, Miss Quested.
Look, l am Douglas Fairbanks.

590
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:06,132
Tell me, dear. What's going on out there?

591
01:11:09,552 --> 01:11:11,679
Mrs Moore, we're almost there.

592
01:11:11,804 --> 01:11:15,933
l will now explain to you about the ladder.
lt is to be your big surprise.

593
01:12:39,684 --> 01:12:42,478
You cannot imagine how you honour me.

594
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:50,570
l feel that l am journeying back into
my past, and that l'm a Mogul emperor.

595
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:11,549
Sometimes l shut my eyes and dream...
l have splendid clothes again.

596
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,890
And that l'm riding into battle
behind Alamgir. He too rode an elephant.

597
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,484
Horrid, stuffy place, really.

598
01:14:12,318 --> 01:14:16,739
- Everything is very well arranged.
- And here, ladies, is your port.

599
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:23,871
The best caves are higher up,
under the Kawa Dol.

600
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:27,667
But we start in this one.

601
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:31,003
The guide says,
everyone to go in quietly.

602
01:14:31,129 --> 01:14:36,509
All sounds make an echo, and many
sounds create inharmonious effect.

603
01:14:36,634 --> 01:14:41,347
l do hope l shall be all right.
ln my early days with Ronny's father,

604
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:44,809
l made rather a fool of myself
in the chamber of horrors.

605
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:47,395
Horrors? What horrors?

606
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,689
The waxwork museum.

607
01:14:49,814 --> 01:14:53,901
He was a very conventional young man,
which made it all rather worse.

608
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:57,196
- This was not Stella's father?
- No, no.

609
01:14:57,905 --> 01:15:00,241
He was very unconventional.

610
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:04,287
My goodness me...

611
01:15:05,455 --> 01:15:07,457
Sahib, sahib.

612
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,878
Hassan! Selim!

613
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:28,705
Shh. Shh.

614
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,606
Kawa Dol.

615
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:31,142
Mrs Moore!

616
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:36,731
Please, please.

617
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:32,787
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes.

618
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:35,373
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

619
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:40,128
Godbole never mentioned the echo.

620
01:18:41,003 --> 01:18:44,215
No. And far too many people.

621
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:49,011
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, thank you.

622
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:57,228
l suppose, like many old people,

623
01:18:57,353 --> 01:19:01,649
l sometimes think
we are merely passing figures

624
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:06,446
in a godless universe.

625
01:19:07,113 --> 01:19:09,157
Get me some water.

626
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:12,285
Oh.

627
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:18,082
- There you are.
- Thank you, my dear.

628
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:23,171
l didn't know you'd gone. Now, now.

629
01:19:25,173 --> 01:19:29,260
We should be thinking of moving on
before the sun gets too high.

630
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,014
Do forgive me, Dr Aziz.

631
01:19:33,139 --> 01:19:36,309
l'm rather tired, so l think l'll stay here.

632
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:41,022
l've never been a good walker, and you
two will get on much better without me.

633
01:19:41,147 --> 01:19:43,983
Dear Mrs Moore, nothing to forgive.

634
01:19:44,108 --> 01:19:46,861
You're right. lt is quite a big climb.

635
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:49,906
And l'm glad you're not coming,

636
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:53,826
because you're treating me
with true frankness, as a friend.

637
01:19:54,786 --> 01:19:56,871
l am your friend.

638
01:19:56,996 --> 01:20:00,124
- So may l make a suggestion?
- Of course.

639
01:20:00,249 --> 01:20:04,879
Don't take quite so many people with you
this time. You'll find it more convenient.

640
01:20:05,004 --> 01:20:08,925
- lt does get rather crowded.
- Exactly, exactly.

641
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,302
We shall take just the guide. Right?

642
01:20:11,469 --> 01:20:15,264
Quite right. And enjoy yourselves.

643
01:21:07,025 --> 01:21:09,485
lt's almost a mirage.

644
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:18,453
Dr Aziz,

645
01:21:18,578 --> 01:21:21,039
may l ask you something
rather personal?

646
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:28,212
- You were married, weren't you?
- Yes, indeed.

647
01:21:32,383 --> 01:21:35,887
Did you love your wife
when you married her?

648
01:21:36,012 --> 01:21:39,974
We never set eyes on each other
until the day we were married.

649
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:42,643
lt was all arranged by our families.

650
01:21:42,769 --> 01:21:45,605
l only saw her face in a photograph.

651
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:50,693
What about love?

652
01:21:52,653 --> 01:21:54,697
We were a man and a woman.

653
01:21:55,656 --> 01:21:58,159
And we were young.

654
01:23:01,931 --> 01:23:03,975
Dr Aziz,

655
01:23:04,934 --> 01:23:07,770
did you have more than one wife?

656
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:10,982
One. One, in my case.

657
01:23:21,284 --> 01:23:23,745
l'll be back in a moment.

658
01:25:17,608 --> 01:25:20,737
<i>- Miss Quested!</i>

659
01:25:43,092 --> 01:25:45,386
Miss Quested!

660
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:02,028
Miss Quested?

661
01:26:10,578 --> 01:26:12,622
Miss Quested?

662
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:36,854
- What's happened?
- Elephant taking bath, memsahib.

663
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:39,023
Something else.

664
01:27:08,678 --> 01:27:10,722
Miss Quested!

665
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,684
Miss Quested!

666
01:27:16,602 --> 01:27:18,646
Miss Quested!

667
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:30,491
Miss Quested?

668
01:27:33,953 --> 01:27:35,997
Fool!

669
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:04,043
- Morning, Mrs Moore.
- Mr Fielding.

670
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:07,839
So sorry about this morning.
Everything going well?

671
01:29:08,256 --> 01:29:11,634
Have you seen Miss Quested and Dr Aziz?

672
01:29:11,843 --> 01:29:16,139
No. l've just walked up from the road.
l'm dying for a drink.

673
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,307
Be with you in a moment.

674
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:26,107
Good Lord!

675
01:29:32,989 --> 01:29:36,743
Oh, Mr Fielding, l'm so glad you're here.

676
01:29:36,868 --> 01:29:40,079
Oh, l was coming over to you.
Nothing wrong?

677
01:29:40,204 --> 01:29:45,460
Not exactly. But they went off with
the guide an hour ago - more, in fact -

678
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:47,086
and somehow...

679
01:29:47,211 --> 01:29:50,381
l don't know this place,
but l'm sure they'll be back soon.

680
01:29:50,506 --> 01:29:53,176
Fielding! Fielding!

681
01:29:58,222 --> 01:30:02,769
Fielding. Fielding, l've so wanted you.

682
01:30:02,894 --> 01:30:05,480
- Where is Miss Quested?
- What is it?

683
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:07,940
She went down the road.

684
01:30:08,066 --> 01:30:10,193
l think she met Mrs Callendar.

685
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:12,779
- lt looked like her car.
- Of course it was her car.

686
01:30:12,904 --> 01:30:14,989
- She drove me here.
- Oh.

687
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,993
Why did Miss Quested
go off with Mrs Callendar?

688
01:30:20,203 --> 01:30:21,496
l don't know.

689
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:25,083
But, Dr Aziz, when did you part with her?

690
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,335
l don't understand.

691
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:31,839
Nor do l. l went round the corner
to have a cigarette...

692
01:30:31,964 --> 01:30:33,549
And?

693
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,761
Then the guide couldn't recall
which cave she'd gone into.

694
01:30:36,886 --> 01:30:40,556
So l looked in all the caves,
and when l came out of...

695
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:45,395
l think it was the third cave,
l... l saw these.

696
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:52,235
And then - l think it was then -
l heard the car.

697
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,613
So l ran over to the edge
and l saw Miss Quested getting in.

698
01:30:55,738 --> 01:30:59,158
And... and then she drove away
with Mrs Callendar.

699
01:31:00,618 --> 01:31:02,662
That's all.

700
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,124
And these.

701
01:31:09,168 --> 01:31:11,421
l think we'd all better go back.

702
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:15,633
Oh, Mrs Moore...

703
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:18,219
Our great day is in tatters.

704
01:31:20,263 --> 01:31:22,306
l will never forgive myself.

705
01:31:22,432 --> 01:31:24,475
Hassan!

706
01:31:25,601 --> 01:31:27,645
Selim!

707
01:31:29,397 --> 01:31:33,067
Aziz is an innocent.
Something else must have happened.

708
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:35,695
Of course something else happened.

709
01:31:37,447 --> 01:31:40,074
This is a dangerous place
for new arrivals.

710
01:31:51,627 --> 01:31:55,214
Now lie back, dear.
Do your best to relax.

711
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:15,902
You'll be better very soon now.

712
01:32:29,165 --> 01:32:34,879
After we've seen off Mrs Moore, l'm going
to take you back for a good stiff drink.

713
01:32:35,004 --> 01:32:39,175
Here we are.
Good Lord, quite a crowd.

714
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:02,573
Dr Aziz, it is my painful duty to arrest you.

715
01:33:02,699 --> 01:33:06,911
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Sir, l am instructed not to say.

716
01:33:07,036 --> 01:33:09,163
Produce your warrant.

717
01:33:09,288 --> 01:33:13,960
Sir, excuse me. No warrant is required
under these particular circumstances.

718
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:18,548
- Please refer to Superintendent McBryde.
- We certainly will.

719
01:33:18,673 --> 01:33:21,884
Come along, old chap.
Some ridiculous mistake.

720
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:26,556
Dr Aziz, will you please come?
A closed conveyance is in the yard.

721
01:33:31,018 --> 01:33:34,647
For God's sake!
Never, never act the criminal.

722
01:33:34,772 --> 01:33:38,192
McBryde's a decent fellow.
We'll see him together.

723
01:33:38,317 --> 01:33:41,362
But my children, my name...

724
01:33:41,487 --> 01:33:43,865
Nothing of the sort.
We're coming, Mr Haq.

725
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,452
- What is it?
- Come. l've got a car waiting outside.

726
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,832
That's Mr Fielding's
and Dr Aziz's compartment.

727
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:56,627
- l'll explain outside.
- l can't leave without speaking to them.

728
01:33:56,753 --> 01:34:01,716
Please come along, Mother.
l know what l'm doing. Make way, please!

729
01:34:05,928 --> 01:34:08,473
Come on.

730
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:11,267
Take my arm. l'll see you through.

731
01:34:25,281 --> 01:34:27,367
Fielding!

732
01:34:28,117 --> 01:34:30,578
Fielding, l want a word with you.

733
01:34:33,831 --> 01:34:36,459
Please... Please don't leave me.

734
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:40,797
l have to go. l'll be with you
as soon as l possibly can.

735
01:35:04,237 --> 01:35:06,823
- Please, Mother, come along.
- l will not!

736
01:35:10,076 --> 01:35:12,829
Something very terrible is happening.

737
01:35:27,343 --> 01:35:31,597
- Absolutely impossible. Grotesque.
- l'm afraid not.

738
01:35:31,723 --> 01:35:34,016
But who brings this infamous charge?

739
01:35:34,142 --> 01:35:38,604
Mrs Callendar, who witnessed
the poor girl's flight down the ravine,

740
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:41,983
and the victim herself.

741
01:35:42,108 --> 01:35:45,153
Miss Quested accuses
Dr Aziz of attempted rape?

742
01:35:45,278 --> 01:35:47,321
- Yes.
- Then she's mad.

743
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:51,367
- l cannot pass that remark.
- l'm sorry, sir.

744
01:35:52,869 --> 01:35:56,372
But the charge must rest on
some dreadful misunderstanding.

745
01:35:56,497 --> 01:36:01,294
- Five minutes will clear it up.
- lt does rest on a misunderstanding.

746
01:36:01,419 --> 01:36:05,882
l've had 25 years' experience here. l have
never known anything but disaster result

747
01:36:06,007 --> 01:36:10,303
when English and lndians
attempt to be intimate.

748
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:54,389
Oh, l hate these damned festivals.
l'll be glad when it's over.

749
01:36:54,514 --> 01:36:58,351
Always have a feeling
they might go over the top.

750
01:36:58,476 --> 01:37:00,853
You have a visitor.

751
01:37:07,694 --> 01:37:10,238
l think l'll be off. See you tonight.

752
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:15,535
She hit him with these.

753
01:37:17,704 --> 01:37:19,831
That's how she escaped.

754
01:37:19,956 --> 01:37:23,668
lf he had assaulted her, he'd scarcely
bring the evidence back with him.

755
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:26,671
- Doesn't surprise me.
- l don't follow.

756
01:37:28,381 --> 01:37:30,967
When you think of crime,
you think of English crime.

757
01:37:31,092 --> 01:37:35,596
The psychology's different here.
And particularly in regard to women.

758
01:37:35,722 --> 01:37:38,141
l've been going through his wallet.

759
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,439
Here's a letter from a friend
who apparently keeps a brothel.

760
01:37:44,564 --> 01:37:47,316
l don't want to hear his private letters.

761
01:37:47,442 --> 01:37:50,486
lt'll have to be quoted in court
as bearing on his morals.

762
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:54,032
Our respectable young doctor
was fixing up to see tarts in Calcutta.

763
01:37:54,157 --> 01:37:55,783
Oh, come on.

764
01:37:55,908 --> 01:37:59,954
You may have the right to throw stones
for that sort of thing, but l haven't.

765
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:11,049
- Tell them to wait.
- Sir.

766
01:38:11,174 --> 01:38:13,217
Aye, it starts already.

767
01:38:13,342 --> 01:38:18,598
Vakil Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali,
legal advisors to the prisoner.

768
01:38:18,723 --> 01:38:20,516
Where is Miss Quested now?

769
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:23,561
Staying with the Callendars
until she's out of danger.

770
01:38:23,686 --> 01:38:26,522
- What danger?
- She has a fever.

771
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:32,028
But worse, hundreds of cactus spines
are embedded in her arms and legs.

772
01:38:32,403 --> 01:38:35,823
There's a danger of them
entering the bloodstream.

773
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:36,949
Yes.

774
01:38:37,075 --> 01:38:40,578
Her scramble down that ravine
was so precipitate

775
01:38:40,703 --> 01:38:44,707
it started a small avalanche of stones
which stopped Mrs Callendar's car.

776
01:38:44,832 --> 01:38:50,088
She hooted, thinking work was
going on above, and then she saw her.

777
01:38:50,213 --> 01:38:53,966
She had got among some cactuses
and was beginning to panic.

778
01:38:58,012 --> 01:39:01,391
l suppose there's no possibility
of my seeing Miss Quested?

779
01:39:01,516 --> 01:39:03,559
She's in no state to see anyone.

780
01:39:03,685 --> 01:39:07,355
Callendar's sedated her and proposes
to keep her like that for days.

781
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:12,276
- He's worried about shock.
- l see. But afterwards?

782
01:39:12,402 --> 01:39:14,946
Why on earth do you want to see her?

783
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:21,411
l want to ask her if she's certain,
dead certain, that it was Aziz.

784
01:39:21,744 --> 01:39:23,996
Callendar could ask her that.

785
01:39:24,122 --> 01:39:27,458
l want someone who
believes in him to ask her.

786
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:30,336
What difference would that make?

787
01:39:30,461 --> 01:39:34,090
She is surrounded by people
who don't trust lndians.

788
01:39:35,466 --> 01:39:39,846
Look, l don't want to be an alarmist,

789
01:39:39,971 --> 01:39:44,267
but, in my opinion, the situation will
become very nasty in the next few weeks.

790
01:39:44,392 --> 01:39:46,436
l would think so.

791
01:39:47,437 --> 01:39:49,689
May l see Aziz?

792
01:39:49,814 --> 01:39:52,025
Only on a magistrate's order.

793
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:55,778
- To whom do l apply?
- The city magistrate.

794
01:39:59,657 --> 01:40:02,160
Nothing else excepting clothes, sir.

795
01:40:02,285 --> 01:40:04,537
But these were under the bed.

796
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:12,211
- Very useful, Haq.
- Thank you, sir.

797
01:40:12,336 --> 01:40:14,797
And there is also that.

798
01:40:22,138 --> 01:40:24,640
- That's his wife.
- How do you know that?

799
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,977
He showed me that photograph.

800
01:40:28,102 --> 01:40:30,146
She's dead.

801
01:40:31,773 --> 01:40:35,568
l see. Well, l must press on
with the report.

802
01:40:37,236 --> 01:40:41,866
l hope to see you at the club on Saturday.
l believe Turton wants us all there.

803
01:40:55,254 --> 01:40:58,007
You are very good to greet us
in this public fashion.

804
01:40:58,132 --> 01:40:59,550
For goodness sake.

805
01:40:59,675 --> 01:41:02,095
Did Mr McBryde say anything
when my card came in?

806
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:04,013
- No.
- l'm wanting bail.

807
01:41:04,138 --> 01:41:07,350
- Did my application annoy him?
- He wasn't annoyed.

808
01:41:07,475 --> 01:41:11,270
- And if he was, what does it matter?
- l might prejudice him against Aziz.

809
01:41:11,396 --> 01:41:14,524
Nonsense.
This is no way to be thinking.

810
01:41:14,649 --> 01:41:18,027
Aziz is innocent, and everything
we do must be based on that.

811
01:41:18,152 --> 01:41:21,739
Mr Fielding, are you on our side
against your own people?

812
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:26,786
lt would seem so.
l think we'd better go somewhere else.

813
01:41:33,126 --> 01:41:37,130
- Who should be counsel for defence?
- You, surely.

814
01:41:37,922 --> 01:41:42,552
We need someone from a distance,
someone who cannot be intimidated.

815
01:41:42,677 --> 01:41:47,390
- Have you heard of Amritrao?
- Amritrao? The Calcutta man?

816
01:41:47,515 --> 01:41:51,519
- A high reputation.
- Notoriously anti-British.

817
01:41:51,644 --> 01:41:54,397
- Freedom Movement.
- That worries me.

818
01:41:54,522 --> 01:41:57,358
Amritrao would be regarded
as a political challenge.

819
01:41:57,483 --> 01:42:01,112
When l saw my friend's
private papers carried in just now,

820
01:42:01,237 --> 01:42:03,364
in the arms of that police inspector,

821
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:06,200
l said to myself
''Amritrao is the man to clear this up.''

822
01:42:06,325 --> 01:42:09,245
Let's not go too fast. We're bound to win.

823
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:13,332
She'll never be able
to substantiate the charges.

824
01:42:19,797 --> 01:42:24,385
<i>She's been complaining
about an echo in her head.</i>

825
01:42:29,766 --> 01:42:31,809
l don't suppose she ever will.

826
01:42:35,605 --> 01:42:38,066
Back in a moment.

827
01:42:43,613 --> 01:42:48,201
- Mother, that was unkind.
- Unkind? Unkind?

828
01:42:48,326 --> 01:42:51,746
What about poor Dr Aziz
and those terrible police?

829
01:42:51,871 --> 01:42:55,249
- Mother, quiet, please.
- l won't be quiet.

830
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:58,044
Aziz is certainly innocent.

831
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:03,800
- You don't know that.
- l know about people's characters.

832
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:06,135
lt's not the sort of thing he would do.

833
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:10,973
Whatever you think, the case has got
to come before a magistrate now.

834
01:43:11,099 --> 01:43:14,018
The machinery has started.

835
01:43:14,143 --> 01:43:17,689
Yes. She has started the machinery.

836
01:43:19,107 --> 01:43:21,150
lt will work to its end.

837
01:43:30,576 --> 01:43:33,413
- Ah, Godbole.
- l see you are in a hurry.

838
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:35,998
l must get out of these things
and go back to town.

839
01:43:36,124 --> 01:43:38,251
May l speak to you just for a moment?

840
01:43:38,376 --> 01:43:41,629
Er, yes. Come in,
if you don't mind me changing.

841
01:43:47,635 --> 01:43:50,680
l wanted to apologise for this morning.

842
01:43:50,805 --> 01:43:52,849
Oh, it's all right.

843
01:43:54,267 --> 01:43:56,811
l hope the expedition was successful.

844
01:43:56,936 --> 01:43:59,605
- The news hasn't reached you then?
- Oh, yes.

845
01:43:59,731 --> 01:44:02,692
No. A dreadful thing has happened.
Aziz has been arrested.

846
01:44:02,817 --> 01:44:06,362
Oh, yes. That is all round the college.

847
01:44:06,487 --> 01:44:11,117
An expedition where that occurs
can hardly be called successful.

848
01:44:11,242 --> 01:44:14,537
- l cannot say. l was not there.
- No.

849
01:44:14,662 --> 01:44:17,331
l must not detain you,

850
01:44:17,457 --> 01:44:22,920
but l have a private difficulty
on which l require your help.

851
01:44:23,629 --> 01:44:27,050
l'm leaving your service shortly,
as you know.

852
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:31,929
l'm returning to the place of my childhood
to take charge of education there.

853
01:44:32,055 --> 01:44:36,684
l want to start a school that will be
as much like this as possible.

854
01:44:36,984 --> 01:44:40,988
- The point on which l desire advice is,

855
01:44:41,113 --> 01:44:44,200
what name should be given to the school?

856
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:48,996
- A name for the school?
- A suitable title.

857
01:44:51,081 --> 01:44:54,001
Godbole, have you grasped
that Aziz is in prison?

858
01:44:54,126 --> 01:45:00,174
Yes. l only meant that when you're less
worried you might think the matter over.

859
01:45:00,299 --> 01:45:04,053
l had thought, with your permission,

860
01:45:04,178 --> 01:45:06,722
of the Richard Fielding High School.

861
01:45:07,765 --> 01:45:10,976
But, failing that,
the King Emperor George V.

862
01:45:12,102 --> 01:45:17,274
Godbole, let me ask you something. l was
under the impression that you liked Aziz.

863
01:45:17,399 --> 01:45:20,736
- Most certainly.
- Then how can you be so indifferent?

864
01:45:20,861 --> 01:45:25,616
- Don't you care what happens to him?
- lt is of no consequence if l care or not.

865
01:45:25,741 --> 01:45:28,077
The outcome is already decided.

866
01:45:28,202 --> 01:45:30,913
- Destiny, karma.
- Just so.

867
01:45:31,038 --> 01:45:36,168
Mr Fielding, we are all part of
a pattern we cannot perceive.

868
01:45:36,293 --> 01:45:39,922
Why did Mrs Moore bring
Miss Quested to Chandrapore?

869
01:45:40,047 --> 01:45:42,216
To marry the city magistrate.

870
01:45:42,341 --> 01:45:44,593
Yes...

871
01:45:44,718 --> 01:45:48,055
Or to go to the Marabar with Dr Aziz.

872
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:52,768
- Or perhaps to meet you.
- Very beguiling.

873
01:45:52,893 --> 01:45:56,146
But at this moment my only interest
is to do something for Aziz.

874
01:45:56,272 --> 01:45:59,400
Excuse me, but nothing you do
will change the outcome.

875
01:45:59,817 --> 01:46:02,153
So do nothing.
ls that your philosophy?

876
01:46:02,278 --> 01:46:05,197
My philosophy is
you can do what you like,

877
01:46:05,322 --> 01:46:08,534
but the outcome will be the same.

878
01:46:32,683 --> 01:46:34,518
Did you get bail?

879
01:46:34,643 --> 01:46:37,730
They're afraid your presence
might incite further trouble.

880
01:46:37,855 --> 01:46:39,899
Even riots.

881
01:46:43,861 --> 01:46:46,739
<i>We've received
a telegram from Calcutta.</i>

882
01:46:46,864 --> 01:46:50,743
- From Calcutta?
- Amritrao is going to defend you.

883
01:46:51,744 --> 01:46:53,829
Amritrao?

884
01:46:53,954 --> 01:46:56,373
Read, read.

885
01:47:00,794 --> 01:47:05,925
- What is ''disbursement''?
- Fee. He will not accept a fee.

886
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,792
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

887
01:47:42,461 --> 01:47:44,672
There's not the least cause for alarm.

888
01:47:44,797 --> 01:47:47,842
l want everything to go on
precisely as usual.

889
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:51,470
So don't start carrying arms about.

890
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:53,931
Ladies, don't go out
any more than you can help,

891
01:47:54,056 --> 01:47:56,100
and don't talk before your servants.

892
01:47:56,225 --> 01:48:00,855
Remember, one isolated
lndian has attempted...

893
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:03,732
has been charged with
an attempted crime.

894
01:48:03,858 --> 01:48:06,569
And he will be brought to trial.

895
01:48:07,945 --> 01:48:10,489
Those drums are merely
the festival, of course.

896
01:48:10,614 --> 01:48:16,036
Yes, indeed. And no doubt they'll be
banging away throughout the night.

897
01:48:16,704 --> 01:48:19,456
Apologies, Collector Sahib, everyone.

898
01:48:19,582 --> 01:48:22,960
Heaslop's just behind me and
l want to say a word before he comes in.

899
01:48:23,085 --> 01:48:27,131
- Of course.
- He needs all our support.

900
01:48:27,256 --> 01:48:30,134
He blames himself
for allowing such an expedition,

901
01:48:30,259 --> 01:48:33,053
as indeed do l for giving the wretch leave.

902
01:48:33,179 --> 01:48:36,932
And then there's his mother.
lt's been a most unsettling experience.

903
01:48:37,057 --> 01:48:40,144
The good news is that the victim
is greatly improved and...

904
01:48:40,269 --> 01:48:44,565
Ah, Heaslop, come along in.
Good to have you with us.

905
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:46,942
For goodness sake, do sit down, please.

906
01:48:47,067 --> 01:48:49,278
Up here, Ronny.
Come and join us up here.

907
01:48:49,403 --> 01:48:52,698
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

908
01:48:52,823 --> 01:48:57,244
<i>- Please, do sit down.
- Some of us never got up.</i>

909
01:48:57,369 --> 01:49:00,456
We were delighted to hear
the major's report on Miss Quested.

910
01:49:00,581 --> 01:49:03,959
Thank you, sir. l didn't mean to
interrupt the meeting in this way.

911
01:49:04,084 --> 01:49:08,422
Not at all. l was saying
before you arrived that you'd refused bail.

912
01:49:09,632 --> 01:49:12,343
l was about to add

913
01:49:12,468 --> 01:49:15,513
that there's a certain member
here present

914
01:49:15,638 --> 01:49:19,683
who's known to be in contact
with the prisoner's defence.

915
01:49:19,808 --> 01:49:24,730
l'd like to say one can't run with the hare
and hunt with the hounds.

916
01:49:24,855 --> 01:49:27,441
At least, not in this country.

917
01:49:30,152 --> 01:49:34,156
- l would like to say something, sir.
- Please do.

918
01:49:35,074 --> 01:49:37,701
l believe Dr Aziz is innocent.

919
01:49:37,827 --> 01:49:40,621
l shall await the verdict of the court.

920
01:49:40,746 --> 01:49:46,085
lf he is found guilty, l shall resign
from the college and leave lndia.

921
01:49:46,210 --> 01:49:48,712
l resign from the club now.

922
01:50:04,186 --> 01:50:06,939
She's old. You mustn't forget that.

923
01:50:07,815 --> 01:50:11,694
Old people never take things
as one expects.

924
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:15,531
They can cause a great deal of trouble.

925
01:50:35,134 --> 01:50:39,430
- Are you all right, Mother?
- Just... just having a little rest.

926
01:50:40,097 --> 01:50:43,601
- lt's very hot.
- Yes, it is.

927
01:50:43,726 --> 01:50:47,730
l do wish l could persuade you not to
undertake this journey at this time of year.

928
01:50:47,855 --> 01:50:52,234
At least stay until the monsoon.
lt's very close now.

929
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:56,280
So much to do, so little time to do it.

930
01:50:56,906 --> 01:50:59,700
To do what, Mother?

931
01:50:59,825 --> 01:51:02,953
Settle things up. See Stella.

932
01:51:04,747 --> 01:51:11,962
Get away from all this muddle and fuss
into some cave of my own, some shelf.

933
01:51:12,087 --> 01:51:15,299
Quite so. But meanwhile
the trial is coming on.

934
01:51:17,218 --> 01:51:20,054
l don't want to have anything to do with it.

935
01:51:20,179 --> 01:51:22,598
But you are an important witness.

936
01:51:22,723 --> 01:51:26,769
You dropped off after the first cave
and let Adela go on with him alone.

937
01:51:26,894 --> 01:51:29,355
No one blames you, Mother.

938
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:33,400
He stage-managed the whole thing
by frightening you with that echo.

939
01:51:33,526 --> 01:51:35,903
Mumbo jumbo, but very effective.

940
01:51:36,028 --> 01:51:38,697
You'll never understand
the nature of that place,

941
01:51:38,823 --> 01:51:42,076
nor will anyone else
in that ridiculous court of yours.

942
01:51:42,201 --> 01:51:45,871
- l don't wish to discuss it further.
- Very well, Mother.

943
01:51:45,996 --> 01:51:49,458
Will you at least stay for our marriage?

944
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:53,546
- You are getting married?
- Of course. Why do you ask?

945
01:51:53,671 --> 01:51:55,798
l wondered.

946
01:51:55,923 --> 01:51:58,717
All this rubbish about love.

947
01:51:58,843 --> 01:52:03,931
Love in a church, love in a cave,
as if there were the least difference.

948
01:52:04,056 --> 01:52:08,394
And l held up from my business
over such trifles.

949
01:52:08,519 --> 01:52:10,563
l don't understand you.

950
01:52:10,688 --> 01:52:14,692
l've never understood you
any more than you've understood me.

951
01:52:17,069 --> 01:52:19,530
But what of Adela?

952
01:52:21,115 --> 01:52:24,743
l like Adela. She has character.

953
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:27,329
Then don't you want to help her?

954
01:52:28,497 --> 01:52:32,042
Nothing l can say or do
will make the least difference.

955
01:52:33,085 --> 01:52:37,089
lf that is really how you feel,
Mother, then you must go.

956
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,604
Goodbye.

957
01:54:09,181 --> 01:54:13,519
You mustn't upset yourself, my dear.
The verdict's a foregone conclusion.

958
01:54:13,644 --> 01:54:16,480
lt isn't that. l'm all right really.

959
01:54:16,605 --> 01:54:19,316
You almost certainly
won't be called till tomorrow.

960
01:54:19,441 --> 01:54:21,902
McBryde will take up
most of the morning.

961
01:54:22,027 --> 01:54:26,949
Then there's Amritrao, who'll be up to his
tricks and playing to the lndian gallery.

962
01:55:46,153 --> 01:55:48,280
Come along, dear. We're there.

963
01:57:25,461 --> 01:57:27,505
What are you doing here?

964
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:31,467
l'm an interested party, Mrs Turton.
l've handed over to my deputy.

965
01:57:31,592 --> 01:57:35,763
<i>- And who is your deputy?</i>

966
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:49,151
Das is a good man, Mrs Turton.

967
01:57:57,284 --> 01:57:59,537
Thank you, sir.

968
01:57:59,662 --> 01:58:05,292
On April 3rd of this year,
Miss Quested and her friend, Mrs Moore,

969
01:58:05,417 --> 01:58:10,798
were invited to a tea party at the house
of the principal of Government College.

970
01:58:10,923 --> 01:58:16,887
lt was here that the prisoner first met Miss
Quested, a young girl fresh from England.

971
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:23,352
Until then, the prisoner had never been
in such close proximity to an English girl.

972
01:58:23,477 --> 01:58:26,272
ln consideration of the ladies present,

973
01:58:26,397 --> 01:58:31,861
l will merely allude you to the fact that the
prisoner is a widower, now living alone.

974
01:58:31,986 --> 01:58:37,324
And in the course of our evidence,
l'll be providing proof of his state of mind.

975
01:58:38,325 --> 01:58:41,036
Before taking you through
the history of this crime,

976
01:58:41,162 --> 01:58:44,915
l want to state what l believe
to be a universal truth.

977
01:58:46,167 --> 01:58:50,754
The darker races
are attracted to the fairer.

978
01:58:52,173 --> 01:58:54,425
But not vice versa.

979
01:58:55,551 --> 01:58:59,722
Even when the lady
is less attractive than the gentleman?

980
01:58:59,847 --> 01:59:04,226
- Order! Order!

981
01:59:04,894 --> 01:59:08,564
Order! Order!

982
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:37,403
l must warn members of the public
and certain members of the defence

983
02:00:37,528 --> 02:00:43,242
that the insulting behaviour
which marred yesterday's proceedings

984
02:00:43,367 --> 02:00:45,828
will not be tolerated.

985
02:00:45,953 --> 02:00:48,873
Well said, Das. Quite right.

986
02:00:49,623 --> 02:00:52,042
- Mr McBryde.
- Thank you.

987
02:00:53,002 --> 02:00:55,671
l shall begin by reminding you
of my contention

988
02:00:55,796 --> 02:00:59,675
that prisoner proposed the expedition
with a premeditated intention

989
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:03,304
of making advances to Miss Quested.

990
02:01:03,429 --> 02:01:07,016
l've made it my business to visit
the Marabar during the last few days.

991
02:01:07,141 --> 02:01:09,935
lt's an inaccessible, barren place,

992
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:14,356
entailing, as you have heard, considerable
planning and expense to get there.

993
02:01:14,482 --> 02:01:19,653
The caves themselves are dark,
featureless, and without interest,

994
02:01:19,778 --> 02:01:21,822
except for a strange echo.

995
02:01:23,157 --> 02:01:26,785
A curious place
for such an elaborate picnic.

996
02:01:26,911 --> 02:01:30,414
The servants were all supplied
by prisoner's lndian friends,

997
02:01:30,539 --> 02:01:33,751
with one exception
of the witness, Antony.

998
02:01:33,876 --> 02:01:40,591
Antony had received explicit instructions
from Mr Heaslop to stay with the ladies.

999
02:01:40,716 --> 02:01:42,760
Yet he remained behind.

1000
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:48,015
Yesterday you heard him admit that he
had accepted money from the prisoner

1001
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,519
minutes before the departure of the train.

1002
02:01:51,644 --> 02:01:54,438
And that brought us to Mr Fielding.

1003
02:01:55,397 --> 02:01:58,818
We are asked to believe he was
prevented from catching the train

1004
02:01:58,943 --> 02:02:02,196
because another friend of the prisoner's,
Professor Godbole,

1005
02:02:02,321 --> 02:02:05,699
was saying his prayers.

1006
02:02:05,825 --> 02:02:11,038
Prayers. After a most unpleasant
altercation, l withdrew my hypothesis

1007
02:02:11,163 --> 02:02:15,334
that similar persuasion had contributed
towards this excess of religious zeal.

1008
02:02:15,459 --> 02:02:17,753
l object, sir.

1009
02:02:17,878 --> 02:02:22,466
Mr McBryde is quite blatantly using
this opportunity to repeat the slander.

1010
02:02:23,551 --> 02:02:25,553
- Objection sustained!
- Ha!

1011
02:02:29,139 --> 02:02:32,726
Order! Order!

1012
02:02:35,146 --> 02:02:37,189
Order!

1013
02:02:41,861 --> 02:02:46,323
Prisoner had yet to rid himself
of a third impediment.

1014
02:02:46,448 --> 02:02:48,492
The lady in question

1015
02:02:48,617 --> 02:02:52,955
suffered from what is known in medical
parlance as ''claustrophobia''.

1016
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:57,626
Prisoner achieved his objective
by entering a cave with Miss Quested,

1017
02:02:57,751 --> 02:03:00,296
leaving this elderly lady in the rear,

1018
02:03:00,421 --> 02:03:03,799
where she was crushed and crowded
by servants and villagers.

1019
02:03:03,924 --> 02:03:08,095
- Mrs Moore. He's speaking of Mrs Moore!
- Quiet.

1020
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:11,390
Are you accusing my client
of attempted murder as well as rape?

1021
02:03:11,515 --> 02:03:13,893
Who is this lady he's talking about?

1022
02:03:14,018 --> 02:03:16,854
The lady l met in the mosque. Mrs Moore.

1023
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:21,609
Mrs Moore? You speak of Mrs Moore?

1024
02:03:21,942 --> 02:03:24,028
l don't propose to call her.

1025
02:03:24,153 --> 02:03:27,156
You don't propose to call her
because you can't!

1026
02:03:27,281 --> 02:03:30,576
She was smuggled out of the country
because she was on our side.

1027
02:03:30,701 --> 02:03:33,829
- She'd have proved his innocence.
- You could have called her.

1028
02:03:33,954 --> 02:03:36,457
Neither side called her,
neither may quote her.

1029
02:03:36,582 --> 02:03:39,793
But she was kept from us!

1030
02:03:39,919 --> 02:03:45,049
This is English justice?
This is your British Raj?

1031
02:03:45,341 --> 02:03:48,219
Just give us back
Mrs Moore for five minutes.

1032
02:03:49,094 --> 02:03:55,059
lf the point is of any interest, my mother
should be reaching Aden at noon today.

1033
02:03:55,184 --> 02:03:58,354
- Banished by you!
- Please, please.

1034
02:03:58,854 --> 02:04:03,067
- This is no way to defend your case.
- l'm not defending a case.

1035
02:04:03,192 --> 02:04:06,737
And you are not trying one.
We are both slaves!

1036
02:04:07,196 --> 02:04:11,951
Mr Mahmoud Ali, unless you sit down,
l shall have to exercise my authority.

1037
02:04:12,076 --> 02:04:14,954
Do so! This trial is a farce!

1038
02:04:16,455 --> 02:04:19,166
l'm going! l ruin my career!

1039
02:04:19,291 --> 02:04:22,127
Mrs Moore! Where are you, Mrs Moore?

1040
02:04:22,294 --> 02:04:26,674
We want Mrs Moore!
Mrs Moore! Mrs Moore!

1041
02:04:26,799 --> 02:04:29,468
Order! Order!

1042
02:04:29,593 --> 02:04:31,720
Farewell, my friend.

1043
02:04:40,688 --> 02:04:43,357
They have taken Mrs Moore!

1044
02:04:46,235 --> 02:04:49,947
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1045
02:04:50,114 --> 02:04:53,284
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1046
02:04:53,534 --> 02:04:56,036
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1047
02:04:56,287 --> 02:04:59,081
<i>- Mrs Moore!</i>

1048
02:05:07,798 --> 02:05:09,842
lsn't it strange?

1049
02:05:10,843 --> 02:05:12,887
Rather wonderful.

1050
02:05:13,846 --> 02:05:17,474
<i>- l knew they'd try something like this.
- Quiet, please.</i>

1051
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,188
- Poor old Das.
- Quiet! Order!

1052
02:05:31,155 --> 02:05:33,449
l apologise for my colleague.

1053
02:05:33,574 --> 02:05:37,786
He's an intimate friend of our client,
and his feelings have carried him away.

1054
02:05:37,912 --> 02:05:40,623
Mr Mahmoud Ali
will have to apologise in person.

1055
02:05:40,748 --> 02:05:42,917
Exactly, sir, he must.

1056
02:05:43,042 --> 02:05:46,921
l must repeat that, as a witness,
Mrs Moore does not exist.

1057
02:05:47,713 --> 02:05:51,550
Neither you, Mr Amritrao,
nor Mr McBryde, you,

1058
02:05:51,675 --> 02:05:55,513
have any right to surmise
what that lady would have said.

1059
02:05:55,638 --> 02:06:00,017
She is not here and,
consequently, she can say nothing.

1060
02:06:02,019 --> 02:06:05,105
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

1061
02:06:05,231 --> 02:06:08,150
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer.

1062
02:06:09,151 --> 02:06:13,697
We therefore commit her body to the deep
to be turned into corruption.

1063
02:06:14,573 --> 02:06:17,326
Looking for the resurrection of the body,

1064
02:06:17,451 --> 02:06:20,329
when the sea shall give up her dead.

1065
02:06:29,547 --> 02:06:32,383
l heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me:

1066
02:06:32,508 --> 02:06:36,512
''Blessed are the dead,
which die in the Lord.''

1067
02:06:36,637 --> 02:06:38,514
<i>Mrs Moore!</i>

1068
02:06:38,931 --> 02:06:40,808
Mrs Moore!

1069
02:06:41,725 --> 02:06:44,854
<i>l now call upon Miss Quested.</i>

1070
02:07:50,085 --> 02:07:52,463
Place your hand on the book.

1071
02:07:56,258 --> 02:07:59,053
And nothing but the truth.

1072
02:07:59,845 --> 02:08:02,723
<i>Quiet, please. Silence!</i>

1073
02:08:06,268 --> 02:08:08,729
Now, Miss Quested...

1074
02:08:09,563 --> 02:08:14,276
l'd like to take you back to the moment
when you came out of that first cave

1075
02:08:14,401 --> 02:08:18,614
and found Mrs Moore
collapsed in her chair.

1076
02:08:18,739 --> 02:08:20,825
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

1077
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:23,577
Did she offer any explanation?

1078
02:08:24,745 --> 02:08:28,499
She said she was upset by the echo
and that she was tired.

1079
02:08:28,624 --> 02:08:34,255
Taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner
instructed the servants to remain behind,

1080
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:37,424
and took you off alone with the guide.

1081
02:08:38,884 --> 02:08:41,720
Yes. But it was
at Mrs Moore's suggestion.

1082
02:08:41,846 --> 02:08:43,889
l don't quite follow.

1083
02:08:44,014 --> 02:08:47,268
She'd been worried by the crowd
and the stuffiness.

1084
02:08:47,643 --> 02:08:52,064
And was concerned that you might be
subjected to the same ordeal.

1085
02:08:52,189 --> 02:08:56,652
No. She wanted us
to enjoy ourselves. She said so.

1086
02:08:57,403 --> 02:08:59,864
She likes Dr Aziz.

1087
02:09:01,407 --> 02:09:04,451
Yes, l think l understand the situation.

1088
02:09:04,577 --> 02:09:10,624
Yesterday, Mr Fielding said that
Mrs Moore was ''charmed'' by him.

1089
02:09:10,749 --> 02:09:14,128
lt was more than that. She liked him.

1090
02:09:14,253 --> 02:09:18,340
Nevertheless, you'd only met him on two
occasions before the day of the crime.

1091
02:09:18,465 --> 02:09:22,386
So it might possibly have been
a rather impetuous assessment.

1092
02:09:23,012 --> 02:09:25,764
Possibly. She's like that.

1093
02:09:27,433 --> 02:09:32,021
Miss Quested, you heard this morning the
slur cast on British justice by the defence.

1094
02:09:32,146 --> 02:09:36,650
lt is most important that you tell the court
the absolute truth of what took place.

1095
02:09:37,151 --> 02:09:41,447
- l was brought up to tell the truth.
- Of course.

1096
02:09:48,954 --> 02:09:51,040
l'm sorry.

1097
02:09:51,165 --> 02:09:53,209
That's quite all right.

1098
02:09:56,378 --> 02:10:04,386
Now, Miss Quested, you went off up
the slope with the prisoner and the guide.

1099
02:10:05,387 --> 02:10:07,598
Yes.

1100
02:10:07,723 --> 02:10:12,394
Take your time and cast your mind back.

1101
02:10:20,986 --> 02:10:22,780
Miss Quested?

1102
02:10:25,366 --> 02:10:29,787
Miss Quested,
we were going up the slope.

1103
02:10:29,912 --> 02:10:32,206
ls something wrong?

1104
02:10:33,374 --> 02:10:35,835
l think it may have partly been my fault.

1105
02:10:37,211 --> 02:10:41,173
- Why?
- We'd stopped to look out over the plain.

1106
02:10:42,508 --> 02:10:47,638
l could hardly see Chandrapore
except through Mr Heaslop's binoculars.

1107
02:10:48,764 --> 02:10:53,435
l asked Dr Aziz if he loved his wife
when he married her.

1108
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:57,398
l shouldn't have done that.

1109
02:10:57,523 --> 02:10:59,733
Then why did you do it?

1110
02:11:03,237 --> 02:11:05,906
l was thinking of my own marriage.

1111
02:11:06,031 --> 02:11:08,951
Mr Heaslop and l
had only just become engaged.

1112
02:11:09,994 --> 02:11:13,747
Seeing Chandrapore so far away,

1113
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:18,752
l realised l didn't love him.

1114
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:23,757
Quiet, please. Quiet.

1115
02:11:42,109 --> 02:11:46,822
Miss Quested, you and the prisoner
continued up to the caves?

1116
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:49,992
- Yes.
- Where was the guide?

1117
02:11:50,117 --> 02:11:52,453
- He'd gone on ahead.
- Sent on ahead?

1118
02:11:52,828 --> 02:11:55,706
No, he was waiting for us
further along the ledge.

1119
02:11:55,831 --> 02:12:00,669
But when you reached the caves, prisoner
left you and went to speak to the guide?

1120
02:12:00,794 --> 02:12:05,341
- l don't know if he spoke to him or not.
- But he went off in his direction.

1121
02:12:05,466 --> 02:12:07,343
Yes.

1122
02:12:07,468 --> 02:12:10,721
- And what did you do?
- l waited.

1123
02:12:13,015 --> 02:12:17,895
<i>You said just now
''I think it may have been partly my fault. ''</i>

1124
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:22,358
<i>- Why?
- I had asked him about love.</i>

1125
02:12:22,483 --> 02:12:25,694
<i>And had thereby introduced
a feeling of intimacy?</i>

1126
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:28,906
<i>That is what I meant.</i>

1127
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:33,410
Thank you.

1128
02:12:33,577 --> 02:12:35,830
Mr McBryde.

1129
02:12:39,959 --> 02:12:44,171
Please tell the court
exactly what happened.

1130
02:12:48,259 --> 02:12:50,970
l lit a match.

1131
02:12:58,769 --> 02:13:00,813
<i>Miss Quested!</i>

1132
02:13:02,982 --> 02:13:05,025
Miss Quested!

1133
02:13:24,295 --> 02:13:26,922
Miss Quested?

1134
02:13:29,133 --> 02:13:32,428
<i>- And the prisoner followed you?</i>

1135
02:13:35,139 --> 02:13:38,601
Miss Quested, the prisoner
followed you, didn't he?

1136
02:13:43,689 --> 02:13:47,485
Could l please have a minute
before l reply to that, Mr McBryde?

1137
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:49,653
Certainly.

1138
02:13:59,413 --> 02:14:01,457
l'm not...

1139
02:14:04,168 --> 02:14:08,047
l'm not quite sure.

1140
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,426
l beg your pardon?

1141
02:14:12,551 --> 02:14:15,846
You are in the cave,
and the prisoner followed you.

1142
02:14:22,686 --> 02:14:25,272
What do you mean, please?

1143
02:14:25,397 --> 02:14:27,900
- No.
- What is that? What are you saying?

1144
02:14:31,237 --> 02:14:34,949
- l'm afraid l've made a mistake.
- What nature of mistake?

1145
02:14:36,742 --> 02:14:41,539
Dr Aziz never followed me into the cave.

1146
02:14:43,374 --> 02:14:48,671
Now, let us go on. l will read you
the deposition which you signed.

1147
02:14:48,796 --> 02:14:51,006
<i>Mr McBryde, you cannot go on.</i>

1148
02:14:51,131 --> 02:14:55,177
l was speaking to the witness.
And the public will be silent!

1149
02:14:56,804 --> 02:14:59,557
Miss Quested,
address your remarks to me.

1150
02:14:59,682 --> 02:15:02,601
And remember - you speak on oath,
Miss Quested.

1151
02:15:03,727 --> 02:15:05,062
Dr Aziz...

1152
02:15:05,187 --> 02:15:07,773
l stop these proceedings
on medical grounds!

1153
02:15:07,898 --> 02:15:10,151
Quiet! Please, sit down!

1154
02:15:15,281 --> 02:15:18,200
You withdraw the accusation,
Miss Quested?

1155
02:15:18,325 --> 02:15:20,369
Answer me.

1156
02:15:20,494 --> 02:15:23,205
l withdraw everything.

1157
02:15:26,542 --> 02:15:29,086
Order! Order!

1158
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:38,262
The prisoner is released
without one stain on his character!

1159
02:15:46,228 --> 02:15:49,231
Dr Aziz is free!

1160
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:10,794
Are you mad?

1161
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:11,921
No.

1162
02:17:35,838 --> 02:17:39,049
<i>Dr Aziz! Dr Aziz!</i>

1163
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:01,197
Bitch.

1164
02:18:03,324 --> 02:18:05,534
We won!

1165
02:18:08,621 --> 02:18:11,332
What do you think you've been doing?

1166
02:18:21,842 --> 02:18:23,886
Miss Quested!

1167
02:18:28,849 --> 02:18:32,394
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.

1168
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,688
You can't wander about like this.

1169
02:18:34,814 --> 02:18:38,609
- Who did you come with?
- l shall walk.

1170
02:18:38,734 --> 02:18:41,904
What madness.
This could turn into a riot.

1171
02:18:43,405 --> 02:18:45,991
We'll find my carriage. lt's closed.

1172
02:18:58,838 --> 02:19:00,881
Richard!

1173
02:19:01,549 --> 02:19:03,592
Richard!

1174
02:19:07,012 --> 02:19:11,016
- l'm coming back.
- Stay with him, please.

1175
02:19:11,433 --> 02:19:14,436
l can't leave you here.
Anything could happen.

1176
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:34,123
- There we are.
- Congratulations, sir!

1177
02:19:34,248 --> 02:19:36,500
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1178
02:19:36,625 --> 02:19:39,211
Make way, please. Thank you.

1179
02:19:40,754 --> 02:19:44,175
- Where shall he take you?
- l don't know.

1180
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:46,343
What do you mean?

1181
02:19:48,679 --> 02:19:50,723
Get in.

1182
02:20:02,067 --> 02:20:04,361
That was Mr Fielding!

1183
02:20:04,487 --> 02:20:07,907
- And Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1184
02:20:17,208 --> 02:20:21,337
Why did you make such a charge
if you were going to withdraw it?

1185
02:20:24,673 --> 02:20:29,428
- l ought to feel grateful to you, l suppose.
- l don't expect gratitude.

1186
02:20:34,767 --> 02:20:37,228
Did you do it out of pity?

1187
02:20:40,439 --> 02:20:42,483
My echo's gone.

1188
02:20:43,526 --> 02:20:47,238
l call the noise in my head my echo.
l've had it since the cave.

1189
02:20:52,076 --> 02:20:55,704
Might the whole thing
have been an hallucination?

1190
02:20:58,833 --> 02:21:02,670
l have a hunch that
poor old McBryde exorcised you.

1191
02:21:03,796 --> 02:21:08,342
He took you back,
step by logical step, into that cave,

1192
02:21:08,467 --> 02:21:11,303
and you broke down quite suddenly.

1193
02:21:11,428 --> 02:21:14,765
- l thought you meant l'd seen a ghost.
- No, no.

1194
02:21:16,767 --> 02:21:21,438
- Mrs Moore believes in ghosts.
- Well, she's an old lady.

1195
02:21:21,564 --> 02:21:24,650
No, l only meant that
it's difficult, as we get older,

1196
02:21:24,775 --> 02:21:27,820
not to believe that the dead live again.

1197
02:21:29,572 --> 02:21:32,616
Because the dead don't live again.

1198
02:21:32,741 --> 02:21:34,785
l fear not.

1199
02:21:36,453 --> 02:21:38,497
So do l.

1200
02:21:41,625 --> 02:21:43,586
<i>Ranjit!</i>

1201
02:21:43,711 --> 02:21:47,173
He must have gone to the tamasha,
but l can make some tea.

1202
02:21:47,298 --> 02:21:49,341
Oh, forgive me a moment.

1203
02:21:59,685 --> 02:22:01,729
Oh, dear.

1204
02:22:22,583 --> 02:22:25,461
''Annie Blair, fellow passenger.''

1205
02:22:34,887 --> 02:22:37,348
l shall never see her again.

1206
02:23:05,334 --> 02:23:08,629
- Ah, Godbole.
- The boys said you were back.

1207
02:23:08,754 --> 02:23:09,630
Yes.

1208
02:23:09,755 --> 02:23:14,510
l'm leaving for Kashmir tomorrow
morning to take up my duties

1209
02:23:14,635 --> 02:23:16,929
as minister of education.

1210
02:23:17,054 --> 02:23:19,431
l came to say goodbye.

1211
02:23:20,141 --> 02:23:23,435
Yes? Er... come in.

1212
02:23:24,019 --> 02:23:26,063
Thank you. Thank you.

1213
02:23:27,606 --> 02:23:29,400
Miss Quested.

1214
02:23:30,943 --> 02:23:33,946
Please, l want to give you my address

1215
02:23:34,071 --> 02:23:36,782
and extend an open invitation
for you to visit me.

1216
02:23:36,907 --> 02:23:39,285
Have you seen the Himalayas,
Mr Fielding?

1217
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:41,537
No.

1218
02:23:44,999 --> 02:23:48,711
- Miss Quested has had some bad news.
- Oh, l am sorry.

1219
02:23:56,093 --> 02:23:59,597
- Mrs Moore.
- Yes.

1220
02:24:05,644 --> 02:24:08,564
- Addressed to you.
- Yes.

1221
02:24:09,732 --> 02:24:13,360
- Why did this lady send to you?
- l don't know.

1222
02:24:13,486 --> 02:24:15,821
Mr Fielding,
l would venture to remark...

1223
02:24:15,946 --> 02:24:21,327
Under the circumstances, l don't think
we should pursue the matter further.

1224
02:24:21,452 --> 02:24:24,455
l'm sorry, Godbole,
but Miss Quested is extremely upset.

1225
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:26,624
Of course, of course. Nevertheless...

1226
02:24:26,749 --> 02:24:30,044
l presumably came up
in a casual shipboard conversation.

1227
02:24:30,169 --> 02:24:34,089
No doubt Heaslop
will be hearing from the company.

1228
02:24:34,215 --> 02:24:37,676
- l see.
- l shan't tell Aziz until tomorrow.

1229
02:24:37,802 --> 02:24:41,847
Hamidullah's bound to be putting on
a celebration, and it'll only upset him.

1230
02:24:41,972 --> 02:24:44,725
Oh, and have you heard
about the damages?

1231
02:24:45,392 --> 02:24:51,482
- Damages?
- Amritrao is asking 20,000 rupees from...

1232
02:24:52,274 --> 02:24:54,902
20,000?

1233
02:24:55,027 --> 02:24:56,737
And costs.

1234
02:25:00,825 --> 02:25:04,870
Who could have foretold that Aziz
would be saved by his enemy?

1235
02:25:04,995 --> 02:25:07,039
What now, Mr Fielding?

1236
02:25:45,202 --> 02:25:47,246
- Aziz!
- Come in.

1237
02:25:52,001 --> 02:25:55,671
Well, what a wonderful day for you.

1238
02:25:56,672 --> 02:25:59,300
l am an lndian at last.

1239
02:26:03,929 --> 02:26:06,515
Where did you take her?

1240
02:26:07,683 --> 02:26:10,269
l took her back to the college.

1241
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:13,147
Why?

1242
02:26:13,272 --> 02:26:15,941
After this morning,
she'd nowhere else to go.

1243
02:26:16,066 --> 02:26:19,987
- No?
- Heaslop? The Turtons?

1244
02:26:20,821 --> 02:26:24,200
She had the entire British Raj
behind her pushing her on.

1245
02:26:24,325 --> 02:26:28,954
But when she saw she was wrong, she
stopped and sent it all to smithereens.

1246
02:26:29,079 --> 02:26:31,665
l wouldn't have had the courage.

1247
02:26:38,297 --> 02:26:40,341
Do you mind if l sit?

1248
02:26:41,217 --> 02:26:43,260
Please.

1249
02:26:48,557 --> 02:26:49,975
What will you do now?

1250
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:53,562
Hamidullah's giving me a victory party
with fireworks and music.

1251
02:26:53,687 --> 02:26:58,025
Good. But l meant later.
Now this dreadful business is over.

1252
02:26:58,359 --> 02:27:00,653
l shall look for another job.

1253
02:27:00,778 --> 02:27:06,534
Hundreds of miles from here
in an lndian state out of British lndia.

1254
02:27:07,743 --> 02:27:11,747
- And you?
- l shall go to England for a long leave.

1255
02:27:14,208 --> 02:27:17,670
Will you and she be going back
on the same boat?

1256
02:27:17,795 --> 02:27:22,716
No. l couldn't possibly get away
before the end of next term.

1257
02:27:22,842 --> 02:27:26,762
Miss Quested is going
as soon as she can get a passage.

1258
02:27:26,887 --> 02:27:28,931
l see.

1259
02:27:34,103 --> 02:27:36,313
- Look...
- l'm looking.

1260
02:27:37,356 --> 02:27:41,861
Godbole tells me that Amritrao
is asking 20,000 rupees damages.

1261
02:27:41,986 --> 02:27:43,863
And costs.

1262
02:27:43,988 --> 02:27:47,533
l'd hate to see her getting
the worst of both worlds. lt'll ruin her.

1263
02:27:47,658 --> 02:27:54,039
And me? Prison,
my private letters read out in court,

1264
02:27:54,832 --> 02:27:58,502
my wife's photograph taken to
the station to be fingered by McBryde,

1265
02:27:58,627 --> 02:28:01,672
all because a girl ''fresh from England''
got too much sun.

1266
02:28:01,797 --> 02:28:03,340
l know.

1267
02:28:03,465 --> 02:28:06,719
And l know what you're going to ask next.

1268
02:28:06,844 --> 02:28:13,893
You're going to ask me to let her off
paying 20,000 rupees, right?

1269
02:28:15,853 --> 02:28:21,150
Then, if l agree,
the English will be able to say

1270
02:28:21,275 --> 02:28:24,862
''Here is an lndian that almost
behaved like a gentleman.''

1271
02:28:24,987 --> 02:28:28,491
''But for the colour of his face,
we might even let him join the club.''

1272
02:28:28,616 --> 02:28:31,160
ls that why you came here to see me?

1273
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:35,706
Answer me.

1274
02:28:36,874 --> 02:28:39,877
ln the end, you English
always stick together.

1275
02:28:40,836 --> 02:28:44,173
l want to have nothing more
to do with any of you.

1276
02:28:44,298 --> 02:28:46,300
Any of you!

1277
02:28:46,926 --> 02:28:50,387
You can go back to the college
and tell her to keep the money.

1278
02:28:50,513 --> 02:28:54,391
Tell her to use it to buy herself
a husband! Tell her...

1279
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:24,880
Are you coming with me?

1280
02:29:25,005 --> 02:29:27,591
l don't think so.

1281
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:15,604
This is a great honour, Professor.

1282
02:32:15,729 --> 02:32:17,773
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

1283
02:32:22,778 --> 02:32:26,198
They arrive at the state guest house
this afternoon.

1284
02:32:27,657 --> 02:32:30,368
How long have you known
they were coming?

1285
02:32:30,494 --> 02:32:33,288
One month, possibly two.

1286
02:32:34,164 --> 02:32:37,250
- Why did you not tell me?
- One cannot tell anyone anything

1287
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:39,753
unless they are ready to hear it.

1288
02:32:39,878 --> 02:32:41,922
And what does that mean?

1289
02:32:42,047 --> 02:32:46,510
Mr Fielding wrote you letters from
London and Bombay. You tore them up.

1290
02:32:47,135 --> 02:32:50,263
- l did.
- That is my point.

1291
02:32:54,059 --> 02:32:57,687
''My dear Aziz,
l have some news for you.''

1292
02:32:57,813 --> 02:33:00,565
''l am going to marry
someone whom you know.''

1293
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:03,318
The end of a foolish experiment.

1294
02:33:03,443 --> 02:33:08,031
l have made a new life for myself
up here... away from the English.

1295
02:33:08,323 --> 02:33:11,701
l shall be going to
the guest house to greet them.

1296
02:33:11,827 --> 02:33:18,375
But my religious duties will be claiming
my full attention for the next three days.

1297
02:33:20,085 --> 02:33:22,629
He's come all this way to find you.

1298
02:33:24,172 --> 02:33:27,843
Can you not let bygones be bygones
and show them around?

1299
02:33:27,968 --> 02:33:31,054
l'm sorry, but l've had enough
of showing Miss Quested lndia.

1300
02:33:42,566 --> 02:33:44,609
Stop. Let's stop for a moment.

1301
02:34:41,458 --> 02:34:43,043
We must be getting on.

1302
02:35:56,116 --> 02:35:57,993
Houseboat, sahib.

1303
02:35:59,995 --> 02:36:02,038
Hello!

1304
02:36:03,331 --> 02:36:05,083
Aziz!

1305
02:36:24,644 --> 02:36:27,522
Well, here you are at last.

1306
02:36:27,647 --> 02:36:30,108
l've been looking for you everywhere.

1307
02:36:36,198 --> 02:36:38,033
Akbar! Jamila!

1308
02:36:40,952 --> 02:36:43,288
Your children?

1309
02:36:43,413 --> 02:36:45,624
Yes.

1310
02:36:45,749 --> 02:36:48,418
l suppose Godbole told you l was here.

1311
02:36:48,543 --> 02:36:52,881
The minister of education never tells
anyone anything unless he has to.

1312
02:36:53,006 --> 02:36:58,762
His only piece of information was that
the high school was destined not to be.

1313
02:36:58,887 --> 02:37:01,556
l was supposed to inspect it.

1314
02:37:01,681 --> 02:37:03,725
Anyhow, here l am.

1315
02:37:07,521 --> 02:37:10,816
l've been visiting schools
all over the country.

1316
02:37:10,941 --> 02:37:15,821
We called in at Chandrapore.
Your bungalow's been turned into a shop.

1317
02:37:16,822 --> 02:37:21,076
Turton's retired and
Callendar's been given the push.

1318
02:37:21,201 --> 02:37:24,079
And Hamidullah sends his salaams.

1319
02:37:24,454 --> 02:37:26,873
lt was he who told me
you'd moved up here.

1320
02:37:26,998 --> 02:37:29,584
So l wrote, care of Godbole.

1321
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:33,463
Why didn't you answer my letters?

1322
02:37:33,588 --> 02:37:36,716
You married my enemy,
stole my money.

1323
02:37:41,555 --> 02:37:44,641
Aziz, l'm going to surprise you.

1324
02:37:46,601 --> 02:37:50,439
- What do you mean?
- My wife is Mrs Moore's daughter.

1325
02:37:54,151 --> 02:37:57,154
- Stella?
- Stella.

1326
02:37:57,279 --> 02:37:59,740
Miss Quested introduced us.

1327
02:38:10,542 --> 02:38:12,586
What a blunder.

1328
02:38:14,171 --> 02:38:16,965
- Where is she?
- l left her at the guest house.

1329
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:20,552
You'll meet her tomorrow.
She mustn't do too much just now.

1330
02:38:23,513 --> 02:38:25,682
She is carrying your child?

1331
02:38:25,807 --> 02:38:27,851
Yes.

1332
02:38:28,643 --> 02:38:31,897
So after all,
your name will not die out.

1333
02:38:32,773 --> 02:38:34,816
That's right.

1334
02:38:38,653 --> 02:38:40,697
Mrs Moore.

1335
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:44,501
Mrs Moore!

1336
02:39:10,769 --> 02:39:15,690
<i>''And Stella believes the evil
of the Marabar has been wiped out,</i>

1337
02:39:15,816 --> 02:39:17,859
<i>and so do I. ''</i>

1338
02:39:21,321 --> 02:39:23,865
<i>''Dear Miss Quested,</i>
