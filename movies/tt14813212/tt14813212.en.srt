1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,382
Ah, this is it.

3
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,360
Looks kind of... empty.

4
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,330
Gee.

5
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,363
Ya think?

6
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,703
Right, pardon me,

7
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,639
but may I help you two
lovely lads with something?

8
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,641
Hey boss, there he is.

9
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,885
What do you know, he's a zombie.

10
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,443
Indeed, I am.

11
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:23,578
Hey, true or false?

12
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,813
Yes.

13
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,514
Are you the guys
that eat brains?

14
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,618
Why yes, I do enjoy a
nicely grilled cerebellum

15
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,753
with a side of chips.

16
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,821
Ah! The bigger the better.

17
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,692
Well then, Floop, you're safe.

18
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,626
Harsh.

19
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,293
Quite rude.

20
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,327
Oi! Hello.

21
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,637
Zombie problem solved.

22
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,572
Ugh.

23
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,775
He's so brittle.

24
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,643
Look at him, Floop.

25
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:58,546
A stinking, rotten bag
of human garbage, oh.

26
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:03,417
Yep, he's a real sack of crap.

27
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,721
So why do you want him?

28
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,488
This man is Franz Pennywhacker

29
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,557
the world's greatest pianist.

30
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,559
I want those phalanges.

31
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,296
Ah, I get it.

32
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,902
I don't get it.

33
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:20,869
Photo.

34
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:21,904
Snap to it.

35
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,371
Chop, chop!

36
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:31,913
Hold it.

37
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,516
Smile for the birdie.

38
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,385
Come on, come on.

39
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,419
Aw, come on.

40
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,521
You can smile bigger than that.

41
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,690
Ah, no, don't do the finger.

42
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:45,426
Uh, what else ya got?

43
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,895
Yeah, okay, we'll do that one.

44
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,569
I sure hope all these
parts fit together.

45
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,674
You know, a man's more
than the sum of his parts.

46
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,575
I don't mean just slap
together Superman.

47
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,680
Wow.

48
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,547
How incredibly
thoughtful and sensitive

49
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,884
and yet so insightful.

50
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,719
Come on, we have a
lot of grave robbing

51
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,587
ahead of us this evening.

52
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,621
Hiya!

53
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:17,726
Couldn't we have
gotten a horse for this?

54
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,996
Onward. We have
little time to waste.

55
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,631
I hate this job.

56
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,856
Ow, oh, oh, oh! The back!

57
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,556
Oh, the back's out again!

58
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,759
Oh, oh no, oh no!

59
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,733
Igor?

60
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,501
Igor, where are you? Come on.

61
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,502
Come out, come out.

62
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,637
I know you're around here.

63
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,706
Come on, you little
flying rodent.

64
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,874
Igor!

65
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,976
Igor where are you? Igor!

66
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:41,877
Ig...

67
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,910
Gah!

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,547
Right here, my Lord.

69
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,683
Come on, my back's out.

70
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,550
I need you to do
that thing you do.

71
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,686
Come on, hurry, please.

72
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,586
I'll get those
vertebrae as straight

73
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,523
as my great aunt Elva's
knickers.

74
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,560
I presume it's the
lumbar in that pesky L4.

75
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,064
Yes, L4 and five.

76
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:03,497
Oh, ah!

77
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,066
Come on, come on.

78
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,566
Hurry up, hurry up.

79
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,702
Do it, do it.

80
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:07,836
Oi.

81
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,037
All right, on three.

82
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,605
And three!

83
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,076
Oh, gah.

84
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,944
Better?

85
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,511
Better.

86
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,579
Better.

87
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,649
Oh, Igor, thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:21,650
That's good.

89
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,851
I gotta tell you something,

90
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,587
once you hit 300,
everything starts to go.

91
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:27,789
And I mean everything.

92
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,523
Sir, you keep telling me, sir.

93
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,625
Is Lily awake?

94
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:31,860
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,004
She's out on a date
with a Mr. Or lock.

96
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,863
Oh, that's good news.

97
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,965
I really think she's
gonna fall for this fella.

98
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,800
I know a love
connection when I see it

99
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,869
and this is a love connection.

100
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,904
And I wanna tell ya
something about Or lock.

101
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,606
He's not only handsome,

102
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,974
but he's a real swinger.

103
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:49,111
And most importantly,
he's loaded to the fangs!

104
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,913
So I assume you are Or lock?

105
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,148
Yes, yes.

106
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,916
And you are?

107
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,051
Um, Lily.

108
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,986
Oh yes, yes, Lily.

109
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,056
It's always so hard
to remember the names.

110
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,624
Oh.

111
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,893
I'm hungry, let's eat.

112
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:38,794
Okay!

113
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:39,827
Ha, ha!

114
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,998
Good evening, Mr. Or lock.

115
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,834
We have your usual table ready.

116
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,568
Please, follow me.

117
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,207
So, do you bring
all your dates here?

118
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,109
Yes, yes, every night.

119
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:56,777
Oh.

120
00:07:57,946 --> 00:07:58,946
Okay.

121
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,863
Oh, whatever happened
to our waiter?

122
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,965
He moves like a snail.

123
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,667
Uh-huh.

124
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,802
It seems like they've
been waiting awhile.

125
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,237
Oh, they are dead.

126
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,805
Who's hungry?

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,242
I have one Cleopatra Special.

128
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,010
Oo, hoo, hoo!

129
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:31,113
No garlic, for the lady.

130
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,881
And one Anubis Salad.

131
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:33,815
This looks good.

132
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,183
Extra onions.

133
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,217
Bon appetit!

134
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,753
So how is your food?

135
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,890
Delicious.

136
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,732
Um.

137
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,868
Oh, so I noticed on
your dating profile

138
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,936
you only listed two hobbies,

139
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,139
the black plague and pestilence.

140
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,641
Which I thought, technically,
were both the same.

141
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,244
Exactly the same.

142
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,179
I love them both equally.

143
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,982
Oh, don't get me
wrong, I love it too.

144
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,217
It's just, you know,
kind of old news.

145
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,954
Do you like rats?

146
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,256
Of course, who doesn't?

147
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,192
Oh! Good, good, good!

148
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,162
I have pictures of my
fuzzy little nuggets.

149
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,196
Oh.

150
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,197
Oh, ho!

151
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,665
Somehow I'm not surprised.

152
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,867
Mm, oh!

153
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,171
This is Eric.

154
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,473
He's a naughty boy.

155
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,175
Oh, he's a cute little fella.

156
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,944
Oh! This is Steve.

157
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,846
He's a real cut up.

158
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,881
Watch out for his hijinks!

159
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,917
Oh, yeah, he's cute too.

160
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:46,988
Oh, this Opie but
I call her Tubby.

161
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,858
She likes to cuddle
under my pillow.

162
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,126
Uh-huh.

163
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,762
He likes to sit
on my head, ha, ha.

164
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,296
Marry me.

165
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,329
Ah!

166
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,234
She likes to play hide and seek.

167
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,269
She's really big and fat.

168
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,704
Rolly Polly, Jill.

169
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,874
Pumpkin!

170
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:11,313
Do you want to rub
Pumpkin's nose?

171
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,881
Oh, I'm good.

172
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:13,982
Oh, okay.

173
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Come to me.

174
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,035
Be a good little wolf.

175
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,843
Ah, puppy.

176
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,144
Come forward and sit.

177
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,317
Awaken.

178
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,351
Oh, man.

179
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,123
You are a difficult
wolf to find.

180
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,193
Which is strange, because
you are the only wolf

181
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:01,329
in town that owes
Zoya big money!

182
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,265
Me? Nah.

183
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,100
I've been around on the scene.

184
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,002
You know, rocking and rolling.

185
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,372
I know scene, you are
not rocking man on scene.

186
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,141
Ha, ha! Right, like
this guy knows the scene?

187
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,342
Give me a break!

188
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,111
I get around.

189
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,144
Enough!

190
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,082
You give me money now or Bella

191
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,350
will chop off your hand.

192
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,953
Okay, stop.

193
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,421
Let's not get crazy.

194
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,889
I gotta ask ya a question.

195
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,860
Why you got a picture
of my pops on your wall?

196
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:35,363
That is ancient,
unfinished history.

197
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,033
Uh, I don't like
the sound of that.

198
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,934
He should call.

199
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,936
It is time for you
to make the call.

200
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,982
Igor, get the phone.

201
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:55,183
I'm watching TV.

202
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,388
What does he do
that's so important

203
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:03,124
that he can't be
here when I need him?

204
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,029
Never mind, I'll get it myself.

205
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,297
It's not like I'm the Count.

206
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,101
Yeah, who is this?

207
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,002
Leave me alone.

208
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:15,403
Yo, pops!

209
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,038
How ya been, baby?

210
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:18,306
Hey guess what?

211
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,275
You're very lucky, I'm
in a good mood tonight.

212
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,911
I'm gonna give you
exactly two seconds.

213
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:23,944
Are ya ready?

214
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:26,214
Go.

215
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,225
I know a straight as an
arrow business lady who...

216
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,451
Time's up.

217
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,453
Listen, pops, she
wants to buy the castle

218
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,055
and transform it into a
casino slash theme park.

219
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,156
We can't lose.

220
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,291
What do ya say?

221
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:38,393
Get the hair out of your ears

222
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,863
and listen very, very closely.

223
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,967
I would rather go into
business with Jack the Ripper!

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,902
Who by the way is
no Jack the tipper.

225
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:51,306
5% tops with this guy,
it's an embarrassment.

226
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,141
Than ever go into
business with you!

227
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:57,978
Moron.

228
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,349
I assume you heard what he said.

229
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:04,519
All Zoya hear was
big, big trouble

230
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,054
for little wolf, wolf.

231
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,389
Funny.

232
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:08,456
That's what I heard too.

233
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,994
Oh, nice neighborhood.

234
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,964
So, do you live around here?

235
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:16,997
Yes, yes.

236
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,300
Just around the corner.

237
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,404
Oh well, that's convenient.

238
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,372
Oh yes, yes.

239
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,107
Very convenient.

240
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:33,481
I have a little surprise.

241
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,718
Close your eyes.

242
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:36,751
Oh.

243
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,354
Come with me.

244
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:43,057
Just over here.

245
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,394
Okay.

246
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,495
No peeky-peeky.

247
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,304
Open your eyes!

248
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,490
Ah.

249
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,094
I'm gonna go.

250
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,332
Oh.

251
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,367
Okay.

252
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:33,609
You're
watching TV 666 Transylvania.

253
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,614
Breaking news!

254
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:39,782
What, what's this?

255
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:42,450
With Donna Doomley.

256
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,553
Good evening, I'm Donna
Doomley with breaking news.

257
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,432
Transylvania's
favorite funny man,

258
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,525
Shecky Von Rathbone, has died.

259
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,394
Shecky was eaten
alive last night

260
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,096
by an irate heckler.

261
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,165
You're momma's so stupid, uh,

262
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,076
she stared at a cup of
orange juice for 12 hours

263
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,302
because it said concentrate.

264
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,437
You call that jokes?

265
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,305
The guy got what he deserved.

266
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:05,507
I got a good job.

267
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,275
I mean, working at
a mirror factory

268
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,646
is something I could totally
see myself doing sexy.

269
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,649
The remains of Shecky were
taken to the Dew Drop In

270
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,183
Funeral Home.

271
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,152
Shecky's death comes just hours

272
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,122
after the passing of his
brother, Shelly Von Rathbone,

273
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,391
world renown astrophysicist.

274
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,126
Sometimes referred to as

275
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,262
the smartest man on earth.

276
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,098
Silicon carbide
grains are present

277
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,133
in refractory inclusions.

278
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,469
A mere child could
trace the torsions.

279
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,137
Shelly's body also lies in state

280
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,506
at the Dew Drop In Funeral Home.

281
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,609
Although it is
unlikely that anyone

282
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:44,445
but a complete moron, and
I do mean complete moron,

283
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,148
would ever confuse
these two men.

284
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,183
I'm Donna Doomley
and I will continue

285
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,252
to bring you the
news as it breaks.

286
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,666
I'll stand guard
from across the way

287
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,326
while you steal the second most
brilliant brain of our time.

288
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,327
Question.

289
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:04,867
And I know what
you're gonna say.

290
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,435
Leave the sciencey
stuff to you, but,

291
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,270
why don't we steal the first

292
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,640
most brilliant
brain of our time?

293
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:16,277
Because, my dear Floop,
I'm still using it.

294
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,479
Geez, conceited much?

295
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:21,416
No, not conceited at all.

296
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:24,519
Simply dropping ice cold facts.

297
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,625
Well, giddy up, little doggy.

298
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,329
And remember!

299
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,666
Shelly Von Rathbone.

300
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:41,202
No other brain shall do.

301
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,475
What do I look like, a moron?

302
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,273
Don't answer that!

303
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,306
I wrote it on my hand.

304
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,577
Oh god.

305
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Nope.

306
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,442
Nope.

307
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:26,513
Bingo!

308
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,518
Well, hello Mr. Von Rathbone.

309
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,287
Sorry, old boy.

310
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,226
But I'm gonna be
needing that melon.

311
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,092
Think of it!

312
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,795
The brain of a super
genius transplanted

313
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:57,431
into the body of a
perfect physical specimen.

314
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:58,599
Ha, ha, ha!

315
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,604
So what are ya gonna call him?

316
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,338
I hadn't given much thought

317
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,542
to such trivial matters,
but now that you mention it,

318
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,847
Project 27X67H54 is a bit dry.

319
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,551
Ah!

320
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,754
As I stride this unholy planet

321
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:22,490
as a modern day
Prometheus, perhaps Uranus!

322
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,592
God of the sky!

323
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:27,896
Seriously?

324
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,430
You're making his
life a lot harder

325
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,365
than it has to be with
a name like Uranus.

326
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,871
Well, I suppose you
have a better idea.

327
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,706
Okay, go on, out with it.

328
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,479
I don't know, Herman.

329
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:47,448
Herman?

330
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,851
Yeah.

331
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,586
I had a pitspire named
Herman, he was a swell guy.

332
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,354
Hm, he's gonna need
a last name too.

333
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,794
How about Munster?

334
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:00,963
Do you really think I would call

335
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:04,766
the greatest creation in
the history of mankind

336
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Herman Monster?

337
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,838
Not Herman Monster,
Herman Munster.

338
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,472
Like the cheese.

339
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,574
Like the cheese!

340
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,010
Out of my way, you simpleton.

341
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,378
I've got work to do.

342
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:23,819
Let's make history, Floop!

343
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,854
Are you ready?

344
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:27,723
Three!

345
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:28,957
Two!

346
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:29,958
One!

347
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,425
And away we go!

348
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:33,996
Ah, ha, ha!

349
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,774
Ah, ah, I want more volts!

350
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,975
Woo, ah!

351
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,009
Woo!

352
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,479
Yes, we need it!

353
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,581
We need more power!

354
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:54,615
Ah!

355
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,722
Don't do it!

356
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,490
You'll kill us both!

357
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,759
Ah, ha!

358
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,526
Warning, warning!

359
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,829
Give me more power!

360
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,665
Are you insane?

361
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,004
Woo! Ha, ha, ha!

362
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,571
Live, I tell you!

363
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,442
Live!

364
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,483
Cut the power, Floop!

365
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,291
And done!

366
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:41,997
Oh, my creation is born.

367
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,206
I'm no expert.

368
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,980
In fact, you yourself called
me a, what was that again?

369
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:58,981
Simpleton.

370
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:00,581
Right, simpleton.

371
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,886
So, take this in the
proper spirit, but uh.

372
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,021
Shouldn't he be
moving or something?

373
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,033
Interesting.

374
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,835
Anything going on in there?

375
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,008
No!

376
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:39,987
No!

377
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,835
Well, what are ya gonna do?

378
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:56,804
It's alive!

379
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,373
Alive!

380
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:04,646
Oo, no, ugh.

381
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,948
I was talking about my
pet cockroach, Ernie.

382
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,550
You see, I thought he was
dead, but look, he's fine.

383
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,356
Aye!

384
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,624
Oh no, he's still fine.

385
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:16,657
Tough little bugger.

386
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:20,762
You have no idea what this
failure means to humanity.

387
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:25,867
I could have changed the
course of life as we know it.

388
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,705
I could have altered mankind's
place in the universe.

389
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,174
I could have...

390
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:35,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:36,378
Am I boring you?

392
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:39,847
Well, am I?

393
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,761
Don't speak, my dear creation.

394
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:54,162
Don't speak.

395
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:57,833
Save your words of wisdom
for the grand unveiling.

396
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,201
Ha, ha, oh.

397
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,736
The world will be watching.

398
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,705
Ha, ha, ha!

399
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,950
Live from the
beautiful Carpathia Mountains

400
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,777
it's "Good Morning
Transylvania."

401
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,747
With your host, the one
and only, Ezra Mosher.

402
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,183
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Ezra.

403
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,220
Hello, everybody.

404
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,889
Welcome back to "Good
Morning Transylvania."

405
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,791
I'm your host, Ezra Mosher

406
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:25,127
and we are coming to ya live
from the very windy studio...

407
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,795
So I really thought
you and old Or lock

408
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:27,829
were gonna hit it off.

409
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,166
Maybe you should give
him another shot.

410
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,834
All right, so he's
a little obsessed

411
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:33,902
with the black plague.

412
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,270
A man needs his hobbies.

413
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:38,006
It's not just that.

414
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,676
I want a man that makes
my blood run cold.

415
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,813
A man that every time
he enters my crypt,

416
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:49,184
it's like a stake through
my dead, black heart.

417
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,786
I could whip ya up a
hubby down in the lab.

418
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,922
Oh no! Remember what
happened last time?

419
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,024
It took us a month to
get him off the roof.

420
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:58,894
He was batty, but
he sure had charisma.

421
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,128
Eh.

422
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,197
Now, can we change the
subject of my love life?

423
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:07,169
So your idiot brother
Lester called last night.

424
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:08,803
Mm, let me guess.

425
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:10,105
He's broke again.

426
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,073
He wants me to sell our castle

427
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:14,009
and cut him in on the deal.

428
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:17,145
Well, at least he dreams big.

429
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,682
Heh, his dreams are my bank
accounts worst nightmare.

430
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,084
Oh.

431
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,719
Oh my goodness.

432
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:26,821
We've got a great treat
in store for everyone.

433
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,157
Our favorite mad
scientist, Dr. Wolfgang,

434
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:32,060
is here to unveil
his latest creation.

435
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:33,228
Oh, ha!

436
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,930
Now ladies and gentlemen.

437
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:38,266
Let's give a warm, "Good
Morning Transylvania" welcome

438
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,703
to the one, the only Dr.
Henry Augustus Wolfgang!

439
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:43,939
Oh, ho, ho!

440
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:45,073
Oo, hoo, hoo!

441
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:47,275
What a pleasure
to have you here.

442
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,077
May I call ya Henry?

443
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,713
Oh, finally.

444
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:58,887
Raven's egg with a side of
tarantula hash browns, my lady.

445
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,222
Oh, thank you, Igor.

446
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,990
It looks yummy!

447
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,928
Bring it on, bring it on.

448
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:07,972
We have something extraordinary,

449
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,764
and I know everyone backstage

450
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:10,942
is so excited about
what's going on.

451
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,300
Your regular, my Lord.

452
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:15,937
Ice cold.

453
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:18,907
Some of the most
substantial intellects

454
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,811
in Transylvania have
called you certifiable.

455
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:26,348
Well, these so-called
substantial intellects.

456
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:30,185
Well they can just eat my

457
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:34,956
And kiss my rosy little.

458
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,358
Oh, hoo, hoo!

459
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:38,793
Well doctor, now that
we've got that out of the way

460
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,763
why don't you show
us what you've got?

461
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:13,295
Speak, my child of electricity.

462
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:18,166
Speak, my child of tomorrow!

463
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:21,069
Speak!

464
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,412
Oh my god.

465
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:34,382
He is gorgeous.

466
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,084
Look at that head.

467
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:39,254
Perfectly flat.

468
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,257
You don't see that everyday.

469
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,059
Hey, can you imagine having

470
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,927
a big maroon like
that in the family?

471
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,262
I couldn't live with the shame.

472
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,295
Shh!

473
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:52,267
Dazzle them with
some quantum physics.

474
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Huh?

475
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,909
Enough talking.

476
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:02,410
Now a little music.

477
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:27,968
Speak.

478
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:51,292
My mother-in-law fell
down a wishing well.

479
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:55,263
Boy, I didn't know those
things actually worked.

480
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:02,437
My friend recently died
drinking a gallon of varnish.

481
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,040
It was a horrible end,
but a lovely finish.

482
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:11,045
Maestro, hit it!

483
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,350
A horse walks into the bar.

484
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,952
The bartender says,
why the long face?

485
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,022
Speaking of establishments,

486
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,991
I'm thinking of opening
up a restaurant.

487
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,392
I'm gonna call it Karma.

488
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:25,360
There's no menu.

489
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:27,495
You just get what you deserve.

490
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,299
Okay, okay, I can actually feel

491
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,034
my brain cells dying.

492
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,103
Igor, change the channel.

493
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:39,307
Don't you dare touch that dial!

494
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,378
Oh!

495
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:45,346
Goodnight, everybody!

496
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,982
I mean, good
morning, ha, ha, ha!

497
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:54,355
He's perfect!

498
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,198
Ruined, I tell you!

499
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:05,467
Disgraced in front
of the entire world

500
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,268
by a dancing baboon.

501
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:11,539
Don't worry, I got the
situation under control.

502
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,209
I've been working on some
really keen magic tricks.

503
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:15,243
Magic tricks?

504
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:16,478
- Juggling?
- Juggling!

505
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,511
Impressions?

506
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,349
Wait until you get
a load of this one.

507
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:26,020
You gotta ask
yourself one question.

508
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,222
Do ya feel lucky?

509
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,325
Huh? Do ya, punk?

510
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:32,093
Woo, I get chills
every time I hear it.

511
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,461
I've heard enough!

512
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:36,296
Oh.

513
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,234
Farewell, comrades.

514
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,170
Away, I must go.

515
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:45,106
To live amongst the beasts.

516
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,139
And the lepers.

517
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:49,244
Of dark Zanzibar.

518
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:55,618
The old doc sure isn't
cut out for show business.

519
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:59,655
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

520
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:03,224
You see, there are
unfounded rumors

521
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:08,062
that I might have accidentally
switched brains and...

522
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,300
Ah, forget it! It's old news.

523
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:16,538
Floopy, old boy, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

524
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,572
What's that, big guy?

525
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,143
For some strange reason,

526
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,456
I can't seem to
remember my name.

527
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:26,313
Well.

528
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:30,418
Picture it in lights.

529
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:36,457
The greatest name in
all of show business,

530
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,326
izness, izness, izness.

531
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,564
Herman Munster!

532
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:01,348
Right this way.

533
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,718
I find wolf
sneaking out backdoor.

534
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:14,288
When I hear your
Lester was in my club,

535
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:18,593
I was assuming he was
here to deliver good news.

536
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:22,263
You own this joint?

537
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:24,565
Zoya owns many joints.

538
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:29,303
Yeah, I guess... I guess
I should a figured that.

539
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:30,639
Well?

540
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:32,407
Good news? Yes.

541
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,742
Well, I'm close.

542
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,679
I got a few irons in the fire.

543
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,322
I've got my feelers
out there in the street

544
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:41,817
and I'm pretty sure
with a little more time,

545
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,318
I can get you what
you want, heh.

546
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,722
I give you two weeks
to get the castle.

547
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:51,492
Afterwards, you're head is mine.

548
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,494
Nah, that ain't gonna work.

549
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,271
I'm starting to think my
material is too intellectual.

550
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:05,708
Maybe I should return
to my vaudeville roots.

551
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:06,441
Ugh, no way, man.

552
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,644
This is the wave of the future.

553
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:09,712
What do you guys think?

554
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,822
Ah, they don't know nothing.

555
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,346
See, they agree.

556
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,625
Don't listen to
them, they're relics.

557
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,616
I'm talking about the long road

558
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,384
to the tippity top!

559
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,662
Well, maybe I should
go a bit more mainstream.

560
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:19,855
I am a man of many parts.

561
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:22,725
The honey babies are falling
at your feet, you're the man!

562
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:24,559
I'm not looking
for honey babies.

563
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,631
Hey, baby, what's shaking?

564
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm looking for a
vision, a queen, true love.

565
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:35,880
Forget about the dames, man.

566
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:37,639
Worry about the music.

567
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,651
We gotta feed the machine
and we gotta cut some vinyl.

568
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,852
The beast is
hungry, and besides,

569
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,343
Rome wasn't built in a day.

570
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:44,345
True, but I believe I was.

571
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,824
Yeah, well, that's
besides the point.

572
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,751
I need some hits.

573
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,518
You want hits?

574
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,620
Okay, I'll give you hits.

575
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:01,729
Ah!

576
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,501
So you give me what I want?

577
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:07,534
Yes.

578
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:11,372
I will get that deed signed.

579
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,642
The castle will be yours.

580
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:15,878
And we can all live
happily ever after.

581
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,345
I promise.

582
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,378
Get out.

583
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,326
What the heck?

584
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,402
Lily, I never thought
I'd see you haunting

585
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,805
these hallowed halls.

586
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:44,539
What brings you here?

587
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,775
That, my dear brother,
is none of your business.

588
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,944
I bet it's that new cat, Herman.

589
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:50,411
I can dig it.

590
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:51,589
I was rapping with him earlier.

591
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:52,915
Solid dude.

592
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,616
Seriously?

593
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,851
You know him?

594
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:56,819
How?

595
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:57,653
You wanna meet him?

596
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:59,487
Oh yes!

597
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,723
But I don't know if I trust
you making the introduction.

598
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:03,826
Consider me your bat wing man.

599
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:06,862
Although, I do seem to be
a little light tonight.

600
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,502
Danke.

601
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:15,570
So?

602
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:16,772
Where is he?

603
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,706
Who?

604
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,707
Herman Munster!

605
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,508
Oh, oh, oh.

606
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,880
Your Romeo is just down the
hall, last door on the left.

607
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:28,416
Or right, one of them doors.

608
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,449
Ha, ha, ha.

609
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,875
And what exactly do you want?

610
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:54,910
Um, is Herman Munster in there?

611
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:58,680
Maybe.

612
00:37:58,714 --> 00:37:59,991
And who should I say is calling?

613
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,617
Lily.

614
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,490
Why don't you just take a number

615
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,525
and wait in the alley with
the rest of the chicks?

616
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:14,730
Well, hello.

617
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:18,800
Hi, um, I'm a big fan and um,

618
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,501
I was wondering.

619
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,503
Well, wait, no this sounds dumb.

620
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,973
But maybe would you like to
come over for dinner one night?

621
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,507
Dinner.

622
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,578
I'd have to check my schedule.

623
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,612
Please hold.

624
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:38,921
Oh boy, oh boy!

625
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,389
Oh boy, oh boy!

626
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,793
Uh, yeah.

627
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:48,030
I happen to have
an opening sometime

628
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,530
in the near future.

629
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,234
What night were
you thinking about?

630
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:55,704
Um, well, maybe tomorrow.

631
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:56,737
Tomorrow?

632
00:38:57,973 --> 00:38:58,941
Hold, please.

633
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,575
Oh.

634
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:04,947
Whoa, tomorrow!

635
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Tomorrow!

636
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,687
Uh, yeah.

637
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,057
I moved some
appointments around.

638
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,925
I think tomorrow works.

639
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,694
Fantastic.

640
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:20,561
Here's my address.

641
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:21,930
And we usually eat early.

642
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,799
Um, we?

643
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:26,268
Oh, my father, the Count and I.

644
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:29,705
Ha, I can dig that, the Count.

645
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:31,505
Far out.

646
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,942
Now I know you show business
people keep weird hours.

647
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:37,913
Shall we say around midnight
or is that too early?

648
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:40,916
Well, I usually
have my bubble bath,

649
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,583
yummy treat, and nap time.

650
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:44,786
But yeah, midnight sounds great.

651
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,824
Tomorrow it is, my sweet Lily.

652
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:49,857
Oh.

653
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:51,692
Tootles.

654
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:03,537
Herman's got a date!

655
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,850
I can't go, I tell
ya, I can't go.

656
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:15,784
What are you talking about?

657
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:16,818
Why can't you go?

658
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:18,720
I haven't got a thing to wear.

659
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:20,789
Herman, you gotta take it easy.

660
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,556
You're a stud.

661
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,893
She's just some undead chick
from out in the sticks.

662
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,560
Quit being so dramatic.

663
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,595
Dramatic!

664
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:32,768
Lily thinks I'm a
Hollywood big shot.

665
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,136
A swinger in the in-crowd.

666
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:36,638
I'm no Bobby Darin.

667
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:37,973
She's gonna see right through me

668
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,941
and know I'm just a big boob!

669
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:42,978
Ah, I need the perfect choice.

670
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:44,946
Herman isn't some lug
head who just fell off

671
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,615
the funeral truck.

672
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:48,784
He's a man of the world.

673
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,085
Well boob or no boob,

674
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,054
when you got hot wax like this,

675
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:54,056
the world is at your feet, baby!

676
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,657
Why, brother man.

677
00:40:56,925 --> 00:41:00,796
With a disc like
this, who can resist?

678
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:01,829
So Igor?

679
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:06,101
Which dress says I'm
very, very interested

680
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:08,637
but not a miserable
and depressed?

681
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,605
The silk baby tarantula web?

682
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,074
Well, yes.

683
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,142
Well yes, of course.

684
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:16,745
Or the faux lizard silk chiffon?

685
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,213
Oh, um, the faux.

686
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:20,816
Um, oh, well you could.

687
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:21,849
Maybe, yes.

688
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:24,219
Igor, get with it!

689
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:27,823
Yowza, baby!

690
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:28,856
Kick it! Woo!

691
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Oh!

692
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,964
Fresh blood, get
your fresh blood!

693
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,700
Fresh blood!

694
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,168
Grab your fresh blood!

695
00:41:41,236 --> 00:41:42,236
Fresh blood!

696
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,239
Lilies!

697
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:46,975
Ha, this my lucky night.

698
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:50,178
What else can I
do for you today?

699
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,200
Well, everything looks so great.

700
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,018
I'll take a bottle
of the B posit...

701
00:41:57,052 --> 00:41:59,654
No! I'm gonna splurge.

702
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:00,422
O negative.

703
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:03,158
Oh, that's a good year.

704
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,627
It's two leg, and
one for the lilies.

705
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,731
Three leg? Wow,
prices are going up.

706
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,268
You know, that reminds me.

707
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,003
I bought a balloon yesterday.

708
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,939
I thought the same thing.

709
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:19,941
Must be the inflation.

710
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:22,176
Ha, ha, ha!

711
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:24,179
Ah, ha, ha!

712
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,090
Hello, Lily!

713
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:37,192
That's too boring.

714
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,962
Good evening, my dear Lily.

715
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:41,996
That's too uptight.

716
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,866
Yo, what's up?

717
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,301
Nah, that's too glib.

718
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,769
It doesn't seem glib.

719
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,171
There's no good.

720
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:51,206
Hey, baby doll. What's shaking?

721
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:55,777
Let's blow this pop stand
and get our groove on.

722
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:58,246
Hermie's got the moves.

723
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,017
Back it up, back it up.

724
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,852
Hermie's backing it up.

725
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,287
Hey, numbskull!

726
00:43:07,322 --> 00:43:08,990
What?

727
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,726
I said, hey numbskull!

728
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,930
Excuse me sir, can you speak up?

729
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:20,502
I assume you are the
Herman Munster character

730
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:23,505
I've been hearing so
much about lately?

731
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,941
Yeah, I think I'm the only one!

732
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,742
When they made me
they broke the mold!

733
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:30,278
With you in it, I presume.

734
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,816
No!

735
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,751
I think I was out by that point!

736
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:39,154
Wait there, I'm gonna come
right...

737
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:41,121
Down.

738
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,825
Are you gonna come inside

739
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:45,760
or do you wanna stand out here

740
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:48,196
swiveling your hips like
a rabid baboon in heat

741
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,031
for the whole
neighborhood to see?

742
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,132
I'll come in!

743
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:56,271
Why are you shouting?

744
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:58,006
I thought you liked it!

745
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,741
Why don't you come inside?

746
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:07,816
After you.

747
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:08,984
Thank you!

748
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,017
I mean, thank you.

749
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,358
This is for you.

750
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,392
Oh yeah, what is it?

751
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:19,561
It's a bottle of O negative.

752
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,305
The blood lady said it
was a very good year.

753
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,832
Well, you're very kind.

754
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:24,399
Thank you.

755
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:26,334
The kind I don't need.

756
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:42,317
Hermie, thank you
so much for coming.

757
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,419
I hope you like curried
scorpion casserole.

758
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:46,955
I made it especially
for tonight.

759
00:44:46,988 --> 00:44:49,357
If you made it, I
know I'm gonna love it.

760
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:52,060
As a matter of fact,

761
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,693
I saved a special spot
for it right here.

762
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:55,930
I mean right here.

763
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:56,964
Oh, you.

764
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:58,800
Oh, these are for you.

765
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:01,436
Thank you so much.

766
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,405
Lilies are my favorite.

767
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:06,041
He gives her lilies
because her name is Lily.

768
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:09,044
We're dealing with some
serious brain power here.

769
00:45:09,077 --> 00:45:11,446
Father, that's quite enough.

770
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:12,314
Come on, Hermie.

771
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:13,181
I'll show you around.

772
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:14,214
Yes, Lily.

773
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:19,954
I beg her to make
curried scorpion casserole

774
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:21,323
and I get nothing.

775
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,425
All of a sudden Mr.
Herman Munster comes over

776
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,827
and it's raining curried
scorpion casserole.

777
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:30,932
Oh, bebop, baloo-bop!

778
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:32,967
How low can you go?

779
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,438
I mean, the songs
just come to me.

780
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,206
I got a million of 'em.

781
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,250
I mean, I don't even know
where they come from exactly,

782
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:42,410
but I get a lot of hot
tracks up in this noggin.

783
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:49,384
Ah.

784
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,919
You know, father,
Herman isn't just

785
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:51,953
another pretty face.

786
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:54,923
He's also very, very funny.

787
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:55,957
Stop.

788
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,293
Oh yeah, that's right.

789
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:01,896
Flat top here fancies
himself a comedian.

790
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,233
All right, dazzle me with
your side splitting wit.

791
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:06,266
Okay.

792
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,337
Here's one I know
you're gonna love.

793
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,276
How do you keep a grouchy, old,

794
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,446
broken down,
vampire in suspense?

795
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,425
I don't know.

796
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,695
How do you keep a grouchy, old,

797
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,029
broken down vampire in suspense?

798
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:39,300
I'll tell ya later.

799
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,273
Ha, ha, ha!

800
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,941
Ah, ha, ha!

801
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:51,311
Oh, you.

802
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,061
Okay, what exactly are
your intentions here?

803
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,020
Because, as you can
see, I've been around

804
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:01,022
the cemetery a few times myself,

805
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,024
and you are not
going to bamboozle me

806
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,926
with your fancy
showbiz fast talk.

807
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:16,237
I assure you, my good man.

808
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:21,309
My intentions are
nothing but honorable.

809
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:23,478
Deep inside

810
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,348
beats the heart of a
simple country boy.

811
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,384
Oh.

812
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,086
In fact, most of my parts

813
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,355
come straight from the dirt.

814
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,192
Oh!

815
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,093
Did you hear that?

816
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:41,764
You can't get more
grounded than that.

817
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:44,999
A simple country boy
straight from the dirt.

818
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,167
Preach it, sister.

819
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:53,107
This is a bunch
of cornball hooey.

820
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,077
Listen, Herman, you may
have hoodwinked Lily

821
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,780
with your folksy gibberish,

822
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,514
but it ain't working on me.

823
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,618
Okay, we're done here.

824
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,119
Enjoy your scorpion, father.

825
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:06,054
Come on, Hermie.

826
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:07,355
Let's go for a walk.

827
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:10,225
Uh, well, it was
so nice to meet you

828
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:11,627
and I hope to see
you again soon.

829
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,228
Over my dead body.

830
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,097
That would be delightful.

831
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,232
Oh, ignore him.

832
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:18,366
Come on, Hermie.

833
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,201
Come on, let's go.

834
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:22,036
Okay, Lily.

835
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:28,109
Hey by the way, your
scorpion is undercooked!

836
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,083
Igor.

837
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:36,484
Sir?

838
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:39,120
We have to do something
about this situation.

839
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,066
What's that?

840
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,568
Oh, that's one
of my gravestones.

841
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,601
Wow!

842
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,348
I hope you don't take the things

843
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:59,240
my father says to heart.

844
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:00,518
He's a bit old fashioned and has

845
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,111
a tendency to go
straight for the jugular.

846
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:05,079
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that, heh, heh.

847
00:49:05,113 --> 00:49:07,282
Oh, I didn't mean it literally.

848
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:09,551
Although to be safe,
wear high collared shirts

849
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,286
while you are getting
to know each other.

850
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:12,520
Oh.

851
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:14,322
Lily it shall be
my mission in life

852
00:49:14,355 --> 00:49:16,457
to get that man to like me.

853
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:19,093
And when Herman Munster
puts his head to something,

854
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,496
Herman Munster puts
his head to it.

855
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,565
Unless of course it falls off.

856
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,601
- Can I confess something?
- Please do.

857
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:28,169
I knew the moment
I laid eyes on you

858
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,337
that you were special.

859
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:33,107
I understand if you
don't feel the same.

860
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:36,511
I'm just a regular gal
living a boring, normal life.

861
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:37,713
No, when I first saw you

862
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:39,480
my heart leapt from my chest.

863
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:43,251
If there's one thing I know

864
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:46,287
is that the rest of
the world melted away

865
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:48,289
as soon as you
appeared in my life.

866
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,158
Oh, Hermie.

867
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:51,191
Mm.

868
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,196
After you, my dear.

869
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,198
Oh.

870
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:07,435
Uncle Gilbert!

871
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,773
What a surprise.

872
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,975
Oh, it's so good to see you.

873
00:51:13,008 --> 00:51:14,475
Nice to meet you, young man.

874
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:15,543
It's an honor.

875
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,576
That's quite a grip.

876
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:14,803
Oh look, there's one.

877
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,812
Oh Hermie, it's so romantic here

878
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:26,547
with the soft, gentle
screech of the vultures

879
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,617
circling overhead.

880
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,818
It sure is, dear.

881
00:52:29,852 --> 00:52:31,653
Unfortunately the
clouds are clearing up

882
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,622
and the sun's coming out.

883
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,356
Oh.

884
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,425
Pussy cat, this
last week has been

885
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,261
the most wonderful time
of all of my lives.

886
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,902
Lily, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

887
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:48,604
Oh yes, pookie bear?

888
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,676
Okay, keep it together big guy.

889
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,511
You're Herman Munster.

890
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:57,880
You got this, you practiced it.

891
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:58,913
Let's do it.

892
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,652
Lily, I...

893
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:04,552
What is it?

894
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:05,585
Is something wrong?

895
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:10,659
Will you, ma, ma, ma...

896
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:12,527
Marry me?

897
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:15,764
Oh, Hermie!

898
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,835
You've made me the happiest
ghoul in the world.

899
00:53:22,638 --> 00:53:25,573
Everything you ever wanted
to know about magic spells

900
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:27,676
but were afraid to ask.

901
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,846
Igor, there's gotta be a
husband spell in here somewhere.

902
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,447
Are you sure about this?

903
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:36,685
It seems that Miss
Lily is truly in love.

904
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,687
Oh come on, you know and I know

905
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,422
that we gotta get rid of
that bozo Herman Munster.

906
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:42,557
He's got no class.

907
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,826
Class?

908
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,627
Yeah, class.

909
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:47,639
He's a stitch job from the
wrong side of the cemetery.

910
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,631
He's not the type
of person I want

911
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:51,465
my Lily hooking up with.

912
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,836
Hamster.

913
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,570
Oh, hippopotamus.

914
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:59,440
Let's see, husband!

915
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,475
There's a husband spell.

916
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:04,445
I really think you
should reconsider.

917
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,648
Who's side are you on, anyway?

918
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:07,749
Mine's the best one.

919
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,450
It's the most gruesome.

920
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:11,519
It is not, mine is uglier.

921
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:12,621
Oh yeah?

922
00:54:12,654 --> 00:54:14,723
I've got the ugliest face.

923
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:17,425
Freddy, we're talking
about the sweatshirts.

924
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:19,871
Sorry things didn't
work out for you

925
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:21,596
so great at the leper colony.

926
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,466
I don't want to talk about it.

927
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,535
Well, at least you came home

928
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:28,937
with that cool new T-shirt.

929
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:31,372
They gave it to me when
they lost my luggage.

930
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:37,746
Hey, hey, you're back!

931
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,650
It's not a crime to go
on holiday, now is it?

932
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,485
Uh, well, you look good.

933
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,519
You look good.

934
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:47,587
Is something different?

935
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,693
New hairdo?

936
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,762
Yeah, new hairdo.

937
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:55,796
Spray tan?

938
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,968
So, how'd it go?

939
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,804
I'm assuming she said yes?

940
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,042
Oh God.

941
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,509
Oh, I knew it!

942
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:09,945
I knew she was a phony.

943
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:11,914
Vampire chicks are all the same!

944
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:14,616
One bite and it's
so long, sucker!

945
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,784
There's always somebody

946
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,686
that spoils everything
by chickening out.

947
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:18,687
She said yes.

948
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,789
That no good, fang banger!

949
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:21,790
Wait, wait, what?

950
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:23,058
She said yes!

951
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:24,726
She said yes!

952
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,994
She said yes!

953
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:27,028
She said yes!

954
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:32,801
Let's begin.

955
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:37,639
Alrighty, we'll start with
the chest hair of Tarzan.

956
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:40,008
For that swinging vibe.

957
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,610
There you go.

958
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:43,779
Oh, and of course
she'll want him

959
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,914
to have some special moves

960
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:48,016
so how about a pair
of dancing shoes.

961
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,687
One from Fred Astaire
and one from Gene Kelly.

962
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,589
And to top it all off
with a little swagger.

963
00:55:57,025 --> 00:56:00,494
A cowboy hat of the one
and only John Wayne.

964
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,699
Well how about that, the
Duke did wear a toupee.

965
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:07,568
And now some wizarding words.

966
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:11,505
Herman Munster dumb-dumb
will be no more.

967
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,976
When you bring the
perfect marrying man

968
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:16,712
to my sweet Lily's door!

969
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:24,552
What?

970
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:25,821
What?

971
00:56:25,854 --> 00:56:27,689
Ugh, I always forget
one ingredient.

972
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:30,058
One simple ingredient.

973
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:33,729
Here we go, perfect
husband coming up.

974
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:37,765
Ah! Ah!

975
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:39,667
What? What?

976
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,805
Okay, alrighty, what went wrong?

977
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Hold on.

978
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:51,847
Ah! This isn't the
hair of Tarzan.

979
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,048
It's the hair of Cheetah!

980
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,618
Okay, time to shuffle
off to Buffalo.

981
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,820
Keep going, all right.

982
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:00,521
Ah, you win some, you lose some.

983
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:12,533
Lily, is that you?

984
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:14,102
Ha!

985
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:15,804
Wow, hey.

986
00:57:15,837 --> 00:57:16,972
You're in a good mood.

987
00:57:17,005 --> 00:57:18,874
Everybody's in a
dancing mood tonight.

988
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:20,709
Is that a victory dance

989
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:23,178
because you finally got rid
of that bum Herman Munster?

990
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:28,593
Wait a minute, what
exactly is going on here?

991
00:57:28,617 --> 00:57:29,484
Are you drunk?

992
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:31,062
Did that good for
nothing give you wine?

993
00:57:31,086 --> 00:57:32,354
No, silly.

994
00:57:32,387 --> 00:57:34,689
You know I never drink wine.

995
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:35,723
It's this.

996
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,126
Is that what I think it is?

997
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,161
Yes, it is.

998
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,064
Oh, brother.

999
00:58:21,103 --> 00:58:22,971
Herman Munster!

1000
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:24,206
How's it going, man?

1001
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,775
Man, it's going great.

1002
00:58:26,808 --> 00:58:28,110
And you are?

1003
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:29,111
I'm Lester, baby.

1004
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:31,046
Ah, Lester Baby.

1005
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,647
Your future brother-in-law.

1006
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:34,116
Oh!

1007
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:36,194
I'm the one who pointed
Lily directly to your door.

1008
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:40,188
If not for me, who knows
if love would have bloomed.

1009
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:43,592
Oh, ho, ho, it is
so great to meet you.

1010
00:58:44,893 --> 00:58:46,070
So listen, Herman,
now that you and I

1011
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:47,863
are practically blood related

1012
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:49,173
I think it's only
right that I tell ya

1013
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:52,134
about this sweetheart
real estate deal.

1014
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,935
That sounds boss, man.

1015
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,673
But, I think it's
best if Lily handles

1016
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:00,842
the finances because I don't
have a head for numbers.

1017
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:01,776
Come on, Herman.

1018
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,944
Get with it.

1019
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,279
You gotta get
ahead of the curve.

1020
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:06,114
If you wanna swerve.

1021
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:07,682
Oh, ho, yeah!

1022
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:10,952
What do you mean?

1023
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,687
Now that you and
my lovely sister

1024
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:15,757
are tying the knot, what's
hers is yours, right?

1025
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:18,026
Well, you do have a point.

1026
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:25,200
I assume you are the
man of the house, right?

1027
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:27,035
Yeah, well, I guess I am.

1028
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,069
You guess!

1029
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:29,204
Come on, brother man.

1030
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:31,473
Stick that chest straight out.

1031
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:33,308
I am the man of the house.

1032
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:34,476
That's the spirit.

1033
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:36,211
Just sign on the dotted line

1034
00:59:36,244 --> 00:59:38,013
and you and your lovely bride

1035
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:40,282
will be residing on easy street.

1036
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:41,816
Oh, goodie!

1037
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:46,788
Lester Baby, you are
the man with the plan.

1038
01:00:15,317 --> 01:00:16,317
Oh.

1039
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:28,095
Oh!

1040
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:49,251
Please proceed with the vows.

1041
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:50,752
Dearest Lily.

1042
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:54,155
You're the hemlock in my veins,

1043
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,957
the cobweb in my brains.

1044
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:58,860
I wanna boogie, oogie, oogie

1045
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:00,295
'til we just can't
boogie no more.

1046
01:01:02,197 --> 01:01:05,033
My sweet pussycat.

1047
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:06,066
Rawr.

1048
01:01:07,335 --> 01:01:11,873
I knew from the moment
I saw your flat head

1049
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:14,409
and that cute little scar,

1050
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:17,846
that I wanted to
spend every moment

1051
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:19,881
tightening those neck bolts.

1052
01:01:21,316 --> 01:01:23,084
All I ask is that we spend

1053
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:27,155
the rest of my lives growing
disgracefully old together.

1054
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,393
And now the rings.

1055
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:33,828
Oh yeah.

1056
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:36,898
Oh, uh, hey.

1057
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:41,269
Yo-yo. Ha, ha.

1058
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:42,303
Yo-yo.

1059
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:45,407
Oh, there they are.

1060
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:48,310
Oh!

1061
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:50,045
Herman, do you
take Lily Gruesella

1062
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:52,047
to be your lawfully wedded wife

1063
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,382
until a stake through
the heart do you part?

1064
01:01:55,651 --> 01:01:56,418
Oh.

1065
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:58,887
What a cream puff!

1066
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
I do.

1067
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:01,455
Oh!

1068
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:11,433
Lily Gruesella, do you
take Herman Dillon Munster

1069
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:14,969
as your husband until a loss
of electricity do you part?

1070
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:16,970
I do!

1071
01:02:20,442 --> 01:02:22,210
If anyone objects
to the marriage

1072
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:25,080
of these two wretched
souls, speak now

1073
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:26,915
or forever hold your peace.

1074
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:28,016
Yeah, uh...

1075
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:33,121
I was just gonna say, good luck.

1076
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:35,156
You're gonna need it
with that big dope.

1077
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:39,928
I now pronounce.

1078
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:41,162
I now pronounce.

1079
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:42,931
I now pronounce.
I now pronounce.

1080
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:43,965
I now pronounce.

1081
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:46,967
Whoopsie.

1082
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:51,072
I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Munster.

1083
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:53,942
Oh yeah.

1084
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,081
Pardon me.

1085
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:01,315
Could someone please call 911?

1086
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,153
Come on, Hermie.

1087
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,389
Mrs. Munster wants to
start her new life.

1088
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:09,057
Mrs. Munster.

1089
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:11,492
Bye!

1090
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,266
He's your bloody
problem now, mate.

1091
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:56,237
Oh, there's Lester.

1092
01:04:02,377 --> 01:04:03,478
Did I miss the wedding?

1093
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:06,214
As a matter of fact, you did.

1094
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:10,385
Well, then, let me
take this opportunity

1095
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:14,389
to congratulate my baby sister

1096
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:17,325
and um, my new partner.

1097
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:18,593
Scram.

1098
01:04:18,627 --> 01:04:20,261
Let's make some money, brother!

1099
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:29,380
That Lester, what a character.

1100
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,404
Gotta love him.

1101
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:32,540
Ha, ha.

1102
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:34,118
What exactly was
Lester talking about?

1103
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:35,486
You didn't give
him money, did you?

1104
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,212
Money? No!

1105
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,246
He's just tipsy.

1106
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:40,515
You know how wolves get
after a few too many.

1107
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:43,117
I know, my sweet,
adorable Hermie baby

1108
01:04:43,151 --> 01:04:44,495
wouldn't be dumb
enough to get into

1109
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,155
a lame brain business
scheme with Lester.

1110
01:04:47,188 --> 01:04:48,624
Business? With Lester?

1111
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:49,657
Don't be ridiculous.

1112
01:04:51,092 --> 01:04:52,327
Ha, ha.

1113
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,095
Good, I would hate
to think I just threw

1114
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:56,030
my life away
marrying a blockhead.

1115
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:01,436
The castle is
now official yours.

1116
01:05:08,443 --> 01:05:10,411
Ah, it appears
your brother-in-law

1117
01:05:10,445 --> 01:05:13,181
is as stupid in
the brain as you.

1118
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,250
What about my green?

1119
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:22,557
That's it?

1120
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,060
That is what is left
for you after our cut.

1121
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:30,532
My advice to you, don't
borrow money from Zoya.

1122
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:33,601
Trust me, you ain't
never seeing me again.

1123
01:05:33,636 --> 01:05:36,371
Next time we won't
be so hospitable.

1124
01:05:36,404 --> 01:05:37,548
There won't be no next time.

1125
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:40,141
I'm going straight to Las Vegas.

1126
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:42,645
So I can quadruple
my pitiful stack.

1127
01:05:42,678 --> 01:05:44,245
Ha, ha.

1128
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,681
Wolf never learn.

1129
01:05:45,714 --> 01:05:47,515
Wolf is stupid.

1130
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:00,428
Merci!

1131
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,263
French fries.

1132
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:04,299
Oh, look up there!

1133
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:05,668
Tres magnifique!

1134
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,569
So, romantic.

1135
01:06:15,678 --> 01:06:19,213
I hate to say it, but
old Paris is overrated.

1136
01:06:21,617 --> 01:06:24,519
These are some of the homeliest
people I've ever seen.

1137
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:27,388
I noticed that too.

1138
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:30,693
And they sure have a funny
way of reacting to foreigners.

1139
01:06:30,726 --> 01:06:32,728
Some of these customs
seem downright rude.

1140
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,096
Well, wait a second.

1141
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:38,533
I almost forgot.

1142
01:06:38,566 --> 01:06:40,301
I think this will
solve our problem.

1143
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:45,406
We'll have no
trouble blending in.

1144
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:48,611
Oh, pookie!

1145
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:51,212
You look so
continental and suave.

1146
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:56,351
I hope they don't confuse
me for Maurice Chevalier.

1147
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,178
Oh, what a beautiful sculpture.

1148
01:07:37,693 --> 01:07:39,360
Hey look, a mime.

1149
01:07:40,796 --> 01:07:42,573
That's the height of French
culture, very classy.

1150
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,533
Oh right about now I think
I could use some culture.

1151
01:07:57,445 --> 01:07:58,546
Sacre bleu!

1152
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:18,331
I don't get it.

1153
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:21,235
That's the loudest
mime I've ever seen.

1154
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:24,006
Must be that new modern
mime I was reading about.

1155
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:25,473
Oh.

1156
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:26,507
Oh, Hermie, look.

1157
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:32,413
Oh, he's so cute.

1158
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:33,716
What a sweetie.

1159
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:35,851
Oh, what's it say?

1160
01:08:35,884 --> 01:08:38,252
Monstre les egouts de Paris.

1161
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:39,454
Huh?

1162
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:41,322
Monster haunts
the sewers of Paris.

1163
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:43,357
Oh, ho, ho! Oh, goodie!

1164
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,626
Let's go.

1165
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,794
What a fun town!

1166
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,822
This is so romantic.

1167
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:15,758
It reminds me of the
old neighborhood.

1168
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,392
Oh, I'm surprised it's so empty.

1169
01:09:18,426 --> 01:09:20,394
I thought it would be
crawling with tourists.

1170
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,265
Oh, well this is why it's empty.

1171
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:26,367
It's closed.

1172
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:28,503
Oh!

1173
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:30,471
I so wanted to find
that little cutie.

1174
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:33,842
Stand back.

1175
01:09:56,665 --> 01:09:57,933
Oh, Hermie.

1176
01:09:57,966 --> 01:09:59,467
You're so manly.

1177
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,674
After you.

1178
01:10:16,919 --> 01:10:19,554
Oh, I think I hear something.

1179
01:10:25,861 --> 01:10:26,895
There it goes!

1180
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:27,929
Ah!

1181
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:40,876
Herman.

1182
01:10:42,878 --> 01:10:44,378
Herman.

1183
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,425
Oh, he's adorable!

1184
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:06,367
Boy oh boy.

1185
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:08,469
Boy, that is nice.

1186
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:11,505
That is very, very nice.

1187
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:12,774
Wow.

1188
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:15,878
Look at this neck, it's
completely natural.

1189
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:18,412
Yeah, boy, look at that.

1190
01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:19,948
That's what I say.

1191
01:11:19,982 --> 01:11:22,885
I'm really a leg man, myself.

1192
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:25,453
Preferably two if possible.

1193
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:29,423
What's that?

1194
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:31,425
Special delivery, my Lord.

1195
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:33,896
From Zoya Krupp.

1196
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:36,632
Zoya Krupp?

1197
01:11:36,665 --> 01:11:38,200
Why does that name
sound familiar?

1198
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:40,903
I believe you were once married.

1199
01:11:40,936 --> 01:11:42,804
You know what,
Igor, you're right.

1200
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:43,739
I was married.

1201
01:11:43,772 --> 01:11:44,940
Let me tell ya something.

1202
01:11:44,973 --> 01:11:46,708
I really dodged a
stake with this one.

1203
01:11:46,742 --> 01:11:48,644
Yeah, she was a little wacky.

1204
01:11:48,677 --> 01:11:51,512
And she swore she would
get revenge on me.

1205
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:53,815
But you know, they all say that.

1206
01:11:56,852 --> 01:12:01,857
My dear Count, as you
once broke Zoya's heart

1207
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,927
I now return the favor.

1208
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,029
Enjoy being a peasant.

1209
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:11,833
Good news?

1210
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:13,467
We're being evicted!

1211
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,905
How is this pa, pa, possible?

1212
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:19,808
Because, I have a
complete numbskull

1213
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,043
for a son-in-law!

1214
01:12:32,988 --> 01:12:33,988
Huh?

1215
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:38,860
Lily!

1216
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:40,629
Your lover boy Herman

1217
01:12:41,997 --> 01:12:43,597
is getting lonely.

1218
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,803
Almost ready, pookie bear!

1219
01:13:00,115 --> 01:13:02,718
How's the newest member
of our family doing?

1220
01:13:04,686 --> 01:13:06,955
Oh, he's being just
as cute as can be.

1221
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:09,590
What should we name him?

1222
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:12,094
I was thinking, Spot.

1223
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:14,629
You know, he looks like a Spot.

1224
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:26,608
Oh, oh, goodie.

1225
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,744
That's the champagne I ordered.

1226
01:13:28,777 --> 01:13:31,747
Room service at this
hotel is terrible.

1227
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:32,981
Every time I order something

1228
01:13:33,015 --> 01:13:34,726
they just throw it at
me from across the hall.

1229
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,584
Oh, Herman.

1230
01:13:36,618 --> 01:13:38,887
You have to remember, we're
not in Transylvania anymore.

1231
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,822
They do things
differently over here.

1232
01:13:40,856 --> 01:13:42,791
Tell me about it.

1233
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:46,628
I can't follow the plot of
this Woody Woodpecker cartoon

1234
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:47,661
to save my life.

1235
01:13:48,697 --> 01:13:49,798
Oh.

1236
01:13:59,107 --> 01:14:00,142
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1237
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:12,621
Merci beacoup.

1238
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:27,568
Sweetie, I'm ready.

1239
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:31,238
Father!

1240
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:34,609
What's going on?

1241
01:14:34,643 --> 01:14:38,046
This halfwit, blockhead
dummy you married

1242
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,115
just signed over our castle

1243
01:14:40,148 --> 01:14:41,750
to my crazy ex, Zoya.

1244
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,622
Well Lester said, if
I didn't swerve then...

1245
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:49,024
No, wait.

1246
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:52,027
If I don't curve
that I don't swerve.

1247
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,964
Oh Herman, how could you
let Lester drag you into this?

1248
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:58,233
Yeah, now thanks
to swervy curvy here,

1249
01:14:58,266 --> 01:14:59,935
we are effectively homeless.

1250
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:05,006
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

1251
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,041
What's that?

1252
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:10,076
I'm gonna hold my breath
until we get the castle back.

1253
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:15,183
What are we going to do?

1254
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:16,751
Oh.

1255
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:18,096
Who's that lawyer that's
always advertising

1256
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,122
in the back of the
Transylvania Gazette?

1257
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:22,424
The one that says
he can win any case?

1258
01:15:22,457 --> 01:15:23,992
Shady Ma Go on!

1259
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:25,660
I know him.

1260
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:27,038
There's not an honest
bone in his body.

1261
01:15:27,062 --> 01:15:29,998
He's untrustworthy,
unethical, and immoral.

1262
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:31,199
Good.

1263
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,901
I will give him a
call when we get back.

1264
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,804
So you've looked at our case.

1265
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:16,778
Right.

1266
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:17,879
Okay, lightning.

1267
01:16:23,818 --> 01:16:24,986
Yes, I understand, shark.

1268
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:29,791
Right.

1269
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:30,824
Lunar eclipse.

1270
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,199
Well, thank you.

1271
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:38,934
Hey, that sounded promising.

1272
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:40,902
What did they say?

1273
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:42,079
We have a better chance
than being struck by lightning

1274
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:45,106
while being attacked by a
shark during a lunar eclipse.

1275
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,309
In other words, we have no case.

1276
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:49,044
What are we going to do?

1277
01:16:49,077 --> 01:16:52,113
Ha, why don't you ask
magna cum dum-dum over there

1278
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:53,515
what we're gonna do.

1279
01:16:53,548 --> 01:16:56,184
He's the one who got
us into this mess.

1280
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:57,786
Friar Zombo.

1281
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:01,223
The most handsome man in
Hollywood, California.

1282
01:17:01,256 --> 01:17:02,256
Herman!

1283
01:17:03,892 --> 01:17:04,892
Herman Munster!

1284
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:07,329
Did you hear that?

1285
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:08,530
Hear what?

1286
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:10,232
Hollywood, California.

1287
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:11,766
So?

1288
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,968
I was thinking.

1289
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:15,237
Please, please,
please, do us a favor.

1290
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,838
No more thinking.

1291
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:17,982
As I was saying before I was

1292
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:19,007
so rudely interrupted.

1293
01:17:21,076 --> 01:17:24,312
If that guy's a star,
imagine what'll happen

1294
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:26,081
when they get a look at me.

1295
01:17:26,114 --> 01:17:27,082
I'm a 10.

1296
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:29,251
Zombo's a seven at best.

1297
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:31,987
That man on the boob
tube has actual talent.

1298
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,056
Oh Herman, you can't be serious.

1299
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,300
I don't wanna leave our
beloved home country

1300
01:17:36,324 --> 01:17:38,393
and move to Tinseltown.

1301
01:17:38,426 --> 01:17:40,028
Crumble Creature Crackers.

1302
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:42,163
As head of this
household, I've decided.

1303
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:44,165
Take it out of
the box like this.

1304
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,835
The Munsters have
out grown Transylvania!

1305
01:17:46,868 --> 01:17:49,871
And then you destroy
it in the bowl!

1306
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:51,373
Hey, what about me?

1307
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:52,340
What about you?

1308
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:54,209
Lily.

1309
01:17:54,242 --> 01:17:56,278
You're not gonna let
your lame brain husband

1310
01:17:56,311 --> 01:18:00,849
abandon your poor, old,
broken down father.

1311
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:02,917
Oh, of course not.

1312
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:04,986
Herman.

1313
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,020
Okay, he can come too.

1314
01:18:07,222 --> 01:18:08,299
But all your junk stays
here in Transylvania.

1315
01:18:08,323 --> 01:18:10,225
Including that freeloading Igor!

1316
01:18:12,227 --> 01:18:13,161
No offense.

1317
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,896
None taken.

1318
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:15,897
Oh.

1319
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,065
This is a fresh start.

1320
01:18:17,098 --> 01:18:18,900
All you get is one box.

1321
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:21,102
One box is all I need.

1322
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:35,450
Perfect.

1323
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:36,985
Perfect.

1324
01:18:37,018 --> 01:18:38,420
Well, Igor.

1325
01:18:38,453 --> 01:18:42,057
This is gonna put a little
flutter in your wings.

1326
01:18:45,093 --> 01:18:46,861
Are you sure about this, sir?

1327
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,430
I'm getting on a bit in age

1328
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:51,132
and I could suffer
from the side effects

1329
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,335
of the transformation.

1330
01:18:53,368 --> 01:18:55,036
Oh come on.

1331
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,038
What's a couple side effects?

1332
01:18:57,072 --> 01:18:59,274
Um, perhaps I should stay.

1333
01:18:59,307 --> 01:19:04,012
I noticed Lord Grimsby is
canvassing for a new pool boy.

1334
01:19:04,045 --> 01:19:07,482
Trust me, Grimsby
Manor has no pool.

1335
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,217
Then why would he...

1336
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,095
Look, do you wanna go
to America with me or not?

1337
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,119
Well...

1338
01:19:14,122 --> 01:19:15,056
Yeah.

1339
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,257
He, he, bottoms up!

1340
01:19:17,492 --> 01:19:19,894
Oh, that's what
Lord Grimsby said.

1341
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:20,928
Ha, ha.

1342
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,930
Mm.

1343
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:37,077
It's not working.

1344
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,254
Something homey with
an old world flare.

1345
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:48,256
Preferably a tomb with a view.

1346
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,457
That would be nice.

1347
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:51,459
Tell her nothing too showy.

1348
01:19:51,493 --> 01:19:54,095
We don't wanna be the
talk of the neighborhood.

1349
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:56,998
It'll be bad enough once
they get a look at me.

1350
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,175
Paparazzi will be everywhere.

1351
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,101
Oh, I agree.

1352
01:20:00,135 --> 01:20:02,070
Yes, nothing too showy.

1353
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:04,406
We're just your typical
family looking to blend in.

1354
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:06,040
Yeah, yeah.

1355
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:09,110
I believe I have just
what you're looking for.

1356
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:11,212
It's a beautiful property

1357
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:13,515
on a very quiet street.

1358
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,417
Oh, I do love quiet.

1359
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,986
I just can't take a
noisy tomb anymore.

1360
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,023
The market in that
area is booming,

1361
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:25,994
but if we move quick, we can
snatch up that last unit.

1362
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:28,430
If it's booming why is
there still a house available?

1363
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:32,000
Well, there is a
situation on the street

1364
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:33,468
that needs to be relocated.

1365
01:20:33,501 --> 01:20:36,304
But once it goes, so
will the last house.

1366
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:37,415
We'll be arriving tomorrow

1367
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,108
on Air Transylvania flight 666.

1368
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:42,444
Oh, Mrs. Munster,
I must warn you

1369
01:20:42,477 --> 01:20:44,179
I'm going to be heading straight

1370
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,749
to a Halloween party after
we visit the property.

1371
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:50,018
So, don't be shocked
by my appearance.

1372
01:20:50,051 --> 01:20:52,187
Um, okay.

1373
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,289
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

1374
01:20:54,322 --> 01:20:55,190
Goodbye.

1375
01:20:55,223 --> 01:20:56,458
Bye-bye.

1376
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:57,392
Hm.

1377
01:20:57,425 --> 01:20:59,060
That was strange.

1378
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,094
What was strange?

1379
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:01,405
For some reason the poor woman

1380
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:04,132
was afraid we'd be
shocked by her appearance.

1381
01:21:04,165 --> 01:21:07,602
Women, they're always so
concerned about their looks.

1382
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:10,104
Not everyone can be as
beautiful as you, my dear.

1383
01:21:10,138 --> 01:21:11,306
No, I guess not.

1384
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:15,043
Good afternoon

1385
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:20,348
and welcome to Air
Transylvania flight 666.

1386
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:24,219
We have a flying time of
22 hours and 47 minutes

1387
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:26,521
to Los Angeles today.

1388
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,456
Oh, it sure was nice
of that flight attendant

1389
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,158
to bump us up to first class.

1390
01:21:30,191 --> 01:21:32,327
First class, baby!

1391
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,629
Although it was a bit strange

1392
01:21:33,662 --> 01:21:35,439
when all the other first
class passengers moved

1393
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:37,298
to the back of the plane.

1394
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:39,367
Lily, my dear.

1395
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,544
How many times
must I remind you,

1396
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:42,805
the average person
isn't accustomed

1397
01:21:42,838 --> 01:21:47,509
to being around people of
such fine breeding of person.

1398
01:21:49,678 --> 01:21:51,614
Oh, I suppose you're right.

1399
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:54,516
But still, the way she was
pushing and shoving everyone.

1400
01:21:54,549 --> 01:21:56,251
It was a bit aggressive.

1401
01:21:56,284 --> 01:21:57,485
Where is she?

1402
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,387
You know what, I could
go for another one.

1403
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,156
Hey, yoo hoo!

1404
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,070
I could go for another
one of these drinky poos.

1405
01:22:06,294 --> 01:22:07,630
Over here.

1406
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:09,230
Hi.

1407
01:22:10,164 --> 01:22:11,566
Can, can I help you?

1408
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,719
I would like another one
of these delightful drinks.

1409
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:16,304
What do you call this?

1410
01:22:16,337 --> 01:22:17,405
Shirley Temple.

1411
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:19,240
It's very strong.

1412
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,174
Okay.

1413
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,565
Oh.

1414
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,668
- Here you go.
- Thank you, dear.

1415
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:47,168
You know, statistically,

1416
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:48,561
flying is the safest
way to travel.

1417
01:22:51,306 --> 01:22:53,541
Oh.

1418
01:23:07,355 --> 01:23:10,425
Welcome to
beautiful Los Angeles.

1419
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:16,497
The local time here is 12:47
and it's a balmy 79 degrees.

1420
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:18,667
Thanks for flying
Air Transylvania.

1421
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:20,234
Oh, here comes our luggage.

1422
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:22,705
Talk about service, he, he!

1423
01:23:28,543 --> 01:23:29,612
Um, where's Herman?

1424
01:23:30,779 --> 01:23:31,779
Herman!

1425
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,651
Here he comes.

1426
01:23:39,487 --> 01:23:40,487
Oh.

1427
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:47,427
I'll never

1428
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,264
drink another Shirley Temple

1429
01:23:51,499 --> 01:23:52,499
for as long as I live.

1430
01:23:54,803 --> 01:23:56,571
How do I know where they are?

1431
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:59,207
Maybe they got wise
to the situation.

1432
01:24:00,408 --> 01:24:01,968
That's true, they are
from Transylvania.

1433
01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:05,580
Oh, wait, wait a minute. I think
this is them.

1434
01:24:05,614 --> 01:24:06,782
Okay, I gotta go.

1435
01:24:06,815 --> 01:24:09,752
Time for me to work my magic.

1436
01:24:09,785 --> 01:24:11,419
Oh dear.

1437
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:17,760
Greetings from Transylvania.

1438
01:24:29,705 --> 01:24:31,539
That's a strange
way of saying hello.

1439
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,475
Oh, I guess we're gonna
have to get used to it.

1440
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:35,654
It ain't easy being beautiful.

1441
01:24:35,678 --> 01:24:38,714
Tell me about it. He, he!

1442
01:24:38,747 --> 01:24:40,515
Miss.

1443
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:41,482
Miss?

1444
01:24:41,516 --> 01:24:42,516
- Ah.
- Miss, wake up.

1445
01:24:46,722 --> 01:24:50,391
I assume you're
the ma, Munsters?

1446
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:51,760
I'm Herman.

1447
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:54,429
And this is my darling
better half Lily.

1448
01:24:54,462 --> 01:24:55,462
Hello.

1449
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,199
Oh, and that thing over there is

1450
01:24:58,867 --> 01:25:00,703
my father-in-law the Count.

1451
01:25:00,736 --> 01:25:02,303
Pleased to meet you.

1452
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,772
Oh yeah, uh.

1453
01:25:03,806 --> 01:25:04,606
Here you go.

1454
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,540
Here you go.

1455
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:06,842
- Ah!
- Oh.

1456
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:09,510
So nice to meet you in person.

1457
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,814
Those costumes really
threw me for a loop.

1458
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:15,617
And I thought I was
taking it to an extreme.

1459
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:19,387
Uh, well way to get in
the spirit of the day.

1460
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,420
Thank you.

1461
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:22,490
What spirit is that exactly?

1462
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:25,292
Oh, you!

1463
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:29,631
Okay, my car is parked
right out front.

1464
01:25:29,665 --> 01:25:31,734
I'm just gonna
grab my keys, okay.

1465
01:25:33,769 --> 01:25:37,505
I think when she said shocking
she meant gorgeous, huh?

1466
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,540
Bow-chica-wow-wow.

1467
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:42,678
Father, please keep
your fangs to yourself.

1468
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:44,412
Yeah, don't blow this.

1469
01:25:44,445 --> 01:25:45,814
Follow me.

1470
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:49,549
- Hi!
- Hey!

1471
01:25:57,425 --> 01:25:59,762
Lily, I want a picture of you.

1472
01:26:01,395 --> 01:26:02,597
I don't feel good.

1473
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,399
Oh, oh, oh!

1474
01:26:38,634 --> 01:26:40,936
Just in case you're wondering,

1475
01:26:40,969 --> 01:26:42,671
this is the party I'm
all gussied up for.

1476
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:45,573
The residents throw a big
Halloween bash every year.

1477
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:50,411
Boy we sure picked
a happening area.

1478
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:51,723
I'm getting a little
worried we might be

1479
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:54,415
too boring for this
hipster neighborhood.

1480
01:26:54,448 --> 01:26:55,651
Speak for yourself.

1481
01:26:55,684 --> 01:27:00,488
I'm always the first on the
dance floor at every funeral.

1482
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:01,521
I bet you are.

1483
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:07,528
Happy Halloween!

1484
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:09,932
Oh my, what beautiful children.

1485
01:27:09,965 --> 01:27:11,499
Trick or treat!

1486
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:12,710
Are you planning on having kids?

1487
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:13,845
Well, I'm a little
young for children.

1488
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:16,437
I'm only 150.

1489
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,873
Although, you know
what they say?

1490
01:27:17,906 --> 01:27:19,440
What, what's that?

1491
01:27:19,473 --> 01:27:21,509
150 is the new 100.

1492
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:23,578
Oh.

1493
01:27:23,612 --> 01:27:24,713
Oh!

1494
01:27:27,716 --> 01:27:28,784
You are a trip!

1495
01:27:29,885 --> 01:27:30,886
Ha, ha, ha!

1496
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:33,956
I'm a trip?

1497
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:35,724
Hollywood lingo.

1498
01:27:35,757 --> 01:27:36,757
Oh!

1499
01:27:39,895 --> 01:27:40,963
Well, what'd ya think?

1500
01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:41,864
Cute, right?

1501
01:27:41,897 --> 01:27:45,868
Oh my! Herman.

1502
01:27:47,468 --> 01:27:47,970
I know it.

1503
01:27:48,003 --> 01:27:48,971
It's perfect.

1504
01:27:49,004 --> 01:27:50,973
It's more than perfect.

1505
01:27:51,006 --> 01:27:52,608
It's breath taking.

1506
01:27:53,942 --> 01:27:55,744
I've always wanted
to be featured

1507
01:27:55,777 --> 01:27:57,445
in Better Tombs and Gardens.

1508
01:28:02,918 --> 01:28:06,021
Uh, okay, crazy jokesters.

1509
01:28:06,054 --> 01:28:07,054
Follow me.

1510
01:28:08,757 --> 01:28:10,792
Herman, why is
she walking towards

1511
01:28:10,826 --> 01:28:13,662
that hideous monstrosity?

1512
01:28:13,695 --> 01:28:15,964
I think Barbara is
trying to swindle us

1513
01:28:15,998 --> 01:28:18,599
into buying that abomination.

1514
01:28:18,634 --> 01:28:21,602
She must think we're yokels
straight off the garlic wagon.

1515
01:28:21,637 --> 01:28:24,538
Oh! Herman, deal with this.

1516
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:26,208
Show her who you're made of.

1517
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:27,843
Yeah, you're the
man of the house.

1518
01:28:29,077 --> 01:28:31,680
Look, Barbara.

1519
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,954
I must inform you
that we Munsters,

1520
01:28:39,988 --> 01:28:41,790
we're not born yesterday.

1521
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:43,725
I mean, some of my
parts were, of course.

1522
01:28:43,759 --> 01:28:45,526
But that's besides the point.

1523
01:28:47,062 --> 01:28:48,062
I want this house.

1524
01:28:49,698 --> 01:28:51,633
And I'm not gonna
pay more than...

1525
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:52,701
Sold.

1526
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:53,802
Please, please.

1527
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:55,871
Don't argue with me.

1528
01:28:55,904 --> 01:28:56,948
You'll only embarrass yourself.

1529
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:58,073
Let's be civilized.

1530
01:28:58,106 --> 01:28:59,507
Oh, whatever you say.

1531
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,909
The house is yours.

1532
01:29:00,943 --> 01:29:02,010
Ha!

1533
01:29:02,044 --> 01:29:03,044
Now, now.

1534
01:29:04,012 --> 01:29:05,614
You don't want me to get tough.

1535
01:29:06,815 --> 01:29:08,549
What?

1536
01:29:08,582 --> 01:29:10,986
Wait, what'd you just say?

1537
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:12,955
The house is yours.

1538
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:15,090
This place has been
a thorn in my butt

1539
01:29:15,123 --> 01:29:16,590
for the past two years.

1540
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,093
If you wanna buy
it and restore it

1541
01:29:18,126 --> 01:29:22,563
to its former glory, then
you just go for it, honey.

1542
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:25,834
And another thing, we
don't want one grave moved.

1543
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:27,803
We're very sociable people.

1544
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,571
Um, okay.

1545
01:29:30,604 --> 01:29:31,807
No problem.

1546
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,709
If you think it
looks wonderful now,

1547
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:35,978
just wait until we
get finished with it.

1548
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:38,046
Oo, I can't wait to
start poking around

1549
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,682
the backyard, who
knows who I might find!

1550
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:43,919
So, when do you wanna move in?

1551
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:47,022
Right now!

1552
01:30:06,608 --> 01:30:08,576
Well, now what?

1553
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:11,713
We've got the house
of our dreams,

1554
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:13,648
but we are flat broke.

1555
01:30:15,784 --> 01:30:17,686
I guess we all have to get jobs.

1556
01:30:18,754 --> 01:30:19,754
No, no, no.

1557
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:23,625
I'm the man of the house.

1558
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,030
Tomorrow I'll go
out and get a job.

1559
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:30,766
Doing what, exactly?

1560
01:30:33,368 --> 01:30:34,368
I don't know, I mean.

1561
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:37,906
I'm pretty sure any
business would wanna

1562
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:39,608
have me around the
office as eye candy.

1563
01:30:42,177 --> 01:30:43,177
What's that sound?

1564
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:46,181
You know what that sounds like?

1565
01:30:46,214 --> 01:30:47,214
A witch burning.

1566
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:56,390
Lily, come look!

1567
01:30:58,627 --> 01:31:00,147
Well, I guess we
should check it out.

1568
01:31:03,098 --> 01:31:04,099
Yeah, okay.

1569
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:09,236
Oh my.

1570
01:31:14,109 --> 01:31:16,812
I think now would
be the perfect time

1571
01:31:16,845 --> 01:31:18,122
to go out and introduce
ourselves to the neighbors.

1572
01:31:18,146 --> 01:31:20,082
That's a grand idea.

1573
01:31:20,115 --> 01:31:21,159
We don't want them thinking

1574
01:31:21,183 --> 01:31:22,017
that the Munsters are snobs.

1575
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:23,618
Speak for yourself.

1576
01:31:23,652 --> 01:31:25,687
We come from a long
line of blue bloods.

1577
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,756
Snobbery is in our veins.

1578
01:32:28,316 --> 01:32:29,818
Ho, ho, ho!

1579
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:30,851
Very good.

1580
01:32:32,053 --> 01:32:34,256
It is now time to
announce the winner.

1581
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:37,959
We have been secretly
monitoring your attire

1582
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:39,861
throughout the festivities

1583
01:32:39,895 --> 01:32:41,963
and have made our decisions.

1584
01:32:41,997 --> 01:32:45,167
And all decisions are final.

1585
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,737
Much like the icy
touch of the Grim Reaper.

1586
01:32:50,305 --> 01:32:52,841
That was a joke.

1587
01:32:55,243 --> 01:32:56,845
The winner is...

1588
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,882
The Munster family.

1589
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:01,916
Oh!

1590
01:33:12,894 --> 01:33:15,797
Herman, why is
everyone staring at us?

1591
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,499
I think we just won.

1592
01:33:17,532 --> 01:33:18,934
What did we win?

1593
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:21,236
Well, it's obviously
a beauty contest.

1594
01:33:21,269 --> 01:33:23,338
I say we grab the
dough and get outta here

1595
01:33:23,371 --> 01:33:25,774
before they change their mind.

1596
01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:28,877
Gaze upon these
glorious rags of horror.

1597
01:33:36,284 --> 01:33:39,221
Well, this is quite the welcome.

1598
01:33:39,254 --> 01:33:42,324
You see, my family
and I just moved

1599
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:45,827
to this neighborhood
only one hour ago.

1600
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,829
We are now the proud owner

1601
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:51,333
of that beautiful
little number 1313.

1602
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:56,838
This is my beautiful wife, Lily.

1603
01:33:56,871 --> 01:33:58,840
She's dressed to kill.

1604
01:33:58,873 --> 01:34:00,942
Unfortunately she
cooks the same way.

1605
01:34:06,248 --> 01:34:09,017
Oh honey, I think
that's quite enough.

1606
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,051
Okay, okay.

1607
01:34:10,085 --> 01:34:12,220
Hey everybody, thanks
so much for the mullah.

1608
01:34:12,254 --> 01:34:14,556
And if anyone's hiring,
my dopey son-in-law

1609
01:34:14,589 --> 01:34:15,857
is looking for a job.

1610
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,891
Okay, thank you.

1611
01:34:16,925 --> 01:34:18,293
Come on.

1612
01:34:18,326 --> 01:34:19,261
We're number one!

1613
01:34:19,294 --> 01:34:20,195
Okay.

1614
01:34:20,228 --> 01:34:21,228
We're number one!

1615
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,135
Oh my goodness, well I'll
have to visit you, thank you.

1616
01:34:27,168 --> 01:34:28,370
A ghost walks into the bar

1617
01:34:28,403 --> 01:34:30,138
and orders a shot of vodka.

1618
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:31,940
Listen, there's
no blood in this.

1619
01:34:31,973 --> 01:34:34,876
I don't know, someone's
playing a joke.

1620
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,077
Well, he is, and you know.

1621
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:39,881
The bartender says, sorry,
we don't serve spirits here.

1622
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,149
Ha, ha, ha!

1623
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,917
Oh you're.

1624
01:34:42,951 --> 01:34:44,152
Oh!

1625
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:45,387
Excuse me.

1626
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,155
Uh, Lily, all right.

1627
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:49,224
Why don't we go over here?

1628
01:34:49,257 --> 01:34:50,892
Yeah.

1629
01:34:50,925 --> 01:34:52,060
Yeah.

1630
01:34:52,093 --> 01:34:53,137
I've got a million,
believe me fellas.

1631
01:34:53,161 --> 01:34:55,063
You're gonna love this.

1632
01:34:55,096 --> 01:34:56,898
Oh.

1633
01:34:56,931 --> 01:34:59,267
Is it true you are looking
for gainful employment?

1634
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:02,037
Because if it is, we
might have something

1635
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,872
of interest to you.

1636
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:06,908
Well, I hope it's in the
entertainment business.

1637
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:09,444
No, we're in the
business of death.

1638
01:35:09,477 --> 01:35:13,882
The finest funeral parlor
in all of Mockingbird Heights.

1639
01:35:13,915 --> 01:35:15,150
I am Mr. Gateman.

1640
01:35:15,183 --> 01:35:16,351
I am Mr. Good bury.

1641
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:19,187
And I am Mr. Graves.

1642
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,220
Funeral parlor.

1643
01:35:21,956 --> 01:35:23,325
I think I could dig that.

1644
01:35:23,358 --> 01:35:27,128
We need a man to move some
of our larger, uh, clients

1645
01:35:27,162 --> 01:35:29,331
from box to box.

1646
01:35:29,364 --> 01:35:30,965
I've got experience in that.

1647
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,401
We don't like to leave
the stiffs lying around

1648
01:35:33,435 --> 01:35:36,171
for more than 48 hours or so.

1649
01:35:36,204 --> 01:35:39,174
They tend to ferment.

1650
01:35:39,207 --> 01:35:41,218
Have you fellas heard
about the new glass coffins?

1651
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:43,011
We have not.

1652
01:35:43,044 --> 01:35:45,013
Are they successful?

1653
01:35:45,046 --> 01:35:47,916
Remains to be
seen, Mr. Gateman.

1654
01:35:47,949 --> 01:35:49,284
Remains to be seen.

1655
01:35:58,259 --> 01:36:00,362
After you, my dear.

1656
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,302
Boy, what a fun group.

1657
01:36:09,137 --> 01:36:11,239
I have to admit, I
haven't had that much fun

1658
01:36:11,272 --> 01:36:13,408
since storming the Bastille.

1659
01:36:13,441 --> 01:36:15,210
Well, I don't
know about you two,

1660
01:36:15,243 --> 01:36:17,345
but I'm exhausted.

1661
01:36:17,379 --> 01:36:19,381
Those neighbors sure
can talk your ears off.

1662
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:22,250
Oh, what's wrong?

1663
01:36:22,283 --> 01:36:24,687
I'm just checking to see if my
ears are still there.

1664
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,121
I'd hate to lose one.

1665
01:36:26,154 --> 01:36:27,674
It makes my reading
glasses hang funny.

1666
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:32,394
Okay, I'm gonna hit the slab.

1667
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:33,427
Good nightmare.

1668
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:42,569
Oh! Garn, darn, darn!

1669
01:36:43,972 --> 01:36:44,506
Oh, Hermie.

1670
01:36:44,539 --> 01:36:45,907
You're so talented.

1671
01:36:49,978 --> 01:36:50,979
I lost you once,

1672
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:54,015
but now you belong
with the dead.

1673
01:36:54,048 --> 01:36:55,950
I want to live, even
in this strange...

1674
01:36:55,984 --> 01:36:56,984
Hoo yah!

1675
01:36:59,053 --> 01:37:01,523
Herman, what are you doing?

1676
01:37:01,556 --> 01:37:04,025
I'm just practicing a few moves.

1677
01:37:04,058 --> 01:37:07,162
Thursday night is league
night at the parlor.

1678
01:37:07,195 --> 01:37:08,563
Oh, I thought you hated bowling.

1679
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:11,332
Besides, you haven't even
started your new job yet.

1680
01:37:11,366 --> 01:37:13,134
I'm trying to get ready.

1681
01:37:13,168 --> 01:37:14,302
Can't let the fellas down.

1682
01:37:14,335 --> 01:37:16,337
I know but let's
not get carried away.

1683
01:37:25,046 --> 01:37:26,414
Come to bed, dear.

1684
01:37:26,448 --> 01:37:28,488
You don't wanna be tired
for your first day of work.

1685
01:37:28,516 --> 01:37:30,485
I really like
that Mr. Gateman.

1686
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:32,153
He paid me the
nicest compliment.

1687
01:37:33,154 --> 01:37:34,556
Oh, what was it?

1688
01:37:34,589 --> 01:37:38,326
He said, Munster, you
have a face for funerals.

1689
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:39,461
How sweet.

1690
01:37:39,494 --> 01:37:40,494
And how true.

1691
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,100
Still got it.

1692
01:37:56,244 --> 01:37:57,244
Mm!

1693
01:38:00,616 --> 01:38:02,618
So what do you have
planned for today?

1694
01:38:02,651 --> 01:38:05,487
Oh, I was gonna hang around
the house for a little while.

1695
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,088
See if I could figure out a way

1696
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:10,325
to turn Igor back
into his old self.

1697
01:38:10,358 --> 01:38:11,502
Oh, I kind of like the new Igor.

1698
01:38:11,526 --> 01:38:13,461
He's got a lot more pep.

1699
01:38:13,495 --> 01:38:15,396
Yeah.

1700
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,430
Bawk!

1701
01:38:17,398 --> 01:38:19,234
The time is... get to work.

1702
01:38:19,267 --> 01:38:21,302
Ya big dummy.

1703
01:38:21,336 --> 01:38:22,403
Nevermore.

1704
01:38:22,437 --> 01:38:25,006
Oh golly, I'm gonna be late.

1705
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,310
Don't forget your lunch.

1706
01:38:29,344 --> 01:38:32,146
I made you a special
surprise for your first day.

1707
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,316
Chocolate chip cookies
shaped like Mickey Mouse?

1708
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,551
You'll find out at lunch.

1709
01:38:39,387 --> 01:38:40,387
Gotta boogie.

1710
01:38:41,222 --> 01:38:42,223
Knock 'em dead!

1711
01:38:43,491 --> 01:38:45,193
I'm pretty sure
they already are.

1712
01:38:45,226 --> 01:38:47,462
It's always good
to double check.

1713
01:38:47,495 --> 01:38:48,495
Oh!

1714
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:50,532
Ho, ho!

1715
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:51,565
Have fun.

1716
01:38:56,404 --> 01:38:57,404
Ugh.

1717
01:39:08,483 --> 01:39:10,184
Oh bummer.

1718
01:39:10,218 --> 01:39:12,353
What a crummy day.

1719
01:39:35,476 --> 01:39:36,476
Ah!

1720
01:39:37,913 --> 01:39:39,247
Ah!

1721
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,280
Oh!

1722
01:39:44,485 --> 01:39:45,485
Ah!

1723
01:39:57,265 --> 01:39:58,266
Lily! Lily!

1724
01:39:58,299 --> 01:39:59,299
Come quick!

1725
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,536
911 emergency!

1726
01:40:01,569 --> 01:40:03,639
Car 54 where are you?

1727
01:40:04,773 --> 01:40:07,208
Herman, what is the matter?

1728
01:40:07,241 --> 01:40:09,277
It's a freak show out there.

1729
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:13,581
Everywhere ya look, it's
more horrible than the next.

1730
01:40:13,616 --> 01:40:16,551
I think we've been invaded
by outer space mutants.

1731
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:20,221
What are you talking about?

1732
01:40:20,254 --> 01:40:21,700
All the beautiful
people from last night

1733
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:26,160
have been replaced by
these hideous creatures.

1734
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:27,228
Oh, Herman.

1735
01:40:27,261 --> 01:40:29,230
Don't be so dramatic.

1736
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:31,299
Everybody looks different
in the daylight.

1737
01:40:31,332 --> 01:40:32,266
Let me take a look.

1738
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,636
No, don't.

1739
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:34,669
Don't! Don't!

1740
01:40:41,442 --> 01:40:42,442
I can't look.

1741
01:40:47,783 --> 01:40:48,783
The horror.

1742
01:40:57,392 --> 01:40:59,527
I for one just
don't understand it.

1743
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,963
Neither do I.

1744
01:41:00,996 --> 01:41:03,264
What happened to all the
hotties from last night?

1745
01:41:03,297 --> 01:41:04,432
What are we gonna do?

1746
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:06,267
We can't live like this

1747
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,444
with people that look like that.

1748
01:41:07,468 --> 01:41:09,270
I agree with my
favorite son-in-law.

1749
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:10,605
It's a disgrace.

1750
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:11,539
Yeah.

1751
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:12,708
Herman Munster!

1752
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:14,242
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

1753
01:41:14,275 --> 01:41:16,444
I expect this from
my father, but you?

1754
01:41:16,477 --> 01:41:18,681
Everyone can't be
as fortunate as us.

1755
01:41:18,714 --> 01:41:20,716
It's what's inside a
person that counts.

1756
01:41:26,487 --> 01:41:28,222
Well then I'm gonna need a pair

1757
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:30,358
of X-ray glasses because I
can't handle the outside.

1758
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:31,794
He's right.

1759
01:41:31,827 --> 01:41:34,697
I haven't seen anything that
gruesome in all of my lives.

1760
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,597
Oh no!

1761
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,366
It's one of those freaks!

1762
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:39,399
Don't answer.

1763
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:42,336
We are going to answer
that door as a family

1764
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:45,206
and greet whoever is
there as our equal.

1765
01:41:46,307 --> 01:41:47,307
Okay, but.

1766
01:41:48,877 --> 01:41:50,445
I hope this lessens the shock.

1767
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:54,816
Follow me.

1768
01:41:58,754 --> 01:42:00,288
Your wife is scary.

1769
01:42:01,355 --> 01:42:02,355
I know.

1770
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:06,762
Ugh.

1771
01:42:06,795 --> 01:42:07,795
Lily!

1772
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:10,665
Lester.

1773
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:15,303
What are you doing here?

1774
01:42:15,336 --> 01:42:17,405
You've got a lot of
nerve coming here, buster.

1775
01:42:18,707 --> 01:42:20,241
After what you pulled,

1776
01:42:21,509 --> 01:42:22,821
I ought a belt ya
right in the kisser.

1777
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:25,313
Herman, baby, before
you go all ape on me,

1778
01:42:25,346 --> 01:42:26,749
I got a surprise.

1779
01:42:26,782 --> 01:42:29,685
I made a killing in Vegas
after that castle deal.

1780
01:42:29,718 --> 01:42:30,786
And here's your share.

1781
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,667
What's it say?

1782
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,836
Come on, spit it out.

1783
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:48,870
Herman!

1784
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:50,705
I'm rich.

1785
01:42:51,807 --> 01:42:53,574
I'm rich! I'm rich!
- What?

1786
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:54,676
We're rich!

1787
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:55,778
We're rich!

1788
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,079
We're rich!

1789
01:42:57,112 --> 01:42:58,647
Oh, ho!

1789
01:42:59,305 --> 01:43:59,366
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
