<i>We come together today...</i>

4
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:56,784
<i>In dark times such as these,</i>

5
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:59,687
<i>we must all remember</i>

6
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,658
<i>to look
to the Lord for guidance.</i>

7
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,494
<i>Submit yourselves,
then, to God.</i>

8
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:07,595
<i>Amen.</i>

9
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,329
<i>Resist the Devil...</i>

10
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,699
<i>...and he will flee from you.</i>

11
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,134
<i>I regret to say</i>

12
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:18,171
<i>I know the powers
of Satan firsthand.</i>

13
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,173
<i>Our very own daughter
was taken</i>

14
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,776
<i>by perverts and swindlers</i>

15
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,278
<i>and let fall
into a world of sin.</i>

16
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,413
Sheriff?

17
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,749
<i>I hope...</i>

18
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,684
You ought to come take
a look at this.

19
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,486
My God.

20
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,327
Go easy on that stuff,
will ya?

21
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,163
You know what they say

22
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,466
about too much
of a good thing...

23
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,839
Give me some sugar.

24
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,619
You're special.

25
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,457
There ain't nobody else
out there like you.

26
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,328
Now giddyup.

27
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,363
Time is money.
Everybody is waiting.

28
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,877
You're a fucking sex symbol.

00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,402
Maxine.

52
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,075
<i>"The Farmer's Daughters."</i>

53
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:17,044
Oh, hot damn.
Look-it, there I am.

54
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:18,479
Wow.

55
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,681
Hollywood, here we come.

56
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,750
No, ma'am.
We don't need Hollywood.

57
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,553
These type of pictures
turn regular folks into stars.

58
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,621
We're gonna do it
all ourselves.

59
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,990
- Ain't that right, RJ?
- Yes, sir.

60
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,492
Finally,
a level playing field for people like us.

61
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,627
I don't know, Wayne.

62
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,428
Sounds an awful lot
like what you said

63
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:35,930
about <i>The Topless Carwash.</i>

64
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:36,798
You remember that?

65
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,332
Yeah.
And had the IRS not had

66
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,701
a goddamn personal vendetta
against me,

67
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,369
that would've panned out
beautifully.

68
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,437
Uh-huh.

69
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,807
Well, you know
I'm always game.

70
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
My American Dream
is not unreasonable.

71
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,911
I just want a paid-for house
with a big ole pool,

72
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,679
so I can float around
with my knees in the breeze

73
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,581
and tan these titties.

74
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,785
What? I was dealt a good hand.

75
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,387
People spend a lot of money
to look at what God gave me.

76
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,956
Be a sin
not to take care of 'em.

77
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,057
Mmm.

78
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,360
Yes, it sure would.

79
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,363
What about you, Maxine?

80
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,799
What's your American Dream?

81
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,801
Hmm.

82
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,171
Hurry it up, we aren't
gonna be long in there.

83
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,845
If this kid I picked up
from the university

84
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,680
can put it together
like he says,

85
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,916
our days of struggling
may soon be over.

86
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,051
We do even half the numbers
of <i>Debbie Does Dallas,</i>

87
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,553
I'm outta the red for good.

88
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,722
Hell, let's make
a picture a week, then.

89
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,956
Patience, darlin'.

90
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,126
I've been being patient
my whole life.

91
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,028
Well, that's the thing
about being patient.

92
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,832
- I need to be famous, Wayne.
- Mmm-hmm.

93
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm ready
for the high life.

94
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,469
I'm sick and tired of
never gettin' what I want.

95
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,205
Well, you help me keep those
jokers in line out there,

96
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,140
I'll make sure you get
everything your heart desires.

97
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,808
You better have.

98
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,443
I don't wanna worry
no more, Wayne.

99
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:32,647
I deserve nice things.
I have cosmopolitan taste.

100
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,815
- Don't I know it.
- I mean it.

101
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,118
I want the whole world
to know my name.

102
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,453
Like Lynda Carter
or some shit.

103
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,621
Hey, everyone with a pulse

104
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,823
is gonna lust
after a piece of Maxine Minx

105
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,191
once they see what you can do.

106
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,660
You know why?

107
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,963
Why?

108
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,898
'Cause you got
that X factor.

109
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,035
Fuckin'-A-right.

110
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,503
Now, mosey on over there

111
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,538
and grab us some Wonder
Bread, Wonder Woman.

112
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,810
I don't
like his girlfriend.

113
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,845
You don't like
anybody's girlfriend.

114
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,715
She hardly says a word.
She just stares at everyone.

115
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,183
Well, she's shy.

116
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,686
Probably ain't never seen
nobody like us before.

117
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,854
People who stare
give me the heebie-jeebies.

118
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:14,922
Better get used to that

119
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,490
if you're gonna be
in the movies.

120
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,802
Your little boyfriend
is cute.

121
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,838
You help him
with all his films?

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,909
Sometimes, yeah.

123
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,613
Is that your boyfriend?

124
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,019
Sometimes, yeah.

125
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,924
Hey, how come you don't gotta
film none of this in order?

126
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,258
Well, once I have it all
in the can,

127
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,727
I can rearrange it
however I want.

128
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,261
No shit.

129
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:55,796
I actually intend
on experimenting

130
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,764
a lot with
the film's editing.

131
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,033
Giving it a certain sense
of the avant-garde,

132
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,201
like they're doing in France.

133
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,969
It's classier that way.

134
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,071
And it's a good trick
to disguise the low budget.

135
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,040
All right,
let's slate it.

136
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,580
And hit it.

137
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,156
All right,
go ahead and fill her up.

138
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,163
You know,

139
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,265
if you tilt the camera up

140
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,300
from the nozzle...

141
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,603
...it'll look
like he's using his cock.

142
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,858
See? I got good sense, too.

143
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:02,963
How come
we couldn't do

144
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,698
any of this filming
in Houston?

145
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:05,633
Ain't they got
plenty of farms?

146
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,002
Well, this county
raised property taxes,

147
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,771
a little bit of cash
goes a long way out here.

148
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,872
Most older folks
can't compete

149
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,974
with the bigger outfits
no more.

150
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,143
Now, we're not the only ones
trying to make a buck.

151
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,646
<i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

152
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,980
<i>sex fiends...</i>

153
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,916
<i>All the result</i>

154
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,219
<i>of our increasingly
secular society...</i>

155
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,387
Besides, it ain't
exactly something

156
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,255
I wanna advertise around town.

157
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,657
You know how
some people can get

158
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,025
when it comes to sex.

159
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,093
<i>Remember
what happened</i>

160
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,128
<i>in Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

161
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,632
- Get what we needed?
- Oh, I got it.

162
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,669
Thanks to help
from yours truly.

163
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,371
- Got my smokes?
- Yes. God damn.

164
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,140
I'm just askin'.

165
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,908
Hey, if I'm gonna be
having sex for you,

166
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,376
I'm gonna
need cigarettes.

167
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,813
How's the script?

168
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,916
I don't know.
It's all right.

169
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,352
Does it matter?

170
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,988
Hey, I don't wanna have
to wear a hard hat

171
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,756
to make a livin', do you?

172
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,059
No.

173
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,193
Then don't you be
bringin' down the vibe

174
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,328
of my investments.

175
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,064
Negativity attracts
negative results.

176
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:18,139
Winstons? You know
I only smoke Old Golds.

177
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,907
All they had,
Bobby-Lynne.

178
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,243
That's it.
I'm calling my agent.

179
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,945
Just get back
in the dang van.

180
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,282
Mmm-mmm!

181
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,888
<i>That's right.</i>

182
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,457
<i>The deviants are
already amongst us,</i>

183
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,225
<i>waiting for our sons
and daughters.</i>

184
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,462
<i>So, heed dire warnings,</i>

185
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:43,964
<i>and repent
before it is too late.</i>

186
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,267
<i>He may be a forgiving God,</i>

187
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,838
<i>but every man
has got his limits.</i>

188
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,122
Must be a bad wreck.

189
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,356
<i>Y'all stay safe out there.</i>

190
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,859
<i>I'll be right back
with some more golden oldies</i>

191
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,327
<i>right after
this commercial break.</i>

192
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,796
<i>93.5, KBQB.</i>

193
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,402
<i>...the 60th anniversary</i>

194
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,037
<i>...take place this Saturday.</i>

195
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,207
<i>Don't miss your chance
to tour the entire state...</i>

196
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,153
- What is it?
- Oh, don't look.

197
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,988
I hate blood and guts.

198
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,525
Just when you thought

199
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,125
you'd escaped
the slaughterhouse.

200
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,961
Yeah.

201
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,395
<i>Now, that's a bonanza...</i>

202
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,831
Was that the...

203
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,121
This is it.
Our own studio backlot.

204
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,023
Thank goodness.
I'm horny.

205
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,926
- You're always horny.
- No, not always.

206
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,197
It's perfect.

207
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,399
It's really gonna
add a lot of production value.

208
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:04,038
Y'all stay put
while I go

209
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,072
and handle business
right quick.

210
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,639
This wasn't I had in mind

211
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,373
when I agreed to help out
on your film.

212
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,208
Gotta start somewhere,
Lorraine.

213
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,110
RJ, it's smut.

214
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,146
When did you become
such a prude?

215
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,083
I'm not.

216
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,486
I just don't understand
why you're doing all this.

217
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,388
Because it is possible
to make a good dirty movie.

218
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,335
Who's that?

219
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,874
Yes, sir. It's Wayne Galleroy.
We spoke on the telephone.

220
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,089
Uh...

221
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,925
Howard, right?

222
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:34,995
You from the county?

223
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,198
This here's private property.

224
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:41,436
Didn't you see the signs
down at the end of the drive?

225
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,271
Oh, easy, partner.

226
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:53,681
Somethin's wrong.

227
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,518
What'chu talkin' 'bout?

228
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,327
You're trespassing.
The law says I can shoot.

229
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,964
Sir, I ain't from the county.

230
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,233
I'm from Houston.

231
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,103
We spoke on Tuesday.
You remember?

232
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,506
About y'all's boarding house.

233
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,710
Oh, that's right.

234
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:25,279
You're looking
for a place to stay.

235
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:32,587
Well, you never can be
too careful with strangers.

236
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:37,559
You had me
pretty nervous there.

237
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,561
It ain't even loaded.

238
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,361
Most of the times,

239
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,565
just wavin' it around
is all it takes.

240
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, yes, sir.

241
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,572
I keep the same thing
in my glove box.

242
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,275
Wow,
that's one ugly sumbitch.

243
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,979
What?

244
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,615
He is.

245
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,466
Hell of a spread
you got here.

246
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,837
We like it.

247
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,554
You all right there,
old-timer?

248
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,256
I'm fine.

249
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,812
- She ain't much.
- She's gorgeous.

250
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:19,754
Building was for soldiers
during the Civil War.

251
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,457
They never saw
any action though.

252
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,124
What about you?

253
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,461
You serve?

254
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,464
Flat feet.

255
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:32,900
I did.
Two tours in South Vietnam.

256
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:33,768
Had enough farmers

257
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:36,136
tryin' to shoot me
for one lifetime.

258
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:39,574
Know what I mean, Pops?

259
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:40,875
Oorah.

260
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:49,584
Oh, careful, Howie.

261
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,452
Hot damn,
that's my future fiancee

262
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:52,487
you're eyeballin' there.

263
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:55,423
Been a while

264
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,190
since you seen
anythin' that nice?

265
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,793
I don't recall
you mentioning

266
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,828
you'd bringing
all these others.

267
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,865
Now, about that...

268
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:07,367
See, your ad said $30, but...

269
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:10,438
I threw in a little extra
to sweeten the deal.

270
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,739
I hope that's okay.

271
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,516
I don't think
I like you, Wayne.

272
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:25,753
In fact,

273
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,221
I don't much like the looks
of none of y'all.

274
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:29,924
Now, my wife is next door,

275
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:33,494
so I would appreciate
a little discretion.

276
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,632
I give you my word.

277
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,502
You won't even know
we're here.

278
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,844
That was
some stellar negotiating.

279
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,879
You really do have
a knack for business.

280
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:53,280
You keep jawin', towhead,

281
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,416
I'll pull you off
the main stage for a month.

282
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,617
Oh, but then, honey,

283
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,419
you won't make
no money neither.

284
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,554
How could you
just stand there

285
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:00,788
and let him talk
about us like that?

286
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,856
Oh, calm down.

287
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,290
Ain't no need
to harsh the mellow.

288
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,759
It's harmless.
He's just old.

289
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,293
His pecker ain't
probably been hard

290
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,360
since before you were born.

291
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,262
I'd hate people
like us then, too.

292
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,832
He don't know
what we're doing, does he?

293
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,837
So, church mouse,
you do speak.

294
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:22,375
No.

295
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,846
He sure doesn't.

296
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,415
And I intend
to keep it that way.

297
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:29,650
Now, I don't wanna give
the old codger a heart attack.

298
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,487
Would you?

299
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,888
It's better to beg
for forgiveness

300
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,322
than ask for permission.

301
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,624
You know what I mean?

302
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:40,260
All right.

303
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:43,598
That's enough jabberin'.

304
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,067
I reckon it's about high time
we cut to the chase

305
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,969
and we give the people
what they wanna see.

306
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:49,804
What do you say?

307
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,006
Fucking finally!

308
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,834
Okay. Now...
Now flip her over.

309
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:21,769
Ooh!

310
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,814
Oh, yeah.
Fuck me.

311
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,482
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

312
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:35,550
That's great.

313
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,418
Just scooch your chin up
for me.

314
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,387
All right,
now slow it all down.

315
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,757
- I wanna see the passion.
- Hey, kid.

316
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,026
How about you just
point the camera

317
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,427
and stay in your lane.

318
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,929
Let me do the screwing here.

319
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:56,604
Yeah!

320
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,706
Yes!

321
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:16,624
Oh, my God.

322
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,284
<i>Now,
I may not know shit from Shinola</i>

323
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,151
when it comes to filmmaking,

324
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,020
but I know for damn sure
people are gonna

325
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,688
wanna see
what I just saw in there.

326
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:28,756
Well, that's
'cause I'm not treatin' it

327
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,992
like pornography,
but as cinema.

328
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:33,961
That's what these other
adult films are lackin'.

329
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:37,098
Whatever you're doin',
you keep doin' it.

330
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,967
People's eyes
are gonna pop out

331
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:42,036
of their damn skulls
when they see this.

332
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,237
We're gonna be rich.

333
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,972
Feel how hard my cock is.

334
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,291
Oh, sorry, baby.

335
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,564
Don't be standing there

336
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,299
like you're all proud
of yourself.

337
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,602
I was born
for this line of work.

338
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:18,272
Uh. You didn't
do nothin', dummy.

339
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,642
It's called actin'.

340
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,578
You good,
but you ain't that good.

341
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,155
Fuck my pussy.

342
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:36,223
Oh, you make me so wet.

343
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:38,759
Oh, my God, you're so big.

344
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:45,733
Aw, don't look so glum.

345
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,968
You did just fine. Come here.

346
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:53,307
I think I love you.

347
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:55,976
Bless your heart.

348
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,910
<i>And action!</i>

349
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,018
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

350
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,288
but my van broke down
on the highway back yonder,

351
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,255
and I was hopin'

352
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,124
I could use y'all's phone
to call for help.

353
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:54,261
Oh, my goodness.

354
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:57,364
I'm afraid we don't own
a telephone,

355
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,099
but my daddy
will be home soon,

356
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:02,136
and I'm sure he could give you
a lift to town.

357
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,738
Would you like to come inside?

358
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,777
Much obliged.

359
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:41,503
Hello?

360
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,872
Hello?

361
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,170
Lemonade?

362
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,955
Sure is hot out there.

363
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,991
You must be awful thirsty.

364
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,293
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,037
It's got a good taste.

366
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,553
I should probably
get back now.

367
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,456
My boyfriend gets real fussy

368
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,156
when he don't know
where I'm at, so...

369
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:33,408
Come with me
before Daddy gets home.

370
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:56,063
I was young once, too.

371
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,169
It was taken
right before the first war.

372
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,710
Believe it or not,
my Howard served in both.

373
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:13,247
He survived the trenches
and Omaha Beach.

374
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,450
There wasn't anything

375
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,317
he wouldn't do for me
back then.

376
00:35:26,427 --> 00:35:27,795
That's the power of beauty.

377
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,032
I was a dancer
in those early years.

378
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,236
But then the war came, so...

379
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,407
Not everything in life
turns out how you expect.

380
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,350
Such a special face.

381
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,291
Beautiful.

382
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:00,762
Look.

383
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,714
I don't know
what's come over me.

384
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:22,316
I've never quite
felt like this before.

385
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:26,153
If Daddy catches us,

386
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,757
<i>there's no telling
what he might do.</i>

387
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:34,862
What are you doing?

388
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,239
You should go.

389
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,711
It will be our secret.

390
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:51,846
What will?

391
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:53,848
Shh.

392
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,720
Watch out!

393
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:35,857
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

394
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,958
Sorry.

395
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,292
The kid says
we're gonna lose the light!

396
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,728
Well, come on now,
chop-chop.

397
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,510
<i>You're not good.
Bluff it.</i>

398
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,312
<i>You're a fucking sex symbol.</i>

399
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:09,322
I will not accept a life
I do not deserve.

400
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:49,329
Are you ready?

401
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:57,572
Let's go to work.

402
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:23,431
Coast is clear.

403
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:24,866
- Right...
- Sound speed.

404
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,001
Okay, we're rollin'.

405
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,870
<i>Farmer's Daughter,</i> take one.

406
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,010
Action.

407
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,949
I'm looking
for the owner of this farm.

408
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,619
His daughter said I could
find him in here.

409
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:47,354
You must have been
talking to my sister.

410
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,489
Sister?

411
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:51,826
- She didn't mention you.
- Not surprised.

412
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:55,429
She's always been jealous.

413
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:58,666
I'm younger,
get all the attention.

414
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:03,037
Daddy never lets her
leave the farm anymore.

415
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:07,041
He's very protective.

416
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,810
Well, I was hopin'
he could give me a ride

417
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,912
back to town
before it got dark.

418
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,820
We shouldn't disturb him.

419
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,556
It would only make him angry.

420
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:25,325
You wouldn't like Daddy
when he's angry.

421
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,033
I could give you a ride.

422
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:09,683
We talked about this.

423
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,587
Howard?

424
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:15,222
Please.

425
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,698
You know I can't.

426
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,333
My heart...

427
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:53,027
<i>♪ They're gonna put me
in the movies</i>

428
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,630
<i>♪ They're gonna make
a big star out of me</i>

429
00:44:57,998 --> 00:45:00,034
<i>♪ They'll make

430
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,370
<i>♪ Who's sad and lonely</i>

431

<i>♪ And all I gotta do
is act naturally ♪</i>

432
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:09,310
You were amazing out there.

433
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,879
Now I know why Wayne
left his wife for you.

434
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,115
So do I.

435
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,116
Careful.

436
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:17,718
Told y'all
she was somethin' special.

437
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:18,919
X factor.

438
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:21,856
Thanks, baby.

439
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:35,002
What are you
looking at?

440
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,370
Wait, come on now.

441
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:38,005
No, Wayne.

442
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,974
Anybody ever teach you
not to stare?

443
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:41,675
It's rude.

444
00:45:42,877 --> 00:45:44,778
You got somethin' to say to me
or what?

445
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:45,813
No.

446
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:51,318
Well,
I do have a question.

447
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:53,421
See,
she's interested, is all.

448
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:55,256
What's on your mind,
church mouse?

449
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:57,158
Isn't it strange

450
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:59,193
watching her doin' it
with him?

451
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:01,362
It's just business.

452
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:03,764
As long as the camera
is runnin'.

453
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:05,699
So the camera
changes things?

454
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:06,800
That's right.

455
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,002
It's not real life, Raine.

456
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:09,404
It's just a movie.

457
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:11,406
I know that.

458
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:15,075
Just sayin'.

459
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,178
What about love?

460
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:18,480
What about love?

461
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:19,880
Well, don't y'all
believe in it?

462
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,449
Of course we believe in love.

463
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:22,783
How can you love someone

464
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:24,185
and still be
with other people?

465
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:25,052
You think we don't have

466
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:26,720
no morals or somethin',
is that it?

467
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:28,856
No. No, I just...

468
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:31,392
Take it from me,
letting outdated traditions

469
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:33,495
control how you live your
life will get you nowhere.

470
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:34,496
I don't know about you,
but I got

471
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:36,797
better places to be
than where I came from.

472
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,965
Amen to that.

473
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,900
And besides,
it's just sex.

474
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:40,968
You can decide
who you wanna love,

475
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,269
but not who you wanna screw.

476
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,338
Attraction's
out of our control.

477
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:47,074
It ain't healthy keeping those
feelings locked away inside.

478
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:47,975
I seen you sneaking

479
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,478
a few long peeks
at Jackson over here.

480
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:53,314
- No, I... I wasn't looking...
- It's okay.

481
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:54,815
He don't mind none.

482
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:56,050
She's right.

483
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:57,985
I don't mind.

484
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,254
No offense.

485
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,424
Everybody likes sex.

486
00:47:02,457 --> 00:47:03,958
It's a gas.

487
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,260
We're just not afraid
to admit it.

488
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:08,996
Queer, straight,
Black, white...

489
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,931
It's all disco.

490
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:13,167
You know why?
Because one day,

491
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,302
we're gonna be too old
to fuck.

492
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:17,771
And life's too short,
if you ask me.

493
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:19,306
Roger that.

494
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,275
The fact
of the truth of the matter is,

495
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:22,943
we turn folks on.

496
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:28,015
- And that scares 'em.
- They can't look away neither.

497
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:29,984
That's right.

498
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,554
We're like a foxy car wreck.

499
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:34,221
Which is how I know

500
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:37,157
that this new home video
market is set to explode.

501
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,494
Finally, people are gonna
get to see what they desire

502
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:42,896
in the privacy of their
own homes, free of judgment.

503
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,332
We're gonna give that to them
before anyone else.

504
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:46,468
Porn ain't only gonna be

505
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,436
- for perverts no more.
- Aw.

506
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,303
Toast to the perverts.

507
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:51,406
They've been payin'
our bills for years.

508
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:53,441
Hear, hear!
To the perverts!

509
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:55,209
To livin' a life
of excess,

510
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:58,879
being young and having fun
till the day we die.

511
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:00,981
To the power
of independent cinema.

512
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:02,850
To living life
on our own terms.

513
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:03,917
And never accepting what

514
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,953
self-righteous naysayers
have to say.

515
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:08,022
Right on.

516
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,391
I don't know
if I agree with all of that,

517
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:13,495
but I did like
what I saw today.

518
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,365
I didn't think I would,
but I did.

519
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:19,567
Cheers to that.

520
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,936
- You ready?
- Yeah.

I wanna do a scene
in the movie.

540
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:44,044
What?

541
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:49,484
I wanna be in the movie.

542
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:52,219
No.

543
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:57,492
Well, why not?

544
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,195
Well...

545
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,296
Because...

546
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:04,432
No.

547
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,703
Did y'all put her up to this
or somethin'?

548
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:10,037
- No!
- Hey!

549
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,773
Take it easy.
They didn't do nothin'.

550
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:13,373
Nobody put me up
to anything.

551
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:15,309
I've been thinking
about it all day.

552
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:16,376
And...

553
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:18,580
Well, I'm young.

554
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:21,315
And if we really are makin'
a good dirty movie,

555
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,217
then I don't wanna
just carry the equipment.

556
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:25,687
I wanna be in it.

557
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:27,988
Well, you can't.

558
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,091
Says who?

559
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:34,496
It's my film, Lorraine.

560
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,196
I mean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

561
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,165
We've already shot half of it.

562
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:41,201
The story can't just suddenly
change midway through.

563
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,304
Why?

564
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,675
Because it just isn't done.

565
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:51,345
What about in <i>Psycho?</i>
You love that movie.

566
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:57,585
Well, <i>Psycho</i> is a horror film.

567
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:01,054
And that plot was a MacGuffin
to build suspense.

568
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:02,624
And I'm not making
that kind of movie.

569
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:04,124
Oh, come on, RJ.

570
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,360
Nobody's comin'
to see this film for the plot.

571
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,429
They're comin'
to see tits and ass.

572
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,232
- And a big dick.
- Lorraine!

573
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:13,367
It's the truth.

574
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:16,638
Why not just give the people
what they're payin' for?

575
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,072
Because I'm making
something better than that.

576
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,610
When did you become
such a prude?

577
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,714
All right, hold on.

578
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:30,518
I am the executive producer,
which means I get a word.

579
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:32,420
So, why don't we just
take a step outside

580
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:35,322
before anythin' gets said
that someone might regret.

581
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:45,567
You gotta back me up
in here, Wayne!

582
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,834
I mean,
this situation is fixin'

583
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:49,269
to get outta control.
It is awfully close.

584
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:50,838
Relax.

585
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:53,106
Hey, what is it they say,
"Life imitates art"?

586
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,108
It's the other way around.

587
00:52:55,142 --> 00:52:56,209
Whatever, it don't matter.

588
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,244
But you need
to listen to me, okay?

589
00:52:57,277 --> 00:53:00,615
Because you ain't been 42,
and I have been 23.

590
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:02,182
And I'm gonna explain
somethin' to you

591
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:03,685
about young women.

592
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:05,285
Now, if she's serious,

593
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:08,388
which I suspect she is,

594
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:12,159
she's gonna do it
whether you like it or not.

595
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,596
Now, you try to stop her,
not only is she gonna do it,

596
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:16,831
she's gonna go on and do it
with God knows how many people

597
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,265
in God knows
how many other films,

598
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:19,734
and nobody wants that.

599
00:53:20,602 --> 00:53:21,636
The way I see it,

600
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,605
you only got
one good option here.

601
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:26,239
What, letting her get balled
by some man whore?

602
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:27,909
Come on now,
Jackson is a professional.

603
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,744
He ain't got no diseases
or nothin'.

604
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:31,613
You just want more sex
in the movie.

605
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:33,681
That ain't me, hoss.
She wants it, you heard her.

606
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:36,484
Heck, if she does great,

607
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,586
she gets famous,
maybe she'll take you with her.

608
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:41,823
Wayne, you don't get it.

609
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,860
Lorraine is not
like the others in there.

610
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,161
She is a nice girl.

611
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:51,833
I beg your pardon?

612
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,835
No, I didn't mean it
like that.

613
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:57,237
Oh, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

614
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:01,241
but ain't none of them
nice girls.

615
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:11,966
To hell with this.

616
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:13,366
She can have it.

617
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:14,769
Let's see how far they get
without me.

618
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,571
Good luck finding

619
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:17,772
your own way out of here.

620
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:29,382
What the...

621
00:57:42,496 --> 00:57:43,631
Ma'am?

622
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:55,943
Are you all right?

623
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,555
Sorry, I'm...

624
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,567

00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:36,083
What?

626
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:38,686
How come you just did that?

627
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:43,724
Why won't you look at me?

628
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:46,427
Look at me
like you looked at her.

629
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:48,529
What?

630
00:58:48,562 --> 00:58:50,564
I can show you
what I'm capable of.

631
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:52,500
Stop. I don't
wanna see it.

632
00:58:57,138 --> 00:59:00,207
Maybe we should just go
find your husband.

633
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:36,711
Help me.

634

01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:24,805
RJ?

641
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:34,008
Hey, hey, hey.

642
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,243
What's goin' on,
church mouse?

643
01:04:36,277 --> 01:04:40,415
It's RJ.
I woke up, and he was gone.

I...

645
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:45,219

01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:48,322
Well, the van's still here.

647
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:50,824
He's gotta be around
somewhere.

648
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:59,033
Oh, hey, it ain't
like your dog ran off.

649
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,368
He's probably just
processin' things, you know?

650
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,270
Go on back to bed.

651
01:05:03,304 --> 01:05:06,840
I feel bad if I hurt him.
I don't wanna break up.

652
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:09,276
Hun, you didn't
do nothin' wrong.

653
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,978
He'll get over it.

654
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:13,347
He just needs
to toughen up, is all.

655
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,982
Come on. I'll talk to him
in the morning.

656
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,452
Will you
help me find him?

657
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,388
Please? I'm worried.

658
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:26,327
All right.

659
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,029
I ain't gettin' in the middle
of no more of this shit.

660
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,542
RJ!

661
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:44,111
Are you in here, brother?

662
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:46,581
This ain't the way
to go about handlin' this.

663
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,327
Oh, no.

664
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,404
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

665
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:11,338
What are you
doin' out here?

666
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,444
I'm lookin' for my boyfriend.

667
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:26,086
Have you seen
my wife?

668
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,288
No, sir.

669
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,898
Two keys to keepin'
a healthy relationship.

670
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,002
Never let a good woman
out of your sight.

671
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:45,407
Never mention her weight.

672
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,242
How do you think
I've been surrounded

673
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:51,311
by so many beautiful females
my whole life?

674
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:53,914
There's an art to it.

675
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:56,917
Just like business.

676
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:11,633
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

677
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,280
Oh, fuck me!

678
01:07:28,483 --> 01:07:32,420
Oh, shut up, cheeseburger!
Go wander into traffic.

679
01:07:32,454 --> 01:07:35,022
Oh, fuck.

680
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:42,497
RJ, you in here?

681
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,399
I stepped on a nail.

682
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:48,168
Come on out and help me,
for Christ's sake!

683
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,739
I'm gonna catch tetanus
from this shit.

684
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:04,051
RJ?

685
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:08,388
Church mouse, that you?

686
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,339
There's another light
down in the cellar.

687
01:08:59,373 --> 01:09:00,608
Can you go get it?

688
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:05,345
Please. My wife is not well.

689
01:09:05,379 --> 01:09:06,681
It's very dark,

690
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:09,417
and I'm worried she could fall
and break her hip.

691
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:29,336
Downstairs.
You'll see my workbench.

692
01:11:16,511 --> 01:11:17,645
Found it!

693
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:33,628
Hey, I'm locked in!

694
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:39,366
Hey!

695
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:44,539
Hey! Hey! Open up!

696
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,441
What is it, baby?

697
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:56,677
Thought I heard somethin'.

698
01:12:59,346 --> 01:13:00,648
Probably nothin'.

699
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:03,851
Old habits die hard.

700
01:13:05,086 --> 01:13:06,554
Go back to sleep.

701
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,657
Aye, aye, captain.

702
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:08,816
Everything okay, Pops?

703
01:14:11,519 --> 01:14:14,455
My wife, she's gone missing.

704
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:15,556
Missin'?

705
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:18,826
She gets confused.

706
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,996
It happens sometimes
after dark.

707
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:24,465
Lot of firepower
for a missin' wife.

708
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,034
It's for gators.

709
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:30,404
I found her once
by the edge of our pond.

710
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:32,039
If she was to fall in...

711
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:37,011
Want some help?

712
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:42,483
Not for self
but for country, right?

713
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,688
Let me go and get my skivvies.

714
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:33,788
I say we each
take a side of the perimeter.

715
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,890
Cover ground quicker that way.

716
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:37,892
I only got
the one light.

717
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,662
No offense,

718
01:17:41,695 --> 01:17:43,964
but it's been a while
since you was deployed.

719
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:46,133
I spent three nights face down
in a rice paddy

720
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:48,235
scanning for land mines
and trip wires.

721
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:51,172
Once a marine,
always a marine.

722
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:53,674
If she's out here...

723
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:56,243
I'll find her.

724
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:00,901
I got nothin', Pops.

725
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:10,244
Shit.

726
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:14,381
What you doing
all the way in there?

727
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:30,264
Oh, no.

728
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,335
Pops, you okay?

729
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,036
You in here?

730
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:41,443
Help!
Help, somebody, please!

731
01:20:41,476 --> 01:20:43,110
Please help me!

732
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:46,046
RJ!

733
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:49,016
Help!

734
01:21:27,187 --> 01:21:29,256
Oh, shit!

735
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:32,159
You scared me, Pops.

736
01:21:32,192 --> 01:21:35,095
Once a marine,
always a marine.

737
01:21:36,163 --> 01:21:37,164
Well...

738
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:39,933
Your lady ain't in there.

739
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:42,936
I can't give her
what she wants anymore.

740
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:47,475
You don't understand
what it's like.

741
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:49,577
You can still do
as you please.

742
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,378
Say what?

743
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:55,115
The last bohemian
that stayed here was the same.

744
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:58,520
Traipsin' around
in barely any clothes.

745
01:21:58,553 --> 01:22:00,455
Enticin' my wife.

746
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:04,191
Yeah...

747
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:06,628
Okay, well,

748
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:08,329
we better get back up
to the house

749
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,197
and find out what's goin' on.

750
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,000
I know exactly
what's goin' on.

751
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:05,919
Maxine?

752
01:23:08,122 --> 01:23:11,258
That woman was in my bed
touching me!

753
01:23:44,426 --> 01:23:46,160
You're just
makin' things worse.

754
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:47,595
Help me!

755
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:49,531
Somebody! Please!

756
01:23:49,564 --> 01:23:51,466
Nobody is comin' for ya.

757
01:23:51,499 --> 01:23:54,402
Get back down in that cellar
and be quiet!

758
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:01,975
- Shut up!
- Help!

759
01:24:02,009 --> 01:24:05,513
- Hey! Somebody, please!
- <i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

760
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:07,147
<i>sex fiends,</i>

761
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:08,248
<i>lurkin' where
we least expect...</i>

762
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:09,316
Help!

763
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:12,052
- Somebody, help!
- <i>...in good Christian homes,</i>

764
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:14,388
<i>right under our very noses!</i>

765
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:22,196
Jackson?

766
01:24:23,465 --> 01:24:24,466
Wayne?

767
01:24:25,365 --> 01:24:26,434
Where are y'all?

768
01:24:44,552 --> 01:24:45,587
Oh, my goodness.

769
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:47,522
Ma'am?

770
01:24:47,555 --> 01:24:50,224
Ma'am? Be careful!

771
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:53,093
Step away from the edge,
it's dangerous.

772
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:57,665
It's all right. Here, here.

773
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:00,468
You're safe now, okay?

774
01:25:00,502 --> 01:25:03,505
Are you hurt?
I don't see anything.

775
01:25:03,538 --> 01:25:05,807
My nana gets confused
sometimes as well.

776
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,475
I learned all about it.

777
01:25:07,509 --> 01:25:08,576
Believe it or not,
I've even thought

778
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:10,210
about becomin' a nurse
one day.

779
01:25:10,244 --> 01:25:11,278
So...

780
01:25:11,311 --> 01:25:12,547
Okay. Why don't you
come with...

781
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,114
Oh!

782
01:25:15,315 --> 01:25:16,551
What the hell
did you do that for?

783
01:25:16,584 --> 01:25:19,420
I don't need a nurse.

784
01:25:19,454 --> 01:25:21,321
Why should you get
to have it all?

785
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:24,124
What have you ever done
except be a whore?

786
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:28,195
Okay, you know what?

787
01:25:28,228 --> 01:25:30,598
You don't want my help?
No problem.

788
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:32,634
I was just tryin' to be nice.

789
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:35,335
You don't deserve
to be able to just flaunt it

790
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:37,405
in my face like you do.

791
01:25:37,438 --> 01:25:40,608
It ain't my fault you didn't
live the life you wanted.

792
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:43,811
Now move
out of the way, please.

793
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,416
Move! You mean old ugly b...

794
01:25:55,557 --> 01:25:56,691
Bitch.

795
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:22,784
Was that the one?

796
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:26,219
You know I don't like blondes.

797
01:26:43,504 --> 01:26:45,105
Disgustin'.

798
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,348
Lorraine?

799
01:26:55,483 --> 01:26:56,484
RJ?

800
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,689
Uh, place is empty.

801
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,391
What about
that other fella, Wayne?

802
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:14,696
In the barn.
Stuck like the pig he was.

803
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:18,398
Well, that's three down.

804
01:28:18,433 --> 01:28:20,501
Four.

805
01:28:20,535 --> 01:28:23,638
And I got another
kept up at the house for you.

806
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,272
I don't want her.

807
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:27,542
This one was different.

808
01:28:27,575 --> 01:28:29,711
She had something special.

809
01:28:29,744 --> 01:28:31,344
Like I did.

810
01:28:31,378 --> 01:28:33,915
Sick and tired of never
gettin' what I want.

811
01:28:37,852 --> 01:28:40,488
You know I want to give it
to you, Pearl.

812
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,523
But I'm tired, too.

813
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:46,728
I know.

814
01:28:54,902 --> 01:28:56,871
Tell me I'm special.

815
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,479
Of course you are.

816
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:09,817
I've felt that way

817
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:11,886
since the first moment we met.

818
01:29:13,688 --> 01:29:17,290
You were the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

819
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:24,766
Oh, not anymore.

820
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:28,503
Always.

821
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,310
Tell me I'm yours.

822
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:41,949
That you still want me.

823
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,326
Make me feel young again.

824
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:05,606
What if my heart
can't take it?

825
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,908
It can.

826
01:31:43,104 --> 01:31:46,140
Fuck me, Howard.

827
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:47,808
Fuck me.

828
01:32:04,926 --> 01:32:06,694
Fuck me.

829
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:29,784
Help!

830
01:32:29,817 --> 01:32:30,985
Help!

831
01:32:31,018 --> 01:32:34,155
Somebody, help me, please!

832
01:33:14,195 --> 01:33:16,764
Let me out of here!

833
01:33:16,797 --> 01:33:18,132
Keep your voice down.

834
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:20,835
Don't tell me
to be quiet!

835
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:23,104
I was locked in a dungeon
down there!

836
01:33:23,137 --> 01:33:25,773
These old people
are fucking crazy!

837
01:33:25,806 --> 01:33:26,874
I have to get
out of this house

838
01:33:26,907 --> 01:33:28,242
before they kill me, too.

839
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,311
We need to find the keys
to their truck.

840
01:33:30,344 --> 01:33:32,013
I never should have
listened to you.

841
01:33:32,046 --> 01:33:33,714
This is all your fault!

842
01:33:33,748 --> 01:33:35,883
Lorraine, we need
to stick together.

843
01:33:35,916 --> 01:33:37,651
I hate you!

844
01:33:37,685 --> 01:33:39,887
I hate you all so much!

845
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:41,989
Lorraine!

846
01:33:46,594 --> 01:33:49,563
I told her to stay
in the damn cellar!

847
01:33:50,097 --> 01:33:51,599
That's all right.

848
01:33:52,266 --> 01:33:54,235
We don't need her anymore.

849
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:58,239
We got each other again.

850
01:33:58,272 --> 01:34:00,841
Help me
drag the body inside.

851
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:03,044
If she's in the house,
that's self-defense.

852
01:34:03,077 --> 01:34:05,012
That's the law.

853
01:34:05,046 --> 01:34:05,946
You don't
really believe

854
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,249
anyone's gonna come
looking for 'em, do you?

855
01:34:08,282 --> 01:34:09,950
We ain't
gonna risk it.

856
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,989
We need
to play this smart, Pearl.

857
01:34:15,022 --> 01:34:17,058
No sense in making a mess now.

858
01:34:18,893 --> 01:34:20,995
If nobody shows up
by tomorrow,

859
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:23,164
we'll take the body
and we'll dump her

860
01:34:23,197 --> 01:34:25,032
in the pond with the others.

861
01:34:25,066 --> 01:34:27,234
Which reminds me,
we're gonna need

862
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:29,003
to get Wayne outta the barn

863
01:34:29,036 --> 01:34:30,704
and sink him, too.

864
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:50,024
She's heavier than she looks.

865
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:01,268
Howard. Howard!

866
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:06,774
Howard?

867
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:08,909
Howard?

868
01:35:08,943 --> 01:35:10,077
Howard!

869
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:13,280
Where are the keys
to the truck?

870
01:35:13,314 --> 01:35:15,716
- He's having a heart attack.
- I don't give a shit!

871
01:35:15,749 --> 01:35:17,852
- Where are the fucking keys?
- <i>Well, now...</i>

872
01:35:17,885 --> 01:35:19,687
- In the kitchen...
- <i>...here we all are...</i>

873
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,823
- ...under the lamp.
- <i>...together.</i>

874
01:35:22,857 --> 01:35:23,924
Howard?

875
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,759
<i>We have reached a crossroad.</i>

876
01:35:25,793 --> 01:35:27,194
<i>With salvation...</i>

877
01:35:27,228 --> 01:35:28,929
- Howard?
- <i>...or damnation?</i>

878
01:35:28,963 --> 01:35:31,899
You're gonna rot when people
find out what you've done.

879
01:35:31,932 --> 01:35:33,067
<i>The time is now.</i>

880
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,036
- What I have done?
- <i>For if we do not take control</i>

881
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,239
- <i>of our own fate, the Lord...</i>
- What about you?

882
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:40,040
<i>...shall do it for us.</i>

883
01:35:40,074 --> 01:35:42,376
You don't think I know
who you really are?

884
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:45,713
I saw what you did
in the barn.

885
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,915
You're a deviant little whore.

886
01:35:48,816 --> 01:35:49,884
We're the same.

887
01:35:52,219 --> 01:35:54,422
You'll end up just like me.

888
01:35:54,456 --> 01:35:57,758
<i>Time to turn our backs on sin
and make the commitment...</i>

889
01:35:57,791 --> 01:35:58,926
I'm nothin' like you.

890
01:35:58,959 --> 01:36:00,194
<i>...once and for all.</i>

891
01:36:00,227 --> 01:36:02,763
You're a kidnappin',
murderin' sex fiend.

892
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:04,298
I'm a fucking star!

893
01:36:04,331 --> 01:36:05,332
The whole world
is gonna know my name.

894
01:36:05,366 --> 01:36:06,700
<i>I want
to hear you all.</i>

895
01:36:06,734 --> 01:36:08,135
<i>Say it with me now.</i>

896
01:36:08,169 --> 01:36:09,870
I will not accept a life

897
01:36:09,904 --> 01:36:11,772
- I do not deserve.
- <i>I will not accept a life</i>

898
01:36:11,805 --> 01:36:14,308
<i>I do not deserve.</i>

899
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:16,944
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

900
01:36:16,977 --> 01:36:19,380
Stop fuckin' starin' at me!

901
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:52,379
<i>Now, that's what I call
divine intervention!</i>

902
01:36:52,414 --> 01:36:58,852
<i>The Lord smiles on those who
accept Him. Praise his name!</i>

903
01:36:58,886 --> 01:37:02,356
<i>Glory be to Jesus!</i>

904
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:24,211
My hip...

905
01:37:24,245 --> 01:37:25,246
Help.

906
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:33,087
Shh!

907
01:37:44,532 --> 01:37:46,333
You whore!

908
01:37:47,535 --> 01:37:49,537
You're not innocent!

909
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:53,508
You're not special!

910
01:37:54,942 --> 01:37:58,112
It'll all be taken from you!

911
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:00,781
Just like it was from me!

912
01:38:01,549 --> 01:38:02,584
I'll tell everyone

913
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:04,251
what you are!

914
01:38:10,124 --> 01:38:11,526
It'll be our secret.

915
01:38:30,578 --> 01:38:32,514
Divine intervention.

916
01:38:58,339 --> 01:39:00,442
Praise the fuckin' Lord.

917
01:39:19,326 --> 01:39:22,896
<i>I hope that,
through my own admission,</i>

918
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:24,599
<i>others may find the light.</i>

919
01:39:25,633 --> 01:39:27,334
<i>I wanna show y'all somethin'.</i>

920
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:31,038
<i>Get a shot of this.</i>

921
01:39:33,974 --> 01:39:35,376
<i>There she is.</i>

922
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:37,579
<i>My beautiful
little daughter Maxine.</i>

923
01:39:38,379 --> 01:39:40,482
<i>Lured into a life of sin</i>

924
01:39:40,515 --> 01:39:41,915
<i>by the very deviants</i>

925
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:45,252
<i>we warn of here
on a daily basis.</i>

926
01:39:45,285 --> 01:39:49,524
<i>From our lovin' home
into the hands of devils.</i>

927
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:52,527
<i>We pray, one day,</i>

928
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,230
<i>she'll find her way home
to us.</i>

929
01:39:56,263 --> 01:39:58,232
<i>Amen.</i>

930
01:39:58,265 --> 01:40:00,402
<i>Bless you, bless you.</i>

931
01:40:09,977 --> 01:40:11,579
What do you reckon
happened, Sheriff?

932
01:40:14,682 --> 01:40:16,484
How the hell
should I know?

933
01:40:21,054 --> 01:40:22,256
Hey, boss.

934
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:29,664
One of the boys
found this inside.

935
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:35,202
What do you think is on it?

936
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:40,575
Well, by the looks
of everythin'...

937
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:45,680
I'd say one goddamn fucked up
horror picture.
