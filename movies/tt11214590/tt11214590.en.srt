00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:53,153
<i>It was a name
that sounded so sweet,</i>

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,354
<i>so seductive.</i>

5
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,159
<i>Synonymous with wealth...</i>

6
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,729
<i>style...</i>

7
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>power.</i>

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,503
<i>You passed one of their windows
and peeked inside,</i>

9
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,872
<i>hoping you'd earn enough
money someday</i>

10
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,141
<i>to afford
the second-cheapest item.</i>

11
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,279
<i>Surprise!</i>

12
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>You won't.</i>

13
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,725
<i>But the last name
was a curse too.</i>

14
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,532
<i>It belonged to a Tuscan family.</i>

15
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:45,640
<i>They didn't fight
over land or crown.</i>

16
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,410
Morning!

17
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,713
<i>They fought over
their own skins.</i>

18
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,181
<i>Signor</i> Gucci?

19
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,705
Hey! Back to work.
Come on.

20
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:51,773
Hey! Come on.

21
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,726
Perfect!
It's just like mine.

22
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,694
Fernando Reggiani.

23
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,630
Good girl.

24
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,532
- Hey, Fernando.
- Hey.

25
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,202
Your lunches are getting
expensive.

26
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,236
Because I have
expensive taste, huh?

27
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,875
Don't tell Ma.

28
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,543
She'll kill you.

29
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,645
You don't tell your mother.

30
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,381
Hello.

31
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,418
Max! Darling.

32
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,588
Tonight?

33
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,892
I think I'm free.

34
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,478
Do you like it? Yeah?

35
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:40,882
This is fun!

36
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,893
No, no.

37
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:12,547
Tanqueray martini
with a twist.

38
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,749
I don't work here.

39
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,751
Then why are you
behind the bar?

40
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,687
Is this part of your costume?

41
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,088
I, uh...

42
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,525
I didn't know it was
a costume party.

43
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,727
The...

44
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,696
The bartender...

45
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,632
Yeah, I...

46
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll make you a drink.

47
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,837
Thank you.

48
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,142
Who invited you?

49
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,810
Bianca.

50
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,344
I don't know her.

51
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:46,614
Bianca Sarzana.

52
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,718
It's her party.

53
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,521
Oh.

54
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:56,624
Right. That Bianca.

55
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,694
I'm Patrizia.

56
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,829
Patrizia...

57
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,465
Maurizio Gucci.

58
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,368
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Patrizia.

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,539
It's a pleasure to meet you!

60
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,841
You too.

61
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:17,979
Patrizia, how come I've never
seen you before?

62
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,916
You weren't looking
hard enough.

63
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,551
I would have noticed
that Bianca

64
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,953
was friends
with Elizabeth Taylor.

65
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,420
I can assure you...

66
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,591
I'm way more fun.

67
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,098
It's good.

68
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,435
Wanna dance?

69
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,538
No.

70
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,043
That's good. Come on.

71
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,916
Is my dancing that bad?

72
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,584
No, no, no. No.

73
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,555
I have to go.

74
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,425
It's only midnight, Cinderella.

75
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,226
The night is young.

76
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,729
I turn into a frog at midnight.

77
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,639
It's nice to meet you,
Patrizia.

78
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,016
It's a pumpkin.

79
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,483
Not a frog.

80
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,591
Hello.

81
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,792
Hello.

82
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,829
I'm sorry, have we met?

83
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,039
Elizabeth Taylor.

84
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,810
- Patrizia Reggiani.
- Yes, of course. Patrizia Reggiani.

85
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,315
It's good to see you again.

86
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,350
You too.

87
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:10,818
Do you study here?

88
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,087
I'm considering it.

89
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:17,091
The problem is I hate reading.
I get bored.

90
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,692
Oh.

91
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,963
What are those about?

92
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,231
These are...

93
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,804
Well, these are
very exciting books

94
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,541
about the legislative process.

95
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,708
I'm studying to be a lawyer.

96
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,178
You seem too nice
to be a lawyer.

97
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,881
Well, there are
a few good ones.

98
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,117
The dead ones.

99
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,698
What were the chances of us
seeing each other again?

100
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,999
It's fate.

101
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,668
It was a really nice surprise.

102
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,279
Aren't you going
to ask me out?

103
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,885
You... You wanna
go on a date with me?

104
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,656
Of course, I would...

105
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,625
I want to see
how this story goes.

106
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,230
Yes...

107
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,770
That's my number.

108
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:41,142
I'm very busy,
but I'll make time for you...

109
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,345
Maurizio.

110
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,818
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

111
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,831
It's for you.

112
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,810
Hello?

113
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,884
So do you think you're gonna
pass the bar soon?

114
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,588
I think I have a...

115
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,557
Would you like to
go into this place?

116
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:31,759
Oh, no. I can't eat there.
It's too expensive.

117
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,761
Okay.

118
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,264
Okay, I can try.

119
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,766
Would you like to go in?

120
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,344
No? Okay.

121
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,345
Ah!

122
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,714
This is for you.

123
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,151
It looks so good.
Thank you.

124
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:59,320
That's all right.
Can I have a napkin?

125
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,755
Can I have a bite?

126
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,094
Mmm. So good. Here.

127
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,462
Mm.

128
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,941
Oh, that's very good.

129
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,788
Come on.

130
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,967
Okay.

131
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,952
- Sit.
- Oh, no.

132
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,990
Get up. What are you doing?
Are you okay?

133
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,191
I fell back.

134
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,029
Oh...

135
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,930
It's fine.

136
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,273
Father, I would like to introduce
you to Patrizia Reggiani.

137
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,142
Patrizia, this is my
father, Rodolfo.

138
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,478
Delighted to meet you.

139
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:42,416
I trust Adele has been
keeping you amused.

140
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:43,917
Picasso?

141
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,388
No. No, no. No, it's Klimt.

142
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,693
How silly of me.

143
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,327
Oh, no, no, no.

144
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,196
It's an easy mistake.
I've made worse myself.

145
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,399
Must be worth a fortune.

146
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,804
Yes.

147
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,341
But you know, to me, art,
like beauty, has no price.

148
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,476
I made a reservation for us
at the Gallia.

149
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:10,978
Perfect choice.

150
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:18,952
So Patrizia...

151
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:20,387
What...

152
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,357
What exactly
are your interests?

153
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,895
I'm a very social person.

154
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,128
Are you?

155
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,531
- A people pleaser.
- Oh.

156
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:35,703
And, do you study?

157
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,973
I work for
my father's business.

158
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,208
Ah.

159
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,277
And his business is?

160
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,016
Ground transportation.

161
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,422
Oh.

162
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,734
Maurizio said
you used to be an actor.

163
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,571
Yes, I was.

164
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:13,407
You may remember a film,
<i>The Ancestor?</i>

165
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,412
No, no, no. Of course.

166
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,714
You're too young.

167
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:21,516
But sometimes on the TV,

168
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,718
they play a movie
<i>Tourist Train.</i>

169
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,887
- <i>Tourist Train</i> sounds familiar.
- Yeah, well...

170
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:31,058
Maybe you noticed a dashing young
actor, Maurizio D'Ancora.

171
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,161
That would have been me.

172
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,131
I didn't know I was sitting
with a movie star.

173
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,601
Can I get an autograph?

174
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,268
Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,371
The only good thing that came
from my career was

176
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,406
meeting Maurizio's mother.

177
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:50,377
Now she,
she was a star.

178
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,314
I remember at her funeral...

179
00:16:55,783 --> 00:17:00,922
during a moment of
silent remembrance,

180
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,491
Maurizio noticed the priest
lighting candles...

181
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,731
and he began to sing
"Happy Birthday."

182
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:16,069
He turned, maybe
the saddest moment of my life,

183
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,840
into something...

184
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,074
How do you say,
something sweet.

185
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,580
That's my son.

186
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,116
That is my dear boy.

187
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,842
- <i>Grazie,</i> Franco.
- Thank you, sir.

188
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,232
Ah, Maurizio.

189
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,169
I liked your Patrizia.

190
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,972
Charming.

191
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,773
Father, she really
liked you.

192
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,747
Tell me,
where did you meet her?

193
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,248
I met her at a party.

194
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,552
Party?

195
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,854
Yeah, Luca Sarzana's house.
At the Palazzo Serbelloni.

196
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,889
Yes, I know
where the Sarzanas live.

197
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,260
You know...

198
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,799
there is a certain sort of
young woman...

199
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:57,337
who makes their fortune

200
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:00,742
from getting their hooks
into someone like you.

201
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,878
Well, yes, Father,
but Patrizia is not like that.

202
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:08,415
Well, I had Franco
do a little investigation.

203
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,417
I think
she's after your money.

204
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,185
Like they all are.

205
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,821
The Reggianis...

206
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,125
are truck drivers.

207
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,459
Her father has
a very successful

208
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,129
transportation business.

209
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,530
It is...

210
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,499
It is an empire.

211
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,737
Oh! A truck driving empire.
How many?

212
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,239
- How many what?
- How many trucks?

213
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,908
Fifty? Five hundred?

214
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,176
What does he transport,
garbage? Huh?

215
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,645
Mafia!

216
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,452
Oh...

217
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,824
Listen, I've...

218
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,160
I give you everything.

219
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,561
I give you this house,
I give you money.

220
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:55,530
You have a life. You...

221
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,331
What is it you want?

222
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,836
What I want is to marry her.

223
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,706
Live with her. Fuck her.

224
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,373
Have a good time with her.
Do what you want.

225
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,109
Go away on holiday.
Go to Sardinia.

226
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:09,911
But, no, not marry.

227
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:15,482
No, don't walk away.

228
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,250
Okay, listen to yourself.

229
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,087
You're so bitter
and you don't even realize it.

230
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,755
Who cares
what her family name is,

231
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,757
or how many trucks
they have.

232
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,727
You hide here in the past

233
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,730
and you expect me
to hide here with you?

234
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:31,398
Not anymore!

235
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,769
These are your ghosts.

236
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,606
These are your ghosts,
not mine.

237
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,240
These are your regrets.

238
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,510
Don't do this to me.

239
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,513
You can't stop it.

240
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,015
I can, I will. I will...
I cut you from my will.

241
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,449
I'll leave you with nothing.

242
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,719
That's fine.

243
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,156
I love her.

244
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:57,290
You're making a big mistake.

245
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,695
Oh, she's fine,
but, you know,

246
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,831
she's a...
She's just a...

247
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,265
I love what she is.

248
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,351
<i>Si?</i>

249
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,988
<i>Commendatore</i> Reggiani,
my name is Maurizio Gucci.

250
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,825
- Patrizia!
- Uh-huh?

251
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,031
I have had a disagreement
with my father

252
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:40,333
that has forced me to leave my
home and my family business.

253
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:43,037
I am still in school.

254
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:46,473
I'm studying to be a lawyer,
so as of this moment

255
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,077
I do not have a job, but I...

256
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,415
But I'm in love
with your daughter.

257
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,054
And I would like to marry her.

258
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,422
Although,
now I have nothing to offer her.

259
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,693
I, uh...
I need a job.

260
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,497
Mom.

261
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,538
Mama.

262
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,994
Maurizio Gucci,

263
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,596
you're urgently needed
in accounting.

264
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,465
Maurizio!

265
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,901
Maurizio!

266
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,189
That was great.

267
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,693
The door! The door!

268
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,442
Papa?

269
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,215
Papa?

270
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,765
Hi, Papa.

271
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:31,592
<i>Ciao, bella, ciao.</i>

272
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,344
Maurizio...

273
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,819
What is this?

274
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,924
Where is this?

275
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,125
What is this?

276
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,499
What is this?

277
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,769
How about that.

278
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,349
Yes.

279
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:12,052
- Ah, Claudia.
- Good morning!

280
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,522
- Good morning, Mr. Aldo.
- Good morning.

281
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,889
- This way?
- That way.

282
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,797
<i>Konichiwa,</i> Mr. Gucci.

283
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,206
What's all this
Japanese bullshit?

284
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,907
I'm learning.

285
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,243
You know, they're our best
customers, so.

286
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,913
They're loyal,
they're quiet.

287
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,415
And they're rich.

288
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:45,252
One of your terrible ideas.

289
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,688
Here it is.

290
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:48,690
Gotemba.

291
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:50,257
Gotemba?

292
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:52,826
Yeah, near the foot
of Mount Fuji.

293
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,261
It's a mall.

294
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,797
Ninety minutes by bus
from Tokyo.

295
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,400
It will be built in the spring.

296
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,870
A window
into the Asian market.

297
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,171
- No, no, no.
- It's a stepping stone.

298
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,707
- No, no, no.
- Come on!

299
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:07,742
No, Aldo.
You and your profits.

300
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,644
Come on, things are fine
as they are.

301
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:13,715
Gucci doesn't belong in a
mall, it belongs in a museum.

302
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:17,217
Museum where
it'll make no profit.

303
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,086
What's this?

304
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:20,321
No.

305
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:24,091
Aldo, as long as
we are fifty-fifty,

306
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,426
that's how it stays.

307
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,994
No malls.

308
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,332
I see Maurizio got married.

309
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,399
Oh, God!

310
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,636
Some... Oh, she's...

311
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,103
I can't even say her name.

312
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,039
Well, sooner or later
you will have to.

313
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,441
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

314
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,242
No, Maurizio and I history.
History.

315
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,944
- No, come on.
- I don't...

316
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,647
You are old.

317
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:50,384
Maurizio is your only son.
He is your true legacy.

318
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,986
- You don't bring him back into the fold...
- Well, maybe...

319
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,823
I'm telling you...

320
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,225
you'll only wind up being
a bitter and lonely old man.

321
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,060
That's what happens
to all of us.

322
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:01,830
Time will tell. But...

323
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:04,599
Yeah. When did you
last touch him, huh?

324
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,133
When did you last hug him?

325
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,335
You don't touch anybody.

326
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,405
You used to touch
every once in a while,

327
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,575
now you, what,
touch yourself?

328
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,110
- You? You, teaching me?
- That's correct.

329
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:19,313
How's it going
with your boy? Hmm?

330
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,916
Well, your son is
a smart lawyer.

331
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:24,151
Mine is an idiot.

332
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,487
But he's my idiot.

333
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,322
And I know
how to deal with him.

334
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,191
But you need to deal
with your son.

335
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,893
- Ah...
- Yes.

336
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,496
It's my birthday on Sunday.

337
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:36,930
Yeah?

338
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:38,165
We'll all be there.

339
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,334
You should come.

340
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,173
I'll have to look at my diary.

341
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:55,983
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

342
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,652
Who is this?

343
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:01,656
- Si, <i>this is Aldo. Aldo Gucci.</i>
- Aldo.

344
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,057
<i>I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.</i>

345
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,459
What could be more important

346
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:07,494
than a phone call
from my new uncle?

347
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:13,000
I am truly sorry for not being
able to come to your wedding.

348
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,803
It was... I couldn't help it.

349
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,136
Business beckoned.

350
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,073
Easy on that.

351
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,143
I understand, of course.
I know how busy you are.

352
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,180
<i>We are celebrating my
birthday this weekend</i>

353
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,816
<i>at my villa.</i>

354
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,651
<i>And I think it would be</i>

355
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:33,220
a perfect opportunity for you
to come and meet the family.

356
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,823
What do you think?

357
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:35,989
Your birthday,
I would love that.

358
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,592
How many candles is it?

359
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,594
<i>Seventy.</i>

360
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:43,096
They say it's the new
sixty-nine.

361
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,867
Well, I can't speak
for Maurizio.

362
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:47,334
He's right here.

363
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,538
No.

364
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:51,573
Please.

365
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,614
<i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

366
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:00,782
<i>Maurizio!</i>

367
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,250
How is my little lawyer?

368
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,720
<i>I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

369
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,488
What are you doing this Sunday?

370
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,625
I'll double check.

371
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:12,594
Come to my birthday party.

372
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,762
I'm only in town
for a couple of weeks.

373
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,029
<i>Come on.</i>

374
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,366
Let me discuss it
with Patrizia.

375
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,435
- Let's go! A little day trip.
- I don't...

376
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,706
You know, your father and I
aren't getting any younger.

377
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:27,474
These gatherings are becoming
more and more

378
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,310
of a rare occurrence,
you know.

379
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,379
Please.

380
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,884
<i>Come on!</i>

381
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,719
I'll be jumping out of a cake.

382
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,978
Come on.
Kick his teeth out.

383
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,015
Come on! Come on!

384
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,584
Earn your fucking lunch!

385
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,820
Kick his teeth out. Come on!

386
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,657
Go, go, go!

387
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,125
That's it. Go!

388
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:21,461
Maurizio! Come on!
We're missing a player.

389
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,032
- Oh. No, no, no.
- What no? Yes, yes. Come on.

390
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:26,734
We're missing a player.
Come on!

391
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,003
- Put it on. Take that jacket off.
- Okay.

392
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,137
You know it.

393
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:31,305
Paolo!

394
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,073
Watch him. Watch him play.

395
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,142
See that?

396
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,012
Oh, my God. Look at that.

397
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,113
Maurizio! Maurizio!

398
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,383
That's your husband!

399
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,363
Paolo!

400
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,634
Papa...

401
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:03,871
- <i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>
- <i>Oh,</i> no.

402
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:07,341
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

403
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,676
How do you act shy?

404
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:11,679
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Aldo ♪</i>

405
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,615
- Papa!
- "Papa." I love that.

406
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,349
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

407
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,086
He's never in his life
called me Papa.

408
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,622
Patrizia, you should know...

409
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,357
that the Guccis

410
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:27,194
were noble saddle-makers
to medieval courts.

411
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,332
We have history flowing through
these green and red webbings.

412
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,503
And yes, we are expensive.

413
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,407
But quality is remembered
long after price is forgotten.

414
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:43,044
Huh?

415
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,412
Thoughts on Paolo's outfit,
Domenico?

416
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,314
You're the fashionista.

417
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,450
It's eccentric.

418
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,554
I designed this myself.

419
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:58,960
Well, you should reconsider
your wardrobe choices, Paolo.

420
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:02,262
You are Gucci,
you need to dress the part.

421
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,331
It's chic.

422
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,936
My father's problem is that
he's stuck in the past.

423
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:13,074
He refuses to take Gucci
into the next century.

424
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:16,010
- Yes, Gucci is doing fine under my watch.
- No!

425
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,578
- No, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no!

426
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,781
No. No.

427
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,448
It needs new ideas.

428
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,250
- New energy.
- Of course.

429
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,953
And I happen to be
bursting with creativity.

430
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,956
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, my bladder may be full...

431
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,994
but my dreams are even fuller.

432
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,863
I'm like a rush of water.

433
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:39,299
Somebody build a dam.

434
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,102
Please.

435
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,638
You're always
brushing me off.

436
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:47,975
I'm a designer.
I need to express myself.

437
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:51,612
- But why all this sudden moaning?
- I have a...

438
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,416
- What do you want?
- Because, I'm so sick of you ignoring me.

439
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,218
I am sick of your talking.

440
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,353
Sick of it.

441
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,690
You deliberately hurt
my feelings.

442
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,625
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

443
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,861
- Jenny! Jenny honey.
- No! That's what he wants.

444
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,296
- Don't. Sit down. Sit down! Sit down.
- You have succeeded.

445
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:10,865
I haven't had espresso.

446
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,134
- Bye.
- Thanks for having us, Uncle.

447
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:18,238
Ah! My nephew,
he has such great taste.

448
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:21,843
Oh. A small wedding gift.

449
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,213
Thank you.

450
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,850
Come to New York. Okay?

451
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:31,786
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.
- <i>Ciao!</i>

452
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,286
<i>Ciao.</i>

453
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,389
Oh, it's good to see you.

454
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,326
I couldn't believe
you got into the car.

455
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,728
How did you do that?

456
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:44,464
It's all bullshit.

457
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,800
We're not royalty.

458
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,704
My grandfather Guccio was
a bellhop in London.

459
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:53,107
That's where he got the idea
for leather goods.

460
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:56,244
By carrying bags around
for rich aristocrats.

461
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,745
Gucci is like that cake.

462
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,647
What?

463
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:02,750
Once you think there's enough
to go around...

464
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:06,821
then you'll have a taste,
and then you'll want more...

465
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:09,356
and then you'll want
the whole thing for yourself.

466
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,827
What about you?

467
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:17,330
You just gonna sit around
and watch them eat everything?

468
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,734
Me? I am Gucci by name.

469
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:24,272
I don't have
their Tuscan character.

470
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,374
It was diluted by
my mother's German blood.

471
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,918
The only wedding gift
the Guccis gave us.

472
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,318
Coupons.

473
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,756
Feels like cash.

474
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,024
I doubt it.

475
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,529
It's not cash.

476
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,803
Fucking Concorde.

477
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,038
To where?

478
00:38:58,105 --> 00:38:59,106
New York.

479
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,312
New York.

480
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:05,913
Ah, Patrizia.

481
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,481
We can't drive to New York,
we have to fly.

482
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,383
You wanna go to New York?

483
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,953
No.

484
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,386
Everybody likes New York.

485
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,256
I don't.

486
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:16,958
I wanna go to New York.

487
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,126
New York.

488
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,996
I love New York.

489
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,396
What are you doing?

490
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,699
New York.

491
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,435
Okay.

492
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:29,871
Okay.

493
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:59,767
<i>Do you have
medical maladies, financial woes...</i>

494
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,103
<i>heartbreak?</i>

495
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:06,473
<i>I can help you with
everything and anything.</i>

496
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,442
<i>And it's very, very private.</i>

497
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,445
<i>Because Pina is discreet.</i>

498
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,515
<i>And very accurate.</i>

499
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,485
<i>You can come to me
with any worries.</i>

500
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,321
<i>There is no need to suffer.</i>

501
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,627
<i>Hello, who am I speaking to?</i>

502
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:28,029
Patrizia.

503
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,964
<i>How old are you, dear?</i>

504
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:31,198
Twenty-five.

505
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,035
<i>Twenty-five.</i>

506
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,804
<i>What is your question,
Patrizia?</i>

507
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,242
Will I be successful?

508
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,577
<i>You have to be more specific.</i>

509
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:46,647
<i>In what?
Career, marriage, what?</i>

510
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:49,482
Will I get what I want?

511
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:52,019
<i>That was not specific.</i>

512
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,188
<i>But I know what you want.
You want everything.</i>

513
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,691
<i>Well, don't be disappointed</i>

514
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,626
<i>if you don't hear
what you want to hear.</i>

515
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,460
Okay.

516
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,631
What's your name?

517
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,634
<i>My name is Pina.</i>

518
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,136
Hello, Pina.

519
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,909
Tell me everything.

520
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,579
<i>I see a great fortune...</i>

521
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,247
<i>coming your way.</i>

522
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:22,817
How big?

523
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,686
- Sophia! Sophia!
- Sophia!

524
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,020
Maybe, I'm not sure.

525
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:02,056
Yes, we have something.
I can show you.

526
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,691
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

527
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:05,493
All due respect,

528
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:08,562
these heels are
not right for you.

529
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:11,699
Hello, Uncle.

530
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,301
No!

531
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,971
What are you doing? Patrizia.

532
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,839
Oh, my!

533
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:22,576
My gorgeous niece. Patrizia.

534
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,746
I was just in the neighborhood.

535
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:28,616
- Yes? In the neighborhood?
- I was hoping I'd see you.

536
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:31,252
Maurizio is
a very smart young man.

537
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,557
So how are things
with his father?

538
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,293
Not bad, not good.

539
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,128
Yeah.

540
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:44,565
My brother,
he's a difficult man.

541
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,936
But it's time for them
to reconcile.

542
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:52,273
Maurizio and his father, no?

543
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,741
<i>Si.</i>

544
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:57,478
Maurizio wants to be
part of the family.

545
00:42:57,546 --> 00:42:59,213
I can see it in his eyes.

546
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,283
But?

547
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,554
But, he needs your help.

548
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:06,754
Yeah.

549
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,957
Well, how do I help?

550
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:13,861
Maybe we can
spend some time together.

551
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,897
Yeah, why not?

552
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,867
Darling Uncle.

553
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:22,670
Mmm.

554
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,605
Maurizio is...

555
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:27,875
He's proud.

556
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,311
We all are, darling.

557
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,947
We all are.

558
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,756
I love it.

559
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,391
Ah!

560
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:49,697
My dear, you smell that?
Smell that!

561
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,266
This is legacy.

562
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:56,403
These gorgeous beasts.

563
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:00,407
Do you know
that these gorgeous beasts

564
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,309
are the direct descendants

565
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:05,646
of the ones Guccio bought
way back when?

566
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,649
They deserve our respect.

567
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,752
They deserve our gratitude.

568
00:44:12,587 --> 00:44:14,722
They are Val di Chiana cows.

569
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,928
Yes, yes. Hello.

570
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:25,634
I wanna introduce you
to my nephew Maurizio

571
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:29,937
and his beautiful new bride,
Patrizia.

572
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,774
- Here, touch.
- Wow, this is soft.

573
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,709
Smell it too.
It's really great.

574
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:37,478
Let me see this new one.

575
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:41,583
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

576
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,986
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Aldo ♪</i>

577
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:49,790
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

578
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:53,160
- <i>Bravo, bravo.</i>
- <i>Bravo.</i>

579
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:58,832
I am ready! I think
I blow 'em out, right?

580
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:05,839
Come on! Help me
blow these out, please.

581
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,142
I like this place.

582
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,844
I love this place.

583
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,019
Am I boring you?

584
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,021
- No. No.
- No, no. We love it.

585
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,524
My word!

586
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,826
Because I can't talk to my son
Paolo about any of this.

587
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,828
He hates Gucci talk.

588
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,798
He only talks about himself.

589
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:34,034
But as you know,
he's a strange bird.

590
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,870
My son is a strange bird.

591
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:39,039
He's definitely unique.

592
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:42,910
Useless. Sadly.

593
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:45,179
Maurizio!

594
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:46,780
- Yes?
- How are you?

595
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:47,948
I'm good.

596
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:49,551
You had a good day today?

597
00:45:49,618 --> 00:45:51,085
It was good. I mean,
I showed you everything

598
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,187
I could show you
in one sitting.

599
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:54,855
Yes. Thank you
very much, Uncle.

600
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,123
- I'm glad.
- It's beautiful here.

601
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,627
I say this because Patrizia

602
00:45:58,693 --> 00:46:01,829
has told me that
you may be interested...

603
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:05,232
in learning about
our business...

604
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,268
whatever.

605
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:12,006
Rodolfo lost a son.

606
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,808
Maybe I gain one. Right?

607
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:17,311
See that.

608
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:26,086
Family is important, Maurizio.

609
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:28,489
You can't erase yourself
from the family portrait...

610
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:31,258
just because you enjoy
playing with trucks.

611
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,561
This is the happiest
I've been in my life.

612
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:37,965
Why change that?

613
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,800
You...

614
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,303
You're so much more than this.

615
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,073
You can help the family.

616
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,444
Strong family makes
a strong business.

617
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:11,098
I'm pregnant.

618
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,872
You're gonna be a father.

619
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,143
You're what?

620
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:26,013
I'm pregnant.

621
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,621
Will you help me with...

622
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,642
Oh, oh!

623
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,009
Not my camera.

624
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,513
- Not the camera.
- No. No. No.

625
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,946
Not the suit.

626
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:35,015
Come here.

627
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,050
Ooh!

628
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,823
Oh, Maurizio.
Don't catch on fire.

629
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,308
Do you like it?

630
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:03,944
That is very beautiful.

631
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:05,479
Is that on sale?

632
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,415
Sale.

633
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:11,285
Patrizia!

634
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,822
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.
- Maurizio!

635
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:16,223
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.
- Oh!

636
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,928
My youth serum.
That's what you are.

637
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:21,395
How did you sleep?

638
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:22,564
Like babies.

639
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,566
The suite is unreal.
Thank you.

640
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:25,900
Wonderful. Wonderful.

641
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,334
- You look good.
- Thank you.

642
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:28,736
But you...

643
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,337
Well, that looks great on you.

644
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,373
- Gucci.
- Gucci?

645
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,676
Looks that good!

646
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,010
We're so surprised.

647
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,246
Yeah, Patrizia is just
playing dress-up.

648
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:43,083
Yeah. Well,
here's a little secret.

649
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,186
Don't tell anybody. See?

650
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,690
Come here, Patrizia.

651
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,593
I got something
I want to show you.

652
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:54,194
Sorry, Mauri,
don't take it personally.

653
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:57,565
Anything you see is yours.

654
00:49:57,632 --> 00:50:00,568
You want it,
you see it, it's yours.

655
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:02,604
- Family discount.
- Mr. Gucci!

656
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,438
Yes!

657
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:06,306
Excuse me.

658
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,117
Hi! How are you?

659
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:21,421
So what do you think?

660
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:24,191
What could you do, Maurizio?

661
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,393
Ah, yes.

662
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:29,062
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>

663
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:34,569
Gucci world affairs
coordinator.

664
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:37,605
What?

665
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:39,239
What does that even mean?

666
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:41,543
I don't know.
It means something.

667
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,947
You'll be my eyes and ears
when I'm away.

668
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:48,048
You'll represent the company.

669
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,485
With foreign buyers
or anybody else.

670
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,421
'Cause with your knowledge
of the law,

671
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:56,223
your language skills...

672
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,826
You fit right in.

673
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,494
Thank you. We're flattered
and we're grateful.

674
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:02,362
I'm glad.
I know you are.

675
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:04,364
Yes?

676
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,233
Yes?

677
00:51:08,101 --> 00:51:09,637
What are you thinking?

678
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:12,339
I'm thinking. I'm thinking,
I'm thinking...

679
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,141
and thinking and thinking.

680
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:16,143
I'm thinking, I'll certainly
think about it.

681
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:40,802
- Franco.
- Morning, sir.

682
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:42,269
Just in time.

683
00:51:45,907 --> 00:51:47,307
Here. Help me.

684
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:48,710
Yes, of course.

685
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:51,779
Boof.

686
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,627
Hello, Uncle.

687
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:08,495
My favorite uncle.

688
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:09,731
Hello.

689
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:12,767
Wow.

690
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,004
So svelte.

691
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:21,042
Your cheek bones
could cut a diamond.

692
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:25,046
Oh, please. To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

693
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:29,717
Well, I came
first and foremost...

694
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:32,920
to say... Well...

695
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:34,856
Hmm?

696
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,691
Hello.

697
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:39,192
Well, hello!

698
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:45,332
Uh, was there anything else?

699
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:51,304
Maurizio and my father
have been spending

700
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:53,074
a lot of time together
in New York.

701
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,175
And I thought...

702
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:58,846
maybe you and I
could do the same.

703
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:01,415
Why would I...

704
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,283
Well, to discuss...

705
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:05,720
To discuss what?

706
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,354
My ideas.

707
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,692
- You have ideas?
- Boof.

708
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,561
Does an elephant
shit in the jungle?

709
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:17,965
I was born with a gift.

710
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:20,768
I am an artist.

711
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:23,336
My father,
he just won't see it.

712
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:25,540
But...

713
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,475
These are yours?

714
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:31,445
How come the family doesn't
know you have a gift?

715
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,614
Domenico, did you know
Paolo had a gift?

716
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:35,750
I'm afraid I did not, sir.

717
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:38,019
Well, we both know
he's blind in one eye

718
00:53:38,086 --> 00:53:39,854
and deaf in the other. So.

719
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,024
- This is...
- Oh, wait.

720
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:45,893
Let me show you.

721
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,164
These were inspired
by my trip to Cuba.

722
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,265
I call this collection...

723
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:54,836
"Havana Libre."

724
00:53:58,206 --> 00:53:59,774
Lots of pastels.

725
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:04,377
Rum inspired, sun-soaked
and lots of browns.

726
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:10,450
You have pastels
and brown together.

727
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:12,319
Yes, yes, yes.

728
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,522
I know, it's musical.

729
00:54:21,294 --> 00:54:22,329
Paolo.

730
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:23,631
Yeah.

731
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:28,401
You must not show these
to anyone.

732
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:30,738
Keep them hidden.

733
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:32,874
I mean it.

734
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,145
You feel they might steal
my ideas, right?

735
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:40,748
Oh, call me a lawyer.

736
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:41,949
Not you.

737
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:46,453
Over the years, I have found...

738
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:54,427
that true talent is often
unaware of its own brilliance.

739
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:59,200
It must be cherished
and protected.

740
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:01,903
Whereas hacks,
they run around...

741
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:08,009
shouting their
delicious ideas,

742
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,578
begging to be recognized.

743
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,746
Blind...

744
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:14,782
to their own...

745
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:18,451
mediocrity.

746
00:55:22,223 --> 00:55:23,991
My dear nephew,
you have achieved

747
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,429
a triumph of mediocrity.

748
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,769
And you have also achieved
the unimaginable.

749
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,438
You have found one thing...

750
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:44,011
upon which your father and I
can agree.

751
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:50,483
Your total incompetence.

752
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:55,690
Oh, no.

753
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:58,458
Forgive me.

754
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:02,797
But I...

755
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,399
I have to take a meeting.

756
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:13,406
You designed this scarf,
correct?

757
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:14,642
Oh, yes.

758
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,579
That scarf is my signature.

759
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:21,616
It has caressed the necks
of all the world's beauties.

760
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:24,518
Jackie O, Grace, Sofia.

761
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:28,022
Study it closely.

762
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:32,392
No browns, no pastels.

763
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:35,529
- Come.
- Yes.

764
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:57,417
I don't need anyone.

765
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,355
I'm Paolo.

766
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,924
Paolo Gucci.

767
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,028
And I am going to start...

768
00:57:08,562 --> 00:57:10,097
my own line.

769
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,553
Mr. Gucci.

770
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,958
- Are you okay?
- <i>Si, si.</i>

771
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:42,930
<i>Grazie.</i>

772
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,473
My father is ill.

773
00:58:13,394 --> 00:58:15,463
- <i>Ciao,</i> Franco.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Franco.

774
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:16,831
Maurizio.

775
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,277
Excuse me. Excuse me.

776
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,518
What is this?

777
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:44,892
I'm a grandfather?

778
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,565
Her name is Alessandra.

779
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,568
Like Maurizio's mother.

780
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:00,241
Whose idea was that?

781
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,613
Mine.

782
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,814
Well...

783
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,317
Alessandra.

784
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:12,286
Here. Come here.

785
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:14,088
Come, come, come.

786
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:20,561
My boy.

787
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:39,580
You take care of Gucci now.
Hmm?

788
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:44,752
I'm glad it wasn't a boy.

789
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:47,721
We need more women
in this family.

790
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,181
There is no love on Earth

791
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,751
greater than that of a father
for his son.

792
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:22,089
With a few exceptions.

793
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,060
Thank you for coming, Uncle.

794
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:29,697
Come to New York.
Join the family.

795
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,733
Make him proud.

796
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,371
I'll think about it.

797
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:38,772
Yeah.

798
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,319
The house in St. Moritz.

799
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,557
Two beach houses,
one in Nassau,

800
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:56,991
the other in Taormina.

801
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:59,026
Twenty-three horses.

802
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,497
Penthouse apartment
in Galleria Passarella...

803
01:01:03,565 --> 01:01:05,933
the only one in all of Milan
with a swimming pool.

804
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:11,105
And, of course,
50% of Gucci S.P.A.

805
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:17,144
But... there is
a slight complication.

806
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:24,985
He, Rodolfo, he never signed
the share certificate.

807
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,798
Okay, what does that mean?

808
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:40,701
You'll have
to pay inheritance tax.

809
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,336
Oh, that's fine.

810
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:44,405
How much are we talking?

811
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:48,275
Could be as high
as 14 billion lire.

812
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:50,277
- 14 billion?
- Yeah.

813
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:51,912
I can't afford that.

814
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,617
Well, you could
sell your shares.

815
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,751
To who?

816
01:01:57,818 --> 01:02:00,454
- I can think of a few qualified individuals.
- Thank you.

817
01:02:00,522 --> 01:02:02,591
Leave them with us.

818
01:02:02,657 --> 01:02:04,992
We'll review them
as soon as we're done mourning.

819
01:02:05,594 --> 01:02:06,760
Of course.

820
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:10,998
<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

821
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:13,300
Suggesting you sell
your shares.

822
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:14,868
Madness.

823
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:17,004
Fourteen billion is totally
unreasonable.

824
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:20,074
And just because your father
forgot to sign it.

825
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:41,195
<i>Ten of spades
represents theft or loss.</i>

826
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:45,366
Someone wants what is yours.

827
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:46,900
Don't let them take it.

828
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:49,803
And don't trust anybody.

829
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:53,907
Because I see
an abuse of trust.

830
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:57,811
An attempt to deceive you in
your own house. You understand?

831
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,548
Yes, Pina.

832
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:03,851
Always have something red
on you for protection.

833
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:07,154
And wear more green.
Green is for cleansing.

834
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,959
Green doesn't go
with my lipstick.

835
01:03:13,294 --> 01:03:15,129
Change your lipstick.

836
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:17,064
You're already so beautiful.

837
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,932
Or wear green underwear.

838
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,269
Maybe it's time for you
to take back.

839
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:27,408
Don't let these forces
around you dictate who you are.

840
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:30,878
You're strong.
You're magnificent.

841
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:32,246
And...

842
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:36,417
Hmm, look at this.

843
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:40,522
There's a great love
in your life.

844
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:48,462
Together, you can conquer
the world.

845
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,166
Patrizia, look at me.

846
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:56,003
You will be the queen.
You.

847
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,383
Hi!

848
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,419
What a beauty.

849
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,588
What a beauty.

850
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:14,888
So good to see you.

851
01:04:14,955 --> 01:04:16,490
Come. Come.

852
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:18,325
Much to show you.

853
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:23,997
This is your new office.

854
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:25,432
Wow.

855
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:27,000
I'm across the hall.

856
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,903
If you need me.

857
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:31,606
Okay.

858
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,409
Look. Enjoy.

859
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:37,111
- Thank you.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

860
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:38,379
<i>Ciao.</i>

861
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:14,181
I got pane fresco.

862
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:19,086
If you didn't eat breakfast,
your father's gonna be very upset with you.

863
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,404
Ira?

864
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:39,373
Yes?

865
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:41,208
Ira, is this yours?

866
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:43,343
Yes.

867
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:46,246
Birthday gift.
From my husband.

868
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,382
It's a Gucci.

869
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,417
Just like yours.

870
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:55,088
Which Gucci store did he go to?

871
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:22,182
Who is
making this stuff?

872
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:25,753
Who's allowing this to happen?

873
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:29,389
As far as fakes go,
they're pretty good.

874
01:06:29,456 --> 01:06:31,024
I mean, I'd buy them.

875
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:32,760
Don't be such a cretin.

876
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:39,032
Don't call me
a cretin, sweetie.

877
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,705
That's not what I said.
I asked you not to be one.

878
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:47,207
This is serious
and you're laughing it off.

879
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:50,143
At least it's my name
on the mugs, not yours.

880
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:53,347
Our name, sweetie.

881
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:55,382
On junk!

882
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:02,389
They're not fake,
by the way.

883
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:05,459
They're replicas.

884
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:07,695
I was just very,
very surprised.

885
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:12,232
Well, you know what else
would surprise you?

886
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:17,137
How profitable this stuff is.

887
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:18,372
What about quality?

888
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,475
Your sacred cows?

889
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:24,044
Quality is for the rich.

890
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:28,415
If a Long Island housewife
wants to...

891
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:33,420
live with the illusion that
she is a Gucci customer...

892
01:07:34,187 --> 01:07:36,189
why not? Let her.

893
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:39,359
Because it damages
Gucci's credibility.

894
01:07:40,093 --> 01:07:43,230
Patrizia, this is us.

895
01:07:44,933 --> 01:07:46,768
This is not a girl's game.

896
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:52,172
Yeah, but, Aldo,
she's right.

897
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:55,577
This stuff is junk.

898
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:58,412
It's not what Gucci is.

899
01:07:59,112 --> 01:08:00,347
Gucci...

900
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:04,251
is what I say it is.

901
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,958
I turned it into an empire.

902
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:12,359
Not Rodolfo.

903
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,194
Certainly not my son.

904
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,263
And, uh...

905
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:20,702
of course, not you, so...

906
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:25,238
Without me...

907
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:30,377
you'd all still be
shoveling cow shit in Tuscany.

908
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,715
That's a fact.

909
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,385
Remember that.

910
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:43,357
We should remember that.

911
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:51,733
<i>Brava!</i>

912
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:52,900
Bravo! Bravo!

913
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:07,782
A martini, please.

914
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:09,316
Yes, sir.

915
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:10,518
Did you like the show?

916
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,688
Oh, it was incredible.

917
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:17,424
The... The...
The lines and tones.

918
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:18,693
Well, what's your name?

919
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,494
My name?

920
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:24,431
Maurizio.

921
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,333
Maurizio what?

922
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:29,236
Maurizio Gucci.

923
01:09:30,404 --> 01:09:33,173
Maurizio Gucci.
How about that? Gucci.

924
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,709
You know, I used to
dress windows for Gucci.

925
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:36,376
Oh, really? Which store?

926
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:39,047
I can't remember. It was...

927
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,782
It was God-awful though.

928
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:42,650
Walter, by the way.

929
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,184
I'm a designer.

930
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,788
Okay, Walter.

931
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:50,758
Well, maybe you will design
for me someday.

932
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:53,628
No. No designer here's gonna
work for Gucci.

933
01:09:54,829 --> 01:09:56,296
Right now, Gucci...

934
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:58,666
Gucci's just a cheap operetta.

935
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,839
- <i>Grazia.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i>

936
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:07,374
Well, enjoy yourself.

937
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,284
Do you want to be left
in the dust?

938
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:21,354
You want to keep selling
coffee mugs in airports?

939
01:10:22,056 --> 01:10:23,558
Is that your legacy?

940
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:29,664
It's time to
take out the trash.

941
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:34,367
Aldo and Paolo, they're poison.

942
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:36,838
They're an embarrassment
to this company...

943
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:38,940
and everybody knows it.

944
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:41,542
They have to go.

945
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,378
And you need to get your
fucking business organized.

946
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:47,481
Patrizia...

947
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:50,918
they're my family.

948
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:55,790
So am I.

949
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:59,160
He's starting a trade war.

950
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:01,796
Paolo barely has enough
to bankroll a pair of socks,

951
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:03,396
let alone start a war
with anyone.

952
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:05,066
I don't want to see it.

953
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:07,001
Yes, but he could
still be a problem.

954
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:09,904
Aldo has awarded him a number
of shares in the company.

955
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:12,305
Yes, but Aldo didn't realize
what an idiot

956
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:13,775
Paolo turned out to be.

957
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:16,210
Maurizio, we need
to build a bridge

958
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:17,945
with Paolo and work things out.

959
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,782
You know how emotional he gets.

960
01:11:20,848 --> 01:11:22,884
He's around all this
male energy all the time.

961
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,719
His wife isn't exactly
the brightest.

962
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:26,821
He needs someone
he can talk to,

963
01:11:26,888 --> 01:11:28,488
who he trusts,
who listens to him.

964
01:11:29,524 --> 01:11:30,758
Someone like who?

965
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:36,564
Paolo likes me.

966
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:37,899
You do have
a natural advantage.

967
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,332
You are not a Gucci.

968
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:44,304
I...

969
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:47,307
I need an espresso.

970
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:56,818
Can I ask you a question?

971
01:11:58,252 --> 01:11:59,452
You just did.

972
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,454
Huh?

973
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:03,858
You just asked me a question.

974
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:06,627
And what you really
want to know is

975
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:08,262
whether you can ask me
two questions,

976
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,297
one of which
you've already asked.

977
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:15,468
That's good.
Domenico, very funny.

978
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:17,505
Okay, here is
my second question.

979
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:24,512
What do you see as being
your purpose at Gucci?

980
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:27,815
Is this a job interview?

981
01:12:28,316 --> 01:12:29,482
Maybe.

982
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,620
I'm a conservationist.

983
01:12:34,222 --> 01:12:37,859
Gucci is a rare animal.
It must be protected.

984
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,828
Protected from who?

985
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,496
From whoever threatens it.

986
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,768
I find it very interesting that

987
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,137
you have such
a strong connection

988
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:52,640
to that which is not yours.

989
01:12:54,075 --> 01:12:55,910
Uh...

990
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,679
Sometimes it takes an outsider
to see the truth.

991
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:00,081
<i>Bravo.</i>

992
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:05,920
Paolo, this one reminds me
of childhood.

993
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:09,957
Yeah, well, it's a memory
wrapped in lycra.

994
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:13,928
It's just so you.
It's exquisite.

995
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:15,263
Do you think so?

996
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,964
You have a gift,
I'm telling you.

997
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:18,431
Oh, well, stop.

998
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:21,135
Stop, you're going
to make me...

999
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:23,436
you're going to make me cry.

1000
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:28,609
Nobody has ever
said that to me. Nobody.

1001
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:31,045
Paolo, why don't you have
your own line?

1002
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:34,148
These are just mock-ups.

1003
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:36,817
I can't afford to get serious.

1004
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,653
With your gift,
and your talent,

1005
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,820
and your vision...

1006
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:40,721
Are you kidding?

1007
01:13:40,788 --> 01:13:42,523
Gucci needs new blood.

1008
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,792
Goodbye 1930s.

1009
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,795
Hello, '80s. Huh?

1010
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:51,632
Oh, you took the words
right out of my guts.

1011
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:53,701
Paolo Gucci is coming.

1012
01:13:57,305 --> 01:13:59,974
Come on.

1013
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:13,120
I'm disgusted by the way
your father treats you.

1014
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:19,093
Leaving you behind
to groom Maurizio.

1015
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:21,494
It's not right.

1016
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:22,997
Who does he think he is?

1017
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:27,868
Well, a dinosaur posing
as a butthole.

1018
01:14:31,906 --> 01:14:33,975
You were a comedian
in a past life.

1019
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,613
Maurizio likes you.

1020
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,716
- Ah...
- He always has.

1021
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:44,218
Well, I like my cousin too.

1022
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:48,723
He's quiet like a...
like a little mouse.

1023
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,858
Uh, tiny little mousy.

1024
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:53,260
Doesn't scream like the others.

1025
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:56,731
No, he doesn't. And you
and Maurizio together...

1026
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,599
That would be amazing.

1027
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:00,901
- That's a new chapter for Gucci.
- No, no, no.

1028
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:03,738
My father,
he would never allow it.

1029
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:07,541
He's got my little peaches
in a very tight grip.

1030
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,110
Paolo...

1031
01:15:11,278 --> 01:15:12,680
maybe it's time...

1032
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,516
to respectfully...

1033
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:18,686
leave him behind.

1034
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:22,523
You are justified.

1035
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,031
I do have...

1036
01:15:30,831 --> 01:15:33,000
something on my father.

1037
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:37,938
Can you keep a secret?

1038
01:15:38,005 --> 01:15:40,708
Cross your heart
and hope to die.

1039
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:45,646
Father, Son,
and House of Gucci.

1040
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:46,981
Okay.

1041
01:15:48,616 --> 01:15:49,884
Okay.

1042
01:15:57,324 --> 01:15:59,126
Well, you know...

1043
01:15:59,193 --> 01:16:00,594
You don't
have to tell me.

1044
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,363
- Listen...
- It's just...

1045
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,632
I can come back any time.
We can talk about your designs.

1046
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:10,071
But what would I get
out of this?

1047
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:20,214
We could offer you
an exclusive deal

1048
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,683
to distribute your own line
under Gucci.

1049
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:25,619
I should talk to Maurizio.

1050
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:32,693
<i>You talked to him?</i>

1051
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:34,295
When?

1052
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:36,831
Today.

1053
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,699
He showed me his designs.

1054
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,701
Why didn't you tell me?

1055
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:43,671
I'm telling you now,
aren't I?

1056
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:45,507
Patrizia,
that's not the point.

1057
01:16:45,574 --> 01:16:49,076
Don't focus on the process,
focus on the result.

1058
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,680
I told him...

1059
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:54,348
we'd distribute
his clothing line

1060
01:16:54,415 --> 01:16:57,084
under Gucci
and he committed to a deal.

1061
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:04,758
Maurizio, those designs
won't see the light of day.

1062
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:06,827
We need Paolo on our side.

1063
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,230
What game are you playing?

1064
01:17:15,336 --> 01:17:17,338
I'm looking out
for our best interests.

1065
01:17:17,404 --> 01:17:18,439
Is that a game?

1066
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,760
Mau, Mau!

1067
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:41,295
Thank you for coming.

1068
01:17:43,964 --> 01:17:45,733
You thought I lost my touch.

1069
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:48,135
No, not yet.

1070
01:17:48,202 --> 01:17:49,904
<i>Ciao,</i> Paolo.

1071
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:50,804
You sounded urgent,
so I came right away.

1072
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:52,006
Very well.

1073
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:09,423
I got these from three
of his ex "secretaries."

1074
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,259
He's not exactly
a favorite among the ex's.

1075
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:15,296
In fact,
they all hate his guts.

1076
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:25,339
Gucci is a very black hole
of undeclared income.

1077
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,275
Paolo, this is fraud...

1078
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:30,277
on a global scale.

1079
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:33,714
In Italy taxes are okay,
but in America...

1080
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:35,916
it is very different.

1081
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:39,220
We should keep this
to ourselves.

1082
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:42,323
But we can use it...

1083
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:46,093
as leverage
to persuade him a bit.

1084
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,796
And with you...

1085
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,565
on my side...

1086
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:53,100
we have the majority we need

1087
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,135
for you to become your own man.

1088
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:59,106
And he won't get into
any real trouble, right?

1089
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:02,142
No. At this point...

1090
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,945
worst case scenario,
he pays his taxes.

1091
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:06,715
They slap his wrists.

1092
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,249
Happens all the time.

1093
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,885
But more importantly,
he would see you.

1094
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:14,888
He would see you.

1095
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,127
I could finally soar...

1096
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:23,831
like a pigeon.

1097
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,869
I'm tired of being
held back.

1098
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:32,840
Father, I'm tired
of being held back.

1099
01:19:32,906 --> 01:19:34,908
I'm serious.

1100
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:37,512
I'm serious.

1101
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:39,380
I'm tired of being held back.

1102
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:41,882
I want freedom.

1103
01:19:42,483 --> 01:19:43,652
I'm serious.

1104
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:45,052
No, I'm serious.

1105
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:49,923
<i>Hello?</i>

1106
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:52,627
<i>Hello?</i>

1107
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,228
- Yeah. The...
- <i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

1108
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:55,796
No, it's a terrible line,
and I...

1109
01:19:55,863 --> 01:19:57,498
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

1110
01:19:57,565 --> 01:20:01,001
- <i>I can call you back.</i>
- No, no. It's midnight.

1111
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,238
<i>It's late here. Just tell me
what's on your mind.</i>

1112
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:05,205
<i>What happened?</i>

1113
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:06,407
I, uh...

1114
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,809
I want my freedom.

1115
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:12,813
I'm tired of being held back.

1116
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,348
I'm serious.

1117
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,884
<i>Freedom?</i>

1118
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,920
Uh... Paolo,
please just wait till tomorrow.

1119
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,056
I'll talk to you about it
tomorrow, all right? I'm busy here.

1120
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:25,426
I have your tax filings.

1121
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:29,229
Taxes? What are
you talking about?

1122
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:32,433
- <i>That's it, Paolo.</i>
- I don't want to expose you, Father.

1123
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,536
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Go to bed.

1124
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:36,705
- <i>You need to go to bed, Paolo. All right?</i>
- I, uh...

1125
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:51,418
Hi, Adriana. How are you?

1126
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:52,486
Hi.

1127
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:05,165
Al.

1128
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:07,034
What?

1129
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:12,940
What?

1130
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:27,622
Criminal tax evasion
sounds pretty serious.

1131
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,456
What if they dig deeper?

1132
01:21:29,524 --> 01:21:32,092
What if they find
even more dirt?

1133
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,596
<i>My father, he's 70.</i>

1134
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:36,598
<i>He's no spring chicken.</i>

1135
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:40,167
We were just supposed
to spook him.

1136
01:21:44,004 --> 01:21:47,642
Do you think he'll know
it was us?

1137
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:50,377
<i>Paolo, no, no, no.
He'll be fine.</i>

1138
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,514
I'm sending a draft
of your contract next week

1139
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:55,416
and we'll go into production
on your line soon after.

1140
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:57,384
<i>My line?</i>

1141
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:59,153
How can I think about my line

1142
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:02,089
when my father could be
dropping the soap?

1143
01:22:05,325 --> 01:22:07,428
Paolo, isn't this
what you wanted?

1144
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:32,286
Paolo...

1145
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:36,290
how could you do this to me?

1146
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,494
Mr. Aldo Gucci.

1147
01:22:43,932 --> 01:22:45,733
This court finds you guilty

1148
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,736
of five counts of failure
to file accurate tax returns,

1149
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:52,072
one count of failure to file a
report of a foreign bank account,

1150
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:54,107
and two counts of bank fraud.

1151
01:22:54,174 --> 01:22:56,611
I hereby sentence you
to a year and a day

1152
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:58,111
in a state penitentiary.

1153
01:22:58,178 --> 01:22:59,914
Court will stand adjourned.

1154
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,449
Good evening.
Are you Paolo Gucci?

1155
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,351
The one and only.

1156
01:23:38,987 --> 01:23:41,188
Another parking ticket?

1157
01:23:44,893 --> 01:23:47,461
"Cease and desist"?

1158
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:51,465
Well, you've broken certain exclusive

Copyright holder?

1161
01:24:00,942 --> 01:24:02,844
I am the copyright.

1162
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:04,311
I am sorry.

1163
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,079
- Do something.
- But it's Gucci S.P.A.

1164
01:24:10,718 --> 01:24:12,820
Oh.

1165
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,401
Please, the show is over.
Thank you.

1166
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:29,169
Towards the exit, please.

1167
01:24:31,573 --> 01:24:33,575
We have to go,
please, everyone.

1168
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:37,612
Get down from the catwalk.
Keep moving, please.

1169
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:38,613
The show is over.

1170
01:24:43,216 --> 01:24:44,552
Towards the exit.

1171
01:25:25,693 --> 01:25:26,628
Paolo.

1172
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,264
Why?

1173
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:34,035
Why?

1174
01:25:34,102 --> 01:25:36,203
Why did you do it?

1175
01:25:36,269 --> 01:25:38,573
- Do what?
- What happened?

1176
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,511
Don't even look at me,
you lying sack of potatoes.

1177
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:45,379
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- Paolo.

1178
01:25:45,445 --> 01:25:47,115
- We are outside the church.
- Paolo!

1179
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,448
- You shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut your mouth.

1180
01:25:48,516 --> 01:25:49,884
Think about Alessandra.

1181
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:51,586
Get her in the car.

1182
01:25:51,653 --> 01:25:53,621
- Put Alessandra in the car.
- Paolo, what's wrong?

1183
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:55,188
You...

1184
01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:56,958
- And you!
- Okay. Okay!

1185
01:25:57,025 --> 01:26:00,895
You ripped my heart out,
let it die in the street.

1186
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:03,064
Oh, my God. My wife...

1187
01:26:03,131 --> 01:26:06,934
My wife had to sing
till her voice was hoarse...

1188
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:10,270
while we figured out
what the fuck was going on.

1189
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:16,309
Why did you report me
for copyright breach?

1190
01:26:16,376 --> 01:26:18,513
Gucci is my name too.

1191
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:21,749
You abused the Gucci name.

1192
01:26:21,816 --> 01:26:23,216
No, no.

1193
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:26,120
- And started a trade war.
- No. I... No.

1194
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:29,256
I didn't. I swear I didn't,
okay?

1195
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:34,162
It's my name.
It's not even your real name, okay?

1196
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,133
Mau...

1197
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:43,336
Mau, it's me, Paolo.

1198
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:45,573
How could you?

1199
01:26:47,508 --> 01:26:49,911
But we're a family. Huh?

1200
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:58,653
What about our family business?

1201
01:27:01,756 --> 01:27:02,757
You're right.

1202
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:05,425
- You're right.
- No.

1203
01:27:05,492 --> 01:27:07,294
We are a family business.

1204
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:10,098
You're right and I don't
want to hurt you.

1205
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:11,699
I want to do right by you.

1206
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,770
But, Paolo, we have
a proposition for you.

1207
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:17,504
It's the only way.

1208
01:27:22,677 --> 01:27:23,678
Sorry.

1209
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:31,619
We want to buy
your shares of Gucci.

1210
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:41,229
You got some courage,
you know that?

1211
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:50,571
And she has bigger
mangoes than you.

1212
01:27:57,545 --> 01:28:01,215
You're a character,
you know that?

1213
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:04,051
My quiet lawyer cousin.

1214
01:28:04,118 --> 01:28:07,655
- Okay. Okay.
- The tiny little mouse is a character.

1215
01:28:07,722 --> 01:28:09,791
- Hey, watch out.
- Who knew?

1216
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:13,426
Paolo, we both know
it's for the best.

1217
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:14,862
Boof.

1218
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:23,871
Never confuse shit
with <i>cioccolato.</i>

1219
01:28:23,938 --> 01:28:26,741
They may look the same...

1220
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:28,441
but the taste?

1221
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:30,044
Very different.

1222
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:34,248
Trust me, I know.

1223
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:40,320
I'd rather see Gucci burn than to
hand it over to you two bastards.

1224
01:28:42,523 --> 01:28:43,658
<i>Ciao.</i>

1225
01:28:46,561 --> 01:28:48,361
Come on, let's go.

1226
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,433
Paolo...

1227
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,770
Let's go, Maurizio. Come on.

1228
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:03,611
How do you know all this?

1229
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:05,478
Maurizio, could you...

1230
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:12,954
There's the police.

1231
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:15,455
The police are here?

1232
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:17,490
Yeah. Financial police.

1233
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:37,879
- Go.
- Go upstairs.

1234
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:39,680
- Gather with me.
- Check everywhere.

1235
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:40,681
Come on.

1236
01:29:41,883 --> 01:29:42,917
Please. In there.

1237
01:30:06,107 --> 01:30:08,009
- Can I help you?
- No.

1238
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:23,124
<i>Signore!</i>

1239
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:24,892
Can I help you?

1240
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,894
Of course, madam.

1241
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:28,663
Patrizia Gucci.

1242
01:30:28,729 --> 01:30:31,599
Alberto de Renzi.
Man in charge of the operation.

1243
01:30:33,768 --> 01:30:35,870
No, thank you.
We don't drink.

1244
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:38,572
- Johnnie Walker? Splash of water?
- Neither, thank you.

1245
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,487
Passport please.

1246
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,895
And open your visor.

1247
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:19,113
Thank you.

1248
01:31:46,774 --> 01:31:48,642
Thank you, Roberto.

1249
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:50,778
You're not listening to me.

1250
01:31:50,845 --> 01:31:52,780
I'm here to help you.

1251
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:55,016
Thank you, <i>Signora</i> Gucci.

1252
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:57,718
We just need to perform
a few more analyses.

1253
01:31:57,785 --> 01:32:00,054
Please,
let me help you.

1254
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:03,824
I'm very resourceful.
Let's discuss.

1255
01:32:03,891 --> 01:32:05,559
We have nothing more
to say at this moment.

1256
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:07,228
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:32:07,294 --> 01:32:08,496
Thank you.

1258
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:10,898
Patrizia, please. Please.

1259
01:32:10,965 --> 01:32:12,967
- Goodbye, <i>Signora</i> Gucci.
- Domenico, please.

1260
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,905
It took you
fucking long enough.

1261
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:19,774
Maurizio called
from St. Moritz...

1262
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,043
and he said you can join him
there whenever you want.

1263
01:32:28,049 --> 01:32:30,051
They took
my daughter's shoes.

1264
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:43,197
What's this about
a forged signature?

1265
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:45,232
Eh?

1266
01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:49,904
What forged signature?

1267
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,906
You know nothing about it?

1268
01:32:54,742 --> 01:32:55,743
Get them out.

1269
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,645
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1270
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:03,017
Paolo.

1271
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,220
Paolo.

1272
01:33:07,522 --> 01:33:08,923
Must be Paolo.

1273
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,624
Yeah. I told you
he was fucking trouble.

1274
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:11,826
Idiot.

1275
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,822
Maurizio?

1276
01:34:20,094 --> 01:34:21,462
Paola.

1277
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,664
- I knew it was you.
- Oh, wow!

1278
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:25,600
Paola.

1279
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:26,800
You look exactly the same.

1280
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:28,669
So do you.

1281
01:34:28,736 --> 01:34:30,471
Until then,
you're coming with us.

1282
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:31,872
- I am not going.
- Because you said you were.

1283
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:32,940
No. I always wanted to come.

1284
01:34:33,007 --> 01:34:34,141
You said you would.

1285
01:34:34,975 --> 01:34:36,377
Maurizio, Maurizio!

1286
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,321
Hey...

1287
01:34:51,325 --> 01:34:52,960
Hope
I'm not interrupting.

1288
01:34:53,027 --> 01:34:54,728
No, of course not.
You're not interrupting.

1289
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,265
I see you've put up the tree.

1290
01:34:58,332 --> 01:34:59,800
Yes. Yes.

1291
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:02,236
Everybody, this is Patrizia.

1292
01:35:03,404 --> 01:35:06,073
- Hey, Patrizia.
- And this is Alessandra.

1293
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,344
- Hello.
- Franco and Gianni, you know, of course.

1294
01:35:10,411 --> 01:35:11,912
This is my friend Paola...

1295
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:14,649
and these are
all of her slaves.

1296
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,051
Alessandra.

1297
01:35:21,188 --> 01:35:22,156
Oh, sorry.

1298
01:35:24,825 --> 01:35:27,161
What do you think
of the macaroons?

1299
01:35:27,228 --> 01:35:30,464
This hazelnut one
is to die for.

1300
01:35:30,532 --> 01:35:33,767
Yeah. Where did you get 'em?

1301
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:37,838
There is this charming little place
by Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in Paris.

1302
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:41,942
"De-Lorette."
Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

1303
01:35:42,009 --> 01:35:43,143
- Right.
- De-Lorette.

1304
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:47,181
Maurizio and I stayed there
five years ago.

1305
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,317
We had the most amazing time.

1306
01:35:50,384 --> 01:35:53,854
I begged Maurizio to take me
there for my 25th birthday.

1307
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:57,024
And of course, he obliged.

1308
01:35:58,727 --> 01:36:00,995
As soon as we landed,
we went to the Jules Verne restaurant...

1309
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:02,731
in the Eiffel Tower.

1310
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:04,365
It's at the top.

1311
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,400
No, no, no.
It's on the second floor.

1312
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:10,938
It was magnificent.

1313
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:13,407
Later we went to the Louvre.

1314
01:36:13,474 --> 01:36:15,677
I'd always dreamt
of seeing the Louvre.

1315
01:36:15,744 --> 01:36:18,445
We arranged for a private tour.
Thank God.

1316
01:36:18,513 --> 01:36:20,981
Imagine all those crowds.
I couldn't do it.

1317
01:36:21,048 --> 01:36:24,218
They just want to know where
you got the macaroons, sweetie.

1318
01:36:24,285 --> 01:36:25,853
I'm telling them.

1319
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:28,055
Yeah, you're filling the story
full of unnecessary details.

1320
01:36:29,823 --> 01:36:31,526
I don't think
our guests mind.

1321
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:33,794
They wouldn't say if they did.

1322
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,565
You're an unnecessary detail.

1323
01:36:45,906 --> 01:36:47,841
What I am trying
to tell you is...

1324
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:51,979
De Sole is the only person who
saw the unsigned certificates.

1325
01:36:52,046 --> 01:36:55,883
He worked for my father for ten
years and he never questioned him.

1326
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,985
I trust him.

1327
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:00,954
He's not the problem.

1328
01:37:02,323 --> 01:37:04,058
I heard the way you spoke
to me at lunch.

1329
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:05,727
He's not the problem?

1330
01:37:05,794 --> 01:37:07,194
I was tired.

1331
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:13,300
Next time, don't embarrass
me in front of those people.

1332
01:37:13,367 --> 01:37:15,537
Those people
are friends of mine.

1333
01:37:15,603 --> 01:37:18,339
I've known most of them
longer than you.

1334
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:22,109
He is the problem. Say it!

1335
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,446
Patrizia, I was tired.
I'm tired.

1336
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:28,382
Then wake yourself up
and say it.

1337
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:29,917
Okay.

1338
01:37:29,983 --> 01:37:32,721
When you make me
sneak around my own family.

1339
01:37:32,787 --> 01:37:35,189
When you set father and son
against each other...

1340
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:37,157
and me against Paolo.

1341
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:40,461
When you second-guess a person
like Domenico De Sole...

1342
01:37:40,528 --> 01:37:43,497
the only person
my father trusted.

1343
01:37:43,565 --> 01:37:47,067
These things have an effect on the
environment I operate in. On me.

1344
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,237
Actions have consequences.

1345
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:53,107
I did that for you.
I was being constructive.

1346
01:37:53,173 --> 01:37:56,210
I'm not gonna apologize
for that. No thanks.

1347
01:37:57,812 --> 01:38:01,482
My uncle is in prison and
my cousin thinks I'm scum.

1348
01:38:01,549 --> 01:38:03,585
And you think
that's constructive?

1349
01:38:03,651 --> 01:38:05,953
Don't pin Gucci's problems
on me, okay?

1350
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:08,021
I'm just here mopping up
your fucking mess.

1351
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:10,023
I never asked for your help.

1352
01:38:21,736 --> 01:38:23,270
Maurizio...

1353
01:38:23,337 --> 01:38:25,406
we're only stronger together.

1354
01:38:30,043 --> 01:38:32,514
The only thing
I need from you...

1355
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:36,016
is to stay away from Gucci
before you cause any more damage.

1356
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:40,454
I can handle it by myself.

1357
01:38:40,522 --> 01:38:41,922
Is that clear?

1358
01:38:45,693 --> 01:38:48,563
Truthfully, I'm only
getting involved...

1359
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:52,834
because you are an
incompetent, little baby idiot.

1360
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:55,469
You're a fucking
weak little brat.

1361
01:38:55,537 --> 01:38:58,405
You really are only
one half of Gucci.

1362
01:38:58,472 --> 01:39:00,107
The shit half.

1363
01:39:04,311 --> 01:39:06,013
And you want a real man?

1364
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:07,214
Here.

1365
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:08,716
Maybe you'll grow a little.

1366
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:27,234
Red, green, red, green. Red.

1367
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:29,336
- Green.
- Red.

1368
01:39:29,403 --> 01:39:31,371
- Green.
- Very good, Alessandra.

1369
01:39:31,438 --> 01:39:33,173
- Green, red.
- Green.

1370
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,709
- Green, red.
- Green.

1371
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:36,511
- I think that's it.
- Green.

1372
01:39:36,578 --> 01:39:37,946
Red, green,
red, green, red, blue.

1373
01:39:38,011 --> 01:39:40,915
Red, green. Red, green.

1374
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:42,884
Red, blue.

1375
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:46,286
Red, green, red,
green, red, blue. Yellow. Okay.

1376
01:39:46,353 --> 01:39:50,525
- Red. Green. Red. Green. Red.
- Red. Green. Red. Green.

1377
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:52,359
- Blue. Yellow.
- Blue. Yellow.

1378
01:39:53,962 --> 01:39:55,897
- You're very...
- The winner.

1379
01:39:57,331 --> 01:39:59,166
The winner gets a present.

1380
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:02,937
For Alessandra.

1381
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:05,072
Thank you, Mommy.

1382
01:40:05,138 --> 01:40:07,107
We'll play later.

1383
01:40:13,515 --> 01:40:14,649
Who is that?

1384
01:40:15,717 --> 01:40:17,017
Turn it around.

1385
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:19,787
Who is that...

1386
01:40:19,854 --> 01:40:21,288
Who is hiding in there?

1387
01:40:23,992 --> 01:40:25,492
I love you.

1388
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,027
I love you.

1389
01:40:28,128 --> 01:40:30,397
Merry Christmas.

1390
01:40:31,866 --> 01:40:33,233
Do you like him?

1391
01:40:34,736 --> 01:40:37,070
For Daddy, from me.

1392
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,280
You can change the strap
if you don't like that color.

1393
01:40:46,346 --> 01:40:48,081
Oh, no. It's fine.

1394
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:52,219
Okay.

1395
01:40:53,555 --> 01:40:54,656
Thank you.

1396
01:40:59,861 --> 01:41:02,664
For Mommy, from Daddy.

1397
01:41:03,698 --> 01:41:04,866
Mmm...

1398
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:06,568
I never know what to get you.

1399
01:41:08,468 --> 01:41:10,270
I'm sure it's perfect.

1400
01:41:21,883 --> 01:41:23,718
A Bloomingdale's gift card.

1401
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:27,287
Yeah, now you can
get what you want.

1402
01:41:29,456 --> 01:41:31,258
You know I never shop there.

1403
01:41:32,927 --> 01:41:35,897
Well, there is a first time
for everything.

1404
01:41:57,317 --> 01:41:59,386
- Paola, darling.
- Oh.

1405
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:01,689
Love the all-white outfit.

1406
01:42:01,756 --> 01:42:03,123
So chic.

1407
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:05,392
I made some strudel
for you and M.

1408
01:42:05,459 --> 01:42:07,595
It's the only thing
I know how to make.

1409
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:11,099
I'm on a diet, but I'm sure
Maurizio will love your strudel.

1410
01:42:11,164 --> 01:42:12,299
Oh.

1411
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:15,603
Would you like a cigarette?

1412
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:16,671
No.

1413
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:27,147
You ever steal anything, Paola?

1414
01:42:27,615 --> 01:42:28,549
What?

1415
01:42:29,117 --> 01:42:30,585
Forgive me.

1416
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:32,687
I am trying to teach
Alessandra...

1417
01:42:32,754 --> 01:42:35,288
the importance of not touching
other people's belongings.

1418
01:42:43,865 --> 01:42:47,334
I don't consider myself a
particularly ethical person...

1419
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:48,803
but I am fair.

1420
01:42:52,472 --> 01:42:54,809
What I cannot
wrap my head around...

1421
01:42:56,511 --> 01:42:59,714
is people who steal
just for ego.

1422
01:43:00,447 --> 01:43:02,349
Or the pleasure of it.

1423
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:06,319
For personal satisfaction.

1424
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:23,236
I'll have my maid
drop off the strudel.

1425
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,509
Good to see you.

1426
01:43:51,165 --> 01:43:53,233
Do you like my hair?

1427
01:44:03,443 --> 01:44:05,613
Maurizio,
do you like my hair?

1428
01:44:08,082 --> 01:44:09,951
Oh, yes, very nice.

1429
01:44:10,017 --> 01:44:11,284
Very chic.

1430
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,321
I was thinking, tomorrow...

1431
01:44:40,313 --> 01:44:42,449
Franco is coming
tomorrow at noon.

1432
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,286
Why?

1433
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:51,424
To take you both
back to Milan.

1434
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:57,565
Can we at least
talk about it?

1435
01:45:13,614 --> 01:45:17,350
I'll find the right words to say
what I want to say when I'm ready.

1436
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:22,824
You really, really hurt me.

1437
01:45:36,237 --> 01:45:37,538
Paolo won't do it.

1438
01:45:37,605 --> 01:45:39,472
He's too scared
of his father.

1439
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,042
<i>He's drowning in debt.</i>

1440
01:45:41,108 --> 01:45:42,877
<i>But we can't buy him out.</i>

1441
01:45:42,944 --> 01:45:45,112
<i>We need a cash partner,
Maurizio.</i>

1442
01:45:46,047 --> 01:45:47,515
Who do you suggest?

1443
01:45:47,582 --> 01:45:49,416
Investcorp.

1444
01:45:49,482 --> 01:45:53,821
<i>It's owned by Nemir Kirdar.
He's an Iraqi powerhouse.</i>

1445
01:45:53,888 --> 01:45:56,423
<i>They like high-end
retail investments.</i>

1446
01:45:56,489 --> 01:45:59,527
<i>They bought Tiffany's in '84
and turned it around quick.</i>

1447
01:46:09,402 --> 01:46:10,838
<i>Maurizio.</i>

1448
01:46:12,273 --> 01:46:14,842
Plant the seed with him.
I'll be back soon.

1449
01:46:19,013 --> 01:46:20,581
<i>Something's different.</i>

1450
01:46:21,315 --> 01:46:22,516
Maurizio's changed.

1451
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:24,685
He's excessive...

1452
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,555
and crazy.

1453
01:46:28,923 --> 01:46:30,524
And that woman...

1454
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:33,895
Don't be scared.

1455
01:46:33,961 --> 01:46:37,698
He's nothing without you.
Hmm?

1456
01:46:37,765 --> 01:46:42,770
Men have an awful problem with thinking
they are smarter than they actually are.

1457
01:46:42,837 --> 01:46:47,708
You mustn't let this
negative energy eat you up.

1458
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:48,709
Huh?

1459
01:46:49,877 --> 01:46:51,679
Remember...

1460
01:46:51,746 --> 01:46:54,548
you are unstoppable, Patrizia.

1461
01:46:55,049 --> 01:46:56,183
Say it.

1462
01:46:57,051 --> 01:46:58,853
I'm unstoppable.

1463
01:47:02,957 --> 01:47:04,558
I'm unstoppable.

1464
01:47:06,727 --> 01:47:08,396
I am only 50% of Gucci.

1465
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:12,033
I'm here representing
my own interests.

1466
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:15,703
I want someone to bring Gucci to
the forefront of today's fashion.

1467
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:20,508
I want a partner who can buy
out the other half of Gucci...

1468
01:47:20,574 --> 01:47:23,210
that's giving me a headache.

1469
01:47:23,277 --> 01:47:27,848
The half that's preventing
Gucci from being great.

1470
01:47:27,915 --> 01:47:31,152
The half that belongs to
your uncle and your cousin.

1471
01:47:31,218 --> 01:47:33,521
Investcorp has had great
success with Tiffany.

1472
01:47:33,587 --> 01:47:35,523
It is...
It is a resurrection.

1473
01:47:35,589 --> 01:47:38,159
True. But Tiffany isn't Gucci.

1474
01:47:38,225 --> 01:47:39,860
Gucci is a family business.

1475
01:47:39,927 --> 01:47:41,595
That means family problems.

1476
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:44,966
Yeah, well, I brought
something for you.

1477
01:48:01,615 --> 01:48:02,750
Burgundy.

1478
01:48:03,517 --> 01:48:06,687
Size ten U.S. wide, right?

1479
01:48:06,754 --> 01:48:09,190
This model is part
of the permanent collection...

1480
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:11,625
at the Metropolitan Museum
in New York.

1481
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,195
You can't buy it anywhere.

1482
01:48:16,697 --> 01:48:17,965
And now it is yours.

1483
01:48:45,459 --> 01:48:47,261
Yes, I...

1484
01:48:47,328 --> 01:48:48,963
Well, I...

1485
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:50,865
Well, when then?

1486
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:54,068
I've got to wash.

1487
01:48:55,970 --> 01:49:00,141
If you could smell between my
groins, you'd understand.

1488
01:49:03,044 --> 01:49:04,078
Si.

1489
01:49:04,145 --> 01:49:05,146
No, not...

1490
01:49:06,047 --> 01:49:07,248
Paolo.

1491
01:49:29,437 --> 01:49:30,638
Come on.

1492
01:49:31,138 --> 01:49:32,139
Uh...

1493
01:49:32,206 --> 01:49:34,075
I think it's, uh...

1494
01:49:35,209 --> 01:49:36,677
No, I know.

1495
01:49:36,744 --> 01:49:38,913
- I know, it's...
- You know what?

1496
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:40,414
There's no cars there.

1497
01:49:40,481 --> 01:49:42,983
Well, no, no, no.

1498
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:45,653
It's over there.

1499
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:47,988
It's over here.
It's here, I know.

1500
01:49:48,055 --> 01:49:49,790
Fuck a duck, it's over here.

1501
01:49:49,857 --> 01:49:51,492
What kind of car is it?

1502
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,727
Fiat 600.

1503
01:49:54,695 --> 01:49:55,963
- Fiat.
- Ah...

1504
01:49:56,964 --> 01:49:58,232
Fiat 600.

1505
01:49:59,266 --> 01:50:01,102
Paolo, it's here.

1506
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:03,304
Boof.

1507
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:15,082
Here. Right here.

1508
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:20,855
Boof.

1509
01:50:26,093 --> 01:50:27,294
Well...

1510
01:50:28,662 --> 01:50:31,799
I didn't know you would
end up in prison.

1511
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,269
- What?
- I hate myself for it.

1512
01:50:35,336 --> 01:50:36,670
Don't, please.

1513
01:50:38,272 --> 01:50:40,841
What did you do here?
What is this?

1514
01:50:40,908 --> 01:50:43,410
Well, I have been
a bit stressed.

1515
01:50:43,477 --> 01:50:44,678
No, it is...

1516
01:50:46,914 --> 01:50:50,417
- We have to clean this.
- Well, my life has been hard. Really hard.

1517
01:50:50,484 --> 01:50:52,786
- I haven't shit in a week.
- No, it's filthy!

1518
01:50:52,853 --> 01:50:55,789
And that bitch of a wife
promised to help me.

1519
01:50:55,856 --> 01:50:58,560
He shook my hand while
she knifed me in the back.

1520
01:50:58,627 --> 01:51:01,729
- Oh, Paolo.
- I've been drowning in legal fees.

1521
01:51:01,795 --> 01:51:03,898
It's been
really, really bad.

1522
01:51:03,964 --> 01:51:05,466
- I know.
- I couldn't even make love.

1523
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:08,402
Jenny left. And after that,
I was in bed...

1524
01:51:08,469 --> 01:51:10,905
- Jenny.
- ...with a pound of gelato <i>cioccolato...</i>

1525
01:51:10,971 --> 01:51:12,706
and very dark thoughts.

1526
01:51:12,773 --> 01:51:14,241
I am back. I am back.

1527
01:51:14,308 --> 01:51:18,379
We will start
where we left off.

1528
01:51:18,445 --> 01:51:19,680
Okay?

1529
01:51:20,615 --> 01:51:24,251
I also glad
to have you back.

1530
01:51:24,318 --> 01:51:27,288
Well, it's good
to be back too.

1531
01:51:31,358 --> 01:51:33,294
Well, look at this place.

1532
01:51:35,029 --> 01:51:36,897
It looks like it's given up.

1533
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:40,234
What?

1534
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:41,769
- Well...
- What?

1535
01:51:55,517 --> 01:51:56,817
What's that?

1536
01:51:58,653 --> 01:52:00,421
A really good deal.

1537
01:52:02,657 --> 01:52:03,924
What deal?

1538
01:52:04,792 --> 01:52:07,795
I met with their lawyers too.

1539
01:52:09,263 --> 01:52:11,600
I couldn't say no.
I needed the cash.

1540
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:12,866
I mean look at this dump.

1541
01:52:12,933 --> 01:52:16,070
I don't even have basic cable.

1542
01:52:16,538 --> 01:52:17,471
No.

1543
01:52:21,108 --> 01:52:23,811
I sold my shares
of Gucci to them!

1544
01:52:23,877 --> 01:52:26,046
No!

1545
01:52:26,514 --> 01:52:27,748
No!

1546
01:52:29,183 --> 01:52:31,051
No! No!

1547
01:52:41,895 --> 01:52:43,864
I know. I'm done.

1548
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:46,000
- No. No. No.
- No, I'm done. I'm dead.

1549
01:52:46,066 --> 01:52:47,401
- I'm dead.
- No.

1550
01:52:47,468 --> 01:52:48,769
I'm dead!

1551
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:50,237
Dead!

1552
01:52:54,275 --> 01:52:55,909
Come. Come here.

1553
01:53:01,148 --> 01:53:02,249
You're...

1554
01:53:03,417 --> 01:53:04,818
an idiot.

1555
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:10,157
But you're my...
you're my idiot.

1556
01:53:10,224 --> 01:53:12,926
Maurizio, these must've
cost you a fortune.

1557
01:53:13,927 --> 01:53:15,262
Art has no price.

1558
01:53:15,329 --> 01:53:17,331
I'm scared to touch anything.

1559
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:19,500
Oh, don't be scared.

1560
01:53:21,302 --> 01:53:23,672
Actually, be a little scared.

1561
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:27,709
That... That couch costs more than
most people's apartment in Monte Carlo.

1562
01:53:27,776 --> 01:53:29,511
Ooh.

1563
01:53:29,577 --> 01:53:32,547
- I'll try not to make a mess of it.
- No, no, no.

1564
01:53:32,614 --> 01:53:34,882
Please, please.
Make a mess.

1565
01:53:38,919 --> 01:53:40,821
Gucci will pay for it.

1566
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:51,599
For the first time in my life,
I can do whatever I want.

1567
01:53:53,802 --> 01:53:55,269
I like this song.

1568
01:53:57,772 --> 01:53:59,373
Take me back to Ipanema.

1569
01:54:00,474 --> 01:54:02,476
I've never been.
I've always wanted to go.

1570
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:07,881
Let's go.

1571
01:54:08,449 --> 01:54:09,383
Right now.

1572
01:54:22,029 --> 01:54:24,331
Ooh.

1573
01:54:24,398 --> 01:54:26,400
- Can you dance salsa?
- Of course I can.

1574
01:54:29,804 --> 01:54:31,505
I can't.

1575
01:54:35,008 --> 01:54:36,910
This could be a big mistake.

1576
01:54:38,912 --> 01:54:40,314
It's not a mistake.

1577
01:54:40,981 --> 01:54:42,316
It's a choice.

1578
01:54:43,651 --> 01:54:45,085
You can do what you want now.

1579
01:55:34,134 --> 01:55:36,003
Tell me where he is.

1580
01:55:36,069 --> 01:55:39,173
Just tell me
where he is, Pina.

1581
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:40,909
I couldn't see.

1582
01:55:40,974 --> 01:55:42,710
You're fucking lying to me!

1583
01:55:43,678 --> 01:55:45,012
Where the fuck is he?

1584
01:55:50,384 --> 01:55:52,019
Tell me where he is?

1585
01:56:16,611 --> 01:56:18,746
- Where is he?
- I'm afraid he couldn't come.

1586
01:56:18,813 --> 01:56:20,849
What do you mean
he couldn't come?

1587
01:56:20,915 --> 01:56:22,817
He had a business in Paris.

1588
01:56:22,884 --> 01:56:27,187
- He's lying and so are you.
- Maurizio is very busy, Patrizia.

1589
01:56:27,254 --> 01:56:30,792
He didn't even have the decency to
come to his daughter's last recital.

1590
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:32,192
What kind of a father is he?

1591
01:56:33,227 --> 01:56:35,095
There will be
a new arrangement.

1592
01:56:35,162 --> 01:56:37,599
And why did he send you, huh?

1593
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:39,901
Hey, Domenico,
why did he send you?

1594
01:56:39,968 --> 01:56:41,569
What, you're his
little fucking messenger?

1595
01:56:41,636 --> 01:56:43,237
He didn't have
the decency to come here.

1596
01:56:43,303 --> 01:56:45,272
He's too much of a coward
to do it himself?

1597
01:56:45,339 --> 01:56:46,674
I have the papers right here.

1598
01:56:47,942 --> 01:56:49,409
Papers?

1599
01:56:49,476 --> 01:56:52,279
Ah, papers!
I'm not signing any papers.

1600
01:56:52,346 --> 01:56:56,183
You can tell him to come here and talk
to me like a fucking normal human being.

1601
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:59,621
Maurizio said you and Alessandra can
continue to live in the penthouse

1602
01:56:59,687 --> 01:57:02,289
since it's no longer
his primary residence.

1603
01:57:02,356 --> 01:57:06,159
He's happy to extend payments until
you're able to stand on your own two feet.

1604
01:57:06,226 --> 01:57:08,495
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

1605
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:11,131
What are you saying?
What are you saying to me?

1606
01:57:11,866 --> 01:57:13,467
Huh?

1607
01:57:13,535 --> 01:57:15,068
- These are words, Domenico.
- Support for Alessandra.

1608
01:57:15,135 --> 01:57:17,104
- I'm not talking to you.
- Shared custody.

1609
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,706
You come to my daughter's school.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1610
01:57:18,773 --> 01:57:20,808
Shared custody. He wants...

1611
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:23,043
He wants to make this as easy
as possible for both of you.

1612
01:57:25,178 --> 01:57:26,548
Shared custody?

1613
01:57:27,414 --> 01:57:29,416
Are we talking about divorce?

1614
01:57:29,483 --> 01:57:31,351
Is that what we're doing here?

1615
01:57:34,254 --> 01:57:36,123
Where is he right now?

1616
01:57:37,491 --> 01:57:39,092
Where is he right now?

1617
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:40,494
I'm not at liberty to say.

1618
01:57:41,596 --> 01:57:43,196
Look in my eyes.

1619
01:57:46,266 --> 01:57:49,269
Do you see anything
in these eyes

1620
01:57:49,336 --> 01:57:55,142
that would let you think that I would
ever let anyone ruin my daughter's life?

1621
01:57:56,243 --> 01:57:58,078
Compromise her.

1622
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:00,213
Do you?

1623
01:58:01,549 --> 01:58:02,784
Do you see that?

1624
01:58:05,419 --> 01:58:08,388
You know that won't happen.

1625
01:58:09,924 --> 01:58:11,559
I will relay the message.

1626
01:58:12,292 --> 01:58:14,028
Get the fuck out of here.

1627
01:58:14,094 --> 01:58:15,262
Yeah.

1628
01:58:24,104 --> 01:58:26,340
For your review, Mr. Gucci.

1629
01:58:26,406 --> 01:58:28,977
We hope you'll find
this offer appealing.

1630
01:58:29,043 --> 01:58:30,678
Well...

1631
01:58:30,745 --> 01:58:35,583
I'd rather not read
my own obituary, no?

1632
01:58:36,784 --> 01:58:38,753
Maestro, I can assure you

1633
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,188
there's no greater admirer
of Gucci than myself.

1634
01:58:42,724 --> 01:58:44,525
Oh, God.

1635
01:58:44,592 --> 01:58:47,461
To be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty.

1636
01:58:48,529 --> 01:58:51,331
It's something
we will cherish forever.

1637
01:58:52,265 --> 01:58:53,735
And truly...

1638
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:56,537
I understand
how difficult this is.

1639
01:58:56,604 --> 01:58:58,673
Please don't patronize me.

1640
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,273
Please.

1641
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:04,012
Those words
are not comforting to me.

1642
01:59:04,078 --> 01:59:09,216
They make me feel offended
in a way, I must say.

1643
01:59:09,751 --> 01:59:11,251
Mr. Gucci,

1644
01:59:11,318 --> 01:59:13,755
I have a plane
that leaves in one hour.

1645
01:59:13,821 --> 01:59:15,556
If there is a problem
with the offer...

1646
01:59:15,623 --> 01:59:17,324
Said and Omar,
they're at your disposal.

1647
01:59:17,391 --> 01:59:19,093
No, no, no.

1648
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:22,764
We are very
grateful for your offer...

1649
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,232
except no.

1650
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:27,135
Right, Papa?

1651
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,872
That shoe you showed me
before...

1652
01:59:30,938 --> 01:59:34,441
take a look inside your shoe
and see at the heel.

1653
01:59:34,509 --> 01:59:36,844
There's something
you should see.

1654
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:41,314
I remember ordering
a pair of those...

1655
01:59:41,883 --> 01:59:43,518
for Clark Gable.

1656
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:46,253
1953.

1657
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:50,290
Right before
he did the film <i>Mogambo.</i>

1658
01:59:52,026 --> 01:59:53,861
This is the rarest of shoes.

1659
01:59:54,696 --> 01:59:56,931
You see that? You see that?

1660
01:59:56,998 --> 01:59:58,465
It's a gold leaf.

1661
01:59:59,667 --> 02:00:01,268
You know...

1662
02:00:01,334 --> 02:00:03,771
I had to stop doing that.

1663
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:05,640
It got too expensive.

1664
02:00:09,877 --> 02:00:10,845
So.

1665
02:00:13,047 --> 02:00:14,916
Where did you get that shoe?

1666
02:00:15,983 --> 02:00:17,484
Where?

1667
02:00:17,552 --> 02:00:20,755
There's no way you bought
that shoe in London.

1668
02:00:21,488 --> 02:00:22,990
Who gave it to you?

1669
02:00:25,193 --> 02:00:26,359
Would you know?

1670
02:00:28,563 --> 02:00:30,497
My, he doesn't wanna answer.

1671
02:00:30,565 --> 02:00:31,899
Well, that's the least...

1672
02:00:31,966 --> 02:00:33,366
This meeting is over.

1673
02:00:34,168 --> 02:00:36,269
I broke up the meeting.

1674
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:39,372
Where is he going?

1675
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:41,274
I'm very sorry.

1676
02:00:41,341 --> 02:00:42,476
I had no choice.

1677
02:00:48,683 --> 02:00:49,684
Aldo.

1678
02:00:53,154 --> 02:00:54,421
Did you know this?

1679
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:57,792
No.

1680
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:00,895
No!

1681
02:01:05,133 --> 02:01:06,534
Maurizio.

1682
02:01:10,938 --> 02:01:13,541
You fucking traitor.

1683
02:01:54,515 --> 02:01:57,350
This is what you want?

1684
02:02:16,804 --> 02:02:18,338
Congratulations.

1685
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:24,879
You are now the majority
shareholder...

1686
02:02:26,446 --> 02:02:27,682
of Gucci.

1687
02:02:29,183 --> 02:02:30,818
You must feel wonderful.

1688
02:02:50,872 --> 02:02:51,806
Boof.

1689
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:57,511
You need to relax.

1690
02:02:57,578 --> 02:02:59,747
Relax. Relax.

1691
02:02:59,814 --> 02:03:02,650
You floating.
You floating like in the air.

1692
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:04,285
Floating. Floating.

1693
02:03:04,352 --> 02:03:06,621
From there to there.
Go left to right.

1694
02:03:06,687 --> 02:03:11,092
Ms. Wintour, walk into any one
of Gucci's 144 international boutiques

1695
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:13,828
and you will find you are
walking into a new world.

1696
02:03:13,895 --> 02:03:15,630
A new vision.

1697
02:03:15,696 --> 02:03:20,835
But wasn't the lure of Gucci
precisely its historical appeal?

1698
02:03:21,569 --> 02:03:24,839
The legacy is remarkable.

1699
02:03:24,906 --> 02:03:27,375
Well, this is true.

1700
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,410
<i>We are products of our past but we
don't have to be prisoners of it.</i>

1701
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,281
<i>I don't fear change.</i>

1702
02:03:33,347 --> 02:03:34,548
<i>I embrace it.</i>

1703
02:03:35,883 --> 02:03:39,787
Where Ralph Lauren stores,
they feel like movie sets

1704
02:03:39,854 --> 02:03:41,989
and Versace
is a rock concert,

1705
02:03:42,056 --> 02:03:45,826
Gucci stores will feel
like the Vatican of fashion.

1706
02:03:51,565 --> 02:03:52,767
<i>Grazie.</i>

1707
02:04:07,014 --> 02:04:11,085
How are you funding
your vision?

1708
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:13,988
Well, that is a very good secret.

1709
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:18,592
Don't ask.

1710
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,498
It may take some time
to recover...

1711
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:28,869
but this is a long-term plan.

1712
02:04:28,936 --> 02:04:32,505
<i>Sometimes you have to go down
to come back up again.</i>

1713
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,844
Ferre, Armani, and Versace!

1714
02:04:36,911 --> 02:04:39,113
That's who I said I wanted
designing our new line.

1715
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,248
And they would be honored
to be working for us.

1716
02:04:41,315 --> 02:04:43,117
De Sole,
where the fuck are they?

1717
02:04:43,184 --> 02:04:46,721
Maurizio, they have
their own lines.

1718
02:04:46,787 --> 02:04:48,089
They're their own bosses.

1719
02:04:48,155 --> 02:04:50,124
I know they have...

1720
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:52,593
I've spoken to everybody.
Nobody wants to...

1721
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,762
Then you haven't tried
hard enough.

1722
02:04:56,263 --> 02:04:58,132
There is someone.

1723
02:04:58,199 --> 02:04:59,800
Maybe.

1724
02:04:59,867 --> 02:05:00,801
Here.

1725
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,112
Who am I looking at?

1726
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:13,848
He's from Texas.

1727
02:05:14,682 --> 02:05:16,050
A mechanic?

1728
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:18,986
Maybe you should meet him.

1729
02:05:19,053 --> 02:05:22,056
I see cranked up blacks.

1730
02:05:22,123 --> 02:05:24,091
Jewel-tone velvet.

1731
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:26,293
And unconventional
styling touches.

1732
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:28,829
Loafers, sans socks.

1733
02:05:28,896 --> 02:05:31,532
I see pole dancers
flanking the runways.

1734
02:05:31,999 --> 02:05:33,067
Female...

1735
02:05:34,235 --> 02:05:35,736
and male, of course.

1736
02:05:40,007 --> 02:05:44,812
I have a vocabulary that
will allow you to expand.

1737
02:05:44,879 --> 02:05:46,647
That's what the brand requires.

1738
02:05:46,714 --> 02:05:48,682
That's where we need to head.

1739
02:05:48,749 --> 02:05:52,920
Without sacrificing the family
character of what this brand is.

1740
02:05:52,987 --> 02:05:54,688
The family character
is the brand.

1741
02:05:56,824 --> 02:05:59,160
I'm here to embellish.
I'm here to resurrect.

1742
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:17,044
Maurizio.

1743
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:19,313
Stop. Please,
please, please.

1744
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,714
I'm begging you.
Please stop.

1745
02:06:22,016 --> 02:06:25,152
Okay, I... I don't want
a confrontation.

1746
02:06:25,219 --> 02:06:26,654
Me neither.

1747
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,055
I tried calling.

1748
02:06:28,122 --> 02:06:32,493
Yes, and calling
and calling and calling.

1749
02:06:32,561 --> 02:06:34,061
What do you want?

1750
02:06:34,128 --> 02:06:35,629
I want to talk.

1751
02:06:35,696 --> 02:06:36,831
Okay.

1752
02:06:38,567 --> 02:06:40,569
Alessandra misses you.

1753
02:06:40,634 --> 02:06:42,670
I saw Alessandra
two weeks ago.

1754
02:06:42,736 --> 02:06:44,338
She talks about you
all the time.

1755
02:06:44,405 --> 02:06:46,874
And I'll see her very soon.
I've been very busy.

1756
02:06:46,941 --> 02:06:48,876
Will you come back home?

1757
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:54,782
You bought Aldo and Paolo out.
You did what I said.

1758
02:06:57,885 --> 02:06:59,220
Good night, Patrizia.

1759
02:07:00,754 --> 02:07:02,089
Come back home.

1760
02:07:06,227 --> 02:07:09,330
Patrizia, you know that's...
that's not possible.

1761
02:07:10,397 --> 02:07:12,800
Now, it is getting very late.

1762
02:07:13,968 --> 02:07:15,336
Go home.

1763
02:07:15,402 --> 02:07:17,204
If not for me,
just for our daughter.

1764
02:07:17,271 --> 02:07:18,839
No, no, no.
Don't do that.

1765
02:07:18,906 --> 02:07:20,741
- Don't...
- Don't...

1766
02:07:20,808 --> 02:07:22,810
I'll take
care of her and you.

1767
02:07:34,021 --> 02:07:35,656
We made something
beautiful together.

1768
02:07:35,723 --> 02:07:36,857
No, what?

1769
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:39,260
Take it.

1770
02:07:40,661 --> 02:07:41,729
Do you like it?

1771
02:07:41,795 --> 02:07:43,197
Patrizia, what is this?

1772
02:07:43,264 --> 02:07:44,398
Do you like it?

1773
02:07:44,465 --> 02:07:45,733
I made it for you.

1774
02:07:45,799 --> 02:07:47,801
You're humiliating yourself.

1775
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:55,075
Why are you talking to me
this way?

1776
02:07:55,142 --> 02:07:58,445
Because you can't see
what you've become.

1777
02:07:58,513 --> 02:08:02,082
This book... A story has
a beginning and an end.

1778
02:08:02,149 --> 02:08:04,185
And ours ended
a few chapters ago.

1779
02:08:05,786 --> 02:08:08,689
So, what do you want
from me now?

1780
02:08:10,659 --> 02:08:12,293
I want you to myself.

1781
02:08:13,727 --> 02:08:15,029
I love you.

1782
02:08:18,299 --> 02:08:19,733
Patrizia...

1783
02:08:20,801 --> 02:08:21,735
No.

1784
02:08:21,802 --> 02:08:23,137
I don't love you.

1785
02:08:24,505 --> 02:08:26,173
I don't hate you...

1786
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:28,475
but I don't want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1787
02:08:29,678 --> 02:08:31,779
Now, I'm sorry. I truly am.

1788
02:08:34,081 --> 02:08:35,983
What happened
to my Maurizio?

1789
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,751
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1790
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:41,021
I had no idea
I married a monster.

1791
02:08:42,056 --> 02:08:43,924
You didn't.
You married a Gucci.

1792
02:08:59,541 --> 02:09:00,975
He's always away on business.

1793
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:02,876
- He moved, you know.
- Hmm.

1794
02:09:04,044 --> 02:09:05,246
Mmm-hmm.

1795
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,881
I've told you so many times.

1796
02:09:07,948 --> 02:09:11,318
He moved into the penthouse
with that fucking horse.

1797
02:09:11,385 --> 02:09:12,753
I've seen them together.

1798
02:09:14,221 --> 02:09:16,757
Maybe you should
stop following them.

1799
02:09:17,592 --> 02:09:19,026
The things they buy...

1800
02:09:19,093 --> 02:09:22,830
Antiques worth billions,
cars, paintings.

1801
02:09:22,896 --> 02:09:24,431
With our money.

1802
02:09:24,498 --> 02:09:26,534
That he has thanks to you.

1803
02:09:28,536 --> 02:09:30,739
He's not even a businessman.

1804
02:09:30,804 --> 02:09:32,439
He can't even
run a parking meter.

1805
02:09:32,506 --> 02:09:34,676
How the fuck
is he gonna run Gucci?

1806
02:09:34,743 --> 02:09:36,210
You're right.

1807
02:09:36,277 --> 02:09:37,712
I know.

1808
02:09:37,778 --> 02:09:39,748
I made him what he is.

1809
02:09:39,813 --> 02:09:42,517
But when you're right,
you're right.

1810
02:09:42,584 --> 02:09:44,552
And you're very, very right.

1811
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:47,154
I'm gonna go see him tomorrow.

1812
02:09:49,557 --> 02:09:53,528
Maybe you should wait until
we come back from the Caymans.

1813
02:09:53,595 --> 02:09:55,429
And then we can...

1814
02:09:55,496 --> 02:09:59,266
we can do
a nice evil eye on him. Hmm?

1815
02:10:01,468 --> 02:10:02,870
Another spell?

1816
02:10:07,474 --> 02:10:08,976
We've run out of spells.

1817
02:10:11,613 --> 02:10:13,414
We need something stronger.

1818
02:10:21,088 --> 02:10:24,759
Maybe I can still do something
that will work.

1819
02:10:24,825 --> 02:10:28,829
But for that,
you have to be positive.

1820
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,475
I am being
very fucking positive.

1821
02:10:45,479 --> 02:10:47,649
<i>You are
a waste of skin</i>

1822
02:10:47,716 --> 02:10:50,417
<i>that belongs on the front
page of every newspaper.</i>

1823
02:10:52,286 --> 02:10:54,288
<i>I want the world to know
what you're really like.</i>

1824
02:10:55,557 --> 02:10:59,093
<i>I will not give you
a minute of peace.</i>

1825
02:11:01,362 --> 02:11:04,998
<i>You tried to crush me,
but you couldn't.</i>

1826
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:11,606
<i>You are a painful appendage
that needs to be removed.</i>

1827
02:11:11,673 --> 02:11:15,175
<i>The inferno for you
is yet to come.</i>

1828
02:11:21,583 --> 02:11:22,584
Two, Rita.

1829
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:23,585
Where the fuck are they?

1830
02:11:24,418 --> 02:11:25,919
If I knew how to use a pistol,

1831
02:11:25,986 --> 02:11:27,589
I'd fucking do
this shit myself.

1832
02:11:27,655 --> 02:11:29,156
Calm down. Calm down.

1833
02:11:36,831 --> 02:11:38,265
They'll show up.

1834
02:11:38,332 --> 02:11:39,366
Come sit.

1835
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:55,617
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1836
02:12:04,726 --> 02:12:05,660
Pina.

1837
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:19,139
Yeah.

1838
02:12:19,206 --> 02:12:23,076
Ivano, I told Patrizia that I know
you since you were a child, huh.

1839
02:12:23,778 --> 02:12:25,279
That we trust you.

1840
02:12:27,615 --> 02:12:29,049
I am Ivano Savioni.

1841
02:12:29,116 --> 02:12:31,251
This is my associate
Benedetto Ceraulo.

1842
02:12:39,727 --> 02:12:41,228
Who does what?

1843
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:44,131
Sicilian.

1844
02:12:45,667 --> 02:12:47,902
How soon can you do it?

1845
02:12:47,968 --> 02:12:50,872
As soon as
we know his routine...

1846
02:12:50,939 --> 02:12:52,874
and his security.

1847
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:55,008
And we are set on our rate.

1848
02:12:57,177 --> 02:12:59,446
Our rate? What rate?

1849
02:13:02,282 --> 02:13:04,117
- What is that?
- You told me six.

1850
02:13:04,953 --> 02:13:06,921
Yeah, yeah.

1851
02:13:06,987 --> 02:13:08,957
- Are you crazy?
- Why is he saying eight?

1852
02:13:09,022 --> 02:13:10,625
- I don't what he's playing.
- Why the fuck is he saying eight?

1853
02:13:10,692 --> 02:13:12,560
- No, I don't know.
- We said eight.

1854
02:13:12,627 --> 02:13:14,394
- No, it's six. 600 million lire.
- We said eight.

1855
02:13:14,461 --> 02:13:16,029
That's it. What are you doing?

1856
02:13:16,096 --> 02:13:17,632
Keep your fucking voice down.

1857
02:13:17,699 --> 02:13:19,299
We said eight.

1858
02:13:19,366 --> 02:13:20,501
- I'd consider it if only it was eight.
- Yeah.

1859
02:13:21,636 --> 02:13:24,137
Somebody else quoted me
for far less.

1860
02:13:25,807 --> 02:13:27,241
Six is all I'm willing to do.

1861
02:13:27,307 --> 02:13:29,611
It will have to be
a rush job then.

1862
02:13:29,677 --> 02:13:31,646
Yeah.

1863
02:13:31,713 --> 02:13:34,281
- And you have to provide us now with photographs.
- Uh-uh-uh.

1864
02:13:34,348 --> 02:13:38,118
Six is all I will pay.

1865
02:13:38,185 --> 02:13:40,020
We'll give you half now...

1866
02:13:41,221 --> 02:13:43,323
half later when it's done.

1867
02:13:45,058 --> 02:13:46,193
Okay.

1868
02:13:46,661 --> 02:13:48,195
Okay.

1869
02:13:50,197 --> 02:13:52,299
Don't miss.

1870
02:13:57,005 --> 02:13:58,171
Deal with her.

1871
02:14:02,142 --> 02:14:03,611
Really.

1872
02:14:03,678 --> 02:14:06,179
You don't wanna
make any mistakes.

1873
02:14:06,981 --> 02:14:08,115
Catch.

1874
02:14:10,317 --> 02:14:13,253
Pay for the coffee
and don't fuck this up.

1875
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,222
'Cause I'll put a spell on you.

1876
02:14:24,732 --> 02:14:26,034
Ready.

1877
02:14:30,738 --> 02:14:31,673
Wait.

1878
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,596
That's amazing.

1879
02:14:54,662 --> 02:14:57,130
I think he's incredible.
Love him.

1880
02:15:08,208 --> 02:15:09,911
Are you sure
this is a Gucci show?

1881
02:15:09,978 --> 02:15:11,679
Yeah, yeah.

1882
02:15:11,746 --> 02:15:15,415
Very nice, this jacket,
we've talked about for months.

1883
02:15:17,284 --> 02:15:19,219
It's beautiful. I love it.

1884
02:15:19,286 --> 02:15:20,588
You're in for a surprise.

1885
02:15:44,244 --> 02:15:45,580
Very modern.

1886
02:15:47,982 --> 02:15:50,450
Three, two, one. Go!

1887
02:16:04,866 --> 02:16:06,299
He looks great.

1888
02:16:14,241 --> 02:16:15,442
Bravo!

1889
02:16:16,711 --> 02:16:17,879
Bravo!

1890
02:16:23,283 --> 02:16:28,923
"When Tom Ford took over
the creative reins of Gucci in 1994...

1891
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:31,859
"there was little hope for
the Milanese fashion house."

1892
02:16:34,562 --> 02:16:37,932
"It took a German designer
to stir up Chanel...

1893
02:16:37,999 --> 02:16:42,670
"and it is an American who has put Gucci
far and away in the front of fashion."

1894
02:16:45,907 --> 02:16:49,811
"Some say Mr. Ford will give
Mr. Lagerfeld a run for his money."

1895
02:16:56,117 --> 02:16:57,852
I have to call my mother
in Austin.

1896
02:17:24,746 --> 02:17:27,215
What an unforgettable night.

1897
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:28,415
Maurizio.

1898
02:17:29,684 --> 02:17:31,719
And the response
is incredible.

1899
02:17:31,786 --> 02:17:34,155
I've never seen
anything like it.

1900
02:17:34,222 --> 02:17:37,625
Indeed. It marks
a new chapter for Gucci.

1901
02:17:37,692 --> 02:17:40,995
Hey, try the carpaccio.
It melts in your mouth.

1902
02:17:41,062 --> 02:17:41,996
Okay.

1903
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:54,041
I think we can all be honest with
each other around this table, yeah?

1904
02:17:54,108 --> 02:17:55,877
We're all friends here.

1905
02:17:55,943 --> 02:17:58,345
We can, we all
respect each other.

1906
02:17:59,213 --> 02:18:00,347
<i>Grazie.</i>

1907
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:04,819
We're very concerned.

1908
02:18:06,888 --> 02:18:09,023
What concerns you?

1909
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,858
Numbers.

1910
02:18:10,925 --> 02:18:12,459
Specifically, Gucci's.

1911
02:18:14,829 --> 02:18:16,798
Well, you said you didn't care
about numbers.

1912
02:18:16,864 --> 02:18:19,567
That you trusted your instinct.

1913
02:18:19,634 --> 02:18:22,335
Yeah. I care about numbers
when they're terrible numbers.

1914
02:18:24,872 --> 02:18:28,408
Our projections for 1996
are abysmal.

1915
02:18:29,644 --> 02:18:31,512
By slashing hundreds of
profitable items...

1916
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:33,581
You mean
my uncle's knickknacks?

1917
02:18:37,251 --> 02:18:41,488
Losses are likely to total
$30 million this year on sales

1918
02:18:41,556 --> 02:18:43,558
of $180 million.

1919
02:18:43,624 --> 02:18:46,828
Down from $210 million in 1991.

1920
02:18:48,129 --> 02:18:50,497
And $270 million.

1921
02:18:51,566 --> 02:18:54,602
There is $85 million
in bank debts.

1922
02:18:54,669 --> 02:18:59,372
We may even have trouble paying
salaries for the next couple of months.

1923
02:19:00,141 --> 02:19:03,077
Profits remain elusive.

1924
02:19:03,144 --> 02:19:06,581
And I've always said that our
strategic plan would take five years.

1925
02:19:06,647 --> 02:19:08,415
It's not about
immediate profit.

1926
02:19:08,481 --> 02:19:10,417
You go down
to come back up again.

1927
02:19:10,483 --> 02:19:12,086
That is how you get out
of a stall.

1928
02:19:12,153 --> 02:19:14,856
But the personal items
are a concern as well.

1929
02:19:16,524 --> 02:19:20,228
All paid for through Gucci's
accounts and charged as expenses.

1930
02:19:20,294 --> 02:19:22,763
The multimillion-dollar
antiques in the stores.

1931
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:24,699
The purchase
of countless cars

1932
02:19:24,765 --> 02:19:27,500
including a Ferrari F40
and a Lamborghini Countach.

1933
02:19:27,568 --> 02:19:30,938
$3 million on a watch,
a Patek Philippe 2523.

1934
02:19:31,005 --> 02:19:32,940
$7 million on
a luxury penthouse.

1935
02:19:33,007 --> 02:19:34,507
I could go on and on.

1936
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:37,111
An 18th century palatial villa
outside Florence

1937
02:19:37,178 --> 02:19:38,913
for use as a training center.

1938
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:41,315
I have justifications
for all of these things

1939
02:19:41,381 --> 02:19:44,285
but it doesn't seem that
you're in a place to hear them.

1940
02:19:44,352 --> 02:19:48,089
Maurizio, please try and take this
in the spirit of our friendship.

1941
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:51,158
We've been through
a lot together.

1942
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,461
You have many qualities.

1943
02:19:54,528 --> 02:19:56,297
But we must be realistic.

1944
02:19:56,364 --> 02:19:58,799
You're not a natural manager.

1945
02:19:58,866 --> 02:20:03,470
You can't run a business purely
on charm and eccentricities.

1946
02:20:03,537 --> 02:20:05,740
No. You need time as well.

1947
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:10,511
Last night does mark
a new chapter for Gucci

1948
02:20:10,578 --> 02:20:11,979
and I am the one
that brought it to you.

1949
02:20:12,046 --> 02:20:14,982
Maurizio, I want you
to understand

1950
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:18,853
whatever happens between
both of our companies,

1951
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:23,624
I have never stopped
respecting you or your vision.

1952
02:20:25,458 --> 02:20:27,862
But I have vision
for my people too.

1953
02:20:27,929 --> 02:20:29,897
And I have a business to run.

1954
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:39,740
We want to offer you
$150 million

1955
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:41,509
for your 50% stake in Gucci.

1956
02:20:41,575 --> 02:20:44,145
You want to buy me out.

1957
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:46,047
We want to save the business.

1958
02:20:46,981 --> 02:20:49,116
And who would be
appointed CEO?

1959
02:21:00,728 --> 02:21:02,596
She was right about you.

1960
02:21:07,001 --> 02:21:09,370
$150 million.

1961
02:21:09,437 --> 02:21:10,805
You'll be a rich man.

1962
02:21:10,871 --> 02:21:12,640
If you really think
it's about money,

1963
02:21:12,707 --> 02:21:15,142
then you know less about Gucci
than I thought.

1964
02:21:38,599 --> 02:21:39,900
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1965
02:21:39,967 --> 02:21:42,103
This meat.
Where is it coming from?

1966
02:21:42,169 --> 02:21:44,538
This is the finest beef
in Tuscany.

1967
02:21:44,605 --> 02:21:46,407
It comes from
the Val di Chiana.

1968
02:21:46,474 --> 02:21:48,542
The cows
are treated like royalty.

1969
02:25:20,354 --> 02:25:22,056
That's him.

1970
02:25:22,122 --> 02:25:23,324
Good morning!

1971
02:25:36,705 --> 02:25:38,072
<i>Signor</i> Gucci?

1972
02:25:56,957 --> 02:25:58,225
What's going on?

1973
02:28:17,732 --> 02:28:18,932
Patrizia.

1974
02:28:28,909 --> 02:28:30,043
I know.

1975
02:28:39,521 --> 02:28:42,356
Please see <i>Signorina</i> Franchi
out of my house.

1976
02:29:44,652 --> 02:29:46,353
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1977
02:29:50,324 --> 02:29:52,025
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1978
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:57,097
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1979
02:30:05,138 --> 02:30:08,510
You can call me <i>Signora</i> Gucci.
