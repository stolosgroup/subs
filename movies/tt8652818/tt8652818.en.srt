2
00:00:51,916 --> 00:01:04,291
sincerely

3
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,791
It was quite sudden.

4
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,625
If she wasn't feeling well,
she should have called us.

5
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:21,000
I bet she didn't say anything
because she thought you were busy.

6
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,791
Grandma was always like that.
You know that, right?

7
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,708
Daisy.

8
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,333
Are you blaming…

9
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,083
me for this?

10
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,583
Not really.

11
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:36,916
I just think…

12
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,041
Grandma must have wanted to see you more.

13
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,083
She must have wanted to see you more.

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,791
Because…

15
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,375
Grandma…

16
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,166
she loved you so, Mom.

17
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:54,958
She…

18
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,791
lost her own mother
when she was still young.

19
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,708
Letters?

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:21,958
Those are the letters Grandma received
from Great-Grandma after she died.

21
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,875
Letters from someone who had died?

22
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,291
She asked a doll to be her scribe,

23
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,666
so Grandma would receive a letter
every year on her birthday,

24
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,166
even after she was gone.

25
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,291
A doll? Are there dolls
who can write letters?

26
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:42,416
A long time ago, there was a man
who made a typewriter for his blind wife.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,458
He called the machine
an "auto memory doll."

28
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:52,291
Later, people began using the word "doll"
to refer to women who worked as scribes.

29
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,875
Scribes?
They wrote letters for other people?

30
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:56,791
Yes.

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:01,416
Back then, many people
couldn't read and write.

32
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,541
Later, more people learned how to write
and telephones became common.

33
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,250
Fewer people send letters now.

34
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,291
That job probably doesn't exist anymore.

35
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,541
Back then, when a person wanted
to write something special or difficult,

36
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,250
they'd ask a doll to do it.

37
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:27,041
Grandma really treasured
those letters very much.

38
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,750
I see.

39
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,958
We have to go back now.
Our patients are waiting.

40
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,666
Yes.

41
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,416
You too, Daisy.

42
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,083
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

43
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,625
Grandma would be lonely
without anyone here

44
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
after the funeral, right?

45
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,041
Daisy.

46
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,541
Why don't you leave, Mom?

47
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,916
You always put your job before family.

48
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,625
That's not true.

49
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,125
I care about Grandma.

50
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,208
I care about the both of you a lot!

51
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,416
Come, I'll take you to the station.

52
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,541
Daisy.

53
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,833
We'll come back after work.

54
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,166
Grandma.

55
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,583
I said an awful thing to Mom again.

56
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,916
Though I know…

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,708
Mom has a really hard job.

58
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,500
"Ann, happy eighth birthday."

59
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,875
<i>Many sad things may be happening.</i>

60
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,791
<i>And you might be feeling</i>
<i>overwhelmed right now.</i>

61
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,125
<i>But don't lose hope.</i>

62
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,541
<i>Even if you're sad and feel like crying…</i>

63
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,041
<i>don't forget:</i>

64
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,541
<i>Your mother loves you very much.</i>

65
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,125
<i>Ann, happy tenth birthday.</i>

66
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,916
<i>You must have grown up quite a bit.</i>

67
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,625
<i>But I'm sure you still love</i>
<i>reading and dancing.</i>

68
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,208
<i>Have you outgrown riddles and bugs?</i>

69
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,916
<i>Happy 18th birthday.</i>

70
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,791
<i>You're grown up now.</i>

71
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,291
<i>Are you in love?</i>

72
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,625
<i>I can't give you love advice.</i>

73
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,666
<i>But I'm sure whomever you choose</i>
<i>is a wonderful person.</i>

74
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
<i>Happy birthday, Ann.</i>

75
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,583
<i>You've lived for 20 years now.</i>

76
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,750
<i>That's amazing.</i>

77
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,125
<i>But remember, even adults</i>
<i>are allowed to complain sometimes.</i>

78
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,333
<i>Whenever you're feeling down,</i>
<i>remember that I am with you.</i>

79
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,458
<i>Ann.</i>

80
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
<i>I will always…</i>

81
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,083
<i>always…</i>

82
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,625
<i>be watching over you.</i>

83
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:03,708
<i>Ann.</i>

84
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,333
She received a letter like this…

85
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,291
every year on her birthday?

86
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,041
Great-Grandma<i>…</i>

87
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,458
must have been really worried
about Grandma.

88
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,625
A newspaper clipping?

89
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,833
Who is this person?

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,625
<i>Those letters were written…</i>

91
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,916
<i>by a doll who was very famous back then.</i>

92
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,291
<i>She wrote a love letter</i>
<i>for a princess once.</i>

93
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,625
<i>She also wrote the lyrics for an opera</i>
<i>performed by a popular singer.</i>

94
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:54,958
<i>And she even wrote the script</i>
<i>for a play of a famous playwright.</i>

95
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,666
<i>She worked for a postal company in Leiden.</i>

96
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,958
<i>But she quit when she turned 18.</i>

97
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,958
<i>Afterwards, there was no news about her.</i>

98
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,041
<i>The name of that doll was…</i>

99
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:26,916
VIOLET EVERGARDEN

100
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
I picked her up on the northern front.

101
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,083
She doesn't have a name.

102
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,583
Hey! Say hello!

103
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,416
You can't treat a child like that!

104
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:50,958
Gil.

105
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,083
She's no child.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,333
She's a weapon.

107
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,833
Just a tool, a tool of war.

108
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,416
Would it be okay if I gave you a name?

109
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,041
Violet.

110
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,416
Violet.

111
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:18,083
I have a feeling you'll grow
into the name when you're older.

112
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,083
Don't be a tool.

113
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,875
Be a person who embodies her name.

114
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,583
<i>Violet Evergarden.</i>

115
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,833
Come forward.

116
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,916
The writer of this year's hymn to the sea…

117
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,458
will now present the hymn
to this year's goddess of the sea,

118
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,250
Ms. Ilma Felice.

119
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:27,083
The hymn to the sea was very good.

120
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,000
Violet.

121
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,958
You must have truly worked hard on it.

122
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,500
Violet.

123
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,458
Yes.

124
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,083
It was different from a normal letter.

125
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,541
The sea is boundless.

126
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,958
It is home to many organisms.

127
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,125
It is abundant and beautiful.

128
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,666
However, it doesn't have

129
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,458
achievements, status, or personality.

130
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,333
It was hard to write praises for it.

131
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,791
Well…

132
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,666
Okay!

133
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,458
I'll write it next year!

134
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,541
You can't write the hymn to the sea
unless you're selected to do it.

135
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,666
I'm gonna start writing
lots of great letters

136
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,458
and make sure they choose me!

137
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,541
Right, Violet?

138
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,583
Yes. I hope they choose you.

139
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,041
Leave it to me!

140
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,541
Yes.

141
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,875
Violet Evergarden.

142
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,791
Mr. Mayor… and the mayor's wife.

143
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,333
Violet, this is the Mayor of Leiden

144
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,625
and his wife.

145
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,500
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

146
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,333
If it is your wish, I will travel
anywhere to meet your request.

147
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,083
Auto memory doll…

148
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,625
Violet Evergarden, at your service.

149
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,083
You're so beautiful.
You really do look just like a doll.

150
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,083
Yes.

151
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,541
I've heard so much about you.

152
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,083
It was I who recommended you to be

153
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,166
the person to write the hymn for the sea

154
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,041
for the Festival of Thanksgiving.

155
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,291
The public oath you wrote for King Damian…

156
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,666
of the Kingdom of Flugel
was a kind of public love letter.

157
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,791
It was quite beautiful,

158
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,666
as beautiful as you are.

159
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,875
When I wrote the oath for the coronation,

160
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,416
all I did was put the visions and
aspirations of the king into words.

161
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,416
Although you describe me as beautiful,

162
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:58,708
there is no correlation
between the words I write and myself.

163
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,708
I mean no offense.

164
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,791
Violet, in other words…

165
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,375
In other words,
I am giving you a compliment.

166
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,041
Right now, you are a doll,
but before that,

167
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:21,875
you were a brave soldier
who saved Leidenschaftlich.

168
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,583
I didn't save Leidenschaftlich.

169
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,625
It was the countless soldiers who fought.

170
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,083
But… the war claimed so many other lives.

171
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,708
I too took many lives.

172
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,333
Therefore…

173
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:54,041
I am not a person who deserves praise.

174
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,791
Should we eat?

175
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,708
I want yakisoba.

176
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,166
Try something else for a change.

177
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,541
Okay.

178
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,416
Violet.

179
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,250
Erica.

180
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,416
It's been a while.

181
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,083
Hey, you look like you're doing well!

182
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

183
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,458
President, it's been a long time.

184
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,791
How's being the playwright's assistant?

185
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,750
The same playwright that
Violet scribed for, right?

186
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,250
Yes.

187
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,375
I introduced Erica to him
after we went to see his play.

188
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,625
I asked if I could be his apprentice.

189
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,083
He writes and rewrites things all day.

190
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,958
It's hard keeping up with the typing.

191
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,500
But I'm learning a lot.

192
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,333
Do you want some yakisoba?

193
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,333
Benedict, we're trying
to have a conversation.

194
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,458
Don't talk to me like that.
You're so mean.

195
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,375
Would you like to walk around
the festival with us?

196
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,708
I'm sorry.

197
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,833
Thank you for inviting me.

198
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,541
But we have a rehearsal
for next month's play.

199
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,916
Did you write the script!

200
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,083
Yeah.

201
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,166
It's a small play we'll do
at the community theater.

202
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,916
But please come see it.

203
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,541
I'll be going now.

204
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,625
See you later.

205
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay.

206
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,166
It goes to show, anything's possible
if you wish hard for it.

207
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,416
Not everything
no matter how hard you wish.

208
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,333
What should you do then?

209
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,125
I'm going to excuse myself too.

210
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,291
I have a lot of work to do.

211
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,125
You can take the day off.

212
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,500
It's the festival!

213
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,833
No.

214
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,416
It'll interfere
with my planned work schedule.

215
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,958
I'll go back now.

216
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,625
Major.

217
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,166
Major?

218
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,000
Save yourself.

219
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,833
Leave me here.

220
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,000
You have to run.

221
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,291
I won't let you!

222
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,875
I won't let you die, Major!

223
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,250
Stop!

224
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,125
Just stop!

225
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,416
You have to live.

226
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,541
Violet.

227
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,291
You have to live.

228
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,000
Be free.

229
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,416
With all my heart.

230
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,666
I love you.

231
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,791
<i>Dearest Major Gilbert,</i>

232
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,958
<i>I had a flashback about you today.</i>

233
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>No matter what I see,</i>
<i>and no matter what I do…</i>

234
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,791
<i>my memories are connected to you.</i>

235
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,291
<i>As time passes…</i>

236
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,541
<i>and the past fades away…</i>

237
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,916
<i>my memories of the time</i>
<i>we spent together still come back to life.</i>

238
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,541
<i>You kept me by your side.</i>

239
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,416
<i>When I was unable to do anything,</i>
<i>you taught me how to live.</i>

240
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,000
<i>And you gave me…</i>

241
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
<i>the words…</i>

242
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,458
<i>"I love you"…</i>

243
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,750
<i>for the first time.</i>

244
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,166
<i>That's why I can't help writing</i>
<i>to you again like this.</i>

245
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:24,958
<i>I hope…</i>

246
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,833
<i>this letter will reach you someday.</i>

247
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,875
<i>And I pray that my wishes will come true.</i>

248
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:02,125
<i>That comes out to three Corse in change.</i>

249
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,333
Thank you very much.

250
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:11,541
It weighs 1,2 Leib.
That will be 11 Corse, please.

251
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,125
Hello. This is the CH Postal Company.

252
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,333
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere
to meet your request.

253
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,875
Auto memory doll,
Iris Cannary, at your service.

254
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,333
Yes.

255
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,500
She's here.

256
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,500
Thank you for waiting.

257
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:48,166
The schedule of the doll you requested
is booked for the next three months.

258
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,416
Could I help you instead?

259
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,791
Oh… I see.

260
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,625
I understand.

261
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,458
I'll make your reservation
for three months from today.

262
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,541
Yes… that's right.

263
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,208
Goodbye.

264
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,875
Iris.

265
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,916
Don't give the customers that attitude.

266
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,541
They can't see my attitude
over the telephone.

267
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,791
Your emotions show in your voice.

268
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,416
All right.

269
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,625
You have lots of reservations too, right?

270
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,958
Not as many as you, Cattleya.

271
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,375
At this rate, I'll never move up
from third place around here.

272
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,291
Thanks for your hard work.

273
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,416
Oh, president, good evening.

274
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:49,916
This week has been busy, right? I hope
you get some rest over the weekend.

275
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,125
I'm going on a business trip this weekend.

276
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,708
I've been asked to be the secretary
for the commerce treaty with Gardarik.

277
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,458
Oh, that's right.

278
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,375
I'm planning to attend
the mayor's wife's party.

279
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,208
I'm going to look for new customers.

280
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,791
You all work too hard.

281
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,958
I recently took up tennis.

282
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,625
I was looking
for someone to play with me.

283
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,791
Don't you have any sense of crisis?

284
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,833
We must work hard while we still can.

285
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:30,291
People will stop sending letters someday
all because of that horrible machine.

286
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
They'll finish building
that radio tower soon.

287
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,875
When that happens,
everyone is going to get a telephone.

288
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:56,541
You're right.

289
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,958
A lot of things are going to change.

290
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,958
Our postal company
will gradually change as well.

291
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,833
Someday, a doll's job will be considered…

292
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,291
old-fashioned.

293
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,166
It will become obsolete and disappear.

294
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,958
That's exactly why
we must work while we still can!

295
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,500
Violet, are you going to the party too?

296
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,166
No… I…

297
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,750
Don't make me bring my rival to the party!

298
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,666
Yes.

299
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,791
Don't make her do that.

300
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,291
I have my own plans for the weekend.

301
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,000
All right!

302
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Come on! Why can't you hit less hard!

303
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,166
I would if I were playing with a girl,

304
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,875
but it's just you today.

305
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,750
Everyone's so busy.

306
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,500
Even Violet turned me down.

307
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,666
I think it's nice
she's going out for a change.

308
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,375
But it's nice having her around.

309
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,875
It helps me get attention from girls.

310
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,625
When I'm out delivering, people ask me,

311
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,833
"Are you from the CH Postal Company?

312
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,333
Where the doll named Violet works?
Introduce me to her."

313
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:25,083
Don't use Violet
for your own dirty motives!

314
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,000
But…

315
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,000
I wonder where she went today.

316
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,625
You're so overprotective.

317
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,333
Captain.

318
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,375
So it was you…

319
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,958
who's been leaving flowers
for my mother every month.

320
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,166
I should've come tomorrow,
on the anniversary of her death,

321
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,458
but your other relatives might come.

322
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,083
Did I trouble you?

323
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:25,916
No.

324
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,333
But you didn't need to come all this way.

325
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,333
It's your day off today.

326
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,333
I was able to come
because it's my day off.

327
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,208
Are you here on his behalf?

328
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:49,083
I'm not doing this
on behalf of the major.

329
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:53,583
I came of my own free will.

330
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:00,666
How many years have gone by
since the end of the war?

331
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,083
You understand, right?

332
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,708
He's not…

333
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,375
Forget Gilbert.

334
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:10,958
Forget him.

335
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:14,958
It is…

336
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,333
too difficult to forget.

337
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,375
As long as I'm alive…

338
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,125
I can't forget him.

339
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:43,875
Hey!

340
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,708
Violet.

341
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:05,375
No. That flower is not a violet.

342
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,791
It's called a pansy.

343
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,708
I see.

344
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,083
You know a lot.

345
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,958
<i>Even if I never see him again.</i>

346
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,958
"I can't…

347
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,333
forget him."

348
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,041
My ribbon.

349
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,250
Hello. CH Postal Company.

350
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,666
<i>Um… Can I speak to a doll?</i>

351
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,333
I'm a doll.

352
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,416
<i>Really? I have a job for you.</i>

353
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,333
<i>Can you come to my place?</i>

354
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,875
Our company is closed today.

355
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,458
<i>What? Really?</i>

356
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,416
<i>I see…</i>

357
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:39,416
Pardon me, but by the sound
of your voice, you sound quite young.

358
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,958
What does age have to do
with writing letters?

359
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:46,041
Don't dolls go wherever you ask them to?

360
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:46,958
Is that a lie?

361
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,041
No. It's not a lie.

362
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,166
<i>Then come over!</i>

363
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,666
Who is it?

364
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,333
I'm the doll from the CH Postal Company.

365
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,833
Oh, come in!

366
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,291
Excuse me.

367
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,458
I am pleased to meet you.

368
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:40,083
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere
to meet your request.

369
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:45,333
Auto memory doll
Violet Evergarden at your service.

370
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,875
You really came.

371
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,500
I came as you requested.

372
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,083
You look young. Are you up to it?

373
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,541
I'll do my best.

374
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:04,958
Yuris!

375
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,500
Brother!

376
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,625
We're here!

377
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,625
We're coming in!

378
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,041
Just a moment!

379
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,541
Hide! Hurry!

380
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,416
Hurry!

381
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,750
Brother!

382
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,666
Yuris, was someone just here?

383
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,583
No.

384
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,291
Oh, really? I thought
I heard someone talking.

385
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,208
How are you feeling?

386
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,208
Stop asking me the same thing every day.

387
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:40,958
Are you okay?

388
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,958
If I were okay, I wouldn't be here.

389
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,708
Forgive me.

390
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,833
Brother!

391
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,666
I'll read you my story book!

392
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,583
I don't read story books.
That's so stupid.

393
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,875
Your brother isn't feeling well.

394
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,708
It's worse than that.

395
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,958
I had three surgeries and been
in the hospital for a whole year.

396
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,416
Yuris, Lucas said
he wanted to come visit you.

397
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,583
He said he wants to see you.

398
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:23,875
I don't want him to.

399
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,666
Why not? You two were so close--

400
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,583
I said I don't want to see him!

401
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,208
What's this?

402
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,208
It's so old--

403
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,750
No! Don't touch that, stupid!

404
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,458
It…

405
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,208
belongs to someone…

406
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,000
who came to visit
the person in the next room.

407
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,583
I'm just holding on to it a bit.

408
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,041
I'm tired now!

409
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,041
Sorry.

410
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,583
We're going for a walk now.

411
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,500
Good idea.

412
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,625
You get some sleep now.

413
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,000
We'll come again.

414
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,833
Sorry.

415
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,791
May I come out now?

416
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,541
Would you please explain…

417
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,666
why I had to stay hidden?

418
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,166
Young master.

419
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,916
You can call me Yuris.

420
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,750
All right, Yuris.

421
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:46,375
I want to write something without my mom,
dad, and brother knowing about it.

422
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,875
Write a letter?

423
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:51,958
Yeah.

424
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,500
Letters for the three of them.

425
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,416
Letters for them to read after I'm gone.

426
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:05,166
So I want you to hold onto them
for a while after we finish.

427
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,666
Don't send them right away.

428
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,208
All right.

429
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,708
You know what I mean?
Can you do stuff like that?

430
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,125
It's not a problem.

431
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,708
I handled a similar request in the past.

432
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:28,125
There was a girl who was
a little younger than you.

433
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,125
Her mother wrote letters to her…

434
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,291
so that she'd receive a letter from her…

435
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:38,625
every year on her birthday
for 50 years even after she was gone.

436
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,583
For 50 years?
Does that mean there were 50 letters?

437
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,666
Yes.

438
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:51,500
Even now, she still receives
one of those letters every year.

439
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,250
I'm sorry but I can't afford that many.

440
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,875
My money's in that tin.
Write as many as it will pay for.

441
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,458
So how many can you write?

442
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,666
If it's three letters… I can write
around 20 characters per letter.

443
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,750
Just 20 characters?

444
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,708
"Dear Mom…

445
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,875
Take care.

446
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,708
Yuris."

447
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:27,041
That's so short!
Even I can write that much!

448
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,166
I need…

449
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,666
I want the letters to make

450
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,333
my mom, dad, and brother feel better

451
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,416
after reading them!

452
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,291
Yuris.

453
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,541
That is the standard fee.

454
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:53,000
My company
has a special discount for children.

455
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,250
Therefore, the money
in your tin will be enough

456
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,333
to pay for any letter
you want me to write.

457
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,666
Is that really true!

458
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,916
It's true.

459
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,875
You're making it up!

460
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,666
I didn't make it up.

461
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,000
This special provision was created

462
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,375
so we can perform our duties
during times of emergency.

463
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,041
It's our emergency provision.

464
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,791
I don't really get it.

465
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,000
But… It sounds cool!

466
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,375
It means "good!"

467
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,708
All right, let's get started!

468
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,500
Your hand.

469
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,250
I lost it in the war.

470
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,916
I was also in a hospital a few years ago.

471
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,000
Can you write letters with it?

472
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:08,500
It took a while to learn
how to use this artificial hand.

473
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,000
But I can use it fine now.

474
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:15,000
I can even do gestures like this.

475
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,791
You're kind of funny.

476
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,375
People always just say to me:

477
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,416
"How are you feeling?"
"Are you okay?" "Go to sleep."

478
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,750
You're different from Mom,
Dad, and the nurses.

479
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,250
How am I different?

480
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,958
People are always worrying
about me, feeling sorry for me…

481
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,208
and being overprotective.

482
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:44,250
You know, I'm tired of that stuff.

483
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:51,250
Understood. I will try to eliminate
those three elements from my emotions.

484
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,458
You really are funny.

485
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,000
All right. Well…

486
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,333
Write me a letter.

487
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,666
Write one to my father.

488
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,208
Your father?

489
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:10,291
Yeah.

490
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,666
My father went off to the war.

491
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,083
He went to a country
called Leidenschaftlich.

492
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:20,125
He said he'd come back soon,
but he hasn't returned yet.

493
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:26,833
That's why I want to tell him that I,
my brother, and my mother are all safe.

494
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:30,083
Can you write me a letter?

495
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:40,083
Let's invite Violet out for dinner.

496
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,125
Okay. Let's go to that one place.

497
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,166
That restaurant…

498
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,208
we all went to when Violet first got here.

499
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,083
It's you.

500
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,083
Captain Dietfried.

501
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,083
Lt. Colonel Hodgins.

502
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,166
No, I should call you president.

503
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,958
I always forget that the war has been over

504
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,625
for many years now.

505
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,458
What do you want?

506
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:12,958
Well…

507
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,291
Violet!

508
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,041
Captain.

509
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:41,791
Please excuse my…

510
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:42,708
impertinence.

511
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,583
No. Don't worry about it.

512
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,500
Here.

513
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,666
Is that my…

514
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,041
Did you come to give that back to me?

515
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,750
I noticed you dropped it.

516
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:06,541
So the place that Violet went to was…

517
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:08,750
The graveyard…

518
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,500
where the major's mother is buried.

519
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,166
Captain.

520
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:16,833
Thank you.

521
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,208
All right, then.

522
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,500
Let's dump our stuff and go eat!

523
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,166
Good idea.

524
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,041
Violet, will you join us?

525
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,541
Okay.

526
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,083
Hey!

527
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,875
My family has decided
to get rid of the boat we owned.

528
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,750
The boat?

529
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,500
Yeah.

530
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:52,750
My brother…

531
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:56,000
sailed in it many times
when he was a child.

532
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:01,791
It contains many of his books
and the toys he played with.

533
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,208
If there's anything you want…

534
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,916
Could I have them?

535
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,416
It's a bunch of junk, really.

536
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,541
I'm going!

537
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,291
I'm going wherever the boat is docked!

538
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,166
I didn't know
you went to her grave every month.

539
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,875
Should I have told you?

540
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,416
No.

541
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,791
You don't have to.

542
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:34,458
You're free to do
as you like in your free time.

543
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:36,750
You're going…

544
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:38,791
to visit the boat?

545
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,208
I'll tell you when I go.

546
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:43,250
I said you don't have to tell us.

547
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:44,916
Violet.

548
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:48,791
Shall I go with you?

549
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,333
I'll be fine.

550
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,041
You may eliminate your pity, concern,
and overprotectiveness of me.

551
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,541
-She said she'll be fine.
-Shut up! Just be quiet and eat!

552
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,208
Violet's right.

553
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,708
You can't worry about her all the time.

554
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,416
Of course I'm worried.

555
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,750
Dietfried, that bastard.

556
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:30,458
He's playing on Violet's broken heart.

557
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,375
He could be good for Violet.

558
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,666
They can share
their memories of the major.

559
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,708
That man took advantage
of Violet being an orphan

560
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,416
and used her as a tool during the war.

561
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:47,958
Is that why he shouldn't talk to her?

562
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:50,125
Even if he's not like that anymore?

563
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:56,458
Are you saying they should lick
each other's wounds?

564
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,708
Would that be such a bad thing?

565
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,833
Violet still has feelings for the major.

566
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:08,333
I'm worried she's going to be crushed
by those feelings unless we do something.

567
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,375
The captain may…

568
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,166
bring comfort to her
in a way that we can't.

569
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,291
You know…

570
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,125
if I ever have kids someday,

571
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,833
I hope it's a boy.

572
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,083
My nerves won't be able to handle a girl!

573
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,166
This is one of the books
he was crazy about.

574
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,916
He played many games with our father.

575
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,708
Did this belong to the major?

576
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,208
No.

577
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,291
That's mine.

578
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,041
Excuse me.

579
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,791
You don't have to be so formal.

580
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,208
Yes.

581
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,041
You and the major must have sailed…

582
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,208
this ship often when you were children.

583
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,500
Yeah.

584
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,041
Our father took us out.

585
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,000
My father was devoted to the military,

586
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,250
but he liked sailing as well.

587
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,000
That's the only thing
I inherited from him.

588
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,666
This is our family's flower.

589
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:15,750
What does it matter?

590
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,583
What?

591
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,666
What did you just say?

592
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,916
That's what you wanted to show us, right?

593
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,666
You wanted to show us this,
so you could tell us to become like you.

594
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,291
Brother.

595
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,916
You just wanted to show us…

596
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,416
that this is our only choice!

597
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,541
Brother!

598
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:45,791
You, your father, and all of us
in the Bougainvillea family

599
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,208
have no choice but to join the military!

600
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,916
Father, stop!

601
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,666
Don't hit Brother!

602
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,208
I'll do it!

603
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:02,958
I'll grow up to be like you!

604
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,708
Since I was so rebellious…

605
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,166
Gil had no choice
but to listen to our father.

606
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,500
It's my fault.
He couldn't choose his own life.

607
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:22,125
But I still treated him horribly.

608
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:26,875
I have… no siblings in my family,

609
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,833
so I don't entirely understand.

610
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,625
However, I can understand…

611
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,291
how someone could…

612
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,708
have complicated feelings…

613
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,833
for someone they're close to.

614
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:45,291
You understand how other people feel?

615
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,250
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be sarcastic.

616
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,375
I know.

617
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,958
Is it okay if I keep the book
and this board game?

618
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,333
Yes.

619
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:11,958
Let's go now.

620
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:25,833
Are you okay?

621
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,333
Thank you.

622
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,333
We've both lost something important.

623
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,083
Both you…

624
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:39,541
and I.

625
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,000
Sorry about the other day.

626
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,875
For saying you'll never see him again,
and telling you to forget him.

627
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,208
I can't forget him either.

628
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,250
After all…

629
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:59,291
he's my little brother.

630
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:03,250
Yes.

631
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:09,916
If I could see him again…
I would apologize for many things.

632
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:13,250
And many things I would talk to him about.

633
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:16,541
Yes.

634
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,291
Next, the letter for my brother.

635
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:28,500
I wonder what
I should write to him, though.

636
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,458
Sion's still only five.

637
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,125
Why don't you tell him how you felt

638
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,750
when he was born?

639
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:37,750
Yeah.

640
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,291
I was so happy when he was born.

641
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:46,916
He was so warm and soft,
like a freshly baked loaf of bread.

642
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,250
But then…

643
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:56,791
Did you start to feel like
he stole your parents from you?

644
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:05,000
Did you feel jealous when your parents
praised him instead of you?

645
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:06,875
You're right.

646
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:11,500
But you thought he was adorable
whenever he chased you.

647
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,000
How did you know that?

648
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,375
I've heard other people talk about it.

649
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,666
Okay. After you write that, add this next:

650
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,083
"Live a full life in my place.

651
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,875
And in my place
be good to Mom and Dad.

652
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:42,958
Have Mom and Dad…

653
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,916
spoil you in my place."

654
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,708
To me, it seems like
you're saying things you don't mean.

655
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,416
What you really want
is for your father and mother

656
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,833
to spoil you yourself.

657
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,000
You know everything.

658
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,083
I've written a lot of letters.

659
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:17,166
Words, attitudes, and feelings
all have an outside and an inside.

660
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:22,041
I've begun to understand
that what you see…

661
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,916
on the surface isn't everything.

662
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:28,625
And sometimes you have to tell people…

663
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:33,458
your true feelings, or they'll never know.

664
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,083
Look.

665
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,500
How is this?

666
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:47,958
Thank you.

667
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,875
I'll hold on to the three letters
and keep them safe.

668
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:14,333
Give them the letters
on the day I go to heaven.

669
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,375
I'll ask the hospital
to inform the post office.

670
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,833
Yes.

671
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:27,083
Hey, can you do a pinky swear?

672
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,791
A pinky swear?

673
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:30,791
Yeah.

674
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,208
You link pinkies…

675
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,250
with each other.

676
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:35,791
And you swear…

677
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,958
to keep your promise.

678
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,083
Thank you.

679
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,250
Your finger is so cold.

680
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,250
Even through my glove.

681
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,125
I'll probably go cold
before the winter comes.

682
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:13,708
Still.

683
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,583
I think your letters will warm…

684
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:22,625
the hearts of your parents and brother.

685
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,375
I'll make sure I give them your letters.

686
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,375
Well, then, I've fulfilled my duties.

687
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:56,250
Wait!

688
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,541
There's one more…

689
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,833
letter I want to write.

690
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:06,416
Is it for Lucas?

691
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,375
I was listening from under the bed.

692
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:20,583
If there's something you want to tell him,
it's best to do it while you can.

693
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:22,666
You think so?

694
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,166
Yes.

695
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,083
I was…

696
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:30,166
unable to ask and say everything I wanted.

697
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:33,416
To whom?

698
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:35,500
The person…

699
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,916
who gave me "I love you."

700
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,500
Did that person die?

701
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,291
I believe…

702
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:47,166
that he's still alive somewhere.

703
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,791
What did you want to tell him?

704
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,750
That I understand…

705
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,916
what "I love you" means.

706
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,666
You understand? Is that all?

707
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:18,666
Lucas said…

708
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,208
he wanted to visit me.

709
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,958
But I told him not to.

710
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:30,166
Lucas and I have been close
since we were little kids.

711
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,000
We always played together.

712
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:35,250
But then…

713
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,083
my arms and legs…

714
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:38,833
began…

715
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,333
to wither.

716
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,458
I don't want him…

717
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,583
to see me like this.

718
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,208
I'll put…

719
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,375
those feelings…

720
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,375
in the letter for you.

721
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:54,750
As for the fee…

722
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,833
Yuris!

723
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,250
I'll get the nurse!

724
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:14,666
Let's leave the letter
to Lucas for next time.

725
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:18,791
Sorry.

726
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,375
No problem.

727
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,458
Are these all the "lost letters"?

728
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,166
I took them from Roland.

729
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,458
I thought I'd return the letters
whose senders we know.

730
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:25,041
So? Are you asking me
to help you since I'm the president?

731
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:29,000
Young people these days
don't like working overtime.

732
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,875
Look how hard I'm working.
You should make me the vice president.

733
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:38,500
You should go to accounting school first.

734
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,083
Our vice president
must understand the account books.

735
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:46,208
Whoa! Now, I know how to get promoted!

736
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,916
Then I might get serious.

737
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:53,000
Isn't this…

738
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,625
Yeah.

739
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:59,958
This is the shelf
where we keep recent mail.

740
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,083
This handwriting…

741
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:05,750
What's wrong?

742
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:07,500
No.

743
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:12,416
The sender's address
is on the Island of Ecarte.

744
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,875
That island
used to be occupied by Gardarik.

745
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,041
It gained independence after the war.

746
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,666
Why did you want to meet with me?

747
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,375
President.

748
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,833
The other day…

749
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:34,583
Is it about that doll
who works at your place?

750
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,708
Did she say something?

751
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,125
No.

752
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:41,791
Don't worry.

753
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:44,541
She left after she visited the boat.

754
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:47,375
She said that you'd be worried about her.

755
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:52,625
She said she'd tell me before she went.

756
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:55,958
You're not her guardian.

757
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,000
You have no right to control her.

758
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,875
You bastard! How dare you say that!

759
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:15,958
Sorry.

760
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,208
I was wrong.

761
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:26,291
This is the only way I know how to talk.

762
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:30,375
I didn't come today talk about Violet.

763
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,250
Isn't this…

764
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,166
Can you look into it?

765
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,125
President.

766
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,833
Sorry to disturb you so late.

767
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,958
I need to talk to you about something.

768
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:11,333
What is it?

769
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,833
I… haven't confirmed it yet.

770
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:19,750
But…

771
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,333
it's possible I'm wrong.

772
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,875
The major?

773
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,708
Is it the major?

774
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,166
Yeah.

775
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,166
Have you news of him?

776
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,541
Have you received new information…

777
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,708
about Major Gilbert?

778
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,875
Are you going to go now?

779
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,416
Yeah.

780
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,875
It might be someone else, but I'm going.

781
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,958
All right! We'll take care of things here!

782
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,541
Violet… Are you okay?

783
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,208
Am I okay?

784
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,416
Is it okay if I see the major?

785
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,708
Is there anything wrong with me?

786
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,458
It's been so many years.

787
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,083
Do you think the major will recognize me?

788
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,083
Come on.

789
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:00,875
Violet.

790
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:04,750
What should I say when I see him?

791
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,291
Tell him how I'm doing now?

792
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:09,583
Or tell him my feelings?

793
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,208
Will I be able to articulate it?

794
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:15,958
Am I being foolish?

795
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,166
Violet.

796
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,000
It's going to be a long journey, right?

797
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:31,208
Why not write a letter on the way there?

798
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:45,208
We're back, Daisy.

799
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,166
Sorry for being so late.

800
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:50,625
Daisy?

801
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:11,875
"I am going to Leiden for a while."

802
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,625
<i>The country eventually nationalized…</i>

803
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:46,208
<i>all the postal companies.</i>

804
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:49,750
<i>The one she worked for</i>
<i>was turned into a museum.</i>

805
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:12,500
<i>I wonder where she went after she quit.</i>

806
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:15,125
Please take your time looking around.

807
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,625
I'm sorry. I didn't notice you there.

808
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,666
No problem.

809
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:25,875
If you have any questions, please ask me.

810
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,625
Okay.

811
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:37,375
Actually, I used to work here
a long time ago as a receptionist.

812
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:39,875
Oh, really?

813
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:43,750
Yes.

814
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:01,708
Excuse me.

815
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:03,958
What's this stamp?

816
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,375
Oh, yes.

817
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:14,625
This stamp is only issued
on the island of Ecarte.

818
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:21,458
The island of Ecarte?

819
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,541
Did you say you used to work here?

820
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,083
Yes.

821
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,625
<i>Oh, sea of blessing</i>

822
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:42,041
<i>Sea that connects to the entire world</i>

823
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,416
<i>The seagulls dance, in your skies</i>

824
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:51,250
<i>The fish swim, in your midst</i>

825
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:57,458
<i>The shellfish burrow, in your bottom</i>

826
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:59,500
<i>You give light</i>

827
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,750
<i>You nurture life</i>

828
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,250
<i>You pour out love</i>

829
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,083
<i>We continue to live close to you</i>

830
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,166
<i>Until we cease</i>

831
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:21,250
<i>We entrust our bodies to you</i>

832
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,750
<i>In the present</i>
<i>In the past</i>

833
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,833
<i>And in the future</i>

834
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:58,416
It's supposed to be a ritual
for giving thanks to the sea.

835
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But it's become a day
to mourn those who didn't return.

836
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,500
No one returned from the war.

837
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,458
The only people left on the island

838
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:18,916
are the old, the women, and the children.

839
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:23,750
They died at war instead of at sea.

840
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,791
I must apologize to our ancestors.

841
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:32,708
Our fathers were killed
by those Leiden soldiers, right?

842
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:34,916
Yes.

843
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,791
I wish everyone in Leiden would die!

844
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:42,333
The hymn they just read

845
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:46,208
was dedicated at the Festival
of Thanksgiving in Leiden.

846
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,791
They say it was written by a famous doll.

847
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:55,291
Violet Evergarden was her name.

848
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,375
Everyone!

849
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:02,083
Come! It's time to eat!

850
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,458
Come on. Let's go!

851
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:20,708
Let's go!

852
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,125
Teacher!

853
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,916
I love you!

854
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:29,666
Let's go!

855
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:31,500
Come on!

856
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,333
<i>Major.</i>

857
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,041
<i>It's been such a long time.</i>

858
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,250
<i>I've thought about you…</i>

859
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,458
<i>every single day,</i>

860
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:52,791
<i>every single day while I couldn't see you.</i>

861
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,833
<i>I hope that my prayers will be answered…</i>

862
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,250
<i>that my wish will be granted…</i>

863
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,083
<i>and that I can see you again…</i>

864
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:04,958
<i>someday.</i>

865
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:14,833
Violet.

866
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:18,375
Can you wait here for a while?

867
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:20,750
I'm going too!

868
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,333
If…

869
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,125
Gilbert really is…

870
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:27,916
here now…

871
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,208
We don't know his current situation.

872
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,083
-So--
-I don't care!

873
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,083
You may not care.

874
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,208
I don't know about him.

875
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:49,083
I heard he's not using his real name here.

876
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,708
It's a small island.

877
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,833
He likely doesn't want to spread rumors.

878
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:00,583
Can you wait here?

879
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:04,291
I'll wait.

880
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,916
If I can see him again,

881
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:10,291
I'll wait as long as it takes.

882
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:20,666
It's your first time here.
Why don't you take a look around?

883
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,750
Understood.

884
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,208
I don't know who he is.

885
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,916
Hello!

886
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,708
Hello.

887
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,375
-Whose father are you?
-I'm not…

888
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,166
-Then who are you?
-You look creepy.

889
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,375
No. I'm from the postal company.

890
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:58,125
Oh! Then are you here to deliver a letter?

891
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,125
Yes.

892
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:03,625
Look! I've got something for you!

893
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,583
He's scared!

894
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,166
Let's go back!

895
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:16,875
I don't think I can handle a boy either.

896
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,583
Are you someone's sister?

897
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,500
-I'm--
-Are you a post-person?

898
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:34,875
Yes. That's right.

899
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,083
I knew it!

900
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:38,166
This is for you!

901
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,083
Here!

902
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:42,250
An insect.

903
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:44,416
A praying mantis.

904
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,583
Aren't you scared?

905
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,833
It's missing…

906
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,416
one of its front legs.

907
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:54,416
Just like Teacher Gilbert.

908
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,791
Is he also missing…

909
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:02,333
his right eye?

910
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,208
You know a lot!

911
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:06,791
He's your teacher?

912
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,500
He's your teacher, right?

913
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:11,458
That's right.

914
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:17,541
Is your teacher…

915
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,208
doing well?

916
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,708
Yeah! He has no right hand
but plays the bars with his left.

917
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:31,583
-And he can run really fast!
-Yeah! He's really fast!

918
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:32,625
Right?

919
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:42,458
Can you…

920
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,416
please tell me more about him?

921
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,750
About your teacher?

922
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:48,666
Okay!

923
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:52,708
Our teacher… he's really nice!

924
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:56,125
He explains things over and over
if you don't understand!

925
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,458
Who is it?

926
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:54,875
Come in.

927
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,250
If there's something you don't understand…

928
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,500
I never thought that…

929
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,625
You survived.

930
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:22,875
Gilbert.

931
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,166
I go by the name "Jilbert" here.

932
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,166
I see.

933
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,458
Sorry for visiting you so suddenly.

934
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:38,750
How did you find me?

935
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,208
You wrote a letter for a kid, right?

936
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:48,708
All the undeliverable letters
get returned to the post office.

937
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:53,916
We check them a final time
before returning them to the sender.

938
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,916
I came across your letter by chance.

939
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:01,750
Why…

940
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
are you here?

941
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,291
<i>After the battle…</i>

942
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:17,000
<i>I awoke lying in a hospital bed.</i>

943
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:23,041
<i>I didn't have my ID tags, so they sent me</i>
<i>to a hospital run by a monastery.</i>

944
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:31,291
<i>I worked at the hospital for a while.</i>

945
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:45,708
<i>Then instead of returning home,</i>
<i>I roamed around for a time.</i>

946
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,583
<i>I came here…</i>

947
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:51,500
<i>a year ago.</i>

948
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:59,291
I wrote letters at the children's request,
and started teaching<i> </i>at this school.

949
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:03,375
I know my duty was to notify the military.

950
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,833
That doesn't matter.

951
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,291
Did you know that Violet is alive?

952
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:14,708
Yeah.

953
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:18,916
Then why didn't you come see her!

954
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,291
Violet!

955
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:25,791
She's been waiting this whole time!

956
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:28,500
I made her unhappy!

957
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:31,958
She's…

958
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:35,375
better off without me.

959
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:40,708
She's here…

960
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,583
as well.

961
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:48,083
She's waiting outside right now.

962
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:53,208
Do you have any idea how much
she wanted to see you?

963
01:21:58,916 --> 01:21:59,916
I can't see her.

964
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,666
Gilbert.

965
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:03,250
I can't see her.

966
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,416
Never again.

967
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,083
My friend…

968
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:10,250
He's dead.

969
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:14,208
Gilbert Bougainvillea is dead.

970
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,958
That's what everyone thought.

971
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:21,416
And as the years went by,
everyone accepted it.

972
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,708
Therefore… let me live a different life.

973
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,208
-Gilbert--
-We're…

974
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,791
in the middle
of the grape harvest season.

975
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:34,791
I'm going to help them.

976
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
All the men on this island left for war.

977
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,416
And none of them returned.

978
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,041
Hodgins.

979
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:46,500
Please.

980
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,291
Leave.

981
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,833
I'll return.

982
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,166
I'll come back.

983
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:23,916
Do you…

984
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,666
Do you hate me?

985
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,708
I don't understand your question.

986
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,500
Have I failed you in some way?

987
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:40,583
If there's something I'm doing wrong,
I'll fix it! Please tell me!

988
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:43,125
No.

989
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,166
That's not true.

990
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:49,208
It's my fault. I said you're not a tool.

991
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,125
But I still…

992
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:54,416
I still… used you.

993
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:58,375
Of course you can use me! I'm your weapon!

994
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,041
The battle is turning against us!

995
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,500
What should I do next?

996
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,583
Major! Give me your orders!

997
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:26,750
President!

998
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,000
It's him!

999
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,958
It's really him!

1000
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,458
I talked to the children.

1001
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:51,791
Did you not see him?

1002
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:53,666
I did.

1003
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:59,541
Was he hurt anywhere
besides his arm and eye?

1004
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,958
No.

1005
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:02,875
Then…

1006
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:05,333
I can see him, right!

1007
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,583
He said…

1008
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:12,583
he can't see you.

1009
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:21,000
Is he still working?

1010
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,625
I'll wait until he's finished.

1011
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,916
That's not it.

1012
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:29,708
-Then I'll wait until nighttime.
-Violet!

1013
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:32,916
Then…

1014
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:34,833
then tomorrow.

1015
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:39,375
Right.

1016
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,875
I'll go see him tomorrow
and try to talk to him.

1017
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:46,583
He must…

1018
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,083
he has to see you.

1019
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,291
Does…

1020
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,791
that mean…

1021
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,541
not that he can't see me?

1022
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,583
But that he doesn't…

1023
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,333
want to see me?

1024
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,000
Why not?

1025
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:11,208
I can't really explain it.

1026
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:15,000
He said it's better that way for you both.

1027
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,250
It can't be.

1028
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,583
I…

1029
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:21,166
I…

1030
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:23,666
Violet.

1031
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:26,958
Violet!

1032
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:46,500
Once you're done, it'll be easy
to move the grapes to the top.

1033
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:51,083
You've been a big help.

1034
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:03,583
It looks like we'll have heavy rain.

1035
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:05,250
Major!

1036
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:13,000
Major!

1037
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:30,958
I found him.

1038
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:00,958
Major.

1039
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,000
Major.

1040
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:10,375
Major!

1041
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,000
Major!

1042
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,666
Major!

1043
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,541
I'm sorry I came…

1044
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,791
to your house.

1045
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:39,875
Major.

1046
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:42,541
If you've been alive…

1047
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:44,916
why haven't you contacted me<i>?</i>

1048
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,250
Why didn't you come to see me?

1049
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:52,708
I want to…

1050
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,833
Major, I want to see you.

1051
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,541
I want to continue talking
where we left off.

1052
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,791
I've begun to understand…

1053
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,708
the meaning of "I love you."

1054
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,583
Go away.

1055
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:16,625
Go away!

1056
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,833
I'll wait.

1057
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,125
I'll wait here…

1058
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:37,750
until I can see you.

1059
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,041
You don't…

1060
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,166
need me now.

1061
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,541
And…

1062
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:48,375
if I'm with you…

1063
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,291
I will remember…

1064
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,375
taking you to the battlefield
when you were so young…

1065
01:29:57,041 --> 01:29:57,875
how you…

1066
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,708
lost both of your arms…

1067
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,250
because of my orders.

1068
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:19,958
Major.

1069
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,833
Do you regret…

1070
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,166
that I exist?

1071
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,125
It must be…

1072
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:31,666
that I am…

1073
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:35,541
causing you pain.

1074
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:40,791
I can understand…

1075
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,208
how you must feel now, Major.

1076
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:47,791
I don't understand everything.

1077
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:50,875
But I understand…

1078
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:52,750
a little.

1079
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:22,458
You idiot!

1080
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:43,750
You can have these.

1081
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,375
We are grateful.

1082
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,458
There was nowhere else for us to stay.

1083
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,708
It's a small island.
We don't even have an inn.

1084
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:59,708
Violet said this lighthouse
functions as a post office as well.

1085
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,125
<i>I see…</i>

1086
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:13,291
<i>how the season has come again</i>
<i>with the bloom of this flower.</i>

1087
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:26,333
"The prince's eyes
were like blue sapphires.

1088
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:30,208
The sword at his side was decorated
with sparkling red rubies."

1089
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:38,458
You've gotten pretty good at reading.

1090
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:40,875
Violet.

1091
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,625
Stay by my side.

1092
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,458
Stay by my side at all times, Violet.

1093
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:57,916
Okay.

1094
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,541
Are you from the Leiden postal company?

1095
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,041
Yes.

1096
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:23,750
Is Violet Evergarden the girl

1097
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:25,750
who was with you just now?

1098
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:32,583
Your postal company
got a call from the hospital.

1099
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:37,375
There's a boy named Yuris
who is in critical condition.

1100
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:39,250
Yuris?

1101
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,791
-Who's that?
-He's one of my…

1102
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:45,375
customers.

1103
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:55,000
Give them the letters
on the day I go to heaven.

1104
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,083
Yes.

1105
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:19,333
I'm going back.

1106
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,000
I'm going back to Leiden.

1107
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:24,500
Violet!

1108
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:28,125
You can't go back
in the middle of a storm!

1109
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:32,250
The boats can only leave
tomorrow morning at the earliest.

1110
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:35,791
You'll see Gilbert.

1111
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:39,041
Right?

1112
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:46,125
I want to see him.

1113
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:50,333
I want to see him!

1114
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:52,791
But!

1115
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,041
I made a pinky promise!

1116
01:35:58,458 --> 01:35:59,416
Yuris.

1117
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,625
I promised him.

1118
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,666
And there's still one letter
I haven't written yet.

1119
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:18,000
But it's going to take you
at least three days to get back.

1120
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:38,958
-Can't you go faster!
-I'm going as fast as I can!

1121
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:54,083
Benedict and Iris left for the hospital
to deliver the letters you were keeping.

1122
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:56,291
Good.

1123
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:13,291
Excuse me.

1124
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:26,958
Yuris.

1125
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:29,750
The doll is here.

1126
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,666
You want her to write a letter, right?

1127
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:41,458
Vio… let?

1128
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:44,791
I'm Iris. I came instead.

1129
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:48,166
Violet is somewhere far away right now.

1130
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:52,041
She is reuniting
with the one who's dear to her.

1131
01:37:54,541 --> 01:37:55,541
Is it the person…

1132
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:58,333
who taught her "I love you"?

1133
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,083
That's right.

1134
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:05,250
He's still alive.

1135
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:09,333
Good.

1136
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:16,000
I've heard about you.

1137
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,791
You want to write Lucas a letter, right?

1138
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,000
Yeah.

1139
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:25,166
What do you want me to write?

1140
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:31,833
Yuris!

1141
01:38:31,916 --> 01:38:32,750
Yuris!

1142
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:57,041
Yuris.

1143
01:38:58,708 --> 01:38:59,916
You'll be okay.

1144
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,375
Yes! Please connect me!

1145
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,375
Please!

1146
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:02,583
Yuris.

1147
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:04,000
It's Lucas.

1148
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:13,041
What am I supposed to do

1149
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,166
<i>with this?</i>

1150
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,250
You say, "Hello."

1151
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:23,500
<i>Yuris!</i>

1152
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,083
Yeah.

1153
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:26,625
<i>Hello.</i>

1154
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,083
Lucas.

1155
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:30,750
Yeah!

1156
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:35,916
<i>Lucas, I'm sorry I told you not to come.</i>

1157
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,083
And that I didn't want to see you.

1158
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:49,625
Sorry.

1159
01:40:51,291 --> 01:40:52,500
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1160
01:40:57,208 --> 01:40:58,958
Why are you apologizing!

1161
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:01,666
I…

1162
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:05,833
<i>I was sad when I heard</i>
<i>you didn't want to see me.</i>

1163
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,958
<i>But I thought it was what you wanted.</i>

1164
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:11,125
<i>So I tried hard.</i>

1165
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:14,083
But…

1166
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:16,500
I couldn't help myself.

1167
01:41:17,333 --> 01:41:19,583
And I went to the hospital many times.

1168
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:27,458
And I saw your face
in the window a little.

1169
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:32,458
Sorry…

1170
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:34,583
for saying something…

1171
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:36,666
so mean.

1172
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:38,041
<i>No.</i>

1173
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,583
I'm not…

1174
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:42,166
mad at you at all.

1175
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,833
Yuris.

1176
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,791
We've always been friends, right?

1177
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,375
Let's continue being friends forever.

1178
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:01,541
Good.

1179
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:04,625
Thank you.

1180
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:34,750
That horrible device
comes in handy sometimes.

1181
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:41,750
Yuris!

1182
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,125
Yuris!

1183
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:47,375
Yuris!

1184
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:22,541
She wasn't… able to write the letter.

1185
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,500
But he was able to speak…

1186
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:33,916
with Lucas on the telephone one last time.

1187
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:35,750
And tell him…

1188
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,416
what he wanted to say.

1189
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:40,583
"I'm sorry."

1190
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:42,791
"Thank you."

1191
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:51,208
And they delivered the letters you wrote…

1192
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,500
for his parents and brother.

1193
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:13,708
"Mom,

1194
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,333
Your…

1195
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,666
pancakes were so delicious.

1196
01:44:20,291 --> 01:44:23,375
If I had eaten more vegetables,

1197
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:27,208
I could have… made you happier."

1198
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:32,166
"Dad,

1199
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,500
It was fun going fishing and camping.

1200
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,583
Mom… Dad,

1201
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:40,625
I'm so glad…

1202
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,416
I was born as your son.

1203
01:44:47,166 --> 01:44:48,291
I love you.

1204
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:51,541
Yuris."

1205
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:07,791
There's also a letter
for his little brother<i>.</i>

1206
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:10,000
Me?

1207
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:14,500
"Sion.

1208
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:18,833
Sorry for the times
I got mad at you or was mean to you.

1209
01:45:19,708 --> 01:45:22,500
But… I was really happy

1210
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:24,791
when you were born."

1211
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:31,500
"Thanks for letting me
become an older brother.

1212
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:34,875
Live a full life in my place.

1213
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,416
And take care…

1214
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
of Mom and Dad in my place.

1215
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:44,458
Have fun with them.

1216
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,791
And have them spoil you…

1217
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:50,750
my dear brother.

1218
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:56,208
From your older brother."

1219
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:07,000
Thank you, brother!

1220
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:08,833
I'm so happy!

1221
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,750
Mom and Dad are you happy too?

1222
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:14,250
Yeah.

1223
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,083
Yes.

1224
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:23,583
Thank you.

1225
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:26,416
Yuris.

1226
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:36,625
They said Yuris was glad
you were able to meet the person…

1227
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:39,083
who is dear to you.

1228
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:51,875
Let's visit him again in the morning.

1229
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:56,125
If he doesn't come out,
I'll kick down his door

1230
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:58,208
and give him a good thrashing!

1231
01:46:58,291 --> 01:46:59,125
No.

1232
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,541
If he's to be struck…

1233
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,625
then I'll do it.

1234
01:47:08,666 --> 01:47:10,000
-What?
-I'm kidding.

1235
01:47:12,166 --> 01:47:14,666
I'm going back to the postal company…

1236
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:17,583
on the next boat.

1237
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:22,250
I'll return to writing letters.

1238
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:25,291
There is much work I have left.

1239
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:29,958
Violet.

1240
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,750
The major is alive and safe.

1241
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,250
I thought I'd never see him again.

1242
01:47:40,916 --> 01:47:43,208
But I was… able to hear his voice.

1243
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:49,375
I'm…

1244
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:52,666
That's…

1245
01:47:59,916 --> 01:48:01,375
enough for me.

1246
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:08,708
All right, give it a try.

1247
01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:35,500
There it is! It's coming up!

1248
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:37,791
That's amazing.

1249
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:40,875
This will make things a lot easier.

1250
01:49:42,125 --> 01:49:45,250
It's the old man and the girl
from the postal company!

1251
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:46,625
Old man?

1252
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:51,000
Hey! Our teacher made that machine!

1253
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:54,541
Isn't it great?

1254
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,541
-Look, there's a lot!
-Can it hold more?

1255
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:01,791
It's great!

1256
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:04,041
Awesome! I wanna try it.

1257
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,333
Right?

1258
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:08,125
It's amazing, right?

1259
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:13,916
Yes.

1260
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:29,041
Will you…

1261
01:50:29,875 --> 01:50:31,833
please give this to your teacher?

1262
01:50:36,291 --> 01:50:38,541
Okay! I'll make sure I give it to him!

1263
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:40,791
Bye!

1264
01:51:10,125 --> 01:51:12,625
It's not your burden to bear alone.

1265
01:51:14,333 --> 01:51:18,291
All the young men from our island left.

1266
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:22,333
And lots of people died in the war.

1267
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:25,666
We're probably all to blame.

1268
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,916
We all thought our lives would be better…

1269
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,125
once we won the war.

1270
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:38,250
We all hated the people
from Leidenschaftlich.

1271
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:40,958
But…

1272
01:51:42,416 --> 01:51:44,958
we all suffered in the end.

1273
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:49,375
All of us.

1274
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,750
If you have a home somewhere else

1275
01:51:56,833 --> 01:51:58,541
you should go back.

1276
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:02,208
No.

1277
01:52:03,208 --> 01:52:04,208
I'm staying here.

1278
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:06,958
Staying forever.

1279
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:12,833
Having you here is a big help to us all.

1280
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:32,791
Hey!

1281
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:44,583
Have you finally been able to choose
your own path on this island?

1282
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:50,500
It sure looks like a nice place.

1283
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,041
Brother.

1284
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:59,875
You've been living a carefree life.

1285
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:04,166
And you didn't even come
to our mother's funeral.

1286
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:09,541
They were fond of you, unlike me.

1287
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:11,958
Sorry.

1288
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:19,958
Meanwhile, Violet has been visiting
our mother's grave in your place.

1289
01:53:20,666 --> 01:53:23,375
She still visits every month even now.

1290
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:27,416
I was…

1291
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:29,791
planning on apologizing to you…

1292
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:32,666
if I ever saw you again.

1293
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:35,958
But right now…

1294
01:53:37,375 --> 01:53:39,250
I ought to stuff you in a sack…

1295
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:42,750
and drag you off to see Violet!

1296
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:49,583
I shouldn't have…

1297
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:52,916
taken her in back then.

1298
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:57,791
Then what did you really want to do?

1299
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:02,125
I wanted her to have…

1300
01:54:03,958 --> 01:54:06,416
fun while she was young…

1301
01:54:09,333 --> 01:54:10,708
to be able to enjoy…

1302
01:54:11,666 --> 01:54:12,833
pleasant things…

1303
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:18,958
to allow her heart…

1304
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:21,833
to be inspired…

1305
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:23,750
by beauty.

1306
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,833
I wanted…

1307
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,958
to provide her with that.

1308
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,083
But I…

1309
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:02,708
It's for you.

1310
01:55:03,958 --> 01:55:04,791
Read it.

1311
01:55:27,125 --> 01:55:29,458
<i>Dearest Major Gilbert,</i>

1312
01:55:30,583 --> 01:55:33,458
<i>Please forgive me</i>
<i>for visiting you so suddenly.</i>

1313
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:36,583
<i>This is…</i>

1314
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:38,458
<i>my last letter…</i>

1315
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:40,416
<i>to you.</i>

1316
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:44,166
<i>The reason…</i>

1317
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:46,458
<i>I'm alive today…</i>

1318
01:55:47,291 --> 01:55:49,208
<i>and learned how to love others</i>…

1319
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:51,833
<i>is all thanks to you.</i>

1320
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:55,875
<i>For…</i>

1321
01:55:56,708 --> 01:55:58,083
<i>accepting me…</i>

1322
01:55:58,833 --> 01:56:00,250
<i>I thank you.</i>

1323
01:56:02,333 --> 01:56:04,000
<i>Thank you for reading to me.</i>

1324
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:09,166
<i>For teaching me how to read,</i>
<i>and showing me many things…</i>

1325
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:11,875
<i>I thank you.</i>

1326
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:20,375
<i>For the brooch you gave me…</i>

1327
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:23,958
<i>I thank you.</i>

1328
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:27,916
<i>For always…</i>

1329
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,916
<i>always keeping me by your side…</i>

1330
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,291
<i>I thank you.</i>

1331
01:56:42,083 --> 01:56:43,166
With all my heart…

1332
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:51,958
<i>For giving me "I love you"…</i>

1333
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:55,000
<i>I thank you.</i>

1334
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,458
<i>Hearing you tell me "I love you"…</i>

1335
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,000
<i>has been like a guiding light in my life.</i>

1336
01:57:09,791 --> 01:57:13,000
<i>Since I've learned</i>
<i>what "I love you" means…</i>

1337
01:57:14,666 --> 01:57:16,916
<i>I wanted to tell you that I love you.</i>

1338
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:28,208
<i>Major.</i>

1339
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:31,916
<i>I thank you.</i>

1340
01:57:35,375 --> 01:57:36,208
<i>Thank you.</i>

1341
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:41,583
<i>I thank you for everything.</i>

1342
01:58:14,291 --> 01:58:15,250
We all struggle…

1343
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:18,750
with being true to ourselves.

1344
01:58:33,083 --> 01:58:35,583
I will carry
the Bougainvillea family name.

1345
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:38,708
You may be free.

1346
01:58:46,666 --> 01:58:47,500
Go.

1347
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:09,166
Violet!

1348
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,916
Violet!

1349
02:00:25,958 --> 02:00:27,375
Major?

1350
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:33,958
Gilbert.

1351
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,333
Major!

1352
02:00:59,166 --> 02:01:00,000
Violet!

1353
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:00,416
Major.

1354
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,833
Violet.

1355
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:11,166
I'm not your master
or your superior officer anymore.

1356
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:16,375
I hurt you.

1357
02:02:17,791 --> 02:02:18,625
I'm not…

1358
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:21,708
the man you think I am.

1359
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:26,250
I'm not a good master…

1360
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:28,708
or a good person.

1361
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:33,875
I don't…

1362
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:37,083
deserve you.

1363
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:46,083
But even now…

1364
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:55,666
Still…

1365
02:02:56,666 --> 02:02:57,500
Still I…

1366
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:01,791
I love you.

1367
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:08,041
I…

1368
02:03:13,291 --> 02:03:14,916
I want you to stay with me.

1369
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:17,083
Violet.

1370
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,375
I…

1371
02:03:28,083 --> 02:03:28,916
Major.

1372
02:03:35,125 --> 02:03:35,958
Major.

1373
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:39,166
I…

1374
02:03:46,458 --> 02:03:47,583
Violet.

1375
02:03:48,875 --> 02:03:49,708
Don't cry.

1376
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:52,958
You see?

1377
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,333
I'm…

1378
02:03:55,333 --> 02:03:56,750
I'm about to cry too.

1379
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:02,416
I want to wipe away your tears.

1380
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:05,916
Please.

1381
02:04:06,625 --> 02:04:07,791
Lift your face.

1382
02:04:13,875 --> 02:04:14,916
I…

1383
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:19,583
Major…

1384
02:04:26,875 --> 02:04:27,750
Major…

1385
02:04:57,166 --> 02:04:58,000
I love you…

1386
02:04:59,333 --> 02:05:00,166
Violet.

1387
02:05:03,291 --> 02:05:05,125
I've always wanted to do this.

1388
02:08:46,541 --> 02:08:49,791
<i>After wrapping up her remaining work…</i>

1389
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,833
<i>she quit her job at the postal company…</i>

1390
02:08:55,958 --> 02:08:59,750
<i>and took over the postal service</i>
<i>at the lighthouse on the island.</i>

1391
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:07,750
<i>Afterwards, the post office moved</i>
<i>to the main street.</i>

1392
02:09:24,625 --> 02:09:29,125
<i>Once telephones became common,</i>
<i>the dolls ceased their work.</i>

1393
02:09:32,125 --> 02:09:34,458
<i>But I'm sure she wrote many letters…</i>

1394
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:40,083
<i>for the people who lived on the island.</i>

1395
02:09:45,916 --> 02:09:46,958
<i>Meanwhile…</i>

1396
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:54,916
This stamp was issued by the CH
Postal Company Memorial Foundation,

1397
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,166
and is only sold on this island.

1398
02:10:00,125 --> 02:10:02,583
The island holds the record

1399
02:10:02,666 --> 02:10:05,833
for the most letters
sent each year per person.

1400
02:10:07,458 --> 02:10:11,041
A long time ago, it used to be a job
done by women called dolls.

1401
02:10:12,041 --> 02:10:17,291
There was a popular doll who lived
on this island and who everyone loved.

1402
02:10:25,958 --> 02:10:27,375
Her name was…

1403
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,708
Violet Evergarden.

1404
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,666
She had also written letters
which my grandmother received.

1405
02:10:56,166 --> 02:10:58,125
<i>If there's something I can't say…</i>

1406
02:10:59,125 --> 02:11:01,250
<i>maybe I could tell them in a letter.</i>

1407
02:11:04,291 --> 02:11:06,875
<i>I want to tell them my true feelings.</i>

1408
02:11:09,541 --> 02:11:11,583
<i>The people I want to tell my feelings…</i>

1409
02:11:14,125 --> 02:11:17,250
<i>are... only here in this moment.</i>

1410
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:34,583
Dad.

1411
02:11:37,291 --> 02:11:38,125
<i>Mom.</i>

1412
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:44,291
<i>Thank you.</i>

1413
02:11:48,833 --> 02:11:58,541
I LOVE YOU
