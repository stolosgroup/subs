00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,380
Being a dad is one of the great privileges of my life.

3
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,320
Give my son a BB gun, and that's just about all the emotional support he needs.

4
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:52,890
My daughter, on the other hand, I've heard people say that there are no differences between male and female.

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,530
Those people are idiots.

6
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,418
I'm a husband.

7
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:58,962
I'm a father of four.

8
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:00,606
I host a talk show.

9
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,330
I give speeches, I write books.

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,780
I like to make sense of things.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,594
But making sense of females is a whole other matter.

12
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:12,884
Even astrophysicist Stephen
Hawking, who could come up with

13
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:16,040
a theory on black holes, was
completely dumbfounded by women.

14
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,594
Women, they are a complete mystery.

15
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:23,403
And now our culture is telling us that
the differences between girls and boys

16
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:27,020
don't matter, that if you identify as
something, then you are that thing.

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,794
How do we help our kids make sense
of this when they're bombarded with

18
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:36,500
conflicting messages about gender and
identity? Forget trying to figure out women.

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,596
The real question is, what is
a woman? As you grow, your

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,146
body changes from that of a
young girl to that of a woman.

21
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:51,252
Soon Molly will be a
young woman having dates,

22
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:54,190
going to dances, and
lovely romantic dresses.

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,868
The boy's shoulders
are broad and his body

24
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:59,354
muscular, while the
girl's body is more curved.

25
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,210
I'd like to know more about different kinds of hormones.

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,130
The presence of these
hormones in the blood brings

27
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,470
about many changes in the
bodies of both boys and girls.

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,160
Being a woman is one of the things I like best about myself.

29
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,380
I think you'll like it, too.

30
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,000
I like to come out here to think.

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,020
Nature seems to always tell the truth, even when we don't want to hear it.

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,123
Truth is, I'm not very
good at fishing, but what is

33
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:55,300
truth? Is there a truth?

34
00:02:55,324 --> 00:03:00,528
Is this what progress looks like? Can my boys really
become girls? Do I have four

35
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:05,655
daughters? Do I now have
to pay for four weddings?

36
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:10,556
Is there a son trapped
in my daughter's body? If

37
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,458
so, how do I get them
out? Are any of my kids who

38
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:20,612
they claim to be? Who are
these people? Who am I?

39
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:25,766
I better see a therapist
in the state of Tennessee.

40
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,046
I'm a licensed marital
and family therapist, which

41
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,198
basically means I've
been trained up to think

42
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:32,254
about, like, systems,
family systems, how we

43
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,642
were raised up, how that
shapes who we are today.

44
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,911
So on your website,
if you'll bear with me

45
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,542
quoting you say I use a
combination of approaches

46
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:44,174
in my therapeutic work, including anti
oppression, feminist, and narrative frameworks.

47
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,390
I rely deeply on systems
theory and understanding

48
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,854
that individuals are products
of and in dialogue with

49
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,067
our surroundings, including
our families, broader

50
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,510
culture, workplaces,
nature, and political climates.

51
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,180
What does that mean? Yeah.

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,358
So thinking about the
modalities that I use, I'm

53
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:04,990
definitely informed by
feminist family therapy.

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,384
And the idea is that we've lived in gendered
worlds where there are certain imperatives

55
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,482
that are placed on us about who we are and
what we do based on how we've been gendered.

56
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,248
From the minute I was
assigned female, I was told, okay,

57
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:20,954
these are the kind of clothing
that you're going to wear.

58
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:25,130
These are the type of play that
you're going to engage in as a child,

59
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:29,282
the path that maybe your life will
take because of social expectations.

60
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:35,686
What do you mean by assigned female? Who assigns female? Yeah.

61
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:39,071
So most times people,
when they're born, they're

62
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,134
assigned to gender
by the doctor doctors.

63
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:42,780
Yeah.

64
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,410
What are they based that assignment on? So basically it's based on genitalia.

65
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,700
So people are looking at genitalia and deciding, okay, this is a girl or a boy.

66
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,114
And we know now that sex and gender are so much more than just this binary.

67
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:05,410
Some women have penises, right? Some men have vaginas.

68
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,700
That's not how gender work.

69
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,478
How do we know that
that's not true? Where did we

70
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,770
learn that? Yeah, well, I
learned that from hearing

71
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:19,022
from transgender people
who said, like, oh, I'm a

72
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:22,814
trans woman, and just because
I happen to have a penis.

73
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:23,038
Right.

74
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:27,005
That doesn't mean that
this is like who I am as

75
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,970
a person or that genitalia
doesn't equal gender.

76
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,390
Who they are, their gender, their gender expression.

77
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,370
Yeah.

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,840
Trans woman is a woman with the fluidity of these things.

79
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,890
How do I know if I'm a woman? That's a great question.

80
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,562
I like scented candles.

81
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,240
I've watched Sex in the City.

82
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,660
So how do I know? Yeah,
Matt, that question right

83
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:58,082
there, that question is
when it's asked with a

84
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:01,540
lot of curiosity, that's
the beginning of a lot

85
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:04,998
of people's gender identity
development journeys.

86
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:10,085
If my mom who gave birth
to me is a woman and my wife

87
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:15,040
is a woman, so I haven't
asked her, maybe I should.

88
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,042
But if they're all women and also the
boy who sits down with you and says,

89
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:29,478
I think I'm a girl actually is one,
then what is a woman? Great question.

90
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:32,840
I'm not a woman, so I can't really answer that.

91
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,750
I thought therapy would make me less confused.

92
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,294
we're talking about gender in society.

93
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,270
Let me start with a real basic question.

94
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,730
I don't want to assume, but you guys are all women.

95
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah.

96
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,246
How would you define it? Like in the simplest terms, that is hard.

97
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:18,726
Yeah.

98
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,326
It is a stumper.

99
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,812
A woman is someone
that likes to be pretty and

100
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:27,190
think of themselves
as a delicate creature.

101
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,710
I'm pretty indelicate.

102
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,618
I could be a woman, too.

103
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:31,518
Yes, you could.

104
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:37,066
Defining womanhood is just a product of someone who identifies as a woman.

105
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:41,842
Yeah, but I'm saying, what do they identify as they identify as a woman.

106
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:48,440
But what is that as they do now? It's a simple question.

107
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,100
for all of human existence, women were understood to be a certain thing.

108
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,400
So what changed? No one can seem to answer the question now.

109
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,410
Over 2000 surgeries and counting, Dr.

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,710
Marcy Bowers is the nation's preeminent sex change surgeon.

111
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,862
talking to.

112
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:39,526
Marcy Bowers, first of all, thanks for talking to us.

113
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,322
My pleasure.

114
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:43,178
So you're a world renowned gynecologist and surgeon.

115
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,950
You're also a transgender woman.

116
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,210
Can you tell me a little bit about that? I identify as a woman.

117
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,870
But you're a woman, right? I'm a woman.

118
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,860
That's my life day to day.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,020
But I have a transgender history.

120
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,474
So one thing on your website, it says gender affirm Gav.

121
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,990
Gender affirming vaginal plasty.

122
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:12,978
What is that exactly? Vaginaplasty is the creation of a female vagina.

123
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,962
And Balva.

124
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:18,935
We're altering the physical
characteristics of the individual

125
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,358
to fit better with a gender
identity that is female.

126
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:25,842
This is all constructed from the penis.

127
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,086
Yes, that's right.

128
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,917
The surgeries are quite refined in the
sense that they really not only do they

129
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:36,650
look like female anatomy, but they
also function that way for the most part.

130
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,294
I mean, certainly it's a bit of a Faustian bargain.

131
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,406
It's not perfect.

132
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:45,338
Does anyone ever regret their surgeries? We know they do.

133
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:47,547
But how often do people
regret their surgeries?

134
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,706
Well, actually, we
don't know that they do.

135
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:54,455
There are legitimate detransitioners,
and there are people who

136
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:59,166
truly feel that in their journey
they may have made a mistake.

137
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:04,398
Now, fortunately, this is a really uncommon phenomenon.

138
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:08,342
I don't know if you've ever heard of people in the trans abled community.

139
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,910
These are people who are
physically able bodied but

140
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,782
feel like they should be
disabled or identify as such.

141
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,900
For example, a man who has two arms but feels like you should have one.

142
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,390
If a man in this kind of
marginalized community went to

143
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:28,573
the doctor and said, I want
to have my arm cut off, do

144
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:32,751
you think that doesn't have
anything to do with gender

145
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:37,400
identity? Someone's self
identity? That's someone who has.

146
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,398
And I'll accept it as a mental diagnosis, a psychiatric condition.

147
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:49,340
I don't even pretend to know what abdomen
affiliate is all about, but somehow it's

148
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:54,630
the idea that you're fascinated or charmed
by having a limb or part of a limb missing.

149
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:02,250
Okay, I would say that's, pardon my non medical language, Kooky.

150
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,280
You don't see any.

151
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,120
Do you think this is totally irrelevant? Yes.

152
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,946
So the biggest broadest
question is, what is a woman? A

153
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,678
woman is a combination of
your physical attributes and then

154
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:25,124
what you're showing to the
world and the gender clues that

155
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:30,570
you give, and hopefully those
match your gender identity.

156
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,460
The critics on the other side of this issue, there aren't many.

157
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,946
But go ahead.

158
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:42,630
There aren't many who would
disagree with what you're saying

159
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:46,640
about, well, the dinosaurs of
the world are certainly out there.

160
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,682
How long have you been running the shop here? 25 years.

161
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:58,366
Wow.

162
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:02,220
Now you had an incident here a little while ago that went really viral online.

163
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,390
Lots of reaction in the public.

164
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Aberdeen Councilwoman
ties confronted owner Don

165
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:12,058
Sucker about a sign he
posted in his store one day.

166
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:15,377
I just put the sign up over
here and he came around

167
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,694
the corner and I thought,
okay, I recognize him.

168
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,830
I said, oh, I recognize you.

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,610
You're our new city Councilman.

170
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,766
He says, no, I'm your new city Council woman.

171
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,630
So it was kind of on from there.

172
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,790
You know what? It's bullshit.

173
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,146
Your spouting is bullshit.

174
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,102
No, it's not.

175
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,146
Women are women.

176
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,406
Sir, that sign is bullshit.

177
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,600
I've been doing this 25 years.

178
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,310
I've never had a problem with anybody.

179
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,818
Whether they're gay, trans, sex, anything.

180
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:49,338
Now you're saying, Councilman
he, this individual is saying,

181
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:53,438
I'm a woman, right? And
you said, you're not a woman.

182
00:12:53,594 --> 00:13:01,660
How do you know that person is not a woman? How do I know? Well, common sense.

183
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,130
Doesn't the science say
that if someone identifies as

184
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:15,114
a woman, then they are?
No, that's completely bogus.

185
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:21,160
I don't care if you think you're a sheep dog and you come into my store.

186
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,694
It don't matter to me.

187
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:26,178
Just don't come in and try to shove that shit down my throat.

188
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,614
If it makes someone feel better.

189
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:30,594
What about their feelings? I don't give a shit about their feelings.

190
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,418
I'm old.

191
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:39,023
What about a Star Wars universe
Jar Jar Binks pansexual? Do you think

192
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:46,506
transgender? Why would I even care
if it's his truth? Well, it ain't true.

193
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:47,554
You're not a scientist.

194
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:48,810
You're not a gender studies major.

195
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,214
Or are you? No.

196
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:50,754
Okay.

197
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:55,830
How do you know that you're a man? How do I know that? I guess because I got a Dick.

198
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,480
Well, I guess Don isn't overthinking it.

199
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,430
He admits he's not a gender studies major or at the very least, a doctor.

200
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,120
Maybe I should go talk to one.

201
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:26,314
My name is Michelle Forcier, and I have a medical degree from University of Connecticut.

202
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:29,374
Residency, University of Utah Pediatrics.

203
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:33,342
And I've worked for a number of different plant Parenthoods for 20 years.

204
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:38,193
I do advanced contraception and abortion,
as well as gender hormones and sort

205
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:42,934
of looking at the whole sort of schema
of gender, sex and reproductive justice.

206
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,274
So you've done a lot of work in this field.

207
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,460
Could you just start by telling us? Sure.

208
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,808
At what age can a child first
begin to transition into another

209
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:56,670
gender or identify themselves
as a gender different from how

210
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:01,290
they were born? Yeah, well,
there's research and data that

211
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:06,394
show that babies and infants
understand differences in gender.

212
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:11,120
Some children figure out their gender really early.

213
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,077
And the reason why we
say, oh, that's interesting

214
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:16,344
or important is
because they're figuring

215
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,803
out their gender
identity is not necessarily

216
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:21,262
congruent with their
sexist signed at birth.

217
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:25,242
When the doctor sees
the penis and says, this is a

218
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:29,730
male as a sex of male,
that's an arbitrary distinction.

219
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,351
Telling that family based on
that little penis that your child is

220
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:41,600
absolutely 100% male identified, no
matter what else occurs in their life.

221
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,446
That's not correct.

222
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:48,051
So what is gender affirmation care
you're a big proponent of if we walk

223
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:52,498
through a child is sitting down
with you is questioning their gender.

224
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:55,825
What's the gender
affirmation process? Affirmation

225
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,816
means that as a
pediatrician, as someone who

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,939
says my job is to provide
the best medical care

227
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:05,062
for you is I need to
listen really carefully.

228
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,614
And how I put it in
words for kids so that

229
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:10,400
they can understand
it is tell me your story.

230
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,088
Where have you been in
terms of your gender and

231
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:17,350
your gender identity?
Where are you right now?

232
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:20,433
And more excitingly,
where would you like to

233
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,873
be in the future? Have
you ever met a four year

234
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:27,135
old who believes in Santa
Claus? This is someone

235
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,397
who believes that fat
man is traveling through

236
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,800
the sky and a flying
reindeer at lightning speed,

237
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,920
coming down his chimney
with presence? Yes.

238
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,450
Would you say that this is someone
who maybe has a tenuous grasp on

239
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:43,966
reality? They have an appropriate
four year old handle on the reality.

240
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:45,558
That's very real for them.

241
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,366
Agreed.

242
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:48,018
But Santa Claus is real for them.

243
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,830
But Santa Claus is not actually real.

244
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,370
Yeah, but Santa Claus does deliver their Christmas presents.

245
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,620
Yeah, but he's not real, though, to that child they are.

246
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,078
When I see a child who believes in Santa
Claus and then let's say this is a boy and he

247
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:08,110
says, I'm a girl, this is someone who can't
distinguish between fantasy and reality.

248
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,463
So how could you take that as a reality?
I would say that as a pediatrician and

249
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:20,780
as a parent, I would say how wonderful
my four year old in their imagination is.

250
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,892
Aren't kids famous for
their active imaginations?

251
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,959
Should we really let our
children define reality?

252
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:38,389
If I said that I feel
a certain way, then

253
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:42,760
obviously you can't tell
me I don't feel that way.

254
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,940
But just because I feel
that way, does that mean

255
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:50,694
that it's true? Truly,
like none of my business.

256
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:53,638
So we all have our own identity realities.

257
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:57,586
What if I said, I want you to say that it's true that I'm a woman.

258
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:02,900
Would you say that? I would also say that if you want I honestly don't care.

259
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,782
Whatever makes you happy.

260
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,820
What's true to you can be false to me.

261
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,734
What if I said that my truth is
that you don't exist? Does that

262
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:17,602
mean you no longer exist? I
mean, if that's your true chair.

263
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:18,550
I don't.

264
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,240
Because it's so you do.

265
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,000
I mean, if you're saying that I do that I do.

266
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,518
Well, but even if I said that you don't, you still do.

267
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:30,440
Because we're having this conversation, are we? I think so.

268
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,060
That's what you think.

269
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,230
Well, I should have known it would be hard to define reality in Hollywood.

270
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,308
I should probably look
to the place where truth

271
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,790
is the foremost pursuit,
the American University.

272
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,371
What we do in gender studies
is not just reduce gender to what

273
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:02,834
psychologists might call individual
differences, but rather thinking about

274
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:07,532
gender, not women and man, but
gender as a social form, something

275
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:12,742
that kind of infuses itself into
virtually all aspects of social life.

276
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:13,858
Let's talk about that.

277
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:14,460
Then.

278
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,225
I guess we should start with
we've got gender and sex, right?

279
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:22,664
What's the difference between
the two? Is there a difference?

280
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:26,103
I saw that in your questions,
and I thought, my goodness, this

281
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:29,542
is what we spend an entire
semester kind of thinking through.

282
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:36,521
But what we tend to think about in the
social Sciences today is that sex refers to

283
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:43,450
a set of biological characteristics, and
gender is a social constructor category.

284
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,780
What I think is often
misleading about that character,

285
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:49,694
that it's allowed to be sort
of messy and complicated.

286
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:53,787
But in that framing, when you split them
up into these wholly discrete constructs,

287
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:57,698
study scholars and really more specifically,
people who study gender and sex.

288
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,760
We're not talking about sexuality right now.

289
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,203
Academic universe that
I travel in is that we see

290
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:06,221
how deeply gendered
ideas, cultural ideas about

291
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:09,208
masculinity, feminine,
maleness and femaleness,

292
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:12,130
both in humans and
in lots of other animals.

293
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,500
So our gender and sex two different things.

294
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,630
Well, I think that they both are and they aren't.

295
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,814
I'm comfortable saying that
gender and sex are two different

296
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:26,902
constructs, but they're deeply
intertwined with each other.

297
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,382
We're talking about gender and sex, and there's a lot of controversies there.

298
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:37,125
If we're talking about a trans woman has
all of the male physical characteristics,

299
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:43,241
so would that not be a male, then?
Couldn't we plainly say this person is

300
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:49,727
a male? Well, I guess it's like, why are
you asking the question? I think I want

301
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:56,050
to understand sort of why that's so
important to sort of understand reality.

302
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,030
Well, I mean, I think when someone tells you who they are, you should believe them.

303
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,409
So if a person says that
they're a woman or they're

304
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,762
a man, then that's them
telling you their gender is.

305
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:13,561
I'm not so sure what social interactions
would have to do with maleness

306
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:18,926
or femaleness that we I'm not
even talking about social context.

307
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,790
I'm just trying to start by getting to the truth.

308
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,578
Yeah.

309
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:27,477
I mean, I'm really
uncomfortable with that language

310
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:30,374
of, like, getting to the
truth again in social life.

311
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:34,840
Why is that uncomfortable? Because it sounds actually deeply transphobic to me.

312
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,810
And if you keep probing, we're going to stop the interview.

313
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,955
If I probe about what the
truth is, you keep invoking

314
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,694
the word truth, which is
condescending and rude.

315
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:48,339
I'm saying to you, how is the
word truth condescending and

316
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:51,900
rude? Why don't you tell me
what your truth is, and you're

317
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:55,521
walking on 30 seconds more of
the nights before I get up what

318
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:59,022
my truth is? Well, I don't
think I really have the truth.

319
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:03,110
I think that there's just the truth, like the reality.

320
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,600
And so we should begin by trying to figure out what the reality is.

321
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,181
And why are you concerned
when someone else tells you that

322
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:17,285
they're a man, or even if they
use the word male, why are you

323
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,689
concerned with not believing
them? Well, you keep bringing it back

324
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:25,958
to how do you respond in a
social situation? That's what I do.

325
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:27,006
I'm a social scientist.

326
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:27,518
Well, right.

327
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:28,554
But we're in a University.

328
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:31,814
This is a place of understanding truth, isn't it? Absolutely.

329
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:33,366
We pursue truth.

330
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,798
And I'm a social scientist, and that's what I did.

331
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,542
You just say the truth is transphobic.

332
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:43,010
That you would say if you're saying the truth is that I get to say you're not a man.

333
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,214
Show me your genitalia.

334
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,102
That's transphobic.

335
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:46,614
No, I don't want to see if it's genitalia.

336
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:51,534
I just mean someone can make a statement about themselves that could be untrue.

337
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:56,283
Like, for example, if I
were to say that I'm a

338
00:22:56,307 --> 00:23:01,008
black man, would you
accept that, or would you

339
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:05,733
be skeptical? Are you
black? Are you African

340
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:10,458
American? Are you
biracial? I don't think so.

341
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:11,610
Well, you don't look that.

342
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,642
And I don't think
that's a it doesn't sound

343
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,980
like that's a genuine
statement of who you are.

344
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,018
Okay.

345
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:19,906
So that's my point.

346
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:21,814
I could make a statement about who I am.

347
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:23,366
That's incorrect.

348
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:24,070
Of course.

349
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,174
I think it's well established that human beings can lie.

350
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:26,820
Yes.

351
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,046
Or not even lie.

352
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,590
I mean, I could just be mistaken.

353
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,220
Yeah.

354
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,493
I guess this all comes back
just all comes down to really

355
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:44,450
one question, especially women,
gender and sexuality studies.

356
00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:01,390
Why do you ask the question? I just really
like to know, what do you think the answer

357
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:08,510
to that question is? Well, I'm asking
that's why I came to a College Professor.

358
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,140
This is what you do.

359
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,446
a lot of like this where you're not answering? I've gotten a lot of that.

360
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:26,278
I think it's interesting that
you say that some of the

361
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:29,422
people you've interviewed
have been reluctant to answer it.

362
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:32,063
And I think that has a lot to do
with the the way questions that

363
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,174
preceded it and the way that you've
conducted yourself in the interview.

364
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:39,865
How have I conducted myself? How do
you think you've conducted yourself? You

365
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:44,411
just really don't want to answer the
questions, do you? I came today very

366
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:48,920
willing and enthusiastic about answering
questions about women and gender

367
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:54,054
sexuality studies, which is you wanted to
answer questions about women's studies.

368
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:56,589
And so the first answer
you should be able to

369
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,100
provide is what exactly
is a woman? Well, for

370
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,611
me, it's actually a
really simple answer, and

371
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:04,122
that's the person who
identifies as a woman.

372
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:09,611
But what are they identifying
as a woman? What is that as

373
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:15,040
a woman? Do you know what
a circular definition is? I do.

374
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,406
It's sort of like what you're doing right now.

375
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:23,777
Where is a woman? Because
you're seeking what we would call

376
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:28,110
in my field of work, an
essentialist definition of gender.

377
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,662
I think it sounds like you would like
me to give you a set of biological or

378
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:37,118
cultural characteristics that are
associated with one gender or the other.

379
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,754
I'm not seeking any type of definition.

380
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,542
I'm just seeking a definition.

381
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,980
Yeah, I gave you one.

382
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,100
Well, now I can say I've been to College.

383
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,450
Glad I didn't pay for it.

384
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,619
Is there anyone willing to
give me a straight answer?

385
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:54,280
Ideally somebody with a bunch
of medical degrees on the wall.

386
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,154
Dr.

387
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:57,302
Grossman, thanks for talking to us.

388
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,951
You're a psychiatrist
and medical doctor and

389
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,550
you've done a lot of
work in child psychiatry.

390
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,880
What is transgenderism?
From a psychiatric

391
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:12,474
standpoint? The best way
to approach it is by speaking

392
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:16,887
about gender dysphoria,
which is an intense

393
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:22,242
loathing and discomfort
with one's biological sex.

394
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:32,066
They exist anywhere between one in 30,000 people and one in 110,000.

395
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:36,572
It's important to
distinguish those people from

396
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:40,919
what's happening much
more recently, which is

397
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:45,267
kids that never had any
discomfort or dysphoria,

398
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:49,614
as it's now called,
with their biological sex.

399
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:56,262
And then quite suddenly, as preteens
or as adolescents, they come out and

400
00:26:56,286 --> 00:27:03,462
they announce that they are gender
fluid or they start to question their sex.

401
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:07,470
So first, let's define the terms sex and gender.

402
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,378
Yes, please.

403
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:11,870
Sex is biology.

404
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,246
Sex is unchanging.

405
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,970
It's based on chromosomes.

406
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:26,310
99 point 99% of the cells in the body are marked either male or female.

407
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,450
Gender, on the other hand, is a perception.

408
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,846
It's a feeling.

409
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:34,180
It's a way of identifying it's an experience.

410
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,686
Okay, that's subjective.

411
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:43,402
It sounds like what you're
saying is that if a man is male

412
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:49,010
but thinks of himself as a
woman, he's not actually a woman.

413
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,500
That's correct.

414
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,562
Male gametes.

415
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:54,762
That's what makes me male.

416
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,330
No, your sperm don't make you male.

417
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,790
Then what does it's a constellation in reality.

418
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,342
In truth.

419
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:05,707
Okay, whose truth are we
talking about? The same truth

420
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:08,246
that says we're sitting in
this room right now, you and I.

421
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:10,338
No, you're not listening.

422
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:14,325
If I see a chicken laying eggs and
I say that's a female chicken laying

423
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,070
eggs, did I assign female or am
I just observing a physical reality

424
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:21,924
that's happening in the world? Does
a chicken have gender identity? Does

425
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:25,670
a chicken cry? Does a chicken
commit suicide because you're talking.

426
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,474
You're trying.

427
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:27,318
Chicken has sex.

428
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:30,590
Like any biological organism, an assigned gender.

429
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,138
But a chicken doesn't have a gender identity.

430
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:35,478
So we assign female the chickens and they lay eggs.

431
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:37,866
We assume they're female if they lay eggs.

432
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:42,649
Now, I was told that really,
everyone agrees with the current

433
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:47,090
approach to gender and
transitioning kids and all that.

434
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,693
And if you don't agree that you
are a dinosaur and a bigot, are

435
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:56,270
you a bigoted dinosaur? I'm not
bigoted and I am not a dinosaur.

436
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,490
I am rooted in reality and in science.

437
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,090
Who's reality? There's one reality.

438
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,133
The first race that I
competed against a

439
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:14,600
transgender athlete was
during my freshman year.

440
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,166
And once the gun went off,
the two transgender athletes

441
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,686
took off flying and left
all of us girls in the dust.

442
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:26,573
Throughout all four
years of high school, I

443
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,646
was forced to compete
against biological males.

444
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:32,726
I only competed against them in the
sprinting events, but I raced against these

445
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,758
athletes over a dozen times throughout
the years, and every single time I lost.

446
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:41,564
Did they inch you out of medals that you
would have won otherwise or trophies you

447
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:46,298
would have won? They beat me out by 20
meters out of medals and qualifying spots.

448
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,310
I missed out on qualifying for New England.

449
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,802
I had to go in the long jump and the 4 X 200 meters relay.

450
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,250
So I was forced on the
sidelines in my own event, and if

451
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:57,698
they were not there, I would
have been able to qualify.

452
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,842
So I missed out on so much throughout my high school career.

453
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,972
Did they win all the events or
almost all the events between

454
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:07,354
the two of them? They want
every single event they competed in.

455
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:10,951
How does that feel? It is so
frustrating and heartbreaking

456
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,991
because we elite female
athletes train so hard to

457
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:17,272
shave distractions of a
second off of our time and going

458
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:20,494
into races knowing that
we will never be able to win.

459
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:23,050
It feels like all that work gone to waste.

460
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,374
Case.

461
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:45,098
In Connecticut, there were two male track runners, trainers, girls, right.

462
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,438
Who decided that they were going to race against the girls.

463
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:51,714
And you look at those
individuals, you look at

464
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:54,918
their times against the
men, against the boys.

465
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,842
So they were kind of middle
of the pack, and then they're

466
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,650
racing the girls and they're
first and second place.

467
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,942
Is that indicative of some kind of
unfair advantage that those individuals

468
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:11,574
might have against the girls? No, it's
not indicative of an unfair advantage.

469
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:16,100
And I think part of the proof of
this is that more transgender girls are

470
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,982
coming out in high school and still
playing sports and they're not winning.

471
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:23,358
The Connecticut case is the exception.

472
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:28,406
It got a lot of attention because those two trans girls performed well.

473
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:33,474
But there are many more trans girls competing in sports, and they don't excel.

474
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,330
At the end of the day, whether or
not you win a game is about how

475
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:41,042
hard you work in your practice,
and most of us aren't going to win.

476
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,300
And that goes for transgender athletes, too.

477
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,580
Let's go.

478
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,686
The norm is that transgender youth don't win that much in sports games.

479
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:03,342
Alana McLaughlin was very appreciative for Provost to take this by.

480
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:06,570
I don't know how appreciative now, but she got a couple of punches in.

481
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,686
It is very much the exception when
a transgender young person does

482
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:17,180
win, and it's because there's not
really an advantage to being trans.

483
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,420
Only a few people are going to lead the pack.

484
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,417
if there was a big advantage
to being transgender in sports,

485
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:47,390
then we would see transgender
women totally dominating.

486
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,228
And over the last half
of the pool, nobody will

487
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:57,030
touch Leah Thomas and
man a feel like a woman.

488
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,834
Transgender swimmer Leah Thomas breaking barriers and records.

489
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:03,598
But in a new article,
Sports Illustrated calls the

490
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:06,894
College senior the most
controversial athlete in America.

491
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:11,306
Leah obviously helps us do better, right? Swimming really fast.

492
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:15,266
Leah's performance helps the University of Pennsylvania swim team.

493
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,630
The feeling of winning doesn't feel as good anymore because it feels painted.

494
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,586
There was a lot of things
you couldn't talk about that

495
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,446
were very concerning,
like a locker room situation.

496
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,290
If you even brought up concerns about it, you were transphobic.

497
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,718
If you even bring up the
fact that Leah swimming

498
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,110
might not be fair, you
were immediately shut down.

499
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,294
This being called a hateful person or transphobic.

500
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,646
But there's never any conversation.

501
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,717
The coaches don't
sit everyone down and

502
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:43,322
acknowledge what
everyone's really upset about.

503
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,363
So kind of actually
brought in people high

504
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,354
up in the athletic
Department to talk to us.

505
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,766
They brought in someone from the LGBTQ center.

506
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:52,598
They brought in someone from the psychological services.

507
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:57,182
So you're upset about what's happening and so you need psychological help.

508
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:57,566
Yeah.

509
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:00,432
And they told us in this meeting,
they said, look, we understand

510
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:03,618
there's an array of emotions, but
Leah, swimming is a non negotiable.

511
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:06,566
However, we can help you make that okay.

512
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:07,802
That's what we here for.

513
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,122
So you're anonymous for this interview.

514
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:15,480
Why did you decide that you can't have your face out there
saying these things? They've made it pretty clear that

515
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,129
if you speak up about it
and you say anything negative

516
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:20,778
that your life will be over
in some way, you'll be lost.

517
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:21,678
It all over the Internet.

518
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,482
As a transphobe.

519
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:24,962
If you come out and then you'll never be able to get a job.

520
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:27,196
Like anyone who wants
to hire you will look you up

521
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,380
and see your transphobic
and your life will be over.

522
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,574
Let's say that I identified
as a woman tomorrow, and I

523
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:39,182
wanted to go into the same
locker room where you are.

524
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:44,210
Should I be allowed to do that? As long as I identify that way, I don't know.

525
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,142
I just feel that other women would be uncomfortable by you walking in.

526
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,998
controversy at a health club in Korea Town over the issue of gender.

527
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:06,678
That's right.

528
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:10,158
Video of spa goers complaining was posted on social media.

529
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,900
I just want to be clear with you.

530
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,203
It's okay for a man
to go into the women's

531
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:19,902
section, show his penis
around the other women.

532
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:22,110
Young, little girls under age.

533
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,386
Your spa.

534
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:25,134
Wi spa condone that.

535
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:30,740
Is that what you're saying? Like I asked, he could stay there.

536
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,780
He could stay there.

537
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,374
Bisexual orientation.

538
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:36,250
I see a dick.

539
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,608
Police identified the
person involved as 52

540
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:40,930
year old Darren Morager
of Riverside County.

541
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,030
Moragor, who has been a
registered sex offender since

542
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:47,446
2006, now faces five felony
counts of indecent exposure.

543
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,774
Hello, I'm Congressman Mark Dakano.

544
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,763
Trans month of visibility is a
time to recognize the strength,

545
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:57,294
diversity and resiliency of
the transgender community.

546
00:35:57,392 --> 00:36:02,731
Together, we can make our country and our world
a more accepting place by speaking out against

547
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:08,900
transphobia at the source and supporting the trans
community by getting the quality acts signed into law.

548
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,478
Congressman, thank you for being here.

549
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,330
Thanks for joining us.

550
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,645
You are the first member of
Congress who's a member of

551
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:18,934
the LGBT community and
also a person of Asian descent.

552
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:22,014
You're also a big proponent of the Equality Act.

553
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:22,782
Yes.

554
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:26,658
What is the Equality Act? If you were to just summarize it very briefly, I know it does a lot.

555
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:32,865
The most simplest way to talk about
the Equality Act is that it simply amends

556
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:38,710
the Civil Rights Act to include
sexual orientation and gender identity.

557
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,800
So public accommodations is one area.

558
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:49,770
What's a way that someone who's LGBT could be discriminated in public accommodations.

559
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,082
Currently, public
accommodations is the whole area

560
00:36:56,106 --> 00:37:02,038
of hotels and motels,
bathrooms and sports teams.

561
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:02,850
Is that.

562
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,658
I say bathrooms, sports teams, athletic events.

563
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:10,086
Let's get into more specific policy issues.

564
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:13,580
There are some women who say and I've talked to a few who say this.

565
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,922
They say, hey, I'd like some Privacy in the bathroom.

566
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:22,162
I'd prefer not to encounter naked penises.

567
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:32,130
Frankly, they say even that the penis is a telltale sign that someone is a male.

568
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:39,810
There are people really bought into the rumor that only men have penises.

569
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,280
we're talking not about a lot of people.

570
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,096
I think a person who wants to use
a woman's bathroom, who identifies

571
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,730
as transgender really does
think of themselves as a female.

572
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:49,500
respect their basic right to live? I think it will be an important part of this law.

573
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,680
Wait a minute.

574
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:01,550
Bathrooms are where you want to take this
conversation instead of the basic right to

575
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:08,974
dislike is something that I'm kind of
mystified that you're kind of not focusing on.

576
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:12,910
First, we're going straight to the controversy over bathrooms.

577
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,138
So you know what? I think this interview is overview is over.

578
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,580
I just had one last question.

579
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,714
The interview is over.

580
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:26,110
We want to know what is a woman? Please turn off the camera.

581
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,186
I just wanted to know.

582
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:35,218
I came all this way to know what they're fair.

583
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:36,850
Quote, I just wanted to know what is a woman.

584
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,199
My trip to California
isn't providing many

585
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,720
answers, but at least
I'm making new friends.

586
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,568
Do you worry about kids walking
around out here? No, because I

587
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:03,114
raised two daughters they're two
of the most well adjusted adults.

588
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:05,258
They grew up around naked people.

589
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:09,275
And there's been studies that have
shown that children raised around

590
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:13,230
non sexual nudity actually have
fewer hang ups when they're adults.

591
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,082
People do have hang ups.

592
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:17,150
There's a lot of things hanging right now during this conversation.

593
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,179
Can anyone be any gender they
want to be? Can a man become a

594
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:24,630
woman if he wants to be what
people do? That's personal choice.

595
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,810
People can live the life they want to.

596
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,622
I'm trying to live the life I want to.

597
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:29,774
An authentic life.

598
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:33,998
That's why I respect other people's rights to choose what they want to do.

599
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:37,533
Well, why are you asking the gay man
as to what it means to be a woman? You

600
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:41,006
should be asking women what it means
to be women, especially trans women.

601
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,758
Who what it means to be women.

602
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:44,090
I'm asking all kinds of people.

603
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,100
Can anyone have an opinion about it? Only people who are women.

604
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,138
Gay men don't know nothing about what it means to be a woman.

605
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:55,385
Have you told gay men here in San Francisco
that they're not allowed to talk about

606
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:59,500
this? No, but it's not like I come around
and say what a gay man is allowed to be.

607
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,263
So you're saying if you're not a woman,
then you shouldn't have an opinion? Where

608
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:09,820
does the guy get a right to say what a
woman is? Women only know what women are.

609
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,180
Are you a cat? No.

610
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,354
This is actually a genuine mistake.

611
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:24,260
I'm sorry I even came up here.

612
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:32,454
Do you want to tell us what a woman is?
If my friend in the purple hat is correct

613
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:39,660
and only women can tell me what a woman is,
I guess I need to go where the women are.

614
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,062
Oh, you're at the women's March.

615
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:01,260
You must have some idea.

616
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,050
So I see girls vagina.

617
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,348
Does that mean that they're the
only people who can get pregnant?

618
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:15,040
If men can get pregnant, too, I
think they want the right to choose.

619
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,094
But men can get pregnant.

620
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:19,666
We're saying someone
who was born as a woman

621
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,214
but identifies as a
man, that's a real man.

622
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:23,054
It's a real man.

623
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:23,680
Yeah.

624
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,980
So men can get pregnant? Yes.

625
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,330
They have the parts.

626
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,886
Is it just women that give birth or is it.

627
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:32,846
Yeah.

628
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:37,180
So men could give birth to Dino, but that could be a man or one.

629
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,374
Well, I mean, I think that's the whole point, right? That it's fluid.

630
00:42:40,422 --> 00:42:42,842
The way that we define these things changes a lot.

631
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,855
What are you doing here?
I'm asking these questions,

632
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:46,742
okay? I'm trying to figure
out what a woman is.

633
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:47,570
That's why I'm here.

634
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,522
This is the women's March.

635
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,054
I figured it's a good place to find out.

636
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,770
I've come all this way, ask that question.

637
00:42:51,820 --> 00:43:02,460
Can anyone tell me what a woman is? What is that? Am I ask her a question.

638
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,290
please.

639
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,740
If one person could tell me what a woman is.

640
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,740
Do you guys know what a woman is by any chance? No.

641
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,250
I've been all over America.

642
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,080
I still can't find an answer.

643
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,580
Maybe I'm looking too close to home.

644
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,762
We came a long way to come and talk to you guys thousands of miles from America.

645
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,102
Thank you for inviting us into your tribe.

646
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:52,858
First of all, I can say it is my pleasure to meet you and feel most welcome.

647
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:55,066
But you're here to learn with me.

648
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:56,386
I'm here to learn with you too.

649
00:44:56,448 --> 00:44:57,060
Great.

650
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,160
with the elbow? Yeah.

651
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:13,970
I mean, they're laughing.

652
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,282
I guess it's not good, but I thought it was pretty good.

653
00:45:16,356 --> 00:45:17,940
Not good enough to be a man yet.

654
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,808
What does a man do? What
are his roles within the tribe?

655
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:27,070
At the role of a man, you
need to work for your woman.

656
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,370
Secondly, to have children.

657
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,800
If you have children
and you don't have

658
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:35,880
something to feed them,
you are not still a man.

659
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,420
The best raw kidney I've had in my life.

660
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,834
in Masai community? It will not exist at all.

661
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:30,010
It doesn't exist.

662
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,115
A woman has its own duty and a
man has its own duty and a lady cannot

663
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:56,750
duty the duty of a man and a
man cannot do the duty of a woman.

664
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:06,920
No.

665
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,660
No.

666
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,346
It looks like if you want
to become a lady, but

667
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,726
your man, you have
something wrong in your mind.

668
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:27,358
Something wrong in your family.

669
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,980
Something wrong in you.

670
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,770
What about if someone was non binary? Come again? Non binary.

671
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,026
Someone is neither.

672
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:57,882
he's saying.

673
00:47:57,956 --> 00:48:02,626
We have never seen things like this for a man, he has a penis.

674
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:04,822
For a woman, has a vagina.

675
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,514
So we know this is a lady.

676
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:07,700
This is a man.

677
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,750
People are laughing.

678
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,814
They're just laughing because they have never heard something like that.

679
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:33,220
This is their first time.

680
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,706
I never heard it before.

681
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,670
A woman has a penis and she's a woman.

682
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,862
In my country, I can't go day without hearing it.

683
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,834
We hear it every day.

684
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:44,649
So in my country, sometimes
you'll hear people say a

685
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:47,390
man will say that I'm a
woman trapped in a man's body.

686
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,080
And so they say that I have a woman trapped inside.

687
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,006
They want to know a woman has the breast.

688
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:05,050
Breast.

689
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,650
Secondly, he has a vagina.

690
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:08,962
Vagina.

691
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:14,953
And the question is, does
this man deliver? Does

692
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:20,700
he deliver babies? No,
not as far as I know.

693
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,408
The question is, let's
say if you want to sleep a

694
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:34,930
woman, definitely you'll
do sexy, is it? But for the

695
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:40,295
man, where do you you ask
that question? I don't know

696
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,454
all the logistics of it
based on what I'm saying.

697
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,414
She saved a woman, delivered.

698
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:08,730
A man cannot.

699
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,906
So it sounds like you don't spend a lot of time thinking about gender.

700
00:50:14,038 --> 00:50:15,174
You just kind of live your lives.

701
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,230
You don't think much about it.

702
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,300
It doesn't matter.

703
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,506
He said no because we believe that's a God plan.

704
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:28,942
God's plan? He's saying that I'm shocked on what you're telling me.

705
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:30,480
He's shocked? Yeah.

706
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,822
The Masai.

707
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:37,870
People don't think much about gender, but they have a firm sense of their identity.

708
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,650
It's clear that gender ideology is a uniquely Western phenomenon.

709
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,139
So where did all this come
from? Who came up with

710
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:51,382
it and why? Matt, I
want to show this to you.

711
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:54,010
You're a parent, right? Okay.

712
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,150
It's perfectly normal for ten years and up.

713
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:14,174
For ten and up, huh? It's unspeakable what these people have done to our children.

714
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:17,878
When did that start? When was it
decided that we need to start teaching kids

715
00:51:17,902 --> 00:51:21,400
about this stuff at such a young
age? So I'll answer that with one word.

716
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,790
Kinsey.

717
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,230
Kinsey was a social reformer.

718
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:33,972
He wanted to rid society of
JudeoChristian values when it came to

719
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:40,850
sexuality, and he worked very hard to
do that, and I would say he succeeded.

720
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,320
Kinsey would be very happy with our culture today.

721
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,510
His idea was that children
are sexual from birth, that

722
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:52,494
we're all inherently sexual
creatures from cradle to grave.

723
00:51:52,602 --> 00:51:55,894
He believed that true
happiness is found in a life of

724
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:59,210
perverse sexual experimentation,
no matter the age.

725
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,810
What came out is that his research was fraudulent.

726
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,022
Kinsey based his fraudulent
conclusions on data he

727
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:09,126
collected from convicted sex
offenders and child molesters.

728
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:12,546
His research was conducted in prisons, not everyday America.

729
00:52:12,678 --> 00:52:17,860
He also performed horrific sexual experiments on children, some under the age of one.

730
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,659
His most influential book,
Sexual Behavior in the

731
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:24,612
Human Male, contains an
infamous chart called table

732
00:52:24,636 --> 00:52:27,294
34, which documents
the orgasms of very young

733
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,460
kids, including babies as
young as five months old.

734
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,772
But instead of suffering the
consequences for his heinous actions,

735
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:38,250
he was, and still is, celebrated
by academia and Hollywood.

736
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,578
His ideas form the foundation for sexual education and public schools today.

737
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:46,398
How do we get from this to you can choose your own gender.

738
00:52:46,494 --> 00:52:49,662
Okay, well, now we have another and very important character.

739
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:52,240
And his name was John Money.

740
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,930
John Money was a psychologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University.

741
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,990
Gender ideology was his brainchild.

742
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,070
In fact, he coined the terms gender identity and gender roles.

743
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,975
And according to Money, babies
are gender neutral at birth, and

744
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:12,066
ultimately, environment determines
whether a person is a man or a woman.

745
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:16,245
Money was telling the world
about his theory that a boy

746
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:20,766
could be raised as a girl and
do just fine and vice versa.

747
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:25,425
And so Money tried out his theory on
two young twin boys, the Rhymer Twins,

748
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:29,850
when the twins were eight months
old and they went to be circumcised.

749
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,786
The first twin, whose name
was Bruce, something went

750
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:39,626
wrong with the machinery
and his penis was burnt off.

751
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:41,871
They stopped and didn't
do a second circumcision

752
00:53:41,895 --> 00:53:43,790
on the other twin,
as you might imagine.

753
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,138
And the parents, of course, didn't know what to do.

754
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:49,760
How are they going to
raise this child? John Money

755
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:52,718
convinced Bruce's parents
to transition him into a girl.

756
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:56,619
Money also conducted sexually abusive
experiments on the twins throughout

757
00:53:56,643 --> 00:54:00,398
their childhood, including forcing
them to simulate sex acts on each other.

758
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:05,020
He reported up to the age of ten that this was a complete success.

759
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,162
Well, it wasn't true.

760
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:10,734
The results were a disaster.

761
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:13,590
Bruce could never fully accept his female identity.

762
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,601
Eventually, his parents told
him the truth, and he chose

763
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,410
to transition back to a
boy, taking the name David.

764
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:24,230
As an adult, David spoke out about the abuse and the damage done to him by John Money.

765
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,778
The girls would do their
things with their barbies

766
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:31,180
and things like that, and
that wouldn't interest me.

767
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,710
And things such as
trucks and rolling forts

768
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:40,398
and getting to the fist
fight, climbing trees.

769
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:41,714
That's the kind of stuff that I like.

770
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:42,750
But it was unacceptable.

771
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,874
So I never as a girl, as a girl, I had no place to fit in.

772
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:52,970
The trauma that he and his brother and his entire family went through left deep scars.

773
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:02,090
His brother died of an overdose when he was 38, and then David committed suicide.

774
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,758
There was never a retraction or an apology from John Money.

775
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,901
Instead, his ideas were adopted
by mainstream psychology,

776
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:12,760
and they formed the basis
of gender ideology today.

777
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,653
Why don't more people know
about John Money and Alfred Kinsey?

778
00:55:17,677 --> 00:55:22,120
Evidently, there are forces that
don't want this information out.

779
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:30,538
I never said I was an Alpha female sales executive.

780
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:32,840
That kind of just didn't fit in any box.

781
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,082
When psychologists or somebody
that I was in love with or whatever said

782
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:44,160
that I was in the wrong body, I
started to think, well, maybe I am.

783
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,574
I'm a biological woman
that medically transitioned to

784
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,450
appear like a male through
synthetic hormones and surgery.

785
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,580
I will never be a man.

786
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:05,336
Is it transphobic for me to tell the truth?
Why is it then, a couple of hundred years

787
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,322
from now, if you dug
up my body, they're going

788
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:11,110
to go, yeah, that was
a woman had babies.

789
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:18,250
Can you tell me about the procedures that you had? I've had seven surgeries.

790
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,674
I've had one stress heart attack.

791
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:24,290
I've had a helicopter life ride with pulmonary embolism.

792
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,806
I've had 17 rounds of antibiotics.

793
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:32,482
I had six inches of hair on the inside of my retrain for 17 months.

794
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,951
Nobody would help me,
including the doctor that

795
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,200
did this to me because
I lost my insurance.

796
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,970
I get infections every three to four months.

797
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,540
I'm probably not going to live very long.

798
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:52,570
Was there any real discussion of the risks and the side effects? No, there's not.

799
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,860
And I know that people want to think that there is, but there's not.

800
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:00,110
The truth is that medical transition is experimental.

801
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,708
We have studies that
said that medical transition

802
00:57:03,732 --> 00:57:07,150
helps mental health,
helps mental health of kids.

803
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,814
They've all been retracted, modified, changed.

804
00:57:10,982 --> 00:57:16,374
But the only long term study
tells us seven to ten years is

805
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:21,790
when transgender people are
the most suicidal after surgery.

806
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:27,109
But that's transphobic to say
for the first time in history, a

807
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:32,722
marginalized group has a huge
dollar sign on the top of their head.

808
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:40,260
We have five children's hospitals in the United States promoting that.

809
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,958
That's a paleoplasty.

810
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,350
That's a bottom surgery.

811
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:52,269
We have five children's
hospitals in the United States

812
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:57,598
telling girls that they
can be boys at $70,000 a

813
00:57:57,622 --> 00:58:02,818
pop in a surgery that has
a 67% complication rate

814
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:08,690
that will kill me from
infection that I can't sue on.

815
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,035
We're butchering a
generation of children

816
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:13,780
because nobody's willing
to talk about anything.

817
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:21,020
I have three kids at the age that they're doing this to kids.

818
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,454
I'm not transphobic.

819
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:27,606
I love my kids and I love other people's kids.

820
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:29,060
And you should, too.

821
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:35,490
This is wrong on so many levels.

822
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,723
Can kids consent?
Do you think kids are

823
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,218
capable of consenting
to that? No, they're not.

824
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:48,526
Being a parent is loving the hell out of your kids
and helping them see around corners what's the

825
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:53,179
youngest patient that you've
operated on? The youngest

826
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:57,394
patient I've done vaginal
plastic on is age 16.

827
00:58:57,502 --> 00:59:03,628
Do you worry that minors just don't understand
enough about themselves? They're not

828
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:06,883
neurologically developed
enough yet to make

829
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:10,602
permit life altering
decisions? Absolutely not.

830
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:13,710
A young person's self perception.

831
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:19,014
One day they may be clear, the next day they may be totally confused and not sure.

832
00:59:19,172 --> 00:59:23,167
And you're affirming it
with hormones that have

833
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:27,970
never been used in this
way in the field of medicine.

834
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:32,190
You're talking about puberty blockers?
Blockers and then opposite sex hormones.

835
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,778
What age does the medical transition begin with medication.

836
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:41,706
So medical affirmation begins when the patient says they're ready for it.

837
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:45,390
So that could be a kiddo
who is just starting puberty

838
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:48,781
and panicking because
they're getting breast buds

839
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:51,964
or their penis is getting
bigger and busier and

840
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:55,698
they're worried about all
kinds of masculine changes.

841
00:59:55,844 --> 01:00:01,371
And that way puberty blockers, which
are completely reversible and don't have

842
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:06,922
permanent effects, are wonderful
because we can put that pause on puberty.

843
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:10,964
It's like if you were listening to
music, you put the pause on and we

844
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:14,886
stopped the blockers and puberty
would go right back to where it was.

845
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:19,194
The next note in the song just delayed that period of time.

846
01:00:19,352 --> 01:00:21,022
You can just pause puberty.

847
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:22,974
No, you can't and then pick it up.

848
01:00:23,012 --> 01:00:23,518
No, you can't.

849
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:24,030
In the future.

850
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,018
No, you can't.

851
01:00:25,174 --> 01:00:27,849
How many studies do
they have? Long term

852
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:31,306
studies on hormone
blockers with children? None.

853
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:36,632
I just spoke a month
or two ago with a mother

854
01:00:36,656 --> 01:00:41,790
whose 14 year old
daughter was put on blockers.

855
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:47,194
They discovered after two years, this 14 year old girl has osteoporosis.

856
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:49,398
That's something that like old women get.

857
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:53,743
How can doctors assure parents
that a certain medicine is totally

858
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:58,026
safe? Based on what you're
saying, they can't possibly know that.

859
01:00:58,148 --> 01:01:06,297
How can they be removing the healthy breaths of 15 year
old girls? How can they be sterilizing kids? How can this

860
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:10,127
whole thing be happening Matt?

861
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:14,470
Every child that they convince is transgender
and in need of medical transition,

862
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,346
it generates $1.3 million to Pharma.

863
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:25,078
And we're believing a pharmaceutical company, Lupron hormone blockers, reversible.

864
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:29,024
So they say, well, the truth
is that in 2003, Lupron was

865
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:33,320
sued and deemed a criminal
enterprise by the US government.

866
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:38,886
They paid the most fine of any pharmaceutical company at that time.

867
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:42,282
$874,000,000 wrote a check.

868
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:46,280
Is Lupron chemical castration? Yes.

869
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:52,760
We're giving it to Pedophiles, aren't we?
We're giving it to people that are dying

870
01:01:52,784 --> 01:01:56,074
and we're giving it to kids telling them
that they were born in the wrong body.

871
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,446
And it's completely safe.

872
01:01:57,578 --> 01:01:59,114
One of the drugs used is Lupron.

873
01:01:59,162 --> 01:01:59,374
Right.

874
01:01:59,412 --> 01:02:04,330
Which has actually been used to chemically castrate sex offenders.

875
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,581
You know what? I'm not sure
that we should continue with this

876
01:02:07,605 --> 01:02:10,934
interview because it seems like
it's going in a particular direction.

877
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,434
Well, you're a medical professional.

878
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,946
I am a medical professional.

879
01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:18,086
So you don't want to talk
about the drugs that you give

880
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:22,178
to kids? Again, I'm a
physician and I use medication.

881
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:26,314
You're choosing exploitive words, drugs I give to you.

882
01:02:26,352 --> 01:02:29,066
I'm choosing a chemical word that was in a dictionary.

883
01:02:29,138 --> 01:02:31,250
That's not a correct term for puberty blocking.

884
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,438
I could look it up on my
phone, but I'm pretty sure

885
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,590
if I looked it up, you can
look it up on your phone.

886
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,367
It says medical definition, the
administration of a drug to bring about a marked

887
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:43,118
reduction in the body's production of
androgens and especially testosterone.

888
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:47,404
And I'm saying as a pediatrician
who takes care of hundreds of these

889
01:02:47,428 --> 01:02:52,250
kids, when you use that terminology,
you were being malignant and harmful.

890
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,040
There are some who would
say that giving chemical

891
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:57,674
castration drugs to kids
is malignant and harmful.

892
01:02:57,782 --> 01:03:03,434
It's about the context of caring
for a child and seeing the suffering

893
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:09,110
that kids can have that have not
been in affirmative home situations.

894
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,973
What do you say to the claim
that we have to do this for

895
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:16,800
these kids? Because if we
don't, they'll kill themselves.

896
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,574
They'll resort to drugs and self harm.

897
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:21,430
A lot of them were hurting themselves.

898
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,974
A lot of them were suicidal before they even discovered gender.

899
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:28,370
That is never part of the discussion.

900
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:34,098
And they say, what would you rather
have? A living daughter or a dead son? If

901
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:39,730
this is what the professionals are
saying, it's terrible emotional blackmail.

902
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,674
Hello? Hey, is this.

903
01:03:45,832 --> 01:03:46,334
This is.

904
01:03:46,372 --> 01:03:46,898
Yes.

905
01:03:47,044 --> 01:03:48,830
Hey, it's Matt Walsh.

906
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,620
Where are you right now.

907
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,340
I'm in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, right now.

908
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,070
Are you able to leave? I'm not able to leave BC.

909
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,720
I can't even go to another province in Canada right now.

910
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,670
And it's because I'm technically out on bail.

911
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:30,894
how exactly did this get into the courts to begin with? Right.

912
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:34,755
So what happened is we set up a meeting
with BC Children's Hospital, and according

913
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:38,602
to the BC Children's Hospital website,
there's going to be a thorough evaluation.

914
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:39,738
And I'm thinking, good.

915
01:04:39,824 --> 01:04:41,178
This is going to be the end of it all.

916
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:44,422
You're going to clearly see that my child is not the opposite sex.

917
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:48,094
So my ex wife brings my child into BC Children's Hospital.

918
01:04:48,202 --> 01:04:51,938
I get a call less than an hour into
that appointment is that they were going

919
01:04:51,962 --> 01:04:55,698
to pump her full of cross-sex hormones
within the hour, and I put a halt to that.

920
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:56,720
I said no.

921
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,430
They agreed to stop for the moment.

922
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,302
They figured, well, let's get the dad on board too.

923
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:02,190
This is all going to be better.

924
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,786
Let's just get everybody on the same page.

925
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:05,154
I said it's not going to happen.

926
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:10,011
So I get a letter from BC Children's Hospital
in December of 2018, and it says that

927
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:14,794
under the BC Infants Act, they will start
injecting my child with cross-sex hormones.

928
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:18,786
And I have two weeks to respond with legal action if I still choose.

929
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:22,234
And so that's how I ended up in court, because I did respond with legal action.

930
01:05:22,402 --> 01:05:28,506
So you called your daughter a she and you went to jail for that?

931
01:05:28,628 --> 01:05:32,902
It's considered criminal violence to not use the preferred pronouns.

932
01:05:32,986 --> 01:05:35,396
It's no different than,
let's say I were to take a

933
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,830
broomstick and whack one
of my kids over the head.

934
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,114
So they were treating it in a similar fashion.

935
01:05:40,162 --> 01:05:41,638
That misgendering.

936
01:05:41,674 --> 01:05:45,286
Mispronouncing my child was the equivalent of family violence.

937
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:49,830
Is she on the hormone pills now? She is.

938
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:57,083
The court ordered that she could
do whatever she wanted.

939
01:05:57,107 --> 01:06:04,250
2020 until I would say 2016, I would say
80% of my clients were trans youth.

940
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:05,314
Now it is.

941
01:06:05,412 --> 01:06:09,050
You identify, you take hormones, you do surgery.

942
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,098
There isn't any other pathways.

943
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:15,289
So if you have two
parents, one parent wants to

944
01:06:15,313 --> 01:06:18,878
affirm the trans identity,
the other parent doesn't.

945
01:06:18,914 --> 01:06:21,910
Who wins that battle? The one who wants to affirm every time.

946
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,918
Every single time.

947
01:06:23,004 --> 01:06:27,000
The goal is to get the parents to affirm the kid.

948
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,298
There's no such thing as a gender affirming therapist.

949
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:36,974
That's a contradiction in terms.

950
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:38,634
Why? Because you don't affirm.

951
01:06:38,682 --> 01:06:41,630
If you're a therapist, it's not your business to affirm.

952
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,330
You come to see me because there's something wrong.

953
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,737
Maybe you come to see
me because a destructive

954
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,998
element of you is
wreaking havoc in your life.

955
01:06:49,144 --> 01:06:52,646
I'm on the side of the part of you that wants to aim up, man.

956
01:06:52,828 --> 01:06:54,374
That's what I'm on the side of.

957
01:06:54,412 --> 01:06:55,814
Okay? Now, I don't know what that means.

958
01:06:55,852 --> 01:06:58,394
In your case, we're going to talk about it.

959
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:02,786
Am I going to affirm what you think? No, it's not up to me to affirm it.

960
01:07:02,848 --> 01:07:05,208
You don't get a casual
pad on the back from a

961
01:07:05,232 --> 01:07:08,238
therapist for your pre
existing axiomatic conclusions.

962
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,426
That's not therapy.

963
01:07:09,498 --> 01:07:10,878
That's a rubber stamp.

964
01:07:11,034 --> 01:07:17,194
Is anybody at any point explaining to
these kids the real long term consequences

965
01:07:17,218 --> 01:07:23,378
of hormones and puberty blockers? I don't
think they're explaining it to the kids.

966
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:26,598
That has frightened
me that it's become that

967
01:07:26,622 --> 01:07:30,194
we're even talking to
the kids about it at ten.

968
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:32,034
We're presenting it in schools.

969
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:38,394
So this generation, they're the lab rats.

970
01:07:38,502 --> 01:07:41,954
Biological sex, binary. It's been binary for
like 100 million years, longer than that.

971
01:07:41,992 --> 01:07:43,422
Temperament is not binary.

972
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:44,790
Temperamental personality.

973
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,822
So it's gender.

974
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:46,986
Temperament is gender.

975
01:07:47,058 --> 01:07:53,850
Well, gender is not a good word because it's vague and it isn't measurable.

976
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:57,332
So do we need it? Why can we just
say temperament? What do we even need

977
01:07:57,356 --> 01:08:00,778
the word gender for? Well, I don't
need it, but what I would say is that

978
01:08:00,802 --> 01:08:04,028
people who talk about the diversity
and gender are actually talking

979
01:08:04,052 --> 01:08:07,622
about diversity and personality and
temperament, but they don't know it.

980
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:12,128
You can have a masculine temperament if
you're a woman, maybe one in ten women have

981
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:16,530
the average temperament of a man and
you can have feminine men temperamentally.

982
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,912
And it's not that uncommon
because the differences

983
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:21,686
between men and women
temperamentally aren't that great.

984
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:23,310
There are masculine girls.

985
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,858
There are feminine boys.

986
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:28,972
What are we going to do about
that? Carve them up? You as someone

987
01:08:28,996 --> 01:08:32,954
who started your professional
life, you know, transgender care.

988
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:33,700
Yeah.

989
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:39,254
Now you're sitting here talking to me and I'm a dangerous man.

990
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:40,180
I've been told.

991
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:46,038
Are you worried about reprisals? Are you
worried about how this is going to play among

992
01:08:46,062 --> 01:08:48,714
your professional
peers? I am worried that I

993
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:51,390
can't have conversations
with any other peers.

994
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,388
I don't know any other
peer that will speak

995
01:08:54,412 --> 01:08:57,350
to me around these
things, that question it.

996
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:02,860
I just don't think developmentally this is helpful to our children.

997
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,178
You step wrong as a therapist.

998
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:07,737
You say the wrong thing
once and your bloody career

999
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:10,182
is over and now it's the
same with physicians.

1000
01:09:10,266 --> 01:09:12,477
How's that going to work?
You're going to go have

1001
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,944
an honest conversation
with your physician when he's

1002
01:09:14,968 --> 01:09:17,155
terrified out of his mind
if he'll say something

1003
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:19,646
politically incorrect during
the diagnostic process.

1004
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:22,670
Hey, man, you're sick with whatever you want to be.

1005
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,800
See you later.

1006
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,845
You want a prescription
for something? I left

1007
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:29,924
academia because the
climate had become too stifling

1008
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:32,832
politically, especially
when it comes to the topic

1009
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:35,562
of gender identity and
the science of gender.

1010
01:09:35,646 --> 01:09:38,738
It is absolutely impossible to do good research.

1011
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:41,093
You basically have to decide
beforehand what you're

1012
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:43,386
going to find so that
you don't upset activists.

1013
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,174
And that is not how you do science.

1014
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:48,371
Why has this shift occurred
where all of a sudden

1015
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:51,291
gender and sex has
become so politically and

1016
01:09:51,315 --> 01:09:54,598
culturally charged?
There's a really ugly history

1017
01:09:54,622 --> 01:09:57,906
between sex researchers
and transgender activists.

1018
01:09:58,038 --> 01:10:05,006
In the past, if any sex researcher spoke out about science
that went against activist orthodoxy or particular narratives

1019
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:08,326
that activists wanted to
promote, they would basically

1020
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:11,646
have their personal and
professional reputations ruined.

1021
01:10:11,718 --> 01:10:13,661
So what you see is
that only experts who toe

1022
01:10:13,685 --> 01:10:15,902
the party line and say
the things that activists

1023
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:18,258
like, those are the people
who get attention, those

1024
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,474
are the people who get
lifted up in the media.

1025
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:23,861
And also, I would say people are
incentivized to go along with the

1026
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:27,630
activist narratives and gender
ideology because that helps their career.

1027
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,018
Trans is very cool.

1028
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:32,800
Trans is a way of giving yourself value.

1029
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:36,306
Given the way society at the moment is functioning.

1030
01:10:36,378 --> 01:10:39,850
All of the things that used
to give us anchors of identity

1031
01:10:39,874 --> 01:10:43,346
have become very fluid or
very volatile in recent years.

1032
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:47,189
And in that context, I
think what you find then is

1033
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:50,934
new identities start to
fill the void of the vacuum.

1034
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:54,600
Whereas in the past I might have
got my sense of self worth from

1035
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:58,126
being part of the village where
I grew up, now I might get my

1036
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:01,680
sense of self worth through
being part of the online community

1037
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:05,234
that I connect with or part of
the sexual identity community.

1038
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:10,083
So now we are seeing kids that
are identifying as animals going

1039
01:11:10,107 --> 01:11:14,798
to school, and they are purring
instead of answering questions.

1040
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:18,441
And they Meow and the
teachers are not allowed to

1041
01:11:18,465 --> 01:11:22,542
question it because it's
considered a queer identity.

1042
01:11:22,686 --> 01:11:27,670
So you have kids that are going
to school and they're saying,

1043
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:32,594
I'm a cat, and the teachers
have to affirm them as a cat.

1044
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:33,460
Yes.

1045
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:35,778
Literal zoos.

1046
01:11:35,814 --> 01:11:43,210
Now, basically they are. I am a 27 year old transgender woman.

1047
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:46,690
I am a Wolf theory and a member of the Furry fandom.

1048
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:52,702
When and how did you discover this inner wolfness? Probably around age ten or eleven.

1049
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:57,482
I was watching an anime about
Wolves and see the Wolf running across

1050
01:11:57,506 --> 01:12:02,202
the screen, and I'm somehow
just intrinsically like, oh, that's me.

1051
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,540
Have you spent any time around biological Wolves? Yes.

1052
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,114
That sounds dangerous.

1053
01:12:07,162 --> 01:12:10,690
Also, what context are you?
So I was a volunteer with

1054
01:12:10,714 --> 01:12:14,242
a preserve, and I've also
visited many Wolf preserves.

1055
01:12:14,386 --> 01:12:19,079
Are you able to communicate with the
Wolf? Am I going to have a conversation

1056
01:12:19,103 --> 01:12:23,670
with a Wolf in the way that I'm
communicating? You and I obviously not.

1057
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,530
Am I going to read their body
language, respond appropriately

1058
01:12:27,554 --> 01:12:30,740
to their behaviors and
their nonverbal cues? Yes.

1059
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:34,743
Would you be able to give
us an example of this Wolf

1060
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,250
communication? No, I'm
not comfortable doing so.

1061
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:38,742
Okay.

1062
01:12:38,816 --> 01:12:39,294
All right.

1063
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:43,362
How exactly have these ideas
become pervasive? First of

1064
01:12:43,386 --> 01:12:47,873
all, I think we need to remember
that in the west, at least,

1065
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:51,872
we have it drilled into our
minds from childhood onwards

1066
01:12:51,896 --> 01:12:56,378
that personal happiness is
the key to individual flourishing.

1067
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:58,966
Secondly, we think of ourselves in psychological terms.

1068
01:12:59,028 --> 01:13:00,266
I am my feelings.

1069
01:13:00,398 --> 01:13:04,634
And in order for me to be happy, I have to be able to express my feelings.

1070
01:13:04,682 --> 01:13:08,630
I have to be outwardly that which I feel myself to be inwardly.

1071
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,122
Thirdly, we're taught that interfering with somebody else's happiness is very bad.

1072
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:17,399
We need to acknowledge that
there are powerful lobby groups,

1073
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:20,940
powerful cultural and political
lobby groups driving this thing.

1074
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:26,558
Hollywood is pressing LGBTQ+ matters in so many movies.

1075
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:30,266
We're seeing it in the way Amazon sets up its algorithms.

1076
01:13:30,398 --> 01:13:33,718
There are all kinds of
factors in society that

1077
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:37,062
are pushing what would
really be numerically a

1078
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:40,406
fairly minority interest
into being one of the

1079
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,750
main political focal
points of this generation.

1080
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:49,950
After my operation, I will be a woman.

1081
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:54,746
Why can't she just be a lesbian? Because she's not a lesbian mom.

1082
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:56,006
She's a boy.

1083
01:13:56,188 --> 01:13:58,226
Because I was born in a girl's body.

1084
01:13:58,348 --> 01:14:04,455
Can I ask you a question? Why don't you kiss me? The
whole idea of social contagion, that there could be

1085
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,375
something in one social
environment that could play

1086
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:10,586
some role in somebody
coming out identifying as trans.

1087
01:14:10,648 --> 01:14:14,111
Would you say that that is
definitely part of your story?

1088
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:17,536
When I look back, I don't
think I would have ever even

1089
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,494
considered seeing myself as a
boy without these social aspects,

1090
01:14:21,518 --> 01:14:25,070
especially if I hadn't joined
these online communities.

1091
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,626
I identify as non binary.

1092
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:31,070
I'll officially be changing my pronouns to they/them.

1093
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,554
My pronouns are dem and demon/demonself.

1094
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:37,094
I've been going by they/them pronouns for four years now.

1095
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:40,506
I'm pretty comfortable with them.

1096
01:14:40,578 --> 01:14:44,414
There was literally a period of a few weeks to a few months.

1097
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:46,709
I started out as an
ally, and then eventually

1098
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,930
I was starting to
identify as transgender.

1099
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,118
We are transmodels.

1100
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:53,020
So they go on the Internet
and they're told that all

1101
01:14:53,044 --> 01:14:55,910
their problems will be
solved if they become a man.

1102
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,414
Kids are being taught.

1103
01:14:57,522 --> 01:15:00,422
You might feel like you're
a boy, even if you have a

1104
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:03,746
vagina and you're a girl,
you are what you feel you are.

1105
01:15:03,808 --> 01:15:06,702
Some people are girls, some are boys, some are both, some are neither.

1106
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:10,626
Gender is all about how we feel on the inside and how we express ourselves.

1107
01:15:10,758 --> 01:15:12,546
Ah, the gender fluid teacher.

1108
01:15:12,618 --> 01:15:15,810
What do I go by in the classroom? I go by teacher fan BRAINI.

1109
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,961
As a queer and trans
teacher, my agenda is to

1110
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:20,314
show little boys that
they don't have to be like

1111
01:15:20,338 --> 01:15:22,692
a steriotypically masculine,
that they can like paint

1112
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:25,070
their nails and wear
earrings and like still be a guy.

1113
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,186
And like it can be cool.

1114
01:15:26,248 --> 01:15:31,228
Do you worry that there could be
a sort of social contagion element of

1115
01:15:31,252 --> 01:15:36,810
this? A teeny tiny bit, maybe? Looking
back on it, it was the same pattern.

1116
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:41,562
Just kids who were really struggling, kids who were very alone and isolated.

1117
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:42,750
They have anxiety.

1118
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:44,598
They don't fit in with their peers.

1119
01:15:44,754 --> 01:15:46,926
They don't know where they belong.

1120
01:15:47,058 --> 01:15:49,670
Maybe they didn't have a welcoming family life.

1121
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,346
They just got caught up in these communities online.

1122
01:15:52,468 --> 01:15:57,398
Then they discover, hey, there's this group of people and they also don't fit in.

1123
01:15:57,424 --> 01:15:57,962
They're different.

1124
01:15:58,036 --> 01:15:59,462
They're not sure who they are.

1125
01:15:59,536 --> 01:16:01,322
Gee, that's where I fit in.

1126
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:04,254
Today is the day before my top surgery.

1127
01:16:04,362 --> 01:16:06,158
I am waking up tomorrow at 05:00 A.m.

1128
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:08,430
To have a subcutaneous mastectomy.

1129
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:12,520
We're telling children when
they haven't fully developed that

1130
01:16:12,544 --> 01:16:16,514
all you have to do is medically
transition and you fit in.

1131
01:16:16,612 --> 01:16:18,350
I was one of those kids.

1132
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,510
It got me at 42.

1133
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,860
Your child doesn't have a chance.

1134
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:30,310
This is only going in one direction.
You will respect us.

1135
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:40,106
As parents come to understand more about gender identity.

1136
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,086
Kids are coming out at younger ages.

1137
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:43,226
It's exciting.

1138
01:16:43,418 --> 01:16:46,922
And you know who gets it right is this next generation.

1139
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:51,121
The next generation who's
already telling us that our antiquated

1140
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:55,200
ideas of things have to be a
certain way just don't apply to them.

1141
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,438
They're rejecting a lot of our social mores.

1142
01:16:59,534 --> 01:17:00,960
They are tweaking the system.

1143
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:09,878
I just don't think it's realistic to put this decision on them.

1144
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:27,990
I'm a physician and I use medication.

1145
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,806
Certainly.

1146
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:30,958
It's a bit of a Faustian bargain.

1147
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:34,410
Puberty blockers, which are completely reversible.

1148
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:41,354
You keep invoking the word truth, which is condescending,

1149
01:17:41,402 --> 01:17:45,790
and rude. Some women have penises, right? Some men have vaginas.

1150
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:50,557
Does the chicken cry? Does
a chicken commit suicide?

1151
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:54,000
I'm not a woman, so I
can't really answer that.

1152
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:56,820
I guess because I got a dick.

1153
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,070
Somehow this madness has affected our entire society.

1154
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:22,520
Am I the crazy one? I'm done asking questions.

1155
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:31,898
Tanner Cross is on administrative leave for what he said about gender identity.

1156
01:18:31,994 --> 01:18:35,990
He said he would not call a student who is transgender by their preferred pronoun.

1157
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:40,161
I can't lie to children, and I got to
also represent a whole community that

1158
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:44,686
believes in biological facts and scientific
facts, and I can't do that to kids.

1159
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:46,462
You get into teaching because you love kids.

1160
01:18:46,536 --> 01:18:51,502
This policy started coming into play and I was like, wait a minute, it's causing me,

1161
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:54,610
I'm going to have to lie to my kids the ones I've always wanted to protect.

1162
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,933
Do we have assaults in our bathrooms
and our locker rooms regularly? To my

1163
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:05,170
knowledge, we don't have any records
of assaults occurring in our restroom.

1164
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:14,342
The predator transgender student is, or person,

1165
01:19:14,536 --> 01:19:16,314
simply, it does not exist.

1166
01:19:16,422 --> 01:19:19,837
The Virginia Department of Education
says it is now reviewing whether the

1167
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:23,562
Loudoun County School District has
properly reported cases of sexual assault.

1168
01:19:23,586 --> 01:19:27,397
This comes after a 15 year old was
charged on two separate occasions

1169
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:30,890
for assaulting two different
students at different schools.

1170
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:36,546
Dozens rallying Center Loudoun County to protest the school's policies.

1171
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:38,904
So that includes limiting
who can talk during

1172
01:19:38,928 --> 01:19:41,214
public comment portions
of board meetings.

1173
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:44,390
One speaker leased property in the area just so he could speak.

1174
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,682
Tonight, Fox Five Paris Jones is live with the details.

1175
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:48,194
That's right.

1176
01:19:48,232 --> 01:19:51,649
Conservative commentator
Matt Wallace told me he's leasing

1177
01:19:51,673 --> 01:19:55,090
out someone's basement in
Loudoun County so he'd be able

1178
01:19:55,114 --> 01:19:58,558
to speak during tonight's
meeting, I decided last week to

1179
01:19:58,582 --> 01:20:02,334
fulfill my lifelong dream of
being a Loudoun County resident.

1180
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:05,454
I've always felt like I lived in Tennessee.

1181
01:20:05,502 --> 01:20:08,946
I felt sort of like a Virginian trapped in a Tennessee.

1182
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:12,482
In his body, I identified sort of state fluid, I guess.

1183
01:20:12,556 --> 01:20:14,202
This is Matt Wall, she tweeted.

1184
01:20:14,286 --> 01:20:18,505
How do you do, fellow Virginians?

1185
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:23,150
Now I just got to explained to my wife and kids that
we're going to be staying in someone's basement.

1186
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,066
They tried to muzzle me by
not allowing me to speak, and

1187
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:36,390
when that didn't work, they
tried to muzzle me with a mask.

1188
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,814
I would thank you all
for allowing me to speak

1189
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:42,502
to you tonight, but
you tried not to allow it.

1190
01:20:42,516 --> 01:20:43,560
Yet here I am.

1191
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,482
Now, you only give us 60 seconds.

1192
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:46,774
So let me get to the point.

1193
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:48,698
You are all child abusers.

1194
01:20:48,854 --> 01:20:51,466
You prey upon impressionable
children and indoctrinate

1195
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,804
them into your insane
ideological cult, a cult

1196
01:20:53,828 --> 01:20:56,516
which holds many fanatical
views, but none so deranged

1197
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:59,126
as the idea that boys
are girls and girls or boys.

1198
01:20:59,318 --> 01:21:01,717
By imposing this vile
nonsense on students to the

1199
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:04,541
point even of forcing young
girls to share locker rooms

1200
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:07,341
with boys, you deprive these
kids of safety and Privacy

1201
01:21:07,365 --> 01:21:10,090
and something more
fundamental, too, which is truth.

1202
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:13,730
If education is not grounded in truth, then it is worthless.

1203
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,398
Worse, it is poison.

1204
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:16,946
You are poison.

1205
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,506
You are predators.

1206
01:21:18,638 --> 01:21:20,386
I can see why you try to stop us from speaking.

1207
01:21:20,448 --> 01:21:22,526
You know that your ideas are indefensible.

1208
01:21:22,718 --> 01:21:25,766
You silence the opposing side because you have no argument.

1209
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:28,515
You can only hide under
your beds like pathetic

1210
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:31,654
little gutless cowards, hoping
we shut up and go away.

1211
01:21:31,692 --> 01:21:35,580
But we won't, I promise you that.

1212
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:51,210
Johnny is a boy with a big imagination.

1213
01:21:53,090 --> 01:22:01,874
One day he's a dog, the next day a crustacean. Johnny's mom loves her son's

1214
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:08,680
make believe time. You're Johnny the Walrus till you change your mind.

1215
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,154
Matt Walsh is out with a new children's book.

1216
01:22:13,192 --> 01:22:15,450
The book is called Johnny the Walrus.

1217
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:20,174
What is this about? It's sold out on Amazon in a few hours.

1218
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:24,018
I have embraced my true calling as a children's author, hence the cardigan.

1219
01:22:24,054 --> 01:22:28,422
The book is about a little boy who is very imaginative and playful.

1220
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:31,447
I have four kids and they all
have an imagination and he likes to

1221
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:34,758
pretend to be different things, and
one day he pretends to be a walrus.

1222
01:22:34,914 --> 01:22:39,174
And unfortunately, his mother is very progressive and thus confused.

1223
01:22:39,222 --> 01:22:43,174
And so she's convinced by the
Internet and by society that if your

1224
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,150
child is identifying as something,
then he really is that thing.

1225
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,603
And so she tries to raise
her child as a walrus, as

1226
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:53,970
a sort of trans walrus,
respecting his self identity.

1227
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:58,113
One morning he came downstairs
barking and clapping wood spoons

1228
01:22:58,137 --> 01:23:02,022
for tusks and sock fins a-flapping.
It's spoons in his mouth,

1229
01:23:02,046 --> 01:23:03,590
he's pretending to be a walrus.

1230
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:07,770
I'm Johnny the Walrus, he said with a roar.

1231
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:10,790
Johnny the Walrus.

1232
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,774
This is a hot topic.

1233
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:22,050
That's a good thing, right? Yeah, absolutely.

1234
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,938
It's good for us to have these conversations.

1235
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:27,370
People open their minds and relearn and unlearn to what we've been taught.

1236
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:31,040
So I want this to be a safe place to talk about and learn.

1237
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:36,610
As you can see, there's an ongoing evolution of language and how people can identify.

1238
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:40,182
My next guest, author and
conservative host of Daily Wire's

1239
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:43,454
The Matt Walsh Show,
talking about his recently

1240
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:46,692
published children's
book that has since been

1241
01:23:46,716 --> 01:23:49,930
removed online by a
popular large retail chain.

1242
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:57,210
Now, Matt says gender is not a social construct, but rooted firmly in biology.

1243
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:58,818
True, true.

1244
01:23:58,904 --> 01:24:00,841
As human beings,
we have a sex, male or

1245
01:24:00,865 --> 01:24:03,366
female, but it's a
biological, scientific fact.

1246
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:05,722
Now, gender is a linguistic term.

1247
01:24:05,866 --> 01:24:06,934
Words have gender.

1248
01:24:06,982 --> 01:24:09,473
People don't you can have
whatever self perception

1249
01:24:09,497 --> 01:24:11,631
you want, but you
can't expect me to take

1250
01:24:11,655 --> 01:24:14,173
part in that self
perception or to take part in

1251
01:24:14,197 --> 01:24:16,714
this kind of charade,
this theatrical production.

1252
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:19,234
You don't get your own
pronouns, just like you don't

1253
01:24:19,258 --> 01:24:21,610
get your own prepositions
or your own adjectives.

1254
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:26,638
It's like if I were to tell you my adjectives are handsome and brilliant.

1255
01:24:26,674 --> 01:24:29,236
And whatever you're talking
about me, you have to describe

1256
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,822
me as handsome and brilliant
because that's how I identify.

1257
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:35,922
So you think it's a delusion? Well, this
is one of the problems with this left wing

1258
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,106
gender ideology is that
no one who espouses

1259
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:40,290
it can even tell you
what these words means.

1260
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:44,854
Like what is a woman? Can you tell me what a woman is? No, I can't.

1261
01:24:45,022 --> 01:24:47,914
Womanhood is something that is an umbrella term.

1262
01:24:48,022 --> 01:24:53,374
It includes people that describes what people who identify as a woman.

1263
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,180
What is that? What's to each their own.

1264
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,304
Each man, each person is
going to have a different relation

1265
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,882
with their own gender
identity and define it differently.

1266
01:25:01,966 --> 01:25:02,934
You want to reduce women.

1267
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,979
You want to reduce
men down to maybe just

1268
01:25:05,003 --> 01:25:07,414
their genetics, our
genitals, our chromosomes.

1269
01:25:07,462 --> 01:25:09,066
Right? That's what you want to do.

1270
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,614
What you want to do is appropriate woman.

1271
01:25:11,722 --> 01:25:14,146
You want to appropriate
womanhood and turn it

1272
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:16,594
into basically a costume
that could be worn.

1273
01:25:16,702 --> 01:25:18,486
Joining us on stage is doctor

1274
01:25:18,548 --> 01:25:22,126
Susie Denbo, associate professor at Kent State University.

1275
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:26,267
Doctor Denbo, how do you feel
those who oppose using pronouns are

1276
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:30,359
taking the wrong approach in this conversation?

1277
01:25:30,383 --> 01:25:34,541
There's the extreme approach that you are
admittedly taking, and then there's also just

1278
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:39,102
ordinary people that might not be
comfortable with the language change.

1279
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,386
She began by saying that my view is extreme.

1280
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:41,658
Okay.

1281
01:25:41,684 --> 01:25:44,079
So the view that every
single person on Earth

1282
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:46,498
has held up until 15
seconds ago is extreme.

1283
01:25:46,594 --> 01:25:49,912
They are conflating gender and sex
because on one hand, they say, well, you

1284
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,254
got your biological sex, but then
your gender is whatever social construct.

1285
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:56,346
But then they turn around and say that trans women are women.

1286
01:25:56,528 --> 01:25:59,304
So a man who identifies
with the gender, the

1287
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:02,557
social construct of
womanhood actually is a woman

1288
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:05,518
part of me wants to ask
why you care so much,

1289
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:08,480
because it's really
not that big of a deal.

1290
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,158
I care about the truth.

1291
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:12,682
So basic truth matters.

1292
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:14,722
I want to live in a society where people care about the truth.

1293
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:18,968
I care about children, and
these insane ideas about gender

1294
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:23,154
are being foisted on kids,
and that bothers me quite a bit.

1295
01:26:23,252 --> 01:26:26,790
I care about the women who are having their opportunities stolen from them.

1296
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,618
I care quite a bit.

1297
01:26:27,644 --> 01:26:27,870
Yeah.

1298
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,646
I wanted us to have a safe place to be able to talk about this.

1299
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:36,112
And it seems like we
should just keep the dialogue

1300
01:26:36,136 --> 01:26:39,330
going and hopefully
find some middle ground.

1301
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:21,108
What do you say to parents?
A parent comes to you and

1302
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:24,590
says, My eight year old
son is telling me he's a girl.

1303
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,289
Great, you're going to have him do an
experimental procedure that creates the most

1304
01:27:29,313 --> 01:27:33,786
suicidal ideation of any other population
seven to ten years after transition.

1305
01:27:33,918 --> 01:27:35,790
And here's what I tell parents.

1306
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:42,746
You don't have the right to medically transition your child.

1307
01:27:42,868 --> 01:27:47,102
We have no research on long term hormone use.

1308
01:27:47,176 --> 01:27:51,206
We will be seeing the first generation of long term hormone use.

1309
01:27:51,388 --> 01:27:53,877
And we already know,
at least with ten years

1310
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,390
of hormones, you're
giving yourself cancer.

1311
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,749
What's your message to parents
who are trying to cope with this?

1312
01:27:59,773 --> 01:28:02,598
The first thing is to tell
parents that they're not alone.

1313
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:06,518
It is our responsibility as a parent to be the front line defense for our children.

1314
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:09,191
And I know with my child,
a lot of people will say,

1315
01:28:09,215 --> 01:28:11,801
Was it worth it because
you now seemingly have lost

1316
01:28:11,825 --> 01:28:14,490
your child? And I'll say,
yeah, but at least I saved

1317
01:28:14,514 --> 01:28:17,022
my conscience and my
morals and my convictions.

1318
01:28:17,106 --> 01:28:21,254
And when my child turns 25 and says, dad, where were you? I'll say, I was there.

1319
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,754
I was fighting as hard as I could.

1320
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:24,760
I was not prepared to let this happen.

1321
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:37,653
Does this really matters is another
question, so...

1322
01:28:37,677 --> 01:28:42,250
Matters for those who are getting double
mastectomies when they're 16.

1323
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:45,378
Why should we care if
we live in a society where

1324
01:28:45,402 --> 01:28:48,620
gender is? Well, I care
because my government decided

1325
01:28:48,644 --> 01:28:51,539
that I had to call people
by the terms that they

1326
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:54,458
designated or I'd be
subject to legal penalties.

1327
01:28:54,614 --> 01:28:58,740
It's like, no, I'm not doing that.

1328
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:01,380
I don't care what your reason is.

1329
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,962
You don't get control of my tongue.

1330
01:29:04,106 --> 01:29:08,970
We live in a climate now in which no one
seems to care about the safety of women and

1331
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:13,858
girls who are going through a very
developmentally challenging time in their lives.

1332
01:29:14,004 --> 01:29:16,994
They may not want to share spaces with their male peers.

1333
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,038
I would not be surprised.

1334
01:29:18,074 --> 01:29:21,566
In a few years, there will no longer be women's sports.

1335
01:29:21,698 --> 01:29:25,550
It will literally be men's sports and transgender sports.

1336
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:29,086
The question being asked by the trans person is a legitimate one.

1337
01:29:29,148 --> 01:29:33,625
How can I be happy? The answer being
given by having my body transformed

1338
01:29:33,649 --> 01:29:38,125
to look like the other gender, by
having myself pumped full of hormones

1339
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:42,626
clearly isn't working, and we have
to find a better and the more humane

1340
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:47,126
way of dealing with individuals who
are struggling with gender dysphoria.

1341
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:54,146
I have the utmost compassion for people who suffer from gender dysphoria.

1342
01:29:54,218 --> 01:29:57,782
It's a nightmare for them and their families.

1343
01:29:57,926 --> 01:30:01,342
The vast majority, up to 90% of kids.

1344
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:05,278
If they go through a normal puberty, they're going to be okay.

1345
01:30:05,424 --> 01:30:09,728
They will be at peace with their
bodies, and they will have avoided

1346
01:30:09,752 --> 01:30:13,990
dangerous and experimental
medical interventions and surgeries.

1347
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:18,273
Maybe we're up against a
battle here, up against a hill

1348
01:30:18,297 --> 01:30:22,020
that perhaps we're not
going to necessarily win today.

1349
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:26,700
But if we don't pave the way for a win, we'll never get there.

1350
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,770
So we're going on this journey.

1351
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,478
Boys can be girls.

1352
01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:33,606
Girls can be boys.

1353
01:30:33,738 --> 01:30:34,514
Men can be women.

1354
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:35,620
Women can be men.

1355
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:41,604
It makes me wonder, what is a woman?
What is a woman? A woman is someone

1356
01:30:41,628 --> 01:30:47,282
who claims that as their identity, it
could be many things to many people.

1357
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:54,693
I think the question really brings up the fact
that it is pretty relative, right? That if you ask

1358
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:58,611
women across race, across
identities, across class,

1359
01:30:58,635 --> 01:31:02,450
across culture, you will
get a different answer.

1360
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,738
Some of it is based on biology, some of it is based on hormones.

1361
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:11,282
Some of it is based on what you wear and how you present yourself.

1362
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:13,202
A woman is not anything in particular.

1363
01:31:13,336 --> 01:31:14,894
There's no one particular thing.

1364
01:31:14,992 --> 01:31:16,898
There is not one particular thing.

1365
01:31:17,044 --> 01:31:22,062
A woman is someone who says that she is a woman and transitions to be a woman.

1366
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:28,703
Who says that she's what?
Can you define the word woman without

1367
01:31:28,727 --> 01:31:41,200
using the word woman? Well that's actually
kind of like, it's a curious question, um, but I...

1368
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,624
We've been journeying
across the country asking

1369
01:31:45,648 --> 01:31:48,420
people this question, and
almost nobody can answer it.

1370
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:53,220
What is a woman? What is a woman? Marry one and find out.

1371
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,998
So I should go home and ask my wife, I guess.

1372
01:31:57,084 --> 01:31:57,720
Yeah.

1373
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:11,020
I mean, to ask you something.

1374
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:11,657
Can you provide a definition
for the word woman?

1375
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:16,330
Can I provide a
definition? Yeah, I can't.

1376
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:21,602
You can't? Not in this context.

1377
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:24,999
I'm not a biologist... So meaning
of the word woman is so unclear

1378
01:33:25,023 --> 01:33:28,810
and controversial that you
can't give me a definition?

1379
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:36,314
Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes.

1380
01:33:36,422 --> 01:33:42,116
If there's a dispute about a
definition, people make arguments and I

1381
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:48,261
look at the law and I decide, so I'm not...
The fact that you can't give me a straight

1382
01:33:48,285 --> 01:33:54,490
answer about something as fundamental
as what a woman is underscores the

1383
01:33:54,514 --> 01:34:00,720
dangers of the kind of progressive
education that we are hearing about.

1384
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:05,031
Just last week, an entire
generation of young

1385
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:09,513
girls watched as our
taxpayer funded institutions

1386
01:34:09,537 --> 01:34:13,853
permitted a biological
man to compete and beat a

1387
01:34:13,877 --> 01:34:18,746
biological woman in the
NCAA swimming Championships.

1388
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:30,842
Senator.

1389
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:33,806
I'm not sure what message that sends.

1390
01:34:33,938 --> 01:34:37,200
If you're asking me about the legal issues related to it.

1391
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:42,218
Those are topics that are being hotly discussed.

1392
01:34:42,254 --> 01:34:44,870
As you say, you could come to the court.

1393
01:34:45,305 --> 01:35:45,580
