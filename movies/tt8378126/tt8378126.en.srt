3
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,894
- Hi, Mom.
- Why haven't you left yet?

4
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:52,810
- We don't know.
- Where's Dad?

5
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,727
He is inside.

6
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:00,685
Why haven't you left?

7
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:05,769
They called from
Stockholm, the police.

8
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,309
They want me to come up.

9
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,060
Why?

10
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,851
I don't know.

11
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,102
- I'll go with you.
- No. Stay with the girls.

12
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:28,185
- They can sleep over at...
- There's no need.

13
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:32,559
I think it's better if I go alone.
Rebecca will be there, too.

14
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:36,810
- Shall I drive you to the airport?
- I've called a taxi.

15
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:41,727
- Will you call me when you get there?
- Yes.

16
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:44,476
- Mom?
- Put your clothes on.

17
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:48,726
- There's someone in the bathroom.
- It's just someone from work.

18
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,352
- Did you find your shoes?
- No.

19
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,060
Find another pair, then.

20
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,809
I thought we had an agreement.

21
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:04,769
No, we had a discussion,
where we couldn't agree.

22
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:07,769
I don't bring my patients home.

23
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:11,643
Because they suffer
from all sorts of infectious diseases.

24
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:12,560
This is our home

25
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:15,727
and we can't have all sorts
of people roaming around here.

26
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,769
It's not 'all sorts of people'.
It's people that need help.

27
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:22,018
We're not discussing
if they need help or not -

28
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,727
- but if they should be here,
in our home.

29
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,769
- I don't want to do this.
- It won't work when Gustav moves in.

30
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,435
No.

31
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,102
Can't we have just one place where
the girls can be free of your work?

32
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:38,184
One single place where the girls
get to have their mom to themselves?

33
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:42,893
Letting real life into our home
won't harm them.

34
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:46,269
Why can't you ever say:
"Yes, Peter, I understand, Peter."?

35
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,851
Why does everything have to become
an endless discussion?

36
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:53,269
- Come on, honey...
- No. I can say what I feel and think.

37
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:58,519
Okay, Peter.
I understand, Peter.

38
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:02,143
- No, no, no...
- Yes, you're right, Peter.

39
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:05,893
I'm so lucky.
You know that, right?

40
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,601
Yes, I know.

41
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:18,727
Did you drink any alcohol that night?

42
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:23,059
- Yes.
- How much did you have?

43
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,351
Two or three drinks.

44
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,393
- Two or three?
- Three.

45
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:33,726
How many men have you been
dating in the past year?

46
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:41,185
- Less than 10? More than 10?
- Less than 10.

47
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:47,019
And how many of them
did you have intercourse with?

48
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:55,268
Listen, you should be prepared for
the defense coming down hard on you.

49
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,518
They want to create an image
of a woman who asked for it.

50
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:07,518
So, how many?

51
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:11,018
- Seven, I think.
- You think?

52
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:14,351
No, I...
Seven.

53
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:17,018
Good.

54
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,685
You're going to do fine in court.

55
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,894
Do you think it's a lot?

56
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,935
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

57
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,102
Not at all.

58
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:39,934
The rabbit hole went straight on
like a tunnel for some way -

59
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,810
- and then it turned so suddenly,
that Alice did not have a moment -

60
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:49,309
- to think about stopping,
and she fell and fell down a well.

61
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:53,935
Either the well was very deep,
or Alice fell very slowly -

62
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,852
- for she had plenty of time
as she went down to look around -

63
00:06:56,934 --> 00:07:00,143
- and to wonder
what was going to happen next.

64
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,684
Mom?

65
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:09,602
Why can't I stay up
until Gustav arrives?

66
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,809
They'll be here very late.

67
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,644
I promise I won't tell Frida.

68
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:25,019
- He'll be here when you wake up.
- So are we his family now?

69
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,394
We always have been.

70
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,935
Then why hasn't
he been living with us?

71
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,977
He's been staying with Rebecca,
you know that.

72
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,394
- Why?
- Because she's his mom.

73
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,393
And he couldn't live
in two countries at once.

74
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:49,769
So Dad preferred to be with us?

75
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,102
It's not that simple, pumpkin.

76
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:56,269
- No more thinking. Time to sleep.
- Okay.

77
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,019
- Night-night.
- Night.

78
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,643
Hello.

79
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,602
Hi!
That was early.

80
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,684
- Welcome, Gustav.
- Thanks.

81
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,851
It's good to see you.

82
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:36,809
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Sure.

83
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,935
I made the key chain
for your new key.

84
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,602
I made the drawings.
You like them?

85
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:10,768
- Thank you.
- I made the wooden heart out of wood.

86
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:15,477
We have this workshop at school
with a machine to cut...

87
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,059
Go sit down, you two.

88
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:24,935
Dad, can you pick us up today?

89
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:28,643
No, Mom will pick you up.
I have stuff to do with Gustav.

90
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:33,476
- Can I come?
- No, it's just him and me.

91
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,934
That's not fair.

92
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,727
I know. The world isn't fair.

93
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,351
Frida, go sit on your chair.

94
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:46,685
- I wanna sit with Daddy.
- Come on, you're a big girl.

95
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,976
I thought we could buy some things
for your room today.

96
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,352
Sure. If you want to.

97
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:02,977
I thought maybe you'd like
to make it more your own.

98
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
Sure.

99
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:10,018
- Will you take this?
- Yes.

100
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:21,601
- I didn't think he wanted to see you.
- Nah...

101
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,977
He's been kicked out of school again.

102
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,644
Rebecca wanted him
off to boarding school.

103
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,434
We talked her into letting him -

104
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:32,269
- finish school down here instead.
He's starting after the summer break.

105
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:36,519
- Does he even understand Danish?
- It's almost the same as Swedish.

106
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,351
Either way he's
against the very idea.

107
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:40,434
You can't
blame him for that.

108
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:45,144
- He left all his friends and stuff.
- But it's not going to be forever.

109
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:48,726
I hope he'll move out again
at some point.

110
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,894
But still.

111
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,976
- How does Peter feel about it?
- He's looking forward to it.

112
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,352
But of course he's
a little anxious too.

113
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:03,519
I think it'll be
good for both of them.

114
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,351
Sure.

115
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,184
How's Mom doing these days?

116
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:13,810
She's been in the hospital again,
something with her lungs.

117
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:21,394
I'm sure a visit from you
would cheer her up.

118
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,644
Yeah...

119
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:46,852
It's completely unacceptable
that you drag out the case like this.

120
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:50,269
Yes, and I think you'll
agree that it's ridiculous,

121
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:51,477
if you give it a thought.

122
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:01,101
Sure.

123
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,143
Good.

124
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:08,518
You just call me anytime.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

125
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,477
Hey.

126
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:45,810
Sorry. I didn't know you were home.

127
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:49,559
I was just bringing some of your stuff
down and...

128
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,726
Thank you.

129
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,393
Is it any good?

130
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,560
What's it about?

131
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,976
- A man.
- Okay.

132
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:14,560
- Just a man?
- Yes.

133
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,351
Alrighty then.

134
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:54,935
- Sorry. I know it's really late.
- Did something happen?

135
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:58,102
I don't think it'll work out.

136
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:03,101
I know it's tough. But I will be
right beside you the whole time.

137
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:06,060
I can't do it.

138
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,519
I just can't.

139
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:15,019
I don't blame you for
just wanting to let it all go.

140
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,727
But you're not just doing it for you.

141
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:26,059
You're also doing it for
all the other girls out there.

142
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,684
I just wish I hadn't started all this.

143
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,060
- What are you afraid of?
- That they won't believe me.

144
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,643
I completely understand your concern.

145
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:43,269
And maybe he won't be convicted.

146
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:50,768
But if you don't testify,
you're the one that lets him off.

147
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:01,644
And I think you'll regret that.

148
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,894
Let me take that for you.

149
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:19,393
- Who showers first?
- Well, you went first last time.

150
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:22,268
Yeah, because the horse threw me off.

151
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:26,144
- Come on, your helmet, please.
- But that's not a good reason.

152
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:32,144
- I was really filthy.
- Yeah, well, today I smell the most.

153
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:35,560
Easy now, you both smell a lot.

154
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,184
We'll have to flip a coin, then.

155
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:49,435
I can't live in Sweden,
and I can't live here.

156
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:54,434
You're not old enough.
When you are, you can do as you like.

157
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,810
- That's a bad excuse.
- You're still a minor.

158
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,893
And until you're old enough,
Mom and I decide what's best for you.

159
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:03,644
- "Mom and you"?!
- Listen to me!

160
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,769
We don't think you're mature enough
to move out on your own.

161
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:10,019
- Because you and Mom are talking now?
- I won't debate this any longer.

162
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,102
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out!

163
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,727
Damn it!

164
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:44,769
It's like we don't
even know each other.

165
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:50,559
It's the first time you live together.
It takes time to find each other.

166
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:54,227
- I have no clue who he is.
- It'll come.

167
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,851
I don't know. Maybe it was
wrong of us to bring him here.

168
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,059
Maybe a boarding school would've been
better for him.

169
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:10,685
- You know that's not right for him.
- But he doesn't want to be here!

170
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:15,768
- I can feel it. He hates me.
- Of course he does, you're his dad.

171
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:19,601
You'll just have to endure it.
You're the adult.

172
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:27,018
Rebecca has been giving
him a free pass for far too long.

173
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,434
Because she's so self-absorbed
and then she gives up.

174
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,934
And then he spins out of control,
and I'm left alone with all the mess.

175
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:39,060
That's not fair. Who was left
with the mess when you just took off?

176
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,643
When did you become Rebecca's ally?

177
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm just saying she's been
handling him all on her own.

178
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:59,685
- But I wasn't allowed to help...
- Well, now you are.

179
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:05,977
It might be too late.

180
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,768
Maybe we should start demanding
something of him.

181
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,935
Right now, this place
is like a hotel to him.

182
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,894
I don't think that's very healthy.

183
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:17,559
We should involve him more.

184
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:25,934
Hello?

185
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,477
Yes.

186
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:37,685
No, no. I'll come in.
Absolutely. Bye.

187
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:51,143
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

188
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,644
Wait...

189
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:16,976
Just wait a second.

190
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,019
You did really well.

191
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:25,809
- I feel so stupid.
- Yes, but it's not your fault.

192
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:29,435
They didn't believe me.
And I told you that would be the case.

193
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,269
- Yes.
- Yes.

194
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,768
Are you having fun?

195
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:10,852
I'll call you right back.
Okay. Bye.

196
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:15,893
Does it feel real good?

197
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:30,435
An iPad, my bag,
your collection of watches, jewelry...

198
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:35,601
I'm not sure what more
is missing exactly.

199
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:39,684
Yes, I've called the police.
They're on their way.

200
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,602
Hang on.

201
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:45,684
Gustav, check your room.
We've had a break-in.

202
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,227
Okay.

203
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,435
Yeah...

204
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:56,477
No, luckily they're at riding class.

205
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,935
Good. Yeah, see you later.
Bye.

206
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,726
I didn't accuse exactly, I insinuated.

207
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,602
You approached a defendant
in a parking lot.

208
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:16,893
My client was being bullied in court,
and the defendant was having a ball.

209
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:19,810
If the Bar Association
believes him,

210
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,769
it's not over with
just paying the fine.

211
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,768
- They may require it publicized.
- I'll pay.

212
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:29,769
It's not about the money!
It's unprofessional. Don't you see?

213
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:35,851
- Why do you care what people think?
- Well, this is sort of my company, too.

214
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:40,519
Yes, but when we became partners,
you knew what you were in for.

215
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:45,934
You know me! You know what I'm like!
When did you become such a chicken?

216
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:49,393
Can't you just for once
admit you made a mistake?

217
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:54,101
- Come on...
- You must learn to control yourself.

218
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,644
- Yes.
- Yes.

219
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,977
I found this.

220
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,060
- I believe it's yours?
- Yes, thanks.

221
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:39,727
It's just that I found it
out in the driveway a while back.

222
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,310
And then I put it in my bag,
but I forgot to give it to you -

223
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:49,559
- and then my bag was stolen
in the break-in.

224
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:00,768
And then today I found it in your
pants when I was doing laundry.

225
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,309
You go through my stuff?

226
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:07,268
It's pretty advanced to break into
your own home, Gustav.

227
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:12,351
- What are you talking about now?
- Where's all the stuff you've stolen?

228
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:20,185
Are you kidding?

229
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,976
You'll have to tell Peter.

230
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:30,394
And then we can go
to the police later and explain.

231
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,976
Or I can tell him, if you prefer.

232
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,352
- Do what the hell you want.
- I doubt you mean that.

233
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:48,102
- You don't know me!
- No. But I know the system.

234
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,768
And I know it's tough to get out
once you get in.

235
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:52,393
Especially for
someone like you who

236
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,977
already has experience with the police.

237
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:01,102
But there is also another option.

238
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,809
And that is not telling anyone.

239
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:11,059
But that requires that you
lean into the family and step up.

240
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:15,851
I don't know
if you're capable of doing that?

241
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,226
So you have a decision to make.

242
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:15,351
What is your favourite dish?

243
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:21,059
- I only get to choose one thing?
- Of course.

244
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,144
Okay, chicken curry.

245
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:25,851
What is your favourite animal?

246
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:32,893
I've got rabbit, dog and horse,
but I can only choose one thing.

247
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:37,685
- So I choose dog.
- Nice.

248
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:44,144
- What's up with the tape recorder?
- It's my old one.

249
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,019
He found it in the basement.
I don't know what he's up to.

250
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:53,894
- Lucas now wants a brother, too.
- Go on then and have more kids, Lina.

251
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:58,684
Go on then and hook me up with a hot
young doctor from the hospital, Peter.

252
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,518
They're all sold out at the moment,
but I can get you an old doctor.

253
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,101
You know, a guy with lots of ear hair.

254
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,851
What would you bring?

255
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:14,018
Okay, my blanket.

256
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:41,893
Hi!

257
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:49,851
Hey. Sorry, we...

258
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,518
- This is Amanda.
- Hi.

259
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,602
This is my stepmom.

260
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,643
- Hi.
- Hi.

261
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:02,560
- Amanda. Hi.
- Anne. Hi.

262
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:05,018
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

263
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:13,269
- Have you been out?
- I guess you could say that.

264
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:17,685
We've just been hanging out
a little, you know...

265
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:24,435
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you were up and...

266
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,310
No, no, I was just working.

267
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:32,101
Okay, then. Hello and goodbye.
We don't want to disturb you, so...

268
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:31,393
- And then what do you do?
- I throw the chair at the window.

269
00:31:31,477 --> 00:31:35,102
- Why?
- I want to get out of there.

270
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,851
So why don't you
just open the window?

271
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:38,851
It's bolted.

272
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:42,685
- Why not use the door then?
- It's locked.

273
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,184
So, your foster parents
have bolted the window

274
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,726
and locked the door, correct?

275
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,351
Yes.

276
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:59,769
What do you do then, when your foster
father eventually opens the door?

277
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,727
I accidentally push him.

278
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,684
Why do you do that?

279
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:15,269
I just want to get away from there.

280
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:22,852
Thank you.

281
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,644
- That was late.
- I had to prepare stuff for tomorrow.

282
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,226
- I'm not quite finished here.
- Are you sure?

283
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:50,518
I just had a breakthrough on the
article I have promised to write.

284
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,602
You can finish it
during the weekend.

285
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:55,602
I can't, I'm going
on a conference.

286
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,768
- You are?
- It's in the calendar.

287
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,184
Oh, I didn't notice.

288
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:42,518
Look at this.
Let me just rinse it.

289
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:53,185
I found something!
A shell!

290
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:56,143
- No, it was just a twig.
- There!

291
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,185
- There, there, there!
- What did you find?

292
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:10,934
- Aren't you going to swim?
- No, I have stuff to do.

293
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,060
Boring.

294
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,393
Let's see what we can find.

295
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:25,726
- Look for the white shells.
- And clams!

296
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:42,394
- Are you going for a swim?
- Yes, I thought I would.

297
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,477
You never go swimming.

298
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,893
Is she completely out?

299
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,560
Do you miss Stockholm?

300
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:03,269
Yes... and no.

301
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:15,476
Feel free to invite people
to come and visit, if you like.

302
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:22,184
I don't have that many friends.

303
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,559
Right.

304
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,269
Me neither.

305
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,184
Where do you get those done?

306
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,685
- These?
- Yes.

307
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:04,268
Here and there.
I know someone who knows someone...

308
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:08,894
- I did these myself.
- I didn't know people still do that.

309
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:12,684
Sure.

310
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,851
It's easy.

311
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,560
- I can make one on you.
- No. I'm not having any.

312
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:24,851
- Why not?
- I'm just not.

313
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:29,102
It's just skin.

314
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:33,810
If I wanted a tattoo,
I could've gotten one a long time ago.

315
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:36,059
No.

316
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:41,851
Can I take a look at your arm?

317
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,601
Can I see your arm?

318
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:54,185
Yes, perfect. Right here.
A tiny one.

319
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,685
No. Not there.

320
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,059
- Okay. Where then?
- Nowhere!

321
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:07,060
A bit higher up. Hang on.
Right there.

322
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,060
The world's smallest tattoo.

323
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,768
Forget it.

324
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,102
Where, did you say?

325
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:00,518
- Do you like it?
- Mm.

326
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:09,685
Thanks.

327
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:21,477
- That was that.
- That was that.

328
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,101
I'll just take this out.

329
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,852
Argh, damn it...

330
00:40:58,268 --> 00:41:03,059
Anyway, we're talking
thousands of dead toads by this lake.

331
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,685
And they've all exploded.

332
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:06,977
Caused by an
explosion down the lake?

333
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,184
- No.
- No. Listen instead.

334
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:15,143
- I am!
- First, they suspected a virus.

335
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:21,435
Coming from some South American
horses at the nearby riding school.

336
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,893
But then a biologist took a look
into it and discovered -

337
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:29,684
- that on the back of each toad
there was a tiny, tiny hole -

338
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:33,101
- and that all the toads
were missing their liver.

339
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,101
- So it was simply a toad massacre?
- The liver was ejected from the body?

340
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:42,352
No, it wasn't ejected.
It was taken out.

341
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:45,935
- By whom?
- Is it a delicacy?

342
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:50,560
- Who'd want to eat that?
- Birds, maybe?

343
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:53,102
Exactly. A bird.

344
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:56,310
- Am I right?
- But which bird?

345
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:59,644
- It's not just any bird...
- It must be a very...

346
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,185
Alright!

347
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:04,185
A crow!

348
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:01,893
- Hey.
- Hey.

349
00:44:01,977 --> 00:44:04,519
Are you okay?

350
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:06,477
Sure.

351
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:14,852
- Want to come up and say hi?
- I'd rather not, if that's okay.

352
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,184
Sure, I don't blame you.

353
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:23,685
Where are you off to?
If you don't mind me asking.

354
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:26,394
I'm going out for cigarettes.

355
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:34,185
Would you like to come?

356
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:39,352
If you don't mind me asking.
It's going to be a lot of fun.

357
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:40,852
Yes.

358
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:50,518
Are you kidding?
You have people over!

359
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:52,226
Yeah.

360
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:03,809
How are things with Amanda?

361
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:09,394
What? Isn't that her name?
Anita? Amalie?

362
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:11,934
- Anna? Anthony?
- No.

363
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:13,934
Her name is Amanda.

364
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:19,435
It was just... the way you said it.

365
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:21,352
Is she nice?

366
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,852
Yes, she's nice.

367
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:31,519
She's very nice.

368
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:33,934
So, is she your girlfriend or what?

369
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:38,685
What does 'or what' mean?

370
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,477
Or maybe she's
not girlfriend material?

371
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:51,394
What kind of girl
isn't girlfriend material?

372
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:55,060
- I think you know.
- You think?

373
00:45:58,893 --> 00:46:01,684
- How about you?
- Me and Peter?

374
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:04,059
We're fine.

375
00:46:04,143 --> 00:46:07,893
- Yeah?
- I doubt you want to hear about that.

376
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,727
I for sure didn't want to hear about
my Mom and her...

377
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:16,018
- Did she have many men?
- Yep.

378
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,227
- And you?
- Me?

379
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:28,059
That's hard to say.

380
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:39,393
I probably wasn't
quite as active as you.

381
00:46:43,894 --> 00:46:46,019
I've gotta go.

382
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,102
Amanda.

383
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:52,518
Anthony.

384
00:46:55,935 --> 00:47:00,685
Well, thanks for the drink
and everything.

385
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:10,560
See you at home.

386
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:58,352
Where were you?

387
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:00,477
Did they leave already?

388
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,476
I tried to get hold of you, but your
phone was here. Where were you?

389
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,644
- I just went for a walk.
- A walk?

390
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:13,101
We had guests here!
Do you know how disrespectful that is?

391
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:16,851
Not just towards me, but to them!
Well?

392
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:21,394
And I was worried sick! At least take
your phone with you next time -

393
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:24,851
- so I can reach you.
Get a grip, please.

394
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:30,227
Here.
You can clean up the rest of it.

395
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,019
...5, 6, 7, 8 -

396
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:58,934
- 9, 10, 11, 12 -

397
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:01,101
- 13, 14...

398
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:13,018
Run!

399
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:15,559
Frida in the can!

400
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:15,685
Run! Gustav, hurry!

401
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:22,394
Okay. 1, 2, 3 -

402
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:25,185
- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

403
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:09,071
Hi.

404
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:13,361
- Do you need any help?
- Yes, I'm looking for a computer.

405
00:58:13,445 --> 00:58:18,111
- Any particular computer?
- No, as long as it's all-around...

406
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,071
For heavy work or...

407
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:22,654
No, it just has
to be... really good.

408
00:58:22,736 --> 00:58:23,571
Good. Yes.

409
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:26,863
It's for school
assignments and such.

410
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:29,321
How much is this one?

411
00:58:58,654 --> 00:59:03,361
I bought Gustav a new computer.

412
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:07,528
- Why?
- He needed some proper equipment.

413
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,988
Is that a problem?

414
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:12,820
No.

415
00:59:12,903 --> 00:59:16,736
Now he doesn't have any excuse
for not doing his homework.

416
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:19,238
Once he starts school.

417
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,736
But maybe we could've discussed it.

418
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,779
How can it be a problem
that I buy your son a new computer?

419
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:31,736
That's my point. He's my son.
Maybe I wanted to be a part of it.

420
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:35,404
Should I also ask your permission
to cook for him and do his laundry -

421
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,778
- or is it just when it comes
to the fun stuff?

422
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:44,236
No, no...

423
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:47,821
Right...
It was very kind of you.

424
00:59:49,529 --> 00:59:52,779
I mean that. It was...

425
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:55,570
It was nice of you.

426
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,403
Forgive me.

427
01:00:38,236 --> 01:00:40,361
Can I try?

428
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,986
Come here.

429
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:03,529
No, no, no...

430
01:01:04,571 --> 01:01:07,361
- Not here.
- Why not?

431
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:10,695
- We'll wake them up.
- And so what?

432
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:16,446
I said, not here.
We'll wake up the kids.

433
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,986
Let's go upstairs. Let's go to bed.
Go, go, go.

434
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,361
Come on.

435
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:13,820
What the hell?!

436
01:02:42,488 --> 01:02:46,196
He said I had ratted him out
to the social services.

437
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:51,946
Otherwise they wouldn't have begun
monitoring us again.

438
01:02:56,695 --> 01:03:01,321
I told him I hadn't said anything,
but he didn't believe me.

439
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:08,738
Then he grabbed me
and then I just ran.

440
01:03:10,488 --> 01:03:13,779
Does he do this often?
Hit you?

441
01:03:20,153 --> 01:03:23,486
He's not nice when he drinks.

442
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:25,488
Does he drink a lot?

443
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:36,113
Every day?

444
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:45,986
I have to report this.
You know that, don't you?

445
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:52,988
He didn't do it on purpose.

446
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,486
I know.
But I have to report it.

447
01:03:57,571 --> 01:03:59,778
He didn't do it on purpose.

448
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:01,820
No, I know.

449
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:06,028
But I have to inform the authorities.

450
01:04:08,029 --> 01:04:10,613
I want to go home now.

451
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:14,820
- I can't let you go home today.
- I want to go home now.

452
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:18,986
- I understand, Sara...
- So let me out!

453
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:24,029
- Sara, it's for your own good.
- You don't get to decide for me.

454
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:28,279
- I want to go now.
- I know, but it's my duty to...

455
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:30,028
I want to go home!

456
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:44,279
We'll be on our way now.

457
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:47,904
- You were right to call us.
- Take care, Sara.

458
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:53,071
Bye.

459
01:05:11,863 --> 01:05:14,571
He said, "let's all
move one place on."

460
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:16,738
And instantly moved on as he spoke.

461
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:22,363
Alice was the only one
a good deal worse off than before -

462
01:05:22,446 --> 01:05:28,403
- as the March Hare had just tipped
over the milk jug into his plate.

463
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:34,945
Alice tried not to offend the Dormouse
and asked, "I don't understand..."

464
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,613
Okay.

465
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:06,403
Bye.

466
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:48,654
Hello.

467
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,528
Oh no.... no, no.

468
01:06:58,613 --> 01:07:01,821
Why are you inside on a beautiful day?

469
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:04,779
Where's Mom?

470
01:07:04,863 --> 01:07:07,821
- Hey, where's Mom?
- We don't know.

471
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:20,154
You're home early.

472
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:24,986
I couldn't concentrate
so I took the rest of the day off.

473
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:29,446
Come along, girls.

474
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:33,820
The sun's shining. Fresh air!
Let's go.

475
01:08:37,654 --> 01:08:40,946
- Who are you?
- You know that.

476
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:48,070
What is the best thing
that ever happened to you?

477
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,779
Having the girls.

478
01:08:51,863 --> 01:08:54,238
And the worst?

479
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:55,946
Losing my dad.

480
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,738
- How old were you when he died?
- 11.

481
01:09:03,028 --> 01:09:06,111
He had a weak heart.

482
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,529
Who is your best friend?

483
01:09:14,945 --> 01:09:17,736
Lina, my sister.

484
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:23,820
What is your biggest fear?

485
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:32,028
That everything will disappear.

486
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:37,113
What is your favourite dish?

487
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:42,945
- Cheese.
- Cheese isn't a dish.

488
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:45,820
Depends on how much you eat.

489
01:09:50,196 --> 01:09:55,279
If you only could bring one thing
to a deserted island -

490
01:09:55,363 --> 01:09:57,779
- what would you bring?

491
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,571
One thing?

492
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:05,736
Matches.

493
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:07,738
Clever.

494
01:10:11,778 --> 01:10:15,528
Who was the first person
you had sex with?

495
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:19,779
- Do you ask everyone that?
- You have to answer all questions.

496
01:10:24,236 --> 01:10:27,820
Someone it shouldn't have been.

497
01:10:27,903 --> 01:10:29,695
Who?

498
01:10:30,738 --> 01:10:33,696
I don't want to talk about it.

499
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:37,445
Why not?

500
01:10:38,988 --> 01:10:41,196
Because...

501
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:48,611
Sometimes what happens and what
must never happen are the same thing.

502
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:54,238
Like you and me?

503
01:11:01,904 --> 01:11:04,279
This was fun.

504
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:06,779
I have to pick up the girls.

505
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:23,779
- Which ones do you want to open next?
- We'll open these ones.

506
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,988
Exciting!

507
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:30,696
- We just know they're gonna be good.
- Yes, because they're not soft.

508
01:11:30,778 --> 01:11:33,028
Cool!

509
01:11:36,236 --> 01:11:39,778
- They shoot water!
- Yes, it's water blasters.

510
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,320
- Awesome.
- So nice!

511
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,028
- Mom, can we try them now?
- Don't you want to open the rest?

512
01:11:50,113 --> 01:11:53,488
- Afterwards.
- Please, Mama!

513
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:57,028
Okay. I'll get some water.

514
01:11:59,904 --> 01:12:04,613
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

515
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,404
- Hey.
- Hey.

516
01:12:14,446 --> 01:12:16,488
- Not now.
- Come on...

517
01:12:16,571 --> 01:12:18,778
Not here.

518
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:37,111
- What's up?
- Not here, I said!

519
01:12:50,195 --> 01:12:52,445
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

520
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:55,488
- Why?
- Why do you think?

521
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:01,279
Please don't.

522
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:03,903
What the fuck are you doing?

523
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:06,446
- What are you doing?
- It's nothing.

524
01:13:09,778 --> 01:13:11,861
Please stay.

525
01:13:11,945 --> 01:13:14,779
He's a child! Lucas!

526
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:20,613
Now we're going to sing
the Swedish version as well, right?

527
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,988
First for Fanny.

528
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:42,571
Four cheers for Fanny!

529
01:13:46,904 --> 01:13:49,445
And now for Frida!

530
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,446
Leave it. I'll do it.

531
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:05,611
What's going on?

532
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:08,404
We shouldn't talk now.

533
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,613
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone!

534
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:18,528
- What?
- Leave me alone!

535
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,154
- What?
- Stop that.

536
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:49,113
What do you mean?

537
01:14:49,196 --> 01:14:52,321
Stop throwing that.
You could hit someone.

538
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:55,154
Shut up. See, I'm throwing it
at your friends, instead.

539
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:56,946
Watch out!

540
01:14:57,028 --> 01:15:02,154
Gustav, come down.
You're ruining the birthday party.

541
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:06,154
- Please come down.
- What's the problem?

542
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:08,820
Stop throwing.

543
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:12,736
Stop throwing and come down
so we can continue.

544
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,945
- What are you afraid of?
- You're disturbing the party!

545
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:18,611
Are you afraid I'll fall and get hurt?

546
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:22,363
- Please come down.
- What is he throwing?

547
01:15:22,445 --> 01:15:26,320
- Watch out! Stop.
- Stop it.

548
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:29,695
- What did you say to me?
- You could hit and hurt someone...

549
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,611
Gustav! Do you hear me?
Lie completely still.

550
01:15:36,695 --> 01:15:40,778
Call an ambulance.
Don't move, Gustav.

551
01:15:40,861 --> 01:15:43,821
- I can't feel my legs.
- Just lie still now.

552
01:15:43,903 --> 01:15:47,278
- Call an ambulance!
- Have you got a phone?

553
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:48,736
Don't move. Did you
call an ambulance?

554
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:51,738
Dad, I can't feel my legs.

555
01:15:51,821 --> 01:15:55,654
It's gonna be okay, Gustav.
Just lie still.

556
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:12,736
Wait... Sorry.
I was just joking.

557
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:15,821
- It was a prank.
- That's enough.

558
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:20,863
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Let go of me.

559
01:16:20,946 --> 01:16:23,363
Let go!

560
01:16:26,196 --> 01:16:27,238
But...

561
01:16:57,986 --> 01:17:01,028
What the hell's wrong with him?

562
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:09,029
We're doing everything we can,
but it doesn't get any better.

563
01:17:12,611 --> 01:17:16,736
Maybe we should consider
some other options.

564
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:21,488
Like what?
Do you want me to send him away?

565
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:24,945
- I didn't say that.
- What, then?

566
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:32,113
- I don't know.
- You must have meant something.

567
01:17:32,196 --> 01:17:37,903
- You said it wasn't working out.
- I can't give up on my own child.

568
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:42,446
- No.
- You just don't do that.

569
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:45,778
No. I was just trying to help.

570
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:22,946
We've known all along
it had to end sometime.

571
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:27,486
And that time is now.

572
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:31,653
Gustav. Do you understand?

573
01:18:31,736 --> 01:18:34,028
Yes, I told you already.

574
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:44,571
I hope it won't ruin anything.

575
01:18:46,236 --> 01:18:48,320
What do you mean?

576
01:18:49,528 --> 01:18:53,153
We love having you with us.

577
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:56,071
And you mean a lot to the girls.

578
01:18:56,986 --> 01:18:58,654
Sure.

579
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:09,153
- What about Peter?
- What about him?

580
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:14,904
You're not going to tell him about us?

581
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,904
- No, of course not.
- Okay, fine.

582
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:24,613
None of us can tell Peter
or anyone else.

583
01:19:26,404 --> 01:19:29,613
- I hope we agree on that?
- Yes.

584
01:19:32,361 --> 01:19:35,071
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:21,529
We could spend some time together.
Think about it.

586
01:20:23,195 --> 01:20:26,611
- Yeah, okay...
- Please.

587
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:29,403
- Hi.
- I'll consider it.

588
01:20:29,486 --> 01:20:30,903
Hi.

589
01:20:46,654 --> 01:20:50,529
I think I'll go up to the cabin with
Gustav and stay for a couple of days.

590
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:53,695
It would do us good to spend
some time together, just him and me.

591
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:55,363
We're thinking
about leaving tonight.

592
01:20:56,946 --> 01:20:57,779
Okay?

593
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:03,529
- Wouldn't that be good?
- Sure.

594
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:07,236
You think it's a bad idea?

595
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:10,946
No. I'm just trying to understand
your priorities.

596
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:13,696
What priorities?

597
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:14,946
You've worked
all through the girls'

598
01:21:15,029 --> 01:21:17,654
holiday and then
you take off with him?

599
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:21,779
- Do you want to come?
- No, we don't want to come.

600
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:28,986
- Lina called.
- She called you?

601
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,986
Yes.

602
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:35,111
What did she want?

603
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:39,946
She didn't leave a message. I guess
she wanted to get a hold of you?

604
01:21:42,695 --> 01:21:45,570
"Take off your hat,"
the King said to the Hatter.

605
01:21:45,653 --> 01:21:49,528
"It isn't mine," said the Hatter.
"Stolen!" the King shouted -

606
01:21:49,611 --> 01:21:53,945
- turning to the jury, who instantly
made a memorandum of the fact.

607
01:21:54,028 --> 01:21:57,070
"I keep them to sell,"
the Hatter added as an explanation.

608
01:21:57,153 --> 01:22:00,821
- "I've none of my own. I'm a hatter."
- Mom?

609
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:05,113
It's just that...

610
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:09,445
Why couldn't we come along to Sweden?

611
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:15,363
Because Dad and Gustav needed
some time alone.

612
01:22:15,446 --> 01:22:18,446
What do you think they're doing?

613
01:22:19,363 --> 01:22:22,779
The things we usually do in the cabin.

614
01:22:23,863 --> 01:22:28,863
They're fishing and cutting wood -

615
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:32,988
- swimming and making a bonfire.

616
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:34,946
Talking.

617
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:42,903
Are you coming?
We'll be late if we don't go now.

618
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:53,779
- Hi.
- Hi there.

619
01:22:53,863 --> 01:22:57,904
- We're on our way to riding class.
- We brought a strawberry cake.

620
01:22:57,988 --> 01:23:01,779
I tried to call but then we thought
we'd just give it a shot.

621
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:05,820
- The girls really miss Lucas.
- We've got other plans today.

622
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:07,986
- Oh...
- Okay.

623
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:11,653
But run along and say hi to him.

624
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:21,779
- I've called you many times.
- I know.

625
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:28,111
- Can't we talk?
- No, I don't really want to.

626
01:23:33,321 --> 01:23:35,654
- You called Peter?
- Yes.

627
01:23:35,738 --> 01:23:38,738
You're not going to tell him, are you?

628
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:41,529
Lina!

629
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:48,320
You're gonna cry now?
I won't feel sorry for you!

630
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:53,238
- It's over. It just happened.
- I don't want to hear about it!

631
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:55,653
Can't we please talk?

632
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:58,945
No, I want you to get out of here!

633
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,571
Girls, come along.

634
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:13,611
Come on, sweetie.

635
01:24:13,695 --> 01:24:15,361
Can't we please
stay a little longer?

636
01:24:15,445 --> 01:24:19,611
Today's not a good day.
Another time.

637
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:20,861
See you.

638
01:24:20,945 --> 01:24:23,820
See you, Lucas.

639
01:24:28,654 --> 01:24:30,738
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

640
01:25:33,945 --> 01:25:38,820
Hi, darling, it's me. I just called
to see if everything's okay.

641
01:25:41,446 --> 01:25:44,738
I just felt like hearing your voice.

642
01:25:44,821 --> 01:25:46,863
Call me back, please.

643
01:26:43,863 --> 01:26:47,613
- Are Dad and Gustav back already?
- It seems so.

644
01:26:49,321 --> 01:26:52,778
- Off with your riding clothes!
- Gustav!

645
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:32,821
Hi.

646
01:27:34,904 --> 01:27:38,446
- Daddy!
- Hi. Hi, girls.

647
01:27:38,528 --> 01:27:41,778
- Why are you home already?
- Because I missed you so much.

648
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:45,445
- Where's Gustav?
- He went out.

649
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:48,654
- We took a taxi home.
- Why?

650
01:27:48,738 --> 01:27:51,904
Mom's car is broken.

651
01:27:53,111 --> 01:27:57,570
- Broken?
- Yeah, it suddenly just broke down.

652
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:03,820
We were the very last ones
to be picked up.

653
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:57,988
I'm thinking of going to the office
to fetch some papers...

654
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:02,028
You're not going anywhere.
Sit down.

655
01:29:16,445 --> 01:29:19,113
I talked to Gustav.

656
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:23,903
He told me that he...

657
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:30,654
He wants to go to boarding school.

658
01:29:34,195 --> 01:29:35,863
Oh.

659
01:29:38,361 --> 01:29:40,736
Maybe that's a good idea.

660
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:44,861
You think so?

661
01:29:44,945 --> 01:29:48,028
Well, if that's what he wants.

662
01:29:48,111 --> 01:29:49,903
Yes.

663
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,738
I told him -

664
01:29:56,821 --> 01:30:01,320
- that I was very happy to finally get
a chance to live with him.

665
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:07,154
How much I'd missed being with him
ever since he was little.

666
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,196
And then suddenly he broke down.

667
01:30:16,321 --> 01:30:19,113
And told me...

668
01:30:21,821 --> 01:30:24,654
...that the two of you...

669
01:30:26,528 --> 01:30:30,653
...that you've had an affair
with my son.

670
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:36,238
Yes...

671
01:30:44,571 --> 01:30:47,488
But that's insane.

672
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:54,196
You don't believe him, do you?

673
01:30:56,570 --> 01:31:00,070
Right now I don't
know what to believe.

674
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:07,696
- Why say it if it wasn't true?
- Don't you see?

675
01:31:07,779 --> 01:31:10,236
To get attention. That's why.

676
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:19,861
Why on earth would I want to have
an affair with your son?

677
01:31:23,363 --> 01:31:25,988
It's an absurd accusation.

678
01:31:27,653 --> 01:31:32,779
He told me details about the two of
you, things he can't have made up.

679
01:31:32,861 --> 01:31:36,236
We're not finished yet.

680
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,154
I've put up with so much from him.
I've tried to treat him well -

681
01:31:41,236 --> 01:31:44,653
- and I only get shit in return!

682
01:31:44,736 --> 01:31:45,986
Hey.

683
01:31:48,071 --> 01:31:51,488
But this I won't stand for.
I'm telling you!

684
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:54,571
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

685
01:31:55,696 --> 01:31:58,613
I know he's had a rough time.

686
01:32:00,613 --> 01:32:05,236
And I know he's been taught to hate me
because I stole his dad from his mom.

687
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,154
Stop this.

688
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:11,820
And I understand
if he wants to punish me -

689
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:14,946
- but this... this is sick!

690
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:20,404
Please stop this. Calm down.

691
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:24,654
Calm down and let's talk about this.

692
01:32:24,738 --> 01:32:27,404
A normal person wouldn't make this up.
And if you believe him -

693
01:32:27,486 --> 01:32:29,903
- you're not the man
I thought you were.

694
01:32:29,988 --> 01:32:34,361
How dare you?!
I'll never forgive you for this.

695
01:32:35,988 --> 01:32:39,488
I just told you what Gustav said.
Please...

696
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,820
And you'd rather
believe a boy you don't

697
01:32:41,903 --> 01:32:44,613
know than the
mother of your children?

698
01:32:44,696 --> 01:32:48,070
I don't know what to believe!

699
01:32:48,153 --> 01:32:50,986
What am I to believe?

700
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:00,196
- Anne, please calm down...
- Don't!

701
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,153
Anne...

702
01:33:07,653 --> 01:33:10,861
Ask your son who
broke into our house.

703
01:33:10,945 --> 01:33:13,696
What?

704
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:15,946
- Gustav?
- Yes.

705
01:33:16,028 --> 01:33:20,113
But I spared you because
I wanted to give him a second chance.

706
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,320
For the sake of both of you!

707
01:33:22,403 --> 01:33:26,279
You don't understand
how people work.

708
01:33:26,363 --> 01:33:28,988
You haven't got a clue!

709
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:33,111
You don't see the game he's playing.

710
01:33:33,861 --> 01:33:38,361
He wants you to choose him over me
so he can have you to himself.

711
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:43,111
You're too easy to manipulate!

712
01:33:49,611 --> 01:33:53,695
- Just explain to me how...
- Explain what?

713
01:33:55,238 --> 01:33:58,238
I'll never convince you
it didn't happen.

714
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:01,529
You've already made up your mind.

715
01:34:07,988 --> 01:34:10,821
I'll go away for a few days.

716
01:34:11,863 --> 01:34:14,361
When I come back -

717
01:34:14,445 --> 01:34:18,279
- I want you to move out,
and I want Gustav gone.

718
01:34:18,363 --> 01:34:24,529
Please, can't we just talk about it?
There's no need to be so dramatic.

719
01:34:31,445 --> 01:34:33,945
You think I'm a monster.

720
01:35:52,863 --> 01:35:57,486
- What is your favourite season?
- Spring. It's getting hotter...

721
01:36:07,945 --> 01:36:11,904
- Who are you?
- You know that.

722
01:36:11,988 --> 01:36:14,361
What is the best thing
that ever happened to you?

723
01:36:33,404 --> 01:36:37,571
We have to talk about the things
you told me in the cabin.

724
01:36:37,654 --> 01:36:42,571
I know I wasn't there for you
when you were little -

725
01:36:42,653 --> 01:36:47,570
- and I'm very sorry about that,
and I understand your anger, but...

726
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:53,654
It's not Anne's fault
that Rebecca and I divorced.

727
01:36:54,696 --> 01:37:00,320
Our marriage had been rocky for a long
time. We were no good for each other.

728
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:07,446
We also understand it was hard for you
to come here and leave everything.

729
01:37:07,528 --> 01:37:12,070
And perhaps we haven't done enough
to make you feel at home here.

730
01:37:12,154 --> 01:37:17,861
And perhaps we haven't listened enough
to you and your needs.

731
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:22,070
But I just want you to know one thing:
We want to do better.

732
01:37:22,153 --> 01:37:24,528
And we're here for you.

733
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:29,488
What's going on here?

734
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:37,653
Your accusations against Anne
are very, very serious.

735
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:41,986
No matter how angry you are, it's not
okay to make something like that up.

736
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:45,486
You cannot lie about
something like that.

737
01:37:45,571 --> 01:37:48,821
But... Dad, I'm not lying.

738
01:37:56,361 --> 01:37:58,945
Aren't you going to say anything?

739
01:37:59,029 --> 01:38:01,445
Well?

740
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:06,488
- Well?!
- Gustav...

741
01:38:07,196 --> 01:38:10,321
- Please.
- It's okay.

742
01:38:13,363 --> 01:38:16,946
I understand that you're upset.

743
01:38:19,738 --> 01:38:22,988
And that you think it's difficult.

744
01:38:24,528 --> 01:38:26,611
But this...

745
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:31,736
- Why are you doing this?
- You know very well why.

746
01:38:33,529 --> 01:38:36,196
No, actually, I don't.

747
01:38:37,821 --> 01:38:40,028
This is...

748
01:38:44,236 --> 01:38:47,736
Have you become completely deranged,
both of you?

749
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:49,029
You have lied to us.

750
01:38:49,113 --> 01:38:53,695
You've stolen from us,
but enough is enough.

751
01:38:53,778 --> 01:38:57,403
We're a family, Gustav, and we have
to be able to trust each other.

752
01:38:57,488 --> 01:39:01,696
And if we can't, you can't live here.
It's as simple as that.

753
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:06,654
So how do you think
we should move on from here?

754
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:09,571
What are your needs?

755
01:39:11,653 --> 01:39:13,320
Talk to me.

756
01:39:16,113 --> 01:39:17,486
Say something!

757
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:24,529
Gustav...

758
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:49,196
He can't stay here any longer.

759
01:41:53,736 --> 01:41:57,070
- We have to leave now, Fanny.
- No.

760
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:58,570
We can go visit
Gustav at the school.

761
01:41:58,654 --> 01:41:59,821
No!

762
01:41:59,904 --> 01:42:03,738
Yes. Come on.

763
01:42:06,154 --> 01:42:08,821
- Fanny.
- Go to Mom.

764
01:43:13,404 --> 01:43:16,488
Is there anything you'd like?

765
01:43:18,904 --> 01:43:20,445
Excuse me?

766
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:25,988
I just asked if you needed anything.

767
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,986
No.

768
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:05,195
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi.

769
01:44:08,821 --> 01:44:12,863
I just wanted to stop by with these.

770
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:15,571
Why are you giving me flowers?

771
01:44:16,653 --> 01:44:20,321
I just want to
thank you for helping me.

772
01:44:21,028 --> 01:44:23,153
But of course.

773
01:44:26,236 --> 01:44:28,528
How is your dad?

774
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:32,946
I'm going to live with a foster family
until he gets better.

775
01:44:34,153 --> 01:44:38,113
- They seem okay nice.
- That sounds great.

776
01:44:42,363 --> 01:44:47,903
Maybe I'll call you some day
to tell you how I'm doing.

777
01:44:47,986 --> 01:44:50,486
I'd really like that.

778
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:55,361
- See you.
- See you. Bye.

779
01:44:55,446 --> 01:44:58,571
- And merry Christmas...
- Thank you.

780
01:45:06,695 --> 01:45:07,945
Good morning.

781
01:45:11,529 --> 01:45:16,279
It can seem extremely harsh
with the discipline and all.

782
01:45:16,363 --> 01:45:20,154
- But I'm sure you'll find...
- Hi.

783
01:45:20,236 --> 01:45:22,695
Good morning.

784
01:45:23,445 --> 01:45:26,486
Shall we...?
Coming along?

785
01:45:29,403 --> 01:45:30,403
Take care.

786
01:45:44,779 --> 01:45:46,821
What are you doing here?

787
01:45:53,821 --> 01:45:57,654
- You have to tell Peter the truth.
- That's not going to happen.

788
01:45:57,736 --> 01:46:00,778
He has to know I'm not lying.

789
01:46:05,111 --> 01:46:08,070
Or else I'm going to report you.

790
01:46:09,236 --> 01:46:12,736
And what do you
hope to get out of that?

791
01:46:14,195 --> 01:46:17,863
- Justice.
- Okay.

792
01:46:17,946 --> 01:46:22,321
What exactly is it you think
I've done to you?

793
01:46:22,404 --> 01:46:24,611
You're an adult.

794
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:28,113
And what are you, a child?

795
01:46:28,196 --> 01:46:32,654
- Did I abuse you or?
- You're the expert. You tell me.

796
01:46:35,028 --> 01:46:38,070
Did I misunderstand something?

797
01:46:38,153 --> 01:46:43,820
- Didn't you want it?
- It's not about what I wanted.

798
01:46:43,904 --> 01:46:48,404
What happened is illegal,
and you know that very well!

799
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:51,488
You of all people should know!

800
01:46:56,488 --> 01:46:58,321
Well?

801
01:47:04,029 --> 01:47:07,445
Why do you think
anyone will believe you?

802
01:47:08,528 --> 01:47:10,736
Because it's true.

803
01:47:14,778 --> 01:47:18,654
You haven't got a case, Gustav.
Have you?

804
01:47:18,736 --> 01:47:23,236
No one's going to listen to someone
like you. You're not credible.

805
01:47:29,654 --> 01:47:33,029
I think you should get over this.

806
01:47:34,403 --> 01:47:39,695
Just tell your father you made it up,
and we can all move on.

807
01:47:43,154 --> 01:47:47,404
And if you're not capable of
doing that, you should stay away.

808
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,361
4, 3, 2 -

809
01:47:52,445 --> 01:47:55,695
- 1...
Go ahead and look.

810
01:47:57,071 --> 01:47:58,946
A dog!

811
01:48:33,363 --> 01:48:34,946
Open...

812
01:48:36,945 --> 01:48:38,571
Good...

813
01:48:39,821 --> 01:48:42,779
Open the door... open the door!

814
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,446
I want to talk to Peter.
Dad!

815
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:58,154
- You'll wake up the girls.
- Shut up... shut up!

816
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:01,529
- I don't give a shit... Move!
- No, no, no!

817
01:49:01,613 --> 01:49:05,153
- Come on. Take it easy.
- Let go. Let go!

818
01:49:05,236 --> 01:49:09,403
Let go! Let go of me.

819
01:49:09,486 --> 01:49:12,486
I want to talk to my dad, not you.
Dad!

820
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:14,111
- Don't you come...
- Dad!

821
01:49:14,196 --> 01:49:18,946
Don't you come here and wake up
the entire house, do you hear?!

822
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:23,529
Your dad can't take it anymore.
Do you understand?

823
01:49:24,321 --> 01:49:25,738
Dad!

824
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,904
Your dad can't take any more.
Do you understand?!

825
01:49:31,403 --> 01:49:34,611
You take up too much space.

826
01:49:50,111 --> 01:49:52,779
You don't live here anymore.

827
01:49:52,861 --> 01:49:54,986
Do you?

828
01:49:57,195 --> 01:49:59,153
You should leave now.

829
01:50:02,236 --> 01:50:04,445
Go away.

830
01:50:36,404 --> 01:50:38,903
Dear Anne, dear birthday girl.

831
01:50:38,986 --> 01:50:44,320
An old quote goes something like this:
Out of chaos comes order.

832
01:50:44,404 --> 01:50:49,863
That is a fairly accurate depiction
of Anne's and my collaboration.

833
01:50:49,946 --> 01:50:54,361
I think you can all envision
the distribution of roles.

834
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:59,863
Contrary to many of us, nothing
you have was just handed to you.

835
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:06,903
You have fought hard to give your girls
a better upbringing than you had -

836
01:51:06,986 --> 01:51:10,486
- and the journey
you have made has

837
01:51:10,571 --> 01:51:13,238
given you an
insight and a strength -

838
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:16,029
- that you apply to your work
every day -

839
01:51:16,113 --> 01:51:20,570
- and which benefits everyone
lucky enough to encounter you.

840
01:51:26,071 --> 01:51:27,613
Thanks.

841
01:51:56,696 --> 01:51:59,446
Are you enjoying yourself?

842
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:04,863
Yeah.

843
01:52:06,236 --> 01:52:08,778
It's nice.

844
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:27,321
I'm really glad you came after all.

845
01:52:30,821 --> 01:52:33,821
It means a lot to me.

846
01:52:33,904 --> 01:52:35,946
Thank you.

847
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:08,863
What did Rebecca want?

848
01:53:08,945 --> 01:53:13,945
- She doesn't know where Gustav is.
- What do you mean?

849
01:53:14,028 --> 01:53:17,779
He hasn't been at the school
since before the Christmas break.

850
01:53:20,486 --> 01:53:23,695
And nobody's seen him?

851
01:53:23,779 --> 01:53:25,821
No.

852
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:30,653
Has she reported him missing?

853
01:53:30,736 --> 01:53:33,236
No, not yet.

854
01:53:34,778 --> 01:53:39,361
- Should we send people home?
- No. Of course not.

855
01:53:39,446 --> 01:53:41,904
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

856
01:53:43,654 --> 01:53:46,113
This is your party.

857
01:54:32,613 --> 01:54:35,863
- Hi, Mom.
- Why haven't you left yet?

858
01:54:35,946 --> 01:54:37,821
We don't know.

859
01:54:41,321 --> 01:54:43,946
Why haven't you left?

860
01:54:45,404 --> 01:54:48,820
They called from
Stockholm, the police.

861
01:54:48,903 --> 01:54:51,445
They want me to come up.

862
01:54:51,529 --> 01:54:53,571
Why?

863
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,486
I don't know.

864
01:55:05,321 --> 01:55:08,029
- I'll go with you.
- No. Stay with the girls.

865
01:55:08,113 --> 01:55:11,113
- They can sleep over at...
- There's no need.

866
01:55:11,196 --> 01:55:15,446
I think it's better if I go alone.
Rebecca will be there, too.

867
01:55:15,529 --> 01:55:20,028
- Shall I drive you to the airport?
- I've called a taxi.

868
01:55:21,571 --> 01:55:24,779
- Will you call me when you get there?
- Yes.

869
01:57:05,029 --> 01:57:07,779
It was a hunter who found him.

870
01:57:11,445 --> 01:57:14,154
Deep in the woods.

871
01:57:17,028 --> 01:57:20,445
All the way up by the cabin, actually.

872
01:57:25,236 --> 01:57:27,695
They think he's
been lying there for

873
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:31,403
a couple of months,
since the snowfall -

874
01:57:31,486 --> 01:57:34,736
- and when the snow disappeared...

875
01:57:38,778 --> 01:57:41,153
Probably he froze to death.

876
01:57:41,238 --> 01:57:45,820
Maybe he got tired and...
just wanted to rest. I don't know.

877
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:55,653
I really don't know...

878
01:57:57,863 --> 01:58:00,738
Maybe drugs and
alcohol were involved.

879
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:03,945
We'll have to
await the autopsy results.

880
01:58:07,695 --> 01:58:10,986
They even thought that maybe he...

881
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:16,528
...that maybe...

882
01:58:16,613 --> 01:58:20,404
That maybe he just
gave up and sat down.

883
02:00:23,236 --> 02:00:27,320
When he lived with us... Gustav...

884
02:00:30,653 --> 02:00:33,528
None of it was your fault.

885
02:00:41,404 --> 02:00:45,404
It wasn't your fault.
I didn't know what to do...

886
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:47,321
Stop!

887
