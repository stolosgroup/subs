3
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,492
- You want cheese?
- Sure.

4
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,145
Lettuce, tomato?

5
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,365
Uh, let me get some
lettuce, tomato,

6
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:43,932
and let me get
some of those peppers.

7
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,413
Done.

8
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,895
Yo, are you high?

9
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,594
I said peppers,
not cucumbers.

10
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,815
Sorry, sir, my bad.

11
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,383
Mayo, mustard?

12
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:02,167
Uh, mayo, and, uh,

13
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,778
give me some of that
salt and pepper, buddy.

14
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,524
Black Canopy Global Security.

15
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,090
Hi, Dorith.
This is Jackson Briggs.

16
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:13,440
I was just checking
on my status

17
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,006
for the Pakistan rotation.

18
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,400
Um, just trying
to sort my travel.

19
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:19,620
Mr. Briggs, you know the
agency can't send a soldier

20
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,926
with a history of brain
injuries to a war zone.

21
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,581
No, no, I just got you guys
a full, clean medical.

22
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,191
Yes, but we need

23
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,542
your commanding officer
to certify that.

24
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,544
Yeah, and I've told
the recruiter, like, 12 times.

25
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,023
You know these guys.

26
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,416
They're impossible
to reach on deployment.

27
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,809
But it's coming.
So let's just get

28
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,332
the on-boarding process going

29
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,900
and, I don't know,
get my travel sorted.

30
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,859
Mr. Briggs,
you know we can't do that.

31
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,209
Look, I got other agencies
beating down my door,

32
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:45,210
so, look...

33
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:50,520
So, look, I can't wait till
next year's rotation, okay?

34
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,435
And we can't staff you
without that recommendation.

35
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,397
Okay, uh, when do I need
to have it by?

36
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,703
The rotation closes
next Wednesday.

37
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:02,184
All right,
you'll hear from me.

38
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,580
- Hello.
- Briggs, this is Jones.

39
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,364
Hey, Captain.

40
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:53,714
Are you in the middle
of something?

41
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,542
No, no, it's a good time.

42
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:56,891
Yeah, no, I was calling about

43
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,458
that diplomatic
security application

44
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,981
I was hoping you'd
help me with.

45
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,635
Look, I'm calling
about Rodriguez.

46
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,201
He passed away last night.

47
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,376
Stop me
if you already heard this.

48
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:06,248
No.

49
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:09,904
No, I didn't hear.

50
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,558
I'm sorry, Briggs.

51
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,863
We're all going
to Patton Barracks

52
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:13,864
to say goodbye to him.

53
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,085
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

54
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,044
All right.

55
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,874
- Briggs?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

56
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:52,120
Sergeant Rodriguez
was a legend

57
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:53,730
who never quit.

58
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,953
He burned bright
and then he burned in.

59
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,565
Airborne Ranger in the sky.

60
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,480
Airborne Ranger
in the sky.

61
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,134
You can tell an Airborne
Ranger by his boots!

62
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,918
By his boots!

63
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,746
♪♪ Glorious! Victorious! ♪

64
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,141
♪♪ Ay! One keg of beer
For the four of us! ♪♪

65
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,537
Man.

66
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,336
Just need you to call
and just be like, "He's good."

67
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,033
- No.
- That's it.

68
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:37,557
- I'm trying to get some money.
- It's not happening.

69
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,906
I'm trying to get
some money, that's it.

70
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:40,472
- Not happening.
- 200K a year,

71
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,257
that's all I want.

72
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,867
Just, like,
make the call for me.

73
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,173
Yeah, I wish I had that power,

74
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,044
but your boy's
still an E-6, so...

75
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,829
...that's not happening.

76
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:50,395
I love him.
You shut your mouth.

77
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,875
You shut your mouth
when you talk about him.

78
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,899
Good luck, brother.

79
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,990
Taboo! Taboo!

80
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,992
Get up, Kiernan. Come on.

81
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,515
- Oh, no.
- You're pissing me off.

82
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,256
- Let's go.
- Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

83
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,780
- Up, up.
- Hey, hey, figure it out.

84
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:27,998
Figure it out.

85
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay, Briggs, get on with it.

86
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,831
- What?
- You know what.

87
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,485
Hey, you're the one who's

88
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,356
screening my calls
and ghosting my texts, sir.

89
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,488
Like, what's a girl
supposed to think?

90
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,229
He's supposed to get the hint.

91
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,796
"Hi, it's Captain Jones

92
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,667
calling on behalf
of Staff Sergeant Briggs.

93
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,016
He's a total badass,

94
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,539
he's squared away,
good to go."

95
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,019
You made that call
for 50 other soldiers.

96
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,368
Yeah, who haven't been flagged
for TBIs.

97
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:51,500
Take it up with the doctors,
not me.

98
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,675
Look, Bear's got half a hand.

99
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,242
You got a, like a chunk

100
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,678
of shrapnel stuck
in your tramp stamp.

101
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:57,375
Kiernan can barely remember
his name.

102
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,073
- Shut your mouth.
- There's a hundred concussions

103
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:01,118
walking around
this entire parking lot.

104
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,642
And it's not stopping y'all.

105
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:03,817
In, in.

106
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,777
Ours aren't on paper.

107
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,301
Maybe check your email.
I got a full, clean medical.

108
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:11,563
Yeah? How much
you pay for that?

109
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,174
That's not the point.

110
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,741
Sir, name it,
what do you want?

111
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,090
Tell me what you want.

112
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:20,268
I'm sorry,
get home safe.

113
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,356
You're just gonna
get in... Okay.

114
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,749
You want me to get the...

115
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:23,924
All right, I'm getting
the knee pads.

116
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,057
I'm getting the knee pads,
sir. Come on.

117
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,406
Are you really just gonna
pull out right now?

118
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,843
Might as well
just get the strap

119
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,192
out of the center console
and put me down

120
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:32,541
if I can't get back
in the game,

121
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,021
just go ahead
and end it for me.

122
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,587
Just put me out of my misery,
it's fine.

123
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:36,980
Briggs, get home safe.
That's an order.

124
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,548
Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

125
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,506
Sir!

126
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,567
Airborne!

127
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,397
Staff Sergeant Briggs
is a total badass, huh?

128
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,356
Oh, hey, Captain.

129
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,010
Figured I'd find you
still here.

130
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,446
Get yourself together.

131
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,621
Come meet me
in Battalion in 30.

132
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,624
Does that mean
you're gonna make the call?

133
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,150
Hey, Captain, all the guys
talk shit about you,

134
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:17,586
but I always knew
you had a heart of gold,

135
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,109
and I was like,
"Not my captain.

136
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:20,937
No."

137
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:36,344
- What's up, man?
- Howdy.

138
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,174
Thank you.

139
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,524
It's expired, sir.

140
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,352
Oh, come on, man.

141
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,049
You know how many times I've been
in and out of this gate with that?

142
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,617
Excuse me?

143
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,837
Okay, think about it.
What's the odds I'm ISIS?

144
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,579
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

145
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:55,842
You want me to step out
of the vehicle...

146
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,191
- Hey.
- ...I'll happily...

147
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,322
He's with
the Ranger battalion.

148
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,672
Ranger battalion.

149
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,589
You're required
to dispose of this.

150
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:05,982
What did you say?
I'm sorry, what?

151
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,770
Thank you for your service.

152
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,207
Energetically will I meet
the enemies of my country!

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,820
I shall defeat them
on the field of battle!

154
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:22,303
For I am better trained.

155
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:23,565
And will fight
with all my might!

156
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,698
Surrender
is not a Ranger word.

157
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:30,311
I'll never leave
a fallen comrade...

158
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,878
What? Y'all gave away
my parking spot.

159
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,618
I had to walk all the way
from the DFAC.

160
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,185
- Keep pushing.
- Where are y'all headed?

161
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,579
We're wheels down in Syria
in 24 hours.

162
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,537
C-17 is loading up
as we speak.

163
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,104
Look, sir,
I really appreciate this,

164
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:42,584
I ain't gonna let you down.

165
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:43,890
I've been working
the last three years

166
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:44,978
to get it straight
for this job.

167
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,457
That's what I like to hear.

168
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,894
Kennelo, what did I say about

169
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:49,634
using your mom's weights?
Like...

170
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:50,984
I'm trying to look good
for your mom.

171
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:52,681
Well, I'm just trying
to say, just...

172
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:54,030
I don't know, more quads.

173
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,423
Gonna give you a baby brother.

174
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,861
So what do you gotta do?
Interview me or something

175
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:01,037
to make sure I've got
a brain cell left, or...

176
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,822
Yeah, something like that.

177
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,824
Well, you say,
"Jump," I say, "How high?"

178
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,478
Wait, isn't your office
this way?

179
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,653
Sure is.

180
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:13,876
Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

181
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,312
Just about, sir.

182
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:17,314
You good, man?

183
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,361
Yeah, man.
It is what it is.

184
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,102
Yeah.

185
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,670
Riley was about as solid
as they come.

186
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:27,585
Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

187
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,718
All right, Kiernan,
let's go, come on.

188
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,504
What's gonna
happen to his dog?

189
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,289
Thought you'd never ask.

190
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,117
Family funeral's Sunday
outside of Nogales.

191
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:40,381
She's the guest of honor.

192
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:42,557
Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,385
I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

194
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,866
Well,
that part will be up to you.

195
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,261
Wait, wait, what?

196
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,180
We sent Riley's body
off late last night.

197
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,879
And his mother called this morning.
She wants his hero dog at the funeral.

198
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,185
Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

199
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,274
No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

200
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,580
She refuses to fly.

201
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:08,191
Why ain't she deploying
with you?

202
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,411
Won't work with anyone. One minute she's good, the
next minute, she's sending three guys to the ER.

203
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:14,197
Riley kept trying after you guys got
blown up, but she's gone all the way.

204
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:17,157
Maybe Riley should have thought of that before
he broke the speed of sound into a tree.

205
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,681
- Yeah, well, Rangers find a way to die.
- Hold on, let me get this straight,

206
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,944
so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call Black Canopy

207
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:25,252
- and get my packet pushed.
- You do this, and then I make the call, no screw-ups,

208
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,342
nothing gets back to me. After the service,
you drop off on base down at White Sands,

209
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,865
they'll handle the rest.

210
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,519
White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

211
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,956
There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,567
Doesn't make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

213
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:40,658
How about I disappear her ass, you make the call,
and we both go on with our lives? How about that?

214
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,618
You stick your neck out for Battalion,
I'll stick mine out for you.

215
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,359
- Take it or leave it.
- Sir...

216
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,537
Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

217
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,799
That's what I'm told, man.

218
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,714
Here's the deal, Briggs,

219
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,759
this isn't the same dog
you served with,

220
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,110
she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

221
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,763
So you keep her secured

222
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,026
and you don't take her out
in public.

223
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,768
We clear?

224
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,817
All right.

225
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,211
If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

226
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,780
Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

227
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,304
No, let's just
get this over with.

228
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:18,348
All right.

229
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:23,745
What's up, dog?

230
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:26,574
You remember me?

231
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:30,578
Your favorite chew toy
from 2015.

232
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:35,191
Huh?

233
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,801
Me and you are gonna go
on a little road trip.

234
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,891
Fifteen hundred miles.

235
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,416
Just to act like your daddy's
looking down on us from above.

236
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,419
All right, I'm gonna
leash you up.

237
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,073
All right?

238
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,511
Be cool. Easy.

239
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,643
Easy.

240
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,737
You really did give up, huh?

241
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:02,001
What are y'all so scared of?
She's milding out big-time.

242
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,482
Stop!

243
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,572
Enough!

244
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,226
Hey, man, I forgot to tell you
not to touch her on the ears, man.

245
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,619
I left that part out.

246
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,623
Hey, we weaned
her off the Prozac,

247
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,407
so she might get moody
from time to time.

248
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,105
Her muzzle can only stay on

249
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,932
for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

250
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,630
Make sure you put water
in her food,

251
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,240
and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

252
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,633
Other than that,
here's your Bible.

253
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,026
- Have a good trip.
- See you, Trent.

254
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,552
Thank you, sir.

255
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,814
All the belongings in
Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack

256
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,163
go to his family.

257
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,773
They want his uniform
at the funeral.

258
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,253
The "I Love Me" book,
that stays with Lulu.

259
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:39,908
If you have any trouble,
all her info's in there.

260
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,431
I'm not gonna be out there
long enough.

261
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,304
- Hey.
- Rangers lead the way, sir.

262
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,435
All the way.

263
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:52,703
- Good luck.
- All right, boys.

264
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,096
Looks like Briggs
finally got a girl.

265
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,953
This is Dorith.

266
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,737
Hey, Dorith,
this is Jackson Briggs again.

267
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:27,999
I was just calling
to let you guys know

268
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,610
that I only fly business class

269
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,742
to countries with names
that end in "stan."

270
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,527
Sir, we're still missing
your recommendation.

271
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,268
Uh, look, it's actually
what I was callin' about.

272
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,399
So, first thing

273
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,009
Monday morning, uh,

274
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,576
you'll be getting a call
from Captain Luke Jones

275
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,361
from Second Ranger Battalion.

276
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,145
If we hear from your captain
before Wednesday,

277
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,929
I'll let the RSO know

278
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:46,714
to expect you on rotation.

279
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,411
Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very
happy to be working with...

280
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,152
Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

281
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:52,154
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
thank you so much. I... Okay.

282
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,417
What?

283
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,160
What is your deal, man?

284
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:00,597
Come on.

285
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,425
You're just slobbering
all over my seat.

286
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,951
Maybe just take
the crazy down.

287
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:09,084
Just like one notch.

288
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,913
Just one notch, that's it,
and maybe we could get along.

289
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,697
And if we get along,

290
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,395
maybe we could
even have some fun

291
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,005
and send Riley off right.

292
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,659
Doesn't that sound nice, dog?

293
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,577
I'm all you got, I'm it.

294
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,927
It's just me.

295
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,408
Believe it or not,
I don't wanna

296
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,714
keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

297
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,455
I really don't.

298
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,762
And to be honest,
I don't wanna drive

299
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,068
straight to some
dry-ass desert town

300
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:40,420
and just sit in a motel and stare at a
wall for five days waiting for his funeral.

301
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:42,161
Do you?

302
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:47,601
Come on, man.
Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

303
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:50,343
All right. So I gotta
take your muzzle off,

304
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,171
but if you bite me,

305
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:53,824
I'm gonna leave it on
all the way to Arizona.

306
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,087
So be chill,

307
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:58,220
all right? That's great.

308
00:17:58,264 --> 00:17:59,961
Just remember all those times

309
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:03,051
we had fun kicking in doors,
getting our murder on.

310
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,271
Relax, I'm not the bad guy.

311
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:10,580
Easy. Do not bite me
in the face, all right?

312
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,234
I'm gonna reach up,

313
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:14,845
I'm not gonna touch your ears,
or near your ears.

314
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,544
All right, I'm not touchin' that, I'm not touchin' that.

315
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:20,373
All right, all right. We're good, we're good.
Okay, look at that. We did it, we did it.

316
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,548
We did it.

317
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,810
All right.

318
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:25,900
Hey, no, no, stop!

319
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,424
Stop it. Hey, hey, chill out.

320
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,644
Fine, fine.
Stay in there then.

321
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:33,255
Stay in there, have fun.

322
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,213
Bye, crazy town.

323
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,359
Hey, you ready to go
to the shitters?

324
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:36,057
Hey! No, no, no. No!

325
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,667
No!

326
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,713
I'm gonna kill you. Oh, my...

327
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,718
No!
Oh, my God!

328
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,154
You just stay right there!

329
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:50,332
You know, I was
gonna let you have

330
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,725
a little bit of fun
on this trip.

331
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:54,118
I was gonna let you
run and frolic,

332
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,773
you know, sniff some buttholes
and all that, but no,

333
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,645
turns out they are right,
you're just a demon.

334
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,342
You're just a demon!

335
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:01,561
All right,

336
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:02,910
last chance to apologize.

337
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,782
No?

338
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,523
All right, fine.
Night-night, bitch.

339
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,653
Oh, what's happening?

340
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,046
You're gettin' a little sleepy
back there?

341
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,482
Someone gettin'
a little tired, tired?

342
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:56,398
Oh, allergy season
is brutal this year.

343
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:59,096
Man, you used to be a legend.
Not no more, huh?

344
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,620
You're just falling asleep
on me.

345
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,578
Wait, what'd you say?

346
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:05,625
Oh! Daddy should go out and get some
beers, you're right.

347
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:08,541
Let you get a little shut-eye.
Okay, I'll do that.

348
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,021
That's really nice of you.
You're right, too,

349
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:12,719
I haven't been laid
in a while.

350
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,242
Maybe not as long as you
but that's not the point.

351
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:16,287
Still sad,
and we'll keep that a secret.

352
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,551
All right, Portlandia,
let's turn it up.

353
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,950
Hey, sorry, man.
No GMOs here,

354
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,083
only bio-dynamic microbrew.

355
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:30,606
Cool, I don't want that.
What's this?

356
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,955
What're you...
Ma'am, what're you having?

357
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,435
- Maker's.
- Maker's.

358
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,784
Can we get two more
of those, please?

359
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,351
You want me to tease it,
or add to it?

360
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,570
Please don't tease it,
just Maker's in a glass.

361
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,310
- That'll be great.
- Awesome.

362
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:41,008
Look, all I'm saying is
every single one of those kids

363
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,444
got out of the compound
all right.

364
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,272
We're not heroes.
We just do our jobs.

365
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,492
I mean, you don't have to
wait in this line, you know?

366
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,407
You just pop on that
VR headset, and boom,

367
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,886
you're at the illest bar
on Earth,

368
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,453
hanging with guys like me.

369
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,673
How do you get to
the actual beers, though?

370
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,458
Virtual beers, bro.
That's the beauty of it.

371
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,112
'Cause you must be, like,

372
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,592
just the biggest Billy Ray
Cyrus fan of all time.

373
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,246
Well, I am actually
a huge country fan.

374
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,727
It's just a little hard
for me to get behind the

375
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,164
toxic masculinity, you know.

376
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,037
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying. Yeah.

377
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,473
So at what point
did you realize

378
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:13,214
that you were just a pawn
for big oil?

379
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:14,520
Just body bags

380
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:15,695
carrying out
ecological genocide

381
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:16,913
for the corporate elite.

382
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:19,829
All these big oil fat cats,

383
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:21,222
they think that
they own this place.

384
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,484
They think they own
Mother Earth,

385
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,007
but no one owns Mother Earth,

386
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,487
and I'm gonna fight
against them every day

387
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:26,793
for the rest of my life

388
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:28,229
- because it's just not...
- Wow!

389
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:29,752
...'cause I don't wanna see
those ducks in the goo.

390
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,362
Look, and if you invite 50

391
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:32,668
of your Instagram friends,
you get half off.

392
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,453
- What does this get me?
- Free drink.

393
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,541
- On me.
- Cool.

394
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:37,934
No, no, no, no version of you

395
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:39,501
ever paying my bill.
Please, no chance.

396
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,155
Would you like me
to come right back?

397
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,199
- No, we're good, I promise.
- Okay.

398
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:44,245
Her money is no good here.

399
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,116
- I got it.
- Oh.

400
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,162
Tonight, I said to myself,
you're gonna love this,

401
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:51,339
I said, "You will meet
a construction worker

402
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,863
or a soldier."

403
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,387
- That's interesting.
- Or, I don't know,

404
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,956
any man without
a white savior complex.

405
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:01,915
Good luck.

406
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,483
Wait, what?

407
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:06,397
I hope that you get
the help that you need.

408
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,269
- Thanks for the drink.
- No, no. Look, look,

409
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:10,097
look, hey, I've been trapped
by the Taliban.

410
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:11,794
Hey.

411
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,060
We gotta get outta here

412
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,281
because you are about the only woman in this entire city
that I would actually like to have a conversation with.

413
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:21,500
Here,

414
00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:23,676
this is a peace offering.

415
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:26,156
Be chill, and I'll be chill
with you. Here.

416
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:30,987
Look, I didn't want
to drug you.

417
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:32,859
You didn't have to eat my
seats, that's all I'm saying.

418
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:35,514
We can be friends, but this is
gonna be an eye for an eye.

419
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,950
Are we gonna be cool?

420
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,299
Or do we need to have
another meeting of the mind?

421
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:41,781
Fine, you don't wanna
trust me, fine.

422
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,347
I don't even care.

423
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,828
I definitely don't trust you,
so whatever.

424
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,179
Is that a Belgian Mal?

425
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,096
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

426
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,011
- She's beautiful.
- Hi, sweet girl.

427
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:56,839
- Are you a rescue?
- Uh, sort of.

428
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:58,188
Does she like
other dogs?

429
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,886
- Oh, yeah.
- No, um, no, no.

430
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,628
Actually she's, um,
she's a little sad right now.

431
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,847
She's... She's, um, grieving.

432
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:07,110
She lost her best friend.

433
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,199
Oh, no, sweetheart.

434
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:11,550
I know. Who are...
Who are these little cuties?

435
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,726
- Oh, this is Lucy.
- This is Maggie.

436
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,554
Aw, they're so cute.

437
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:16,598
- They're Shih Tzus.
- They're great.

438
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,426
Oh, I love Shih Tzus.

439
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,036
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

440
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,864
Mmm-hmm. Cheers.

441
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,649
I was about to give up on
this city before I met y'all.

442
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:26,086
Well, Portland's not
for everybody.

443
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:27,870
I don't know,
it's growin' on me.

444
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:32,396
It's not every day you meet
two plant musician ladies.

445
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,749
We're actually
Tantrikas.Um...

446
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,402
- Okay.
- Yeah.

447
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,883
We DJ ecstatic dance circles
sometimes, though.

448
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:42,668
That's sick. Is that, like...
That's like yoga?

449
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,801
I've done yoga.
But I'm horrible at it.

450
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:48,195
We help heal people
by moving blocked energy

451
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,631
so they can experience

452
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:51,764
the full potential
of sexual pleasure.

453
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:55,768
Oh.

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,467
So you just move
the energy for...

455
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,077
Hell, yeah. I can...

456
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,036
I mean, I got... I got cash
in the truck, I think.

457
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,515
Oh, no, no.

458
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,042
No, the attraction
is completely genuine.

459
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:11,827
Ah. I mean...

460
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,220
As long as
it's in the flow for you.

461
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:16,484
No, I'm good.

462
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:17,790
Kidding.

463
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,053
I'm so in...
I'm so in the flow.

464
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,193
Great, I love some
chakrastuff.

465
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,673
Do we smoke that or...

466
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:32,500
- No.
- No?

467
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:39,072
This is... This is rad.

468
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,683
Does your baby wanna come in?

469
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:43,685
Nope, she's good,
she's just happy.

470
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,121
She's a happy...
That's a happy bark.

471
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:46,427
She's just letting me know.

472
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,690
How are our hearts
in this moment?

473
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,264
Mmm, my heart is, um...

474
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:01,442
just full and it's like...

475
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,749
I mean, I got a new job.

476
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:08,318
Yeah, uh, things are
really looking up.

477
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:10,016
I just feel solid.
I feel solid over here,

478
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,060
I'm ready to go.

479
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,151
- Um, I'm not quite there yet.
- Okay.

480
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,892
- Hmm.
- Okay.

481
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:18,981
But maybe yab-yum
would help move some prana.

482
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:20,591
This is what my heart needed.

483
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,030
- Yeah, let's go.
- Mmm.

484
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:26,032
So good, right?

485
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:31,907
All right.

486
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,604
May I have permission
to remove your shirt?

487
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,695
Hell, ye...
I'm gonna remove it for you.

488
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:44,964
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

489
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,792
Why are you so upset?

490
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,751
Oh, poor baby.

491
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:53,146
Oh, my Buddha.

492
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:57,716
Oh, no, no. That's, like,
some old army shit.

493
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,108
Don't worry about that.

494
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,240
- You guys...
- What's this from?

495
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:03,286
I don't know. That one is...

496
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,159
The big one's an AK round.

497
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:09,205
Your body is in so much pain.
I'm so sorry, we had no idea.

498
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:11,033
No, no, look, it's fine.

499
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:14,907
It's fine. Do I have permission
to remove your shirt?

500
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,560
'Cause I wanna take care
of your heart.

501
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:17,910
This is why we were
drawn together.

502
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,781
What an asshole.

503
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,309
What?

504
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,181
- Place my hand...
- Mmm-hmm.

505
00:27:28,224 --> 00:27:29,835
...wherever your pain
guides it.

506
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,925
Yeah, I can do that.

507
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:35,841
I like this plan.
Why don't we start here?

508
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:37,930
Let's get you out of here.

509
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,412
I'm sorry, um...

510
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:43,979
- Okay, uh...
- I'm sorry. I can't, uh,

511
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,025
- I can't hold this pace.
- I'll go check on her,

512
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:47,766
how about that?
I'll go check on her. Just...

513
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:50,769
You stay right there
and you just keep the energy.

514
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,554
Hey!

515
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:54,816
Hey! What are you doing?

516
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,687
Freeing that abused animal.

517
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:58,951
You throw that rock and we're
about to see who's abused.

518
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,822
Of course you threaten
violence, you redneck!

519
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:02,606
Red... You're
the one with the rock, man.

520
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,173
Just put it down
and walk away.

521
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,609
- I promise you...
- Animals are people, too.

522
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,046
- Okay...
- Let her out now or I will.

523
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,656
- You understand...
- Are you okay?

524
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:09,962
- What's going on?
- Oh, no. It's no big deal.

525
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:11,485
He's just a nice man,
came over

526
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:12,834
to make sure the dog...

527
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:14,227
Hey!
Dog, get back here!

528
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,576
No!

529
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:16,707
- Stop!
- Let go! No!

530
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,798
- No!
- Get it off.

531
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,800
- Heel!
- Release!

532
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,671
Come on. All right.
Come on. Let go!

533
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:27,066
- Stop it.
- I'm callin' the cops.

534
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,850
What are you tryin' to do?

535
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,417
You... Son of a...

536
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,592
All right, now,
you ruined an epic threesome.

537
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:33,202
No. Hey! Ah!

538
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:34,247
Bitch!

539
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,425
Where are you guys going?

540
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:44,518
What about...
What about my pain?

541
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:46,433
God, just get in the car.

542
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:46,319
Whatever happened
to you, dog, huh?

543
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:48,190
Remember when Maretti died?

544
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:51,411
Riley made us watch, like,
15 hours of Grey's Anatomy.

545
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:53,369
Everybody was sitting around
and then you just came around

546
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:55,719
with your fat head,
nuzzling everybody,

547
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,547
being all cute,
making everybody laugh.

548
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:58,897
Whatever happened
to that dog, huh?

549
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:02,161
The army has no place
for liabilities

550
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,902
and that's all you are now.

551
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,601
See, you know,
that's the difference

552
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:09,081
between you and I, though.

553
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,952
You know that?

554
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,911
Those brain doctors said
I'd be on disability

555
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:13,955
for the rest of my life.

556
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,783
Not your dad, though.

557
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:17,698
Your dad, they just sent back
with no questions asked.

558
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,265
They said I'd never
see straight,

559
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:21,397
I'd have headaches
and if I got stressed out,

560
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,834
that I'd have seizures and die
or some bullshit like that,

561
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:25,924
but you don't see some little
seizure stopping me, do you?

562
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:29,971
But you, on the other hand,
look, if you don't want it,

563
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:30,885
ain't no cure for that shit.

564
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:32,539
Nope.

565
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,063
People like me and you

566
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:37,022
are better off just being
all in or all out.

567
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:39,198
I just wouldn't want some
bullshit-ass injection,

568
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:42,375
like you're going to have. I mean, it's
not like you've got a choice in the matter,

569
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:43,854
but it's just not
a warrior's death.

570
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:46,770
I'd probably
steal a prop plane

571
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:47,858
and fly that bitch
right into the sun

572
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:49,382
till the engines froze out.

573
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,253
And then I'd swan dive
right out of the cockpit

574
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,429
and laugh my ass
all the way to Valhalla.

575
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,998
Hey, come on, man,
stop the whining.

576
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:01,263
You sound like
a whiney-ass chihuahua.

577
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,569
Oh, shit. Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

578
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:03,657
Hey! No, no, no!

579
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:10,533
Hey! Hey!

580
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,144
No, no!

581
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:13,754
Hey!

582
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,238
Hey, look. No, no, no, no.
Come here.

583
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,370
Hey, dog!

584
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,592
Dog, come here. No!

585
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,599
Come here!

586
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,695
Hey, dog!

587
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:44,872
Dog!

588
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,636
Hey, dog!

589
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:20,299
Hey, come!

590
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,959
Oh, shit.

591
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:32,050
No, no, no, no, no. Dog, we're
not supposed to be in here.

592
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:32,833
Let's go.

593
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,056
Hello?

594
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:45,063
Hello?

595
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,070
Come!

596
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,247
Dog?

597
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,770
Come on.

598
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,387
Hey!

599
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:37,332
Oh, shit. You've gotta
be kidding me.

600
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,119
Dog!

601
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,301
Hey, dog!

602
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,215
Hello?

603
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,307
Hello!

604
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,006
Hey, big fella.

605
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,664
Hey, what did you hit me with, man?
Horse tranq?

606
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,188
This is pretty good.

607
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,320
Time for you
to start squealing.

608
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,018
Hey, have you seen a dog?

609
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,194
She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

610
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,414
I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?

611
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:18,460
Tell me who you work for.

612
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,114
Okay, look,

613
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,986
I'm obviously not
who you think I am.

614
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,640
I know
who the hell you are.

615
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,993
Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

616
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:30,951
Take my strains?

617
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,999
Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

618
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:37,175
till the end of the road,

619
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:38,654
I highly suggest
you cut me loose

620
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:40,265
and let me go find
my damn dog.

621
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:42,223
You got five minutes
to clear your head,

622
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,181
or you can join her ass.

623
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,626
Hell, yeah.

624
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,034
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

625
00:35:55,557 --> 00:35:56,863
We'll see about that.

626
00:35:58,691 --> 00:35:59,692
Bitch!

627
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,950
Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

628
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:46,216
Dog, come here,
come here.

629
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,783
Now! Come here!

630
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,307
Come here!

631
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,138
Gus, is he awake yet?

632
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:56,749
Wide awake.
He's zip-tied in the barn.

633
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,185
Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

634
00:36:58,228 --> 00:36:59,969
What the hell
did you do to him?

635
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:02,145
Some shit.
I told him I killed his dog.

636
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,930
Gus, what do you know
about interrogation?

637
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,584
You were
a conscientious objector.

638
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,412
How about a little
damn appreciation?

639
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:10,197
I told you not to hit
those edibles so hard.

640
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,373
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

641
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,896
- Tell him you're...
- You're crazy, I'm not...

642
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,942
...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

643
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,291
Just tell him you're sorry.

644
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,075
I shot him
with a tranquilizer.

645
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,947
- I don't care what you did.
- I pushed him...

646
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,514
Now you're making me upset this little nugget.

647
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,430
This perfect noodle...

648
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:27,432
Listen, let's get
the hell out of here.

649
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:29,608
'Cause I wanna look
at your little, little paw.

650
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,218
You're so good.

651
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:32,524
So good.

652
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,960
So good.

653
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,135
What a little nugget.

654
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,705
- Honey...
- Look, Jesus, I...

655
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:40,706
Shut up.

656
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,403
Sit down.

657
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,408
Uh...

658
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

659
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:58,419
I didn't make her
do anything.

660
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,202
I just talked to her.

661
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,380
By the way, you can do
anything you like

662
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:03,772
with my idiot husband.

663
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,819
Gus, apologize.

664
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:10,779
Sorry, dude.
My bad, my bad.

665
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:21,877
Hmm, see,
she's just a noodle.

666
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,531
She just needs some good...

667
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:25,446
I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

668
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,448
Is she gonna be okay?

669
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:29,668
Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

670
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:32,061
but I'm gonna try my best.

671
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:34,194
You need to give, um...
What is her name?

672
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:35,238
Lulu.

673
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,762
Lulu and I some space.

674
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:38,503
So, um, here.

675
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,679
Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

676
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:42,594
and get this man
some clean clothes

677
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:44,857
because he's really
smelling strongly

678
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,467
of Boris and his friends.

679
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,687
So here, take some
homemade edibles.

680
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,906
Go make friends, okay?

681
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,868
Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.

682
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:57,217
You can't tell me that

683
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,088
you did this
with a damn shoestring.

684
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,307
You just gotta
compromise the plastic.

685
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,613
That's it.

686
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:04,311
Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

687
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,486
than I am tying dudes up.

688
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:09,664
I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

689
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,884
- Dying?
- Yeah.

690
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,103
Pretty... Pretty close, actually. I almost
put an axe in the back of your head.

691
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,977
This is...
Well done.

692
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,500
- Yeah, right? Right?
- Hmm.

693
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:22,111
I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

694
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:24,331
I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

695
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:25,941
Come on, get on your back.

696
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,290
Get on your back,
you can do it.

697
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,901
- Come on.
- Whose damn dog

698
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:29,684
Is it?

699
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:34,646
Look, you see that?

700
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:37,475
- You see this?
- Yeah.

701
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,172
This is how they teach them to attract the enemy.
They can smell their clothes from, like, a mile off.

702
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,915
Is this two dead dudes?

703
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,961
Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

704
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,181
uh, dope farmers right there.

705
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,748
Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

706
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,358
It's war.
It's not all unicorns

707
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,142
and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

708
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:56,102
Yeah, I bet.

709
00:39:56,145 --> 00:40:00,236
So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

710
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,021
I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

711
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:03,762
they just,
they make us all keep one.

712
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:06,329
They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

713
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,770
So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

714
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,685
Like her music.
Like, music she...

715
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:16,470
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

716
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,167
you know.

717
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:20,300
Like,
it's her bodycam footage.

718
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:21,780
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

719
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:22,650
- It's the...
- kinda...

720
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:24,565
Yeah, I'll pass.

721
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:25,958
So let me get this right, man.

722
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:28,787
So, like, the dog
did all this, man.

723
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,136
I mean, they're just
going to put her down?

724
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,967
Look, don't get all
misty-eyed on me, big man.

725
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,969
Like, it's...
It's not like that.

726
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:40,276
That dog did exactly
what she was born to do,

727
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,757
and that was to live
a legendary life.

728
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:44,411
And she did it.

729
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:48,807
What the hell is this here?

730
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:51,244
"Dear Lulu,

731
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,463
I can hardly imagine life
before I knew you.

732
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:56,597
Did you come into this world
a beast of fury,

733
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,730
- or were you just..."
- What was that? What was that?

734
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:00,732
He wrote... It's like written
up on top right there.

735
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:02,603
There's a couple of 'em,

736
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:05,040
like poems or love letters,
or something.

737
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:08,566
Rodriguez could barely spell.

738
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:11,220
I mean, he definitely
can't rhyme.

739
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:13,135
I know what this is.
This is...

740
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,615
So when you have
a brain injury,

741
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:17,226
you basically get sent
to these brain doctors.

742
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,490
And then they study you,
and they make you draw

743
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:22,754
and write and do
all this art therapy bullshit.

744
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,625
Nobody really
takes it serious.

745
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:25,670
- Shit!
- Oh!

746
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:26,975
Dog!

747
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,629
You're okay. Hey.

748
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:30,326
Look at her.
She's running around.

749
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,633
Yeah. There was just
a little piece of barbed wire

750
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:34,461
just lodged way up in her paw.

751
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,419
I sterilized it
and stopped the bleeding.

752
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:38,030
Never seen a dog so strong.

753
00:41:38,073 --> 00:41:40,075
Thank you. Thank you so much.

754
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,600
Also, she did offer me
a transmission.

755
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:45,254
- If you feel called.
- Transmission?

756
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,822
Yeah, she bats
about 350 on those.

757
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,563
I mean, but, you know,

758
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,261
if it was baseball,
it'd be hall of fame numbers.

759
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:55,438
Wow.

760
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:58,006
You two are definitely
karmically connected.

761
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,227
She must have incarnated
to find you.

762
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,143
I'm seeing pyramids.

763
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:08,016
Ancient Egypt.

764
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,497
Now, a young girl,
she's playing.

765
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,151
Oh, she's so happy.

766
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,240
Does Lulu work with kids?

767
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:16,068
Uh, wow.

768
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:18,244
Yeah. She loves kids.

769
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,549
She loves 'em.

770
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:21,290
- Oh.
- And licks their faces

771
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:23,205
- right off.
- Unbelievable.

772
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:25,643
I think it might be

773
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:28,907
your daughter.

774
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:32,650
Does she have a boy's name?

775
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,697
- A boy's name?
- Uh, Sam.

776
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,351
Oh.

777
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,745
Um, what about my daughter?

778
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:44,139
Well, Lulu, she's bringing her
into my awareness.

779
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:45,140
How old is she?

780
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:47,099
Uh, three.

781
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,535
Let's... Let's just keep it
about the dog.

782
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,059
Okay.

783
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:53,235
I'm feeling cold.

784
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:57,065
Hard, yes.

785
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:59,589
She's yearning for soft.

786
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:01,287
Yes, a bed.

787
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:05,552
A luxury mattress.

788
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:07,902
She says she's never slept
in a nice bed before.

789
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:09,338
She asks if it's okay.

790
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:10,862
- She's asking me that?
- Mmm.

791
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:13,908
Okay, yeah, sure.

792
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:16,781
Now I'm getting hot...
Tongue... Taste.

793
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:18,957
Yes.

794
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,785
- Indian food she wants?
- Oh!

795
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:23,135
Are you kidding me?

796
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:25,093
- Gus.
- Strike three.

797
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:27,182
Gus, why do you undermine me?

798
00:43:27,226 --> 00:43:29,707
The damn dog
don't want Indian food.

799
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,845
I'm so happy we didn't
have to kill

800
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,542
those nice people.

801
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,240
But I'm just saying,
if we did,

802
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:43,155
you were definitely digging
the bigger hole

803
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:45,026
'cause Gus was massive.

804
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,506
And by the way, the next time
you smell weed,

805
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:47,986
don't run away,
just let me know,

806
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,291
and we can go get it together.

807
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,293
Hey, hey, hey! No, no!

808
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,861
Why, man?

809
00:43:53,905 --> 00:43:55,341
Hey, dog!

810
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,744
No, no, no, no, no, no!

811
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:08,571
Stop it! No, no!

812
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,399
This is my unicorn.

813
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:20,018
No, no, no, no, no. Stop!

814
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:23,761
Stop it. Okay, all right,
come on, come on. Let's go.

815
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,850
Let's go. Sorry, guys.

816
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:38,819
Hey, it's Niki.
Leave a message.

817
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:46,218
What are you looking at?

818
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,222
What you whining for?

819
00:44:50,265 --> 00:44:51,397
You're the whole reason
we're up here.

820
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:56,445
Get comfy.

821
00:44:56,489 --> 00:44:57,707
That's where
you're sleeping tonight.

822
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,629
You're missing
your cage?

823
00:45:07,892 --> 00:45:10,851
Look. It's Alcatraz,
it's right there.

824
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:12,635
Just take a little tour.

825
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,463
You know,
possibly just leave you there.

826
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:18,076
You only got about
three more days left

827
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,121
on this green Earth,
so you better speak now

828
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,427
or forever hold your peace.

829
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:24,430
Hey, look, ain't no shame

830
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,171
in wanting a big,
comfy mattress, okay?

831
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:27,694
Look, I get it. I get it.

832
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:29,304
I've had three
back operations, so I get it.

833
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:32,699
Comfort is king.
But the facts are this...

834
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:34,483
They ain't letting two
rock eaters like me and you

835
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:35,963
in some bougie-ass hotel.

836
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:37,486
And I ain't about
that Holiday Inn life.

837
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,053
But I got an idea.

838
00:45:39,097 --> 00:45:40,359
If you want that bed,

839
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:43,841
we gotta go big,
or we gotta go home.

840
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:45,843
Are you with me?

841
00:45:46,582 --> 00:45:47,975
Hey.

842
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,760
Are you in or are you out?

843
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,459
I'm going to take that
as a yes.

844
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:09,736
Welcome to
the Grand Regal, sir.

845
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:10,519
What up, cuz?

846
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:13,914
Enjoy your stay.

847
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:14,697
Thank you.

848
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,574
Hi. Welcome to the
Grand Regal, sir.

849
00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:22,923
- Oh, hi, sorry.
- Hi.

850
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,055
Are you checking in?

851
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:25,534
Yes, please. I was...

852
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:26,927
I was hoping, uh,
that you might have

853
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:29,364
a room for me
and my little girl here.

854
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:31,627
Oh, well,
let me check on that.

855
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:34,065
Oh, is that a purple heart?
Was she wounded?

856
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,067
Uh...

857
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,200
- Yes, she was.
- Oh.

858
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:41,768
Thank you
for your service. Oh.

859
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:47,774
What did I say?
Right when we walked in,

860
00:46:47,817 --> 00:46:50,342
I said that, "Never in history

861
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:51,996
has a blind veteran
and his hero dog

862
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,346
walked into a hotel
and not gotten a free room."

863
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:56,522
And why did I say that?

864
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:58,089
Why did I say that happens
every time?

865
00:46:58,132 --> 00:46:59,699
Oh, you're right.

866
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:02,789
Freedom. That is why
that happens.

867
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:04,399
Who's a genius?

868
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:06,097
What... What's your...
What's your deal?

869
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:09,013
Why are you... Are you hot?

870
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:09,839
Do you want water?

871
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:12,364
Huh?

872
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:15,976
Let's get this vest off you.
Come on, get up, get up.

873
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,021
Up! Come on.

874
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,112
Oh, man, you stink.

875
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,548
Okay, dog, here.

876
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,853
Come on, let's get in.

877
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:25,420
The water's fine.

878
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:26,726
Come here. Come on. Let's go.

879
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,250
Let's go. Come here.

880
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:32,166
Come, come, come here.
Get in the tub.

881
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:34,255
Come on, come on.

882
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,431
Okay.

883
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,785
You good little nugget.

884
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,571
Such a good little nugget.

885
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,487
Come on, little nugget.

886
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,359
Come on,
now get in the nugget bath.

887
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:52,578
Good girl, come on.

888
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:55,624
Come on. You're okay.

889
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,626
I'll dip you like a nugget.

890
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,673
I don't want to kill you.
Mmm-mmm.

891
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:03,023
Yeah, good girl. Good girl.

892
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:04,677
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

893
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,809
Come on, yeah! Get in.
Come on, come on.

894
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:08,159
No, no, no, come here.

895
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:09,421
Come here, come here,
come here.

896
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,031
It's all nice and warm.

897
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:13,599
It's all nice and warm.
Yes, it is.

898
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,209
Yes, it is!

899
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:20,214
We went through four
bath bombs, bath salts.

900
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,347
Should I call down to the spa
and get us a slot down there

901
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,610
for a doggy massage? Yeah?

902
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:27,700
You're definitely not the girl

903
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:29,615
I thought I'd be
in the tub with, but, hey,

904
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,400
you know,
I'll take what I can get

905
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:34,011
at this point, I guess.

906
00:48:34,054 --> 00:48:35,577
All right.

907
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,449
Last bit, all right?

908
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:39,494
There we go.

909
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,238
One second. One Minute.

910
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:45,109
Hold on, I'm coming.

911
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,634
Yes, one second.

912
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:53,247
Um, one second, yes.

913
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,510
Coming.

914
00:48:55,554 --> 00:48:57,295
Good evening, sir.
Here with the room service.

915
00:48:57,338 --> 00:48:58,861
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.

916
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:00,124
- May I come in, please?
- Yes, please.

917
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,473
All right.
I can take the door.

918
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,345
So we have one rib eye,
medium rare,

919
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:06,043
and one Indian samosas.

920
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:07,522
- Anything else?
- No.

921
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,089
- Everything looks shipshape.
- All right.

922
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,656
- Thank you very much.
- Have a good evening.

923
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:20,100
Hey, dog, you should
see this guy's face.

924
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:22,233
Hey! No!

925
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:23,756
Get off! Get off there!

926
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,105
Don't do it! Stop!

927
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:27,107
No! No! You...

928
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:29,805
Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

929
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:30,937
That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.

930
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,172
Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

931
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,349
Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

932
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:53,655
Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

933
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,484
turn on the TV and put your greatest hits on
of you mauling people, to get you to relax?

934
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,139
You narcissist.

935
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,620
What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

936
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:02,664
I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

937
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,406
But don't you worry.

938
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,539
I got exactly what you want.

939
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:11,108
Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

940
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:14,720
Take it, savor it. Come on.

941
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,332
You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

942
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,292
Whatever.

943
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:28,734
Do not do anything stupid.

944
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:40,006
What?

945
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:41,834
Hell, no.

946
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:43,357
Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

947
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,837
Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

948
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,447
No.

949
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,622
I'll never forget
about Portland.

950
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,363
Ever.

951
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:50,756
Go lay back down.

952
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:53,454
You asked for the bed,

953
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:54,760
I got you the bed.
Go lay down.

954
00:50:57,632 --> 00:51:00,766
Hey, no, no!

955
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,771
Hey, dog, no!

956
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:23,789
You're a first-class moron,
you know that?

957
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:44,505
You smell that, girl? Money.

958
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:47,726
Congratulations, by the way.

959
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:49,597
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

960
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:01,087
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh, sir, pardon me.

961
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,872
- I'm... You okay?
- Yes, Mr. Briggs.

962
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,700
- Of course, yeah.
- Wait, I know that voice.

963
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:08,486
- Wait. Who's that?
- Oh, we met at the front desk.

964
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,096
- Oh, the... Yes.
- Callan.

965
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:11,619
Yes, Callan,
the front desk angel.

966
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,230
I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

967
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,883
- Oh, there are...
- Any good recommendations?

968
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,537
Yes, there's
a fantastic oyster bar

969
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:17,451
down at the Embarcadero.

970
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:19,018
I love oysters.

971
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:20,411
They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

972
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:21,542
What time do you get off?

973
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:23,065
Uh, I'm off at 7:00.

974
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:24,458
7:00? What time is it now?

975
00:52:24,502 --> 00:52:27,113
Oh, no, no. No, no, no! Dog!

976
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:28,636
Come here, dog! No, dog!

977
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,290
Dog, no!

978
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:31,726
Watch out, watch out.

979
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:36,427
Dog! No, no, dog! No, dog!

980
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,950
Dog, dog, no, no, no! Move!

981
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,476
No, no! No, no, no, no!

982
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:46,175
Get off!

983
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:46,915
Get off.

984
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:49,570
No!

985
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,746
Oh my god,
take your time, take your time.

986
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,921
Are you okay?

987
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,358
Somebody get a doctor.

988
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:56,882
I'm so sorry.

989
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:01,974
No!

990
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,802
You all right?
Take it easy, take it easy.

991
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:05,891
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

992
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,897
Oh, my God, I can...
I can see.

993
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,205
I can see. Guys, I can see!

994
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:24,344
Hey, hey! Hey!

995
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:27,173
So you were
impersonating a blind man

996
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:30,132
as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

997
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:32,047
- Yep, that's right.
- Mmm-hmm.

998
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:35,573
When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

999
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:38,227
um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

1000
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,099
sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

1001
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:42,362
- and muzzle struck the victim?
- Correct.

1002
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:43,972
And you've never
seen this dog exhibit

1003
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:45,757
any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

1004
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,716
Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

1005
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,197
It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

1006
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,025
- Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
- Uh-huh.

1007
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:56,420
Is there anything else
you want to add?

1008
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:57,725
How is the guy?
Is he all right?

1009
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,161
- Yeah.
- He seemed okay.

1010
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,424
Well, we're gonna
be contacting

1011
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,035
Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

1012
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:05,385
He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

1013
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,257
Until then,
you just sit tight.

1014
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:10,172
Cool, and the dog?
Dog's okay?

1015
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:11,478
We're gonna
have to check

1016
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:13,001
with animal control
on that one.

1017
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,394
Okay.
So when do I get her back?

1018
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:16,265
Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

1019
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:19,051
Post bail?
Buddy, it is Friday night.

1020
00:54:19,094 --> 00:54:21,532
Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

1021
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:25,231
And I am required
to keep all suspects

1022
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:26,972
in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

1023
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,626
Hate crime?

1024
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,367
Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

1025
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,064
Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

1026
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,892
Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

1027
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:34,893
Let me level with you, man.

1028
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:37,591
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

1029
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,029
That dog's handler was
my buddy, and he passed.

1030
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:44,032
I got to take her down to his
funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

1031
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,600
I got a Gold Star family
that's just depending on me

1032
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:47,993
to get her there.

1033
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,429
All right?
Now I'll be back here

1034
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:50,996
first thing Monday morning.
I promise.

1035
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,432
I just... I got to...
I got to get her

1036
00:54:52,476 --> 00:54:53,433
and I got to go tonight.

1037
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,263
You were an Army Ranger?

1038
00:54:57,306 --> 00:54:59,004
Yeah.

1039
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:02,311
Why the hell
didn't you say so?

1040
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:05,358
- I'm sorry.
- Instead of puttin' me through

1041
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,491
20 minutes of that Ray Charles
bullshit, huh?

1042
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:09,318
I was in the 202nd.

1043
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:10,450
Hey, buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

1044
00:55:10,494 --> 00:55:11,930
And I gotta level with you.

1045
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:13,497
You going into that
hotel lobby, huh,

1046
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,499
with that damn cane
and those glasses, man.

1047
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:16,674
You Army Rangers,

1048
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,371
you've got balls of steel.

1049
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,981
- No. It was stupid.
- I'm a huge fan, seriously.

1050
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,243
Hey, I gotta ask you something,
on the real, on the real.

1051
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:24,856
You sent that little beast
for that raghead, didn't ya?

1052
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:27,119
- What?
- Huh?

1053
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:28,990
Get a little payback for what
they took from us, right?

1054
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,601
- Right?
- No. I... No,

1055
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,472
- definitely, I didn't do that.
- Come on. Don't worry, man.

1056
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:34,300
My lips are sealed.
I'm not gonna say nothing.

1057
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:36,476
And us 31 Alphas,
we keep it tight.

1058
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,173
- You know?
- Alpha 31s?

1059
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:39,610
Yeah, we looked out for you
badasses real good.

1060
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:42,090
Out by the front gate, right?

1061
00:55:42,917 --> 00:55:44,136
Oh, you were an MP.

1062
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:45,485
- Damn right.
- Right.

1063
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:46,965
What are you implying?

1064
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:49,054
Oh, no, no,
I'm not implying anything.

1065
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,883
No, I mean, we...

1066
00:55:51,926 --> 00:55:55,364
You MPs, man,
you guys got a hard job.

1067
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:57,192
I never slept better
knowing that you guys

1068
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:58,846
were out there
at the guardhouse,

1069
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,500
on the wall, watching over us.

1070
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:02,502
Yeah, I appreciate
that, brother.

1071
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:04,112
Yeah, I appreciate it too
that you're not like

1072
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:06,245
all those other Army Rangers
that I've met.

1073
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:07,768
You know, with the long beards

1074
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,944
flowing in the wind,
like they were Moses?

1075
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:13,774
The car going right by the
front gate, not showin' an ID,

1076
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:16,255
flipping us off,
"Thank you for your service."

1077
00:56:16,298 --> 00:56:17,517
Yeah, you're not one
of those guys, are you?

1078
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:18,953
- No, I...
- No, no, no.

1079
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:20,433
- No, I definitely...
- You know what?

1080
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,566
I buy that.
You know what else I buy?

1081
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:27,396
White military guy sics
his dog on a Muslim doctor

1082
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,921
in the heart of
woke-ing class America.

1083
00:56:29,964 --> 00:56:31,531
Man, don't do this.

1084
00:56:31,575 --> 00:56:33,751
Don't do this. Just let me
get my dog and go.

1085
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:35,100
Oh, now it's your dog!

1086
00:56:37,232 --> 00:56:38,364
Sleep tight, bitch.

1087
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:47,112
Briggs?

1088
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,508
Rise and shine.
Line-up time.

1089
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:58,123
Step to the left.

1090
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:02,127
Really? A line-up?
It's like...

1091
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:04,433
It's me, right?

1092
00:57:04,477 --> 00:57:06,348
Everybody,
step to your right.

1093
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:08,699
What are we doing?
Did you guys even have dogs?

1094
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:11,919
He seems like a cat guy.

1095
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:13,573
- Quiet, number three.
- We all know it was me, right?

1096
00:57:13,617 --> 00:57:14,313
Yes, it was him.

1097
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,141
Face forward.

1098
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,360
It's him.

1099
00:57:18,404 --> 00:57:20,058
I got it. Thank you, sir.

1100
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:22,539
Can I... Can I just, like...
You know what?

1101
00:57:22,582 --> 00:57:24,236
I'm just gonna confess.
How about that?

1102
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:26,107
Step back, number three.

1103
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,848
No, I'm sorry. Can I confess?
Is that, like, a thing?

1104
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:29,328
Man, I've got lunch.

1105
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:30,851
It was my fault. I don't...

1106
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:32,636
Look, my dog,

1107
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:35,203
she was just doing
what she was trained to do.

1108
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,249
And unfortunately,
she was trained

1109
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:40,208
to attack guys that look
like Dr. Al-Farid.

1110
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,645
All right, that's enough,
number three.

1111
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:43,342
Wait, let him speak.

1112
00:57:43,385 --> 00:57:44,778
There. But I'm sorry,
that is the truth.

1113
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:46,475
She served seven years,
eight deployments,

1114
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,217
but she did save more people
than you can count.

1115
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:51,176
I'm not some racist
piece of shit,

1116
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,830
but I'll confess to whatever
it is that you want me to

1117
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,483
or do whatever you want me to,

1118
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:56,616
as long as someone promises me

1119
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,184
that they will get her
to that funeral this Sunday.

1120
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:01,012
Is that a deal
that I can make?

1121
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,842
Give me a break.

1122
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,539
All right.
Take him out of here.

1123
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,367
- Really? Nothing.
- Next group in five.

1124
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,108
That's it?

1125
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:11,370
Hold on, number three.

1126
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:19,987
So you impersonated
a blind man

1127
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,423
just to get a free hotel room?

1128
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:24,949
Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

1129
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:27,299
Um, there was a psychic

1130
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:28,735
and she said that
she wanted...

1131
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:30,650
My dog wanted a mat...
Like, a comfy mattress.

1132
00:58:30,694 --> 00:58:31,999
And some... Never mind.

1133
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:33,218
It's... It's insane.

1134
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:36,830
It is insane.

1135
00:58:37,744 --> 00:58:39,093
And if you want my

1136
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:40,225
non-clinical opinion,
so are you.

1137
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,228
Yeah, that's... That's fair.

1138
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:48,450
But the more I sit with it,
it's even more insane to

1139
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:51,410
leave my practice
and fly back from Boston

1140
00:58:51,453 --> 00:58:53,412
just to prosecute a veteran

1141
00:58:53,455 --> 00:58:54,935
trying to get his dog
to a funeral.

1142
00:58:57,851 --> 00:58:59,548
Just promise,
when it's all done,

1143
00:58:59,592 --> 00:59:01,072
you'll seek professional help.

1144
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:04,641
I, uh... Yes, sir.

1145
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:08,340
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

1146
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:18,959
On a warm summer's evening

1147
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:22,180
Hey, what's up, dog?

1148
00:59:22,223 --> 00:59:25,313
What's up? How're you doing?

1149
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,489
Never thought I'd be
this excited to see you.

1150
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,274
Has she always panted so much?

1151
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,711
Yeah, she runs... She runs
hot, I guess, like me.

1152
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:33,452
She's not hot.

1153
00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:36,063
That's anxiety.
It comes from trauma.

1154
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:37,412
You know,
she tried to bite my colleague

1155
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:39,414
when he lightly
touched her on the ears.

1156
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,721
Either take responsibility for
her or find someone who will.

1157
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:44,332
Okay, thank you.

1158
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:51,949
You're ready
to get out of here? Huh?

1159
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:55,561
Your personal effects.
Dismissed.

1160
00:59:56,954 --> 00:59:59,434
As in, get out of my face.

1161
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:01,959
Did you hear the nice man?
We should get out of his face.

1162
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,308
Come on.

1163
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:07,181
Oh, and, officer,

1164
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:09,575
thank you
for your service, bitch.

1165
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:15,320
Come on.

1166
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:16,321
Yeah, keep walking.

1167
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:21,065
What are you looking at?

1168
01:00:21,108 --> 01:00:23,241
♪♪ You got to know When to hold 'em ♪♪

1169
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:24,677
♪♪ When to hold 'em ♪

1170
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,113
♪♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪

1171
01:00:26,157 --> 01:00:27,549
♪♪ When to fold 'em ♪

1172
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,812
♪♪ Know when to walk away ♪

1173
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,337
You're a very photogenic dog,
you know that?

1174
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,079
You look like a hero.

1175
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,824
Why didn't you tell me
you had a brother?

1176
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:42,347
And he lives in Los Angeles.

1177
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,783
We got something in common,
me and you.

1178
01:00:43,827 --> 01:00:45,350
I got family
in that godforsaken city.

1179
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:51,399
You know what?
I'll make you a deal.

1180
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,010
You don't do anything
all psychotic on this trip,

1181
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:55,403
and we make good time,
we can go see him.

1182
01:00:56,709 --> 01:01:00,060
Maybe, okay? Is that a deal?

1183
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:01,453
Shake?

1184
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:04,543
Shake. You got it.

1185
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,416
Okay, deal.

1186
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,246
Jesus Christ. All right.

1187
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:17,730
All right, let's go.

1188
01:01:52,547 --> 01:01:53,722
Okay, game time.

1189
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:56,508
Look, if I'm spending
too long in there,

1190
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:58,075
you have full permission
to go psychotic,

1191
01:01:58,118 --> 01:01:59,337
like usual, and I'll come out.

1192
01:02:03,254 --> 01:02:05,430
Jacket or no jacket? I feel like
the jacket's too much.

1193
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:06,561
What am I doing,
talking to you?

1194
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:28,061
Mommy, Curious George
turned off.

1195
01:02:28,105 --> 01:02:29,541
Okay, sweetie.

1196
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,847
- I'll be right there, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1197
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:38,942
Mommy, who's there?

1198
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,165
Uh, it's just
one of Mommy's friends.

1199
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:46,906
Go to my room,

1200
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,256
I'll bring your pasta
in a few minutes, okay?

1201
01:03:47,445 --> 01:03:49,142
Well, you want it? You got it.

1202
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:56,367
Okay, dog, I tried my family,
let's try yours.

1203
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:13,558
What?

1204
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:14,689
Look, if your brother
ain't here,

1205
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:16,169
we are definitely not waiting.

1206
01:04:16,213 --> 01:04:18,345
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.

1207
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:19,433
- Nuke!
- Hey, Noah.

1208
01:04:19,477 --> 01:04:21,305
I'm sorry to barge in, man.

1209
01:04:21,348 --> 01:04:23,002
Lulu, is that you?

1210
01:04:23,046 --> 01:04:24,656
I'm one of Riley's
old teammates,

1211
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:26,745
and I figured, you know,
I'd let her see her brother.

1212
01:04:26,788 --> 01:04:28,181
Watch her...

1213
01:04:28,225 --> 01:04:29,835
I know, I know.

1214
01:04:29,878 --> 01:04:31,750
She's sensitive on the ears,
aren't you, girl?

1215
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:33,970
Good girl. Hey.

1216
01:04:34,013 --> 01:04:35,449
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:37,669
You give hugs now, really?

1218
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,758
Oh, yeah.
Lulu gives the best hugs.

1219
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,499
You've never had a Lulu hug?

1220
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,414
No, we don't... We don't...
We don't exactly hug.

1221
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:45,807
You a medium or a large?

1222
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:48,897
Are you bitching out on me?

1223
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:50,769
No, I'm not bitching out on you. She's
been wanting to kill me for three days.

1224
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,206
Come on, let's go.

1225
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,599
Give it to me,
come on, let's go.

1226
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:56,427
Stay calm.
You're having fun.

1227
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,211
This is fun.

1228
01:04:58,255 --> 01:04:59,604
Oh, having fun?
Just look at her.

1229
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,997
She wants to murder me.

1230
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,302
- Relax.
- This isn't fun.

1231
01:05:02,346 --> 01:05:03,825
- Relax.
- Come on, come on.

1232
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:05,479
Come on, we'll make it fun.

1233
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:07,307
It's fun. Take a little piece.

1234
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:08,700
Take a little piece.
I know you like it.

1235
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,919
I know you want it.

1236
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:14,053
Remind me again
why we want her to bite.

1237
01:05:14,097 --> 01:05:17,056
She doesn't know what war is.
For her, it's just work.

1238
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,189
You've got to show her
that work can be fun again,

1239
01:05:19,232 --> 01:05:21,017
nothing bad
is going to happen, okay?

1240
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,627
That's how you make a bond.

1241
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,107
I don't need to make
a bond, okay?

1242
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,847
I just... What, am I not
fun enough for you?

1243
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:26,979
- You're fun.
- Come on.

1244
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,198
Just hold your arm up
a bit higher.

1245
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:29,634
It's up, man. Take it.

1246
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:31,070
Come on, just get it.

1247
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:33,942
- Good boy, Nuke. Good boy!
- Good boy.

1248
01:05:33,986 --> 01:05:35,683
Let him know
this is love, your chew toy,

1249
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:36,858
this is fun.

1250
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:39,774
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1251
01:05:39,818 --> 01:05:41,037
So you're
telling me that Nuke

1252
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,126
was just as messed up as Lulu.

1253
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:45,563
I'd been working every day
for six months

1254
01:05:45,606 --> 01:05:48,479
before I convinced the army
to let me adopt him out.

1255
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:49,393
Thought we'd never get there.

1256
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,831
Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

1257
01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:54,137
Kids, burgers!

1258
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:54,963
Shit.

1259
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:02,667
Daddy, was this on the ground?

1260
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,104
- No.
- You're lying. I saw it fall.

1261
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:07,367
Baby, I dropped it
into my hand, okay?

1262
01:06:07,411 --> 01:06:09,282
It's fine. You're fine.

1263
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:12,938
Saturdays.

1264
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:17,116
I can barely
take care of the dogs.

1265
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,378
I don't know
how you're doing all this.

1266
01:06:18,422 --> 01:06:20,250
Yeah, I get it.

1267
01:06:20,293 --> 01:06:21,729
Nuke was about
all I could handle,

1268
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,905
but when he stopped
struggling,

1269
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:25,255
that's when I realized
maybe I could

1270
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:26,691
stop struggling too, you know?

1271
01:06:29,215 --> 01:06:31,696
Do you think Riley
could've fixed Lulu?

1272
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:34,525
Not by keeping her
in the fight, no.

1273
01:06:34,568 --> 01:06:37,267
You gotta know when to hang
'em up or check out, I guess.

1274
01:06:39,182 --> 01:06:41,401
Well, sometimes Rangers
just find a way to die, man.

1275
01:06:44,187 --> 01:06:46,189
Give Riley's mom a big hug.

1276
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:48,756
They didn't talk much, I know,
but she meant a lot to him.

1277
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,367
Yeah, I will, man.

1278
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:58,114
Oh, come on. No! Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.

1279
01:06:59,202 --> 01:07:00,507
No, it's a real
nice neighborhood

1280
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:01,769
you got here, man.

1281
01:07:03,336 --> 01:07:05,730
They got all my shit.
They got Riley's shit.

1282
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:07,384
They got my meds.

1283
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:09,037
Well, that's good.

1284
01:07:09,081 --> 01:07:10,343
At least I can give
his parents his dog tags.

1285
01:07:10,387 --> 01:07:11,779
Oh, good.

1286
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,694
They left your unicorn.

1287
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,132
Lulu, Lulu, here.

1288
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,178
Seek.

1289
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,659
Yeah, Lulu, go, seek.

1290
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,143
- Good boy.
- Lulu, seek.

1291
01:07:28,622 --> 01:07:30,015
Seek, seek.

1292
01:07:32,235 --> 01:07:34,106
What's in here?

1293
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,412
Oh, yeah. There we go.
There we go.

1294
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:37,588
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1295
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:39,590
Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

1296
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:40,808
Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

1297
01:07:42,114 --> 01:07:43,811
I guess we're going
in the right direction.

1298
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:44,769
Seek, seek.

1299
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:46,510
Seek, seek.

1300
01:07:46,553 --> 01:07:48,381
Yes, baby, yes.

1301
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,427
Put the water on,
I'm sure it's boiling.

1302
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,342
Yes, pesto is fine.

1303
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:54,257
We're... I'm just showing
my buddy the Boardwalk.

1304
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,433
Sorry, Tiffany, I just
wanted to see the piers.

1305
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:58,391
Yes, okay.
We'll be back soon, okay?

1306
01:07:58,435 --> 01:07:59,436
Seek.

1307
01:08:01,264 --> 01:08:02,874
- Nuke!
- Oh, hey!

1308
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:06,878
Yeah, Lulu, go, go, seek.

1309
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:11,230
Seek, seek.

1310
01:08:11,274 --> 01:08:13,232
Just don't let her go.
Seek, Nuke.

1311
01:08:14,886 --> 01:08:16,366
Seek.

1312
01:08:16,409 --> 01:08:17,193
Seek, Nuke.

1313
01:08:22,285 --> 01:08:25,462
Seek, seek, seek.

1314
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:28,595
Find it, Nuke. Find it.

1315
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:34,210
- Hey! Hey!
- Seek.

1316
01:08:34,253 --> 01:08:35,602
Joe! Shut the hell up.

1317
01:08:37,648 --> 01:08:40,999
Seek, seek.

1318
01:08:42,522 --> 01:08:43,828
Seek. Seek.

1319
01:08:46,265 --> 01:08:47,527
Seek.

1320
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:51,923
Seek.

1321
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:53,054
Yeah, yeah,

1322
01:08:53,098 --> 01:08:54,055
she found it, she found it.

1323
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:56,841
Good boy, Nuke.

1324
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:58,495
Yeah, this is it.

1325
01:08:58,538 --> 01:09:01,889
Yeah, yeah, it's my shit.
It's just everywhere.

1326
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:03,021
This crackhead's
probably snorting

1327
01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:04,414
my migraine meds right now.

1328
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,114
Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

1329
01:09:09,157 --> 01:09:10,289
Her book's here.

1330
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,815
Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

1331
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,513
- Oh, is it? That's yours?
- Yeah.

1332
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,428
- All right, Jackson, let's go.
- Your name's Rodriguez?

1333
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:20,517
Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

1334
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,301
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1335
01:09:22,345 --> 01:09:23,781
- I ain't taking off shit.
- What battalion were you in?

1336
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:25,826
That's classified.

1337
01:09:27,785 --> 01:09:30,701
Get it off!
Get it off!

1338
01:09:30,744 --> 01:09:34,661
Oh, goddamn, man.

1339
01:09:34,705 --> 01:09:37,055
Hey, I serve my country,

1340
01:09:37,098 --> 01:09:38,665
and this is the thanks I get?

1341
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:39,971
I'm a war hero!

1342
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,755
Get the fuck
outta here, man!

1343
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:43,366
You're gonna be
all good without those meds?

1344
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:44,802
I should have
just let her eat

1345
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:46,673
that stolen valor
piece of shit.

1346
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:48,893
You never know in places
like that who served.

1347
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,722
And if you were here
five years ago,

1348
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:53,593
you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

1349
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:55,987
and that would have been
the best-case scenario.

1350
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,902
Yeah, but I didn't.

1351
01:09:57,945 --> 01:09:59,295
'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1352
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:00,339
Yeah?

1353
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:01,340
What about Riley?

1354
01:10:02,254 --> 01:10:04,038
What about Riley?

1355
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:06,171
I mean, the dude couldn't get out
of bed without popping three percs.

1356
01:10:07,433 --> 01:10:08,913
Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

1357
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:10,697
and he was a champion.

1358
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:13,178
I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

1359
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:14,832
we'd get shitfaced
talking about

1360
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,529
how we were gonna check out.

1361
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:19,010
Look, man, we all
deal with shit

1362
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,838
to stay in the game, okay?

1363
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,230
So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

1364
01:10:23,493 --> 01:10:25,016
He used to talk
about driving off

1365
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:26,931
the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1366
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:29,412
but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

1367
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:35,853
I tried to get him to talk.

1368
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,725
Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

1369
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,336
That was a great idea.

1370
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:42,120
No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

1371
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:43,164
or even just to God.

1372
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,558
God?

1373
01:10:45,602 --> 01:10:47,778
Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

1374
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:49,780
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1375
01:10:49,823 --> 01:10:51,259
Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

1376
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:53,218
could be his damn barber.

1377
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:56,003
But we all got to pick
something at some point.

1378
01:10:56,656 --> 01:10:57,657
Well...

1379
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,881
he didn't, and he won't.

1380
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,841
So ain't no use
bitching about it.

1381
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:09,582
You know, we trained
to put the whole world

1382
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:11,062
on our back.

1383
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:12,759
At the end of the day,

1384
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:14,239
the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

1385
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,156
Bye, Lulu.

1386
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:20,158
Say hi to your daddy for me.

1387
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,466
I'll be praying for you guys.

1388
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:24,989
We're gonna
be just fine.

1389
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:27,818
Come here.

1390
01:11:27,861 --> 01:11:28,993
Hello, guys.

1391
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:10,164
I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

1392
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:12,253
because you know
what they want, right?

1393
01:12:13,907 --> 01:12:18,738
They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

1394
01:12:18,782 --> 01:12:21,306
just missing her
hero war daddy.

1395
01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:25,528
What they definitely
don't want...

1396
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:27,660
They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

1397
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:30,054
as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

1398
01:12:32,752 --> 01:12:34,058
Now, they...
They don't know you.

1399
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,495
That's for damn sure.

1400
01:12:38,323 --> 01:12:40,064
They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

1401
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,068
The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

1402
01:12:45,548 --> 01:12:46,549
If they knew the truth,

1403
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:51,641
it would scare the living shit
out of them.

1404
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,169
You know, when I got out,

1405
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,301
your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

1406
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:02,478
with the word "Thanks"
carved in it.

1407
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,134
It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

1408
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,876
that you experience
what we experienced together?

1409
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:13,750
You even listening to me?

1410
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:17,667
Just talking to a dog.

1411
01:13:21,932 --> 01:13:23,194
What is that?

1412
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,369
No. No, no.

1413
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:27,111
No, no. Come on.

1414
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:29,505
Don't you do this to me now.

1415
01:13:36,599 --> 01:13:37,556
No.

1416
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:41,342
Ow.

1417
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:48,698
Okay...

1418
01:13:48,741 --> 01:13:50,308
Of course, there's no service.

1419
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:51,439
Why would we have service?

1420
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,341
Hey, hey, hey.

1421
01:14:26,866 --> 01:14:27,867
Hello?

1422
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:32,568
Hey.

1423
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,105
Come on.

1424
01:14:51,456 --> 01:14:53,589
All right, we got to go.

1425
01:14:53,632 --> 01:14:55,503
Come on. We're moving on.

1426
01:14:55,547 --> 01:14:56,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1427
01:14:56,896 --> 01:14:58,942
Hey, hey, no.

1428
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:00,857
No. Chill out.

1429
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:04,295
Hey. Hey, hey!

1430
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,210
No! Stop! Relax!

1431
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,647
Look, stop. It's just thunder.

1432
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:10,997
It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

1433
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:13,434
Calm down. Stop!

1434
01:15:13,478 --> 01:15:15,045
Hey!

1435
01:15:15,088 --> 01:15:17,090
All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

1436
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:19,049
Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

1437
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:21,529
Come on, then, let's go!

1438
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:32,540
Such a coward.

1439
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:37,344
Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

1440
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:39,346
How about we just chill out
for a little while?

1441
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,608
Relax.

1442
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:43,524
Hey, it's okay.

1443
01:16:43,568 --> 01:16:45,091
It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

1444
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:49,574
You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

1445
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:52,229
give us a little something
to take our mind off.

1446
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:54,579
Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

1447
01:16:54,622 --> 01:16:55,493
What do you feel like?

1448
01:16:57,147 --> 01:16:58,583
Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

1449
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,150
You want to watch
your greatest hits,

1450
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:01,586
or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

1451
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:02,805
I'm gonna go with Grey's.

1452
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:07,635
It works.

1453
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:12,945
We're just gonna rest,

1454
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:15,208
we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

1455
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,345
Watch a little trash TV.

1456
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:25,784
A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

1457
01:17:25,828 --> 01:17:26,611
without a snack.

1458
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,530
What?

1459
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,750
Oh, you want some?

1460
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:44,020
Look at that.

1461
01:17:45,935 --> 01:17:48,459
Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

1462
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,595
Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

1463
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,380
like, read you
his love letters?

1464
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:00,253
Some pretty good ones
in there.

1465
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:04,388
Let's see.

1466
01:18:08,218 --> 01:18:09,306
What about...

1467
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,788
Okay.

1468
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:20,796
"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

1469
01:18:23,624 --> 01:18:24,974
You've taken bullets before.

1470
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:27,585
This was the worst.

1471
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:31,415
The guilt still haunts me.

1472
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:35,071
I'm not going to lie,

1473
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:37,551
but I know you did
what you did that night,

1474
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:39,640
so none of your brothers
had to die."

1475
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,599
It's pretty good.

1476
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:46,125
"When they took you away,

1477
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:48,867
I was sure
we'd run out of time

1478
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:52,349
and that's when
it hit me, girl,

1479
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,614
I was never your handler.

1480
01:18:59,312 --> 01:19:01,314
That you were actually mine.

1481
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:06,537
Your brother, Riley."

1482
01:19:09,148 --> 01:19:10,280
You slept with Corrine?

1483
01:19:11,368 --> 01:19:13,022
Yeah.

1484
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:14,850
What? Okay.

1485
01:19:14,893 --> 01:19:16,460
While I was dealing
with my sick daughter?

1486
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,462
I cannot believe
you actually like this trash.

1487
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:20,725
Unreal.

1488
01:19:20,768 --> 01:19:22,118
All right, the sun's up.

1489
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:23,162
It's time.

1490
01:19:25,382 --> 01:19:28,864
There is about zero chance
of us making it

1491
01:19:28,907 --> 01:19:30,604
a hundred clicks in six hours

1492
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:32,302
with no cell phone service
or ride.

1493
01:19:32,345 --> 01:19:35,566
But, hey, last time I checked,

1494
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:37,568
"surrender"
is not a Ranger word.

1495
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,965
I don't know about you,
but I got a funeral to go to.

1496
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:46,359
Come on.

1497
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:51,799
Come on.

1498
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:14,866
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1499
01:20:31,013 --> 01:20:32,057
Hey.

1500
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:36,714
Hey, hey, hey, please, please.
Come on.

1501
01:20:36,757 --> 01:20:39,238
Come on, please, please.
Come on! Man.

1502
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:52,442
We're gonna make it.

1503
01:21:52,485 --> 01:21:53,486
Come on.

1504
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,272
Come on.

1505
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:01,103
Come on.

1506
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:05,542
Almost there.

1507
01:22:08,806 --> 01:22:10,547
May you know
the Lord's love and peace.

1508
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,896
You're gonna look great.

1509
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:13,202
You're gonna look like a hero,

1510
01:22:13,245 --> 01:22:14,681
just like
Riley would've wanted.

1511
01:22:14,725 --> 01:22:16,466
Okay.

1512
01:22:16,509 --> 01:22:18,424
You know what else
Riley would've liked?

1513
01:22:18,468 --> 01:22:21,514
You not to bite anybody,
so maybe just don't do that.

1514
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:23,821
Come on.

1515
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:25,301
Receive the Lord's blessings.

1516
01:22:26,519 --> 01:22:28,826
May the Lord bless you
and watch over you.

1517
01:22:30,393 --> 01:22:31,698
May He make His face
to shine upon

1518
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:32,743
each and every one of you

1519
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:35,267
and be gracious to you.

1520
01:22:36,138 --> 01:22:38,531
May He look lovingly on you

1521
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:39,663
and grant you peace.

1522
01:22:40,968 --> 01:22:42,231
May He bless your children

1523
01:22:42,274 --> 01:22:43,710
and your families...

1524
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:46,670
...that they may
know love and happiness.

1525
01:22:47,714 --> 01:22:49,151
No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

1526
01:22:49,194 --> 01:22:50,500
May you know
that love deeply.

1527
01:22:52,023 --> 01:22:53,590
And may He always
be with you.

1528
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:54,678
We should not grieve for...

1529
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:57,768
Lulu.

1530
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:00,684
Come on. It's okay.

1531
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:01,598
I'm sorry.

1532
01:23:05,384 --> 01:23:06,690
No, no, no. It's okay.

1533
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,346
Okay, fine, all right.

1534
01:23:12,174 --> 01:23:13,305
Okay, it's okay, go.

1535
01:23:14,524 --> 01:23:15,612
It's okay.

1536
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,708
Aw.

1537
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,717
So let us rejoice for
our dearly departed brother.

1538
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:37,764
For he has stood
his last watch,

1539
01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:40,158
and he's now
on his final deployment.

1540
01:23:40,202 --> 01:23:42,900
In the name of the Father
and the Son

1541
01:23:42,943 --> 01:23:45,729
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1542
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:50,647
Detail. Port Arms.

1543
01:23:52,344 --> 01:23:54,520
Half right, face.

1544
01:23:56,218 --> 01:23:59,046
With blank ammunition, load!

1545
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:02,398
Ready!

1546
01:24:02,441 --> 01:24:04,791
Aim! Fire!

1547
01:24:04,835 --> 01:24:05,923
Easy.

1548
01:24:05,966 --> 01:24:08,317
Aim!

1549
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,014
Fire!

1550
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:11,842
- You're okay, you're okay.
- Aim! Fire!

1551
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:15,367
- Ready...
- You're okay, you're okay.

1552
01:24:15,411 --> 01:24:16,977
Cease fire!

1553
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:20,633
Present Arms!

1554
01:24:20,677 --> 01:24:23,506
You're okay. You're okay.

1555
01:24:58,105 --> 01:25:00,369
On behalf of the President
of the United States,

1556
01:25:00,412 --> 01:25:02,806
the United States Army,
and a grateful nation.

1557
01:25:16,254 --> 01:25:16,994
Thanks.

1558
01:25:21,259 --> 01:25:22,260
All right.

1559
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:24,828
Come on, let's go.

1560
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:34,664
Yes, sir.

1561
01:25:34,707 --> 01:25:36,361
Yep. Still on schedule
to drop her off

1562
01:25:36,405 --> 01:25:37,884
First thing in the A.M.

1563
01:25:37,928 --> 01:25:39,582
All right, I'll tell him
to expect your call.

1564
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,236
Hey, and, Captain, thank you
for making this call.

1565
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:42,280
- I really appreciate it.
- You got it, brother.

1566
01:25:42,324 --> 01:25:43,716
Oh, uh, one more thing.

1567
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,937
Look, she's...
She's doing a lot better.

1568
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,156
I mean, she's a completely
different dog now.

1569
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,549
I don't know, maybe there's
someone on base

1570
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:52,290
that one of us could talk to.

1571
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:54,466
Briggs, you know
that's not up to us.

1572
01:25:56,163 --> 01:25:58,165
- Just get it done.
- Yeah.

1573
01:25:58,209 --> 01:25:59,254
Good luck over there,
Briggs.

1574
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:00,777
Yes, sir.

1575
01:26:02,126 --> 01:26:02,866
All right.

1576
01:26:08,611 --> 01:26:10,700
Let's go, let's go.

1577
01:26:10,743 --> 01:26:12,441
Let's go do something stupid.

1578
01:26:14,486 --> 01:26:16,096
Thank you, sir.

1579
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:41,905
You wanna go out there?

1580
01:26:43,559 --> 01:26:44,516
Hmm?

1581
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:48,520
You see something
you wanna go get?

1582
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:09,367
You're free, go.

1583
01:27:11,804 --> 01:27:13,937
Go for it.
I ain't gonna try to stop you.

1584
01:27:16,809 --> 01:27:18,202
You hear me? Hey.

1585
01:27:18,245 --> 01:27:19,769
Hey.

1586
01:27:20,422 --> 01:27:21,205
Go.

1587
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:24,991
Get out.

1588
01:27:25,035 --> 01:27:27,037
Go, come on. No. Hey.

1589
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,952
No, I'm not trying to tell you
to do tricks, kid. No.

1590
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:30,780
Get. Go.

1591
01:27:32,259 --> 01:27:34,523
Hey. Hey.

1592
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:39,136
Now. Come on. Come on.

1593
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:41,617
Hey. Hey.

1594
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:59,591
You got no idea, do you, dog?

1595
01:30:00,712 --> 01:30:01,757
I'm okay.

1596
01:30:03,585 --> 01:30:04,368
I'm okay, girl.

1597
01:30:06,196 --> 01:30:07,110
I'm all right.

1598
01:30:08,938 --> 01:30:10,983
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1599
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:13,508
I'm okay.

1600
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,601
I'm okay.

1601
01:30:37,836 --> 01:30:38,794
You're okay.

1602
01:30:40,622 --> 01:30:41,623
You're okay.

1603
01:31:29,671 --> 01:31:31,629
All right, Lulu,
come on.

1604
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:48,124
- ID, sir?
- Yeah.

1605
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:51,301
Your army ID has expired.

1606
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:52,476
You're required by law
to dispose...

1607
01:31:52,519 --> 01:31:53,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

1608
01:31:53,999 --> 01:31:55,087
Uh, I'm just dropping off
the dog, man,

1609
01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:56,611
uh, to a Corporal Levitz.

1610
01:31:57,437 --> 01:31:58,438
Hey, Levitz!

1611
01:31:59,657 --> 01:32:00,702
Do me a favor,
park right here.

1612
01:32:00,745 --> 01:32:01,528
Yeah.

1613
01:32:13,976 --> 01:32:16,108
Shit, man. You Rangers
ever hear of callin'?

1614
01:32:16,152 --> 01:32:18,415
I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

1615
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:20,286
It could be worse.

1616
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:23,072
You could be actually working.

1617
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:24,726
All right, man.
I hear she's a real killer,

1618
01:32:24,769 --> 01:32:26,075
so just make sure
you muzzle her up good, okay?

1619
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:27,119
Yeah.

1620
01:32:28,904 --> 01:32:30,296
Don't worry.

1621
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,907
She ain't gonna be a problem.

1622
01:32:32,559 --> 01:32:33,430
Are you, girl?

1623
01:32:34,736 --> 01:32:37,913
Last time, okay? Last time.

1624
01:32:37,956 --> 01:32:39,697
Just gonna put it on
one more time.

1625
01:32:42,004 --> 01:32:44,093
Hey, man,
she's been doing a lot better.

1626
01:32:44,136 --> 01:32:48,401
So just make sure the vet techs, you
know, reevaluate her, give her a chance.

1627
01:32:48,445 --> 01:32:49,664
Yeah, yeah,
they got their protocol.

1628
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:52,667
You heard me. Make sure.

1629
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:57,062
So as soon as we're done here,
you're gonna call Captain Jones, yeah?

1630
01:32:57,106 --> 01:32:59,891
- That's what they're telling me.
- What are you... Look, man, are you trying to piss her off?

1631
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:09,422
All right. You're gonna
be okay, all right?

1632
01:33:09,466 --> 01:33:11,033
Come on, man,
I ain't got all day, let's go.

1633
01:33:11,076 --> 01:33:12,382
I'm just gonna
put this on you.

1634
01:33:19,215 --> 01:33:20,956
Give 'em hell.

1635
01:33:20,999 --> 01:33:22,000
All right, let's go.

1636
01:33:51,203 --> 01:33:52,639
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

1637
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:55,338
Come on.

1638
01:34:10,614 --> 01:34:12,747
God. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1639
01:34:24,106 --> 01:34:25,629
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1640
01:34:25,672 --> 01:34:27,370
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1641
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:29,285
Hi, hi, hi.
No. It's fine. It's fine.

1642
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:32,288
My bad. I should have... You know
what, I should have put a vest on her.

1643
01:34:32,331 --> 01:34:34,203
She listens more
when the vest is on.

1644
01:34:34,246 --> 01:34:36,031
You know girls
and their fashion.

1645
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:37,380
I'll be right back. Up!

1646
01:34:38,816 --> 01:34:39,774
Get there.

1647
01:34:41,514 --> 01:34:43,690
Sir, you forgot your ID.

1648
01:34:43,734 --> 01:34:47,042
Uh, you know what, man,
why don't you keep it?

1649
01:34:47,085 --> 01:34:48,086
Thank you for your service.

1650
01:34:50,872 --> 01:34:52,612
Hey, man, what about the dog?

1651
01:34:52,656 --> 01:34:55,528
What are you...
What are you looking at?

1652
01:34:55,572 --> 01:34:58,705
Let's not make this
all emotional, okay?

1653
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:20,118
Dear Lulu,

1654
01:35:23,905 --> 01:35:25,645
I got the adoption papers
from the army today.

1655
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:35,438
Riley would be so proud.

1656
01:35:38,354 --> 01:35:40,443
Maybe even of both of us.

1657
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,324
Look, I'm no good
at this poem stuff,

1658
01:35:52,368 --> 01:35:56,328
so I'll just
get to the damn point.

1659
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,376
Thanks.

1660
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:03,553
Thanks for saving my life.

1661
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:39,375
