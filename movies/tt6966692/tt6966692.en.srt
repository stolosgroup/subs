00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,726
- Yo, Tommy!
- Hey, taxi!

2
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,402
Cigars. Cigarettes.

3
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,406
Great idea.

4
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,084
Hello, New York.
I'm Bobby Rydell, and I'm glad to be here.

5
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,103
Thank you all
for coming to see us tonight.

6
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,757
It's Saturday night at the Copa.

7
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,423
We think you're gonna have
a great time tonight.

8
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,425
We're gonna do our best
to make sure of that.

9
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,222
As always, a very special thanks
to Mr. Jules Podell for having us out.

10
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,936

Here's my coat. And you see this here hat?

25
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,174
I want you to guard it with your life.

26
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,138
It was a gift from my mother.

27
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,060
Yes, Mr. Loscudo.

28
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,811
- Here, that's for you.

00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,684

- Hey, Carmine.

30
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,441
- How are you, pally?
- Good to see you.

31
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,984
Oh, thank you. That's unnecessary.

32
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,941
Come on, let's go. <i>Andiamo.</i>

33
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,494
I saw this kid Bobby Rydell
two and a half years ago in South Philly.

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,071
Nobody knew who he was.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,285
They know him now.

36
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,246
Hey, give me Loscudo's hat.

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,502
- But he said to guard it.
- I know. I heard.

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,506
Give it to me, all right?

39
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,918

Shut up.
She works here, all right, tough guy?

45
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,893
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,643

Do yourself a favor,
go home with your friends.

53
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,465
You don't tell me where to go.
You know who I am?

54
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,887
I'm going back in there.

You tell Juley Podell
if I don't get my hat,

61
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,431
I'm gonna burn this joint down!
You hear me?

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,482
Joe, it's gonna turn up.
I swear to God it's gonna turn up.

63
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,371
- Really?
- It'll turn up.

64
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,923
You tell that fat Jew bastard,

65
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,251
I don't get my hat,
I'll burn the Copa down.

66
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,096
I'm gonna have to go back
to driving garbage trucks.

67
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,511
Jesus Christ.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,017
Loscudo's out of his mind.

69
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,770
We earned our money tonight.

70
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,006
Lip,
I thought you were gonna kill that guy.

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,113
- Yeah.
- Better him than me.

72
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,127
So, what are you gonna do
while we're closed?

73
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,951
I don't know.
Maybe go work at my uncle's pizza joint.

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,665
You?

75
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,992
I'm gonna drink for two months.

76
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,750
Take me home, Lip.

77
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,709
- Hey, good luck.
- You, too.

78
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,840
See you, Carmine.

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,532
No, you shouldn't...
That should not happen.

80
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,637
No, I don't want to be a...

81
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,643
My hat.

82
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,062
Heard it was missing, so I looked into it.

83
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,393
I wanted to kill that broad.

84
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,225
No, no. It wasn't her fault.

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,652
Who had the balls to clip Gio's hat?

86
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,755
Don't worry about it. I took care of it.

87
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,486
Yeah, I hope you gave him some beating.

88
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,660
Here. Take this. Put it in your kick.

89
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,581
No. No, thanks.
It was a pleasure, Mr. Loscudo, really.

90
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,283
Bullshit. Take it.

91
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,162
And from now on,
you don't call me "Mr. Loscudo."

92
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,087
You hear me?

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,505
I'm your pal Gio.

94
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,253
Morning.

95
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,840
Good night.

96
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,034
<i>One down,
and the batter will be Roger Maris.</i>

97
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,328
- We need to get back in this.
<i>- The pitch to Maris. Curveball.</i>

98
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,309
Come on, Roger. Come on.

99
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,020
Come on, Roger, hit one out!

100
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,250
- Let's do it!
- Johnny, quiet.

101
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,793
- You're gonna jinx it.
- Come on, Roger.

102
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,184
Hey, Johnny.
Think you could yell a little louder?

103
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,611
- Maris is up.
- Yeah, so am I now.

104
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,795
What the hell are all you guys doing here?

105
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,367
- All right.
- We came over to keep Dolores company.

106
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,364
- Come on.
- Tony!

107
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,138
Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,520
- Come on, Roger, please.
- Let's do it, baby.

109
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,644
- I'll walk you out.
- Sure.

110
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,643
We need to get back in this ball game.

111
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,005
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

112
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,190
Any problems, give us a call.

113
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,067
Come on, come on, Roger.

114
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,259
<i>- The 1-2 pitch.</i>
- Come on, baby.

115
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,803
<i>The curve is hit deep into right field.</i>

116
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,999
We did it! We got it!

117
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,246
- Yeah!
- There it is!

118
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,372
Whoo!

119
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,294
- All right.
- 3-1, baby. 3-1.

120
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,919
- Coming back.
- Roger, baby, way to go!

121
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,295
- 3-1.
- Way to go!

122
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,590
Do it again. Let's do it again.

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Come on, baby.

124
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,761
No, Tony. Go get dressed. We're gonna eat.

125
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,805
All right.

126
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,103
No game seven, no game seven.

127
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,651
From thy bounty, through Christ our Lord.

128
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,657
- Amen.
- Amen.

129
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,914
And if anyone hears of a job for Tony,
let us know.

130
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,788
- Dolor.
- What?

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,878
Please.

132
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,044
What happened? Did you get fired?

133
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,588
- No.
- No.

134
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,006
The Copa's closing for repairs,

135
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,778
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

136
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,970
All the people he knows,
he'll find something in no time.

137
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,973
Well, he had a great job
at the sanitation department.

138
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,414
You shouldn't have punched out
the foreman.

139
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,398
He shouldn't have woke me up.

140
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,439
That's Tony.

141
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,553
I can't believe they lost.

142
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,068
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

143
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,785
That never happened before.

144
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,556
They're gonna win the World Series.

145
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,463
I'm telling you, this is gonna be the
easiest 50 bucks you're ever gonna make.

146
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,717
Yeah, we'll see.

147
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,383
Hey, there they are.

148
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,477
Hi, Johnny.

149
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,498
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie. How you doing?

150
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,060
I'm good, I'm good.
So, uh, Johnny here tells me

151
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,108
you ate 48 White Castle burgers
all in one sitting.

152
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,980
Cheeseburgers.

153
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,357
You tell him, Frankie.

154
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,447
I don't believe it.

155
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,648
What do we care if you believe it?

156
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,198
Hey, Gorman.
What's the record here for hot dogs?

157
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,244
Eighteen. Fat Paulie.

158
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,101
Why wasn't Lip in on that contest?

159
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,037
What contest? I was hungry.

160
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,834
Well, the bet's simple.

161
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,379
Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.

162
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,956
With toppings.

163
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,885
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

164
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,054
Hey, 2... Your left ass weighs 260.

165
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,678
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

166
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,728
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

167
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,235
Pick it up, Lip!
The baby elephant just hit 19!

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,232
Let's go, Lip! Let's go!

169
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,405
Come on, let's go, Lip!
Let's get this going!

170
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,448
You're embarrassing!

171
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,638
You're embarrassing your son!

172
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,574
He is killing you!

173
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,004
Hey, Nicky, you doing your homework?

174
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,422
- Yep.
- Good.

175
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,552
Where you been?

176
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,470
Gorman's.

177
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,847
I'm making dinner.

178
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,927
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks
he could eat more hot dogs than me.

179
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,097
He knocked off 24. Guy's an animal.

180
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,104
Are you crazy? You lost $50?

181
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,106
Dolores, please.

182
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,609
I ate 26.

183
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,199
You are so lucky.

184
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,447
You know that?

185
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,952
Rent is due on Monday.

186
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,539
You gonna get that?

187
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,130
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, Lip.</i>

188
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,760
Some guy called over here, a doctor.
He's looking for a driver.

189
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,799
- You interested?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

190
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,385
They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.

191
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,940
The address is, uh, 881 Seventh Avenue.

192
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,026
2:15.

193
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,331
Hey. Excuse me.

194
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,424
We're not open right now,

195
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,904
but you're welcome to purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.

196
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,512
Nah, that's all right.
Uh, I think I got the wrong address.

197
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,181
But, uh,
is there a doctor's office in here?

198
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,850
A doctor's office?

199
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,389
Dr. Shirley?

200
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,123
You have the correct address.

201
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,104
Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the hall.

202
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,572
How you doing?

203
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,375
I'm here for the driver job.

204
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,629
Tony Lip.

205
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,915
No "Tony Lip."

206
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,467
No, I should be on there.

207
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,385
Uh...

208
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,383
no.

209
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,591
Um, I have a Tony Val... Valle-la-la...

210
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,642
Vallelonga. Yeah. That's me.

211
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,893
- Fill it out while you wait.
- What?

212
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,562
Fill it out while you wait.

213
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,984
Oh. Yeah.

214
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,218
Have a seat.

215
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,077
Mr. Vallelonga. Sorry to keep you waiting.

216
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,376
Oh.

217
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,627
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

218
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,422
Tony.

219
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,251
Yes. Please sit down.

220
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,220
Some place you got here.

221
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,551
Are them horns real?

222
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,724
Elephant tusks, yes.

223
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,604
What about that?

224
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,305
Is that a molar?

225
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,481
- A what?
- A molar, like a shark tooth.

226
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,858
Or a tiger's maybe.

227
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,651
It was a gift.

228
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,238
I thought, uh...
I thought I was going to an office.

229
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,074
They said a doctor needed a driver.

230
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,906
That's all they told you?

231
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,331
Yeah.

232
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,410
Actually,
it's a bit more complicated than that.

233
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,454
Have you ever driven professionally
before?

234
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,215
Yeah. Sanitation.

235
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,051
Garbage trucks.

236
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,838
Plus, I drive my boss home at night.

237
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,641
But I can drive anything.
Limos. Tow trucks.

238
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,468
Snowplows. Whatever.

239
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,600
I see. What other experience do you have?

240
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,022
I worked a lot of joints.

241
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,350
Wagon Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa.

242
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,936
- In what capacity?
- What do you mean?

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,233
What did you do there?

244
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,782
Uh...

245
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,651
public relations.

246
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,913
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

247
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm a musician.

248
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,412
You mean, like, songs?

249
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,336
Yes. And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

250
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,209
the majority of which will be down south.

251
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,586
- Atlantic City.
- No.

252
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,338
The Deep South.

253
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,762
First, we're starting in the Midwest,
and then we're taking a hard left.

254
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,425
Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee,
and on down through the Delta.

255
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,511
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

256
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,647
No.

257
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,562
No, no, no. It was just the other day,

258
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,190
me and the wife had a couple
of colored guys over at the house.

259
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,067
For... For drinks.

260
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,238
Hmm. I see. You're married.

261
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,615
Yeah. Two kids.

262
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,199
I'm not sure this is the proper job
for a married man.

263
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,955
Why? Are we bringing broads?

264
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,171
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

265
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,964
No breaks, right up until Christmas.

266
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,166
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

267
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,928
Depends what you're paying.

268
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,051
A hundred dollars a week
plus room and board.

269
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:57,927
Hmm.

270
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,508
But let me be crystal clear.

271
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,303
I'm not just hiring a chauffeur.

272
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,351
I need someone
who can handle my itinerary,

273
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,682
be a personal assistant.

274
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,857
I need a valet.

275
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,983
I need someone who can launder my clothes
and shine my shoes.

276
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,406
Good luck, Doc.

277
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:19,955
Tony.

278
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,121
I had my record label ask around town
to find me the right man.

279
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,877
Your name came up more than once.

280
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,593
You've impressed several people
with your...

281
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,629
innate ability to handle trouble.

282
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,971
And that is why I called
and inquired about your availability.

283
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,354
Okay, here's the deal. I got no problem
being on the road with you.

284
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,479
But I ain't no butler.

285
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,778
I ain't ironing no shirts,
and I'm not polishing nobody's shoes.

286
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,026
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

287
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,178
You need someone to make sure
there's no problems along the way?

288
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,412
And believe me, you in the Deep South...
there's gonna be problems.

289
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,995
So, if you want me,
it's a buck and a quarter a week.

290
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,205
Or go hire that little chink
just pranced out of here,

291
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,377
see how far you get.

292
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,090
Well, Mr. Vallelonga...

293
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,294
thank you for stopping by.

294
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,526
Hey, Bobby.

295
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,519
Give me a Rheingold.

296
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,155
Ice cold.

297
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
Mr. Tony.

298
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,913
Augie asking about you.

299
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,463
- Come on! I'm dying of thirst over here.
- Shut up!

300
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm talking.

301
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,377
When?

302
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,464
Now. He in his box.

303
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,376
Tony Lip.

304
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,331
What the hell happened at the Copa?

305
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,917
I hear you almost split a guy's face open.

306
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,466
That guy you hit, Mikey Cerrone,

307
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,510
part of Charlie the Hand's crew.

308
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,508
Guess he should have known better.

309
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,014
Hand asked me to look into it.
I spoke to Podell.

310
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,768
Whole thing was, uh,
over a piece of ass, right?

311
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,946
Yeah.

312
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,782
Beef like that should never happen
inside the club.

313
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,859
They were out of line.

314
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,661
So we squashed it.

315
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,454
You, uh, looking to earn
a little extra <i>scharole</i>?

316
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,873
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

317
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,047
What do I gotta do?

318
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,883
Things.

319
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,553
Appreciate it, but, uh, I want to spend
some time with the family.

320
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,059
Don't be stupid.

321
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,126
You make yourself a few extra bucks,

322
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,476
you buy something nice
for that pretty little wife of yours.

323
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,442
Hmm.

324
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,443
Nah, I'm good. I'm flush right now.

325
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,671
Here's 50.

326
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,839
Here.
Pay me 60 by New Year's, you get it back.

327
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,137
Hey, Lip.

328
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,762
Everything okay?

329
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,720
What, you got beak trouble, Charlie?

330
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,934
Mind your business.

331
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,689
So, come on. I'm dying to hear.
What happened with the doctor interview?

332
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,238
He ain't a real doctor.
He's a piano player.

333
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,862
Well, I don't understand.
Why did they say that he was a doctor?

334
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,284
I don't know. I think he's, like,
a doctor of piano playing or something.

335
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,489
You can be that?

336
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,125
I guess.

337
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,284
He lives on top of Carnegie Hall.

338
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,370
You should've seen this place, Dee.

339
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,172
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

340
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,058
And he was sitting
on top of a friggin' throne

341
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,211
all dressed up like, uh...
like the king of the jungle bunnies.

342
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,097
He's colored?

343
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,260
Well, you wouldn't last a week with him.

344
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,020
For the right money, I would.

345
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,283
Yeah.

346
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,494
Oh.

347
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,036
Look...

348
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,832
Really?

349
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,908
- Uh, okay.
- Everything okay?

350
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,242
Okay, hang on a sec.

351
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,334
It's, uh, Dr. Shirley, the piano guy.

352
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,664
He wants to talk to you.

353
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,757
- Me?
- Yeah.

354
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,005
What? No.

355
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,254
- Come on. Take it.
- No. Tony...

356
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,759
Just... Just talk.

357
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,184
Hello?

358
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,557
Uh, good morning, Doctor.
It's nice to talk to you.

359
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,361
Well, uh, yes, that is a long time.

360
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,537
It is.

361
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,869
Yes. I'm sure.

362
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,770
<i>Thank you.</i>

363
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,410
Thank you for calling.

364
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,166
Bye now.

365
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,051
What'd he say?

366
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,132
He wanted to know if I'd be okay

367
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,011
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

368
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,681
He said he'd pay you what you asked for.

369
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,943
- Hey.
- Hmm?

370
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,359
It's good money.

371
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,325
We need it.

372
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,909
Can't be eating 26 hot dogs every day.

373
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,749
I know.

374
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,753
I told him it was okay for you to go.

375
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,995
All right. Hey, look.
So here's the first half of your pay.

376
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,893
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

377
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,512
No, I gotta get paid every week.

378
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,518
Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.

379
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,887
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

380
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,636
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

381
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,143
Well, then we got nothing to worry about.

382
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,526
Here's the deal, Mr. Vallelonga, okay?

383
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,772
It's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.

384
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,314
Now, if he misses any shows,
you're not getting your back end.

385
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,195
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

386
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,201
Oh, you're gonna need this.

387
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,183
Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.

388
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,007
Sometimes you guys are staying
in the same hotel, sometimes you're not.

389
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,206
- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

390
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,292
All right, don't let me down. Let's go.

391
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,178
<i>Marone</i>. Is this the new one?

392
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,883
Yeah, the record company rented it.

393
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,802
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

394
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,393
So, what'd my sister have to say
about you being gone for three weeks?

395
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,644
Eight weeks.

396
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,152
10-to-1, you slap this moolie out,
you come home in under a month.

397
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,523
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

398
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,937
- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

399
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,737
- All right. You gonna be good boys?
- Uh-huh.

400
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,431
- You'll listen to your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,831
Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.

402
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,620
I'm counting on youse.

403
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,203
- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

404
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,338
- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.

405
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,763
No. I mean, the record companies
gave me the maps and the itinerary

406
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,849
and this thing.

407
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,892
<i>The Negro Motorist's Green Book.</i>

408
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,249
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.

409
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,061
Like, uh, you know, traveling while black.

410
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,767
"Traveling while black"?

411
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,604
Yeah, if you're black
and you gotta travel for some reason.

412
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,189
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

413
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,450
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

414
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,495
- How are you gonna press your pants?
- I'll put 'em under the mattress.

415
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,916
I want you to write me a letter
every chance you get.

416
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,540
- I can't write letters.
- Yes, you can.

417
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,190
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

418
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,671
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

419
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:51,965
It ain't gonna be no good.

420
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,668
It's a lot cheaper
than calling long-distance, Tony.

421
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,336
Promise me you're gonna write.

422
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,139
I promise.

423
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,802
Dee, put this in the bank today.
It's half my pay.

424
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,064
Oh, here. There's a couple of sandwiches
for you and Dr. Shirley.

425
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,642
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

426
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,567
I will.

427
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,653
I love you.

428
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,822
I love you, too, baby.

429
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,492
You better be home for Christmas,
or don't come home at all.

430
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,082
I got it, Pop. I got it.

431
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,739
Hey. I'm Tony.

432
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,618
His driver.

433
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,953
Bum a smoke?

434
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,543
Thanks.

435
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,260
So you're the band?

436
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,139
Oleg. Cello.

437
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,304
George. Bass.

438
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,761
And we're not a band. We're a trio.

439
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,764
Oh. Trio. Right.

440
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,066
Good morning. Excuse me.

441
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,152
Morning.

442
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,925
Thank you, Amit.

443
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,255
Have a wonderful trip, sir.

444
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,997
Tony, the first thing I'd like you to do
when we arrive in the city...

445
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,814
- Hmm?
- ...is check the piano where I'm playing.

446
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,581
Make sure it's a Steinway
as per my contract.

447
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,969
And can you see to it
that there's a bottle of Cutty Sark

448
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,172
in my room every night?

449
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,183
Every night?

450
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,144
Well, if you ever need
any help with that.

451
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,850
I won't.

452
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,274
10:00 and 2:00 on the wheel, please.

453
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,614
Hey, Doc.

454
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,073
I noticed on the itinerary thing

455
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,531
the last show's on the 23rd of December,
right?

456
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,863
Birmingham, yes. It's a Christmas show.

457
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,870
So, any way we could, uh,
maybe hit the road early next morning

458
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,792
so we'd be home in time for Christmas Eve?

459
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,914
We'll see.

460
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,797
Appreciate it.

461
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,082
Could you put out the cigarette, please?

462
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Why?

463
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,086
I can't breathe back here.

464
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,077
What are you talking about?

465
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,809
Smoke's going in my lungs.
I'm doing all the work here.

466
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,895
Thank you.

467
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,864
What are you looking at?

468
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,614
You speak German, huh?

469
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,740
That was Russian.

470
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,701
Yeah,
I was stationed in Germany in the army.

471
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,529
I could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there.

472
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,377
Watch out for them krauts.

473
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,291
They're all snakes.

474
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,086
Kennedy should've bombed them
when he had the chance.

475
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,213
Plus now them Cuban bastards.

476
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,005
Ain't they supposed to be following us?

477
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,265
They have the itinerary.

478
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,951
As long as they get to the show on time,

479
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,102
I'm not worried about it,
and neither should you.

480
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,646
I ain't worried about nothin'.

481
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,977
In fact, when you see me worried,
you'll know.

482
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,089
- Tony.
- You'll know if I'm worried.

483
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,479
How about some quiet time?

484
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,068
- Hmm?
- Sure.

485
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,616
It's amazing you said that.

486
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,997
"How about some quiet time?"

487
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,784
Dolores, my wife,
used to say that all the time.

488
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,618
Well, not all the time, but, you know.

489
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,524
She says it when
I come home from work sometimes.

490
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,228
You know,
she's been with the kids all day,

491
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,671
and she'll say,
"Tony, how about some quiet time?"

492
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,757
Exactly like how you said it.
I mean, it's amazing.

493
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,438
How is that?

494
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,607
Salty.

495
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,700
Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?

496
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,817
No. Not really.

497
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,430
Why? Is there money in that?

498
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,869
I'm just saying you have a marvelous way
with words when describing food.

499
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,995
"Salty."

500
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,290
So vivid, one can almost taste it.

501
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,920
Hey, I'm just saying it's salty.
And salt's cheating.

502
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,005
Any cook can make things salty.

503
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,489
To make it taste good without the salt,

504
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,800
with just the other flavors,
that's the trick.

505
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,201
I mean, you take the basic ingredients...

506
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,468
We should get going soon if we expect
to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.

507
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,057
Hmm.

508
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,311
Hey, when I was in the army,
I knew a guy from Pittsburgh.

509
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,816
Except he called it Titsburgh.

510
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,025
'Cause he said all the women there
had huge tits.

511
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,866
That's absurd.

512
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,053
Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breasts

513
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,490
than, say, women in New York?

514
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,866
Guess we'll find out, huh?

515
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,455
Hey, you know, when you first hired me,

516
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,064
my wife went out
and bought one of your records.

517
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,579
The one about the orphans.

518
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,755
Orphans?

519
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,340
Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.

520
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,425
Orpheus.

521
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,223
Yeah.

522
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,018
<i>Orpheus in the Underworld.</i>
It's based on a French opera.

523
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,475
And those weren't children on the cover.

524
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,023
Those were demons in the bowels of hell.

525
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,358
No shit? Must have been naughty kids.

526
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,286
What are... What are you doing?

527
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,622
Gotta take a leak, Doc.

528
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,298
Here? Now?

529
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,001
You want me to piss my pants?

530
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,706
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

531
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,590
Take this for any incidentals we may need.

532
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,241
If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.

533
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,131
Just keep the receipts, please.

534
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,016
When it runs low, let me know.

535
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,514
Oh. Thanks.

536
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,979
One more thing.

537
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,067
We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts,

538
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,631
interacting with some of the wealthiest

539
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,612
and most highly educated people
in the country.

540
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,650
It is my feeling that your diction,

541
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,569
however charming it may be
in the tri-state area,

542
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,655
could use some... finessing.

543
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,245
You mean diction... like in what way?

544
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,748
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

545
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,750
Okay.

546
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,833
Your intonation, inflection,
your choice of words.

547
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,297
Hey, I got my own problems.

548
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,880
Now I gotta worry about
what people think about the way I talk?

549
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,535
There are simple techniques
I can teach you that are quite effective.

550
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,390
I can help you.

551
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,093
I... I don't need no goddamn help.

552
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,468
People don't like the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

553
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,603
The profanity is another issue.

554
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,185
<i>Fanabola</i>. Why are you breaking my balls?

555
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,144
Because you can do better, Mr. Vallelonga.

556
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,480
Which brings me to one more point.

557
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,610
As the guest of honor, I'll be introduced
when entering these intimate events.

558
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,320
You will be introduced as well.

559
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:52,537
In my humble opinion, "Vallelonga"
may be difficult to pronounce.

560
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,869
So, I was thinking

561
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,024
"Valle" would be more appropriate.

562
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,631
Tony Valle. Short and sweet.

563
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,800
Eh... nah.

564
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,366
They got a problem with "Vallelonga,"
they can call me Tony Lip.

565
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,173
These are genteel people.

566
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,679
"Tony the Lip" may be a little...

567
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,061
worldly for them.

568
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,138
Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga.

569
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,775
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

570
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,148
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

571
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,078
you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?

572
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,676
They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.

573
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,816
I'll just wait outside.

574
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,698
A sound compromise.

575
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,222
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

576
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,221
to present a great American artist.

577
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,934
He gave his first public performance
at the age of three.

578
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,558
At age 18, at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,

579
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,565
our guest made his concert debut
with the Boston Pops.

580
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:08,284
He holds doctorates in psychology,
in music, and in the liturgical arts,

581
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,363
and he has performed at the White House
twice in the past 14 months.

582
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,870
He is a true virtuoso.

583
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,541
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

584
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,963
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

585
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,464
Means, uh, he's really good.

586
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:28,172
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the Don Shirley Trio.

587
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,140
...a new pair of shoes!

588
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,524
- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!

589
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,009
It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.

590
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,194
You cheating, brother!

591
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,197
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

592
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,574
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

593
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,996
I work for the record company.

594
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,602
Yeah, I work for the record company, too.

595
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,037
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on, man.

596
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,164
Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot, huh?

597
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,745
I'm sorry, fellas. Duty calls.

598
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,580
- Come on, man.
- Duty calls?

599
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,375
My man, my duty is to get my money back.

600
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,255
I've been looking for you.

601
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,804
Yeah, sorry.
The guys were having a little game.

602
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,924
Next time you need extra money,
just ask me.

603
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,388
It's more fun winning it.

604
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,095
And what if you lost?

605
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,731
Craps and cards, I don't lose, Doc.

606
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,228
I don't lose.

607
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,766
So, stooping down in the gravel,

608
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,937
pitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?

609
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,615
What are you giving me shit for?
Everybody was doing it.

610
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,573
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

611
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,206
You did.

612
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,576
Now wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

613
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,900
<i>Dear Dolores, how are you?</i>

614
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,526
<i>I am fine.</i>

615
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,072
"I'm eating real good. Hamburgers mostly.

616
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,067
So don't worry about me not eating good.

617
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,117
I saw Dr. Shirley play the piano tonight.

618
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,619
He don't play like a colored guy.

619
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,122
He plays like Liberace, but better.

620
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,249
He's like a genius, I think.

621
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,748
When I look at him in the rearview mirror,

622
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,505
I can tell he's always thinking
about stuff in his head.

623
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,840
I guess that's what geniuses do.

624
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,634
But it don't look fun to be that smart.

625
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,385
I miss you very, very much."

626
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,028
- Who is this?
- Who?

627
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,568
On the radio.

628
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,285
Little Richard.

629
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,153
Really? That's Little Richard?

630
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,247
Yeah.

631
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,340
Think you could play something like that,
Doc?

632
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,497
I don't know. Sounds fairly complicated.

633
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,333
Got that right.

634
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,458
So, where did this
"Tony the Lip" moniker come from?

635
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,510
It's not "Tony <i>the</i> Lip."

636
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,801
It's "Tony Lip." One word.

637
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,098
I got it when I was a kid,

638
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,427
'cause my friend said I was
the best bullshit artist in the Bronx.

639
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,012
Why are you smiling?

640
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,648
What do you mean?

641
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,396
It doesn't bother you that your friends,

642
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,773
the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

643
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,152
Who said "liar"? I said "bullshit artist."

644
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,698
And what's the difference?

645
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,902
'Cause I don't lie. Ever.

646
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,821
I'm just good at talking people into,
you know,

647
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,372
doing things they don't want to do.

648
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,033
By bullshitting them.

649
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,626
And you're proud of that?

650
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,412
Well, it got me this job.

651
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,428
Wait a minute. You're full of shit.
You never heard of Chubby Checker?

652
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,349
Of course I've heard of him.
I've just never heard his music before.

653
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,097
But I like this. This is nice.

654
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,101
- He's got a silky voice, very smooth.
- Yeah, he's terrific.

655
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,752
This is what everybody's dancing to now.

656
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,438
- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.

657
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,904
You know this song.

658
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,191
I don't think so, no.

659
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,994
How could you not know this music?
Aretha Franklin.

660
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,706
Chubby Checker, Little Richard, Sam Cooke.

661
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,375
I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.

662
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,995
Do you want anything?
I'm getting a pack of smokes.

663
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,019
No, thank you.

664
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,917
Grabbed the rock and put it in his pocket.

665
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,011
Thank you, Oleg.

666
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,338
Nice turtleneck. Way to mix it up.

667
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,351
Got you an apple, Doc.

668
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,692
Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.

669
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,614
- Yeah?
- Oleg told me what you did.

670
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,948
What'd I do?

671
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,402
You stole a jade stone from the store.

672
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,532
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

673
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,455
I didn't steal no stone.

674
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,373
You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.

675
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,453
I picked up a rock off of the ground.
I didn't steal from a box.

676
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,441
Now, why would you pick up a rock
off the ground?

677
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,465
I don't know.

678
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,755
'Cause it ain't stealing.
It's just a regular rock.

679
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,507
And why would you want a regular rock?

680
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,715
To have. For luck maybe.

681
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,889
A lucky rock.

682
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,387
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

683
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,740
Mm-mm.

684
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,904
Take it back and pay for it.

685
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,183
I told you that kraut was a snake.

686
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,494
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!

687
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,562
Pay for the stone, Tony.
You'll feel better.

688
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:00,206
I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rock I found in the dirt.

689
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,300
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

690
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,472
Put it back.

691
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,455
- Feel better?
- No.

692
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,788
If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.

693
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,829
Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.

694
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,663
Excuse me. Sir.

695
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,087
- I'm with the band.
- You're all set up.

696
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,590
This isn't the piano, right?

697
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,676
That's it.

698
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,255
It ain't a Steinway.

699
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,253
So what?

700
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,216
Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.

701
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,925
It's in his written contract.

702
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,430
Who's Dr. Shirley?

703
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,605
Dr. Shirley. The Don Shirley Trio.
They're playing tonight.

704
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,898
Does it really matter?

705
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,526
Yeah, it does. It's in his contract.

706
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,938
Come on, man.

707
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,445
These coons can play on anything
you put in front of 'em.

708
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,245
But it's a piece of shit.

709
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,868
And there's garbage in there.

710
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,292
So take it out.

711
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,252
What'd you say?

712
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,214
You heard me.

713
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,886
Hey. You got two, three hours.
Just get a clean Steinway in here.

714
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,806
- There ain't a Steinway on campus.
- Not my problem.

715
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,250
I bet there's not two Steinways
in the whole state of Indiana.

716
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,595
I guess you'd better move your ass, then.

717
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,726
Who you think you're talking to,
greaseball?

718
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,091
<i>Dear Dolores,</i>

719
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,845
<i>this morning I had steak and eggs
for breakfast.</i>

720
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,394
<i>The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.</i>

721
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,397
<i>Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.</i>

722
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,520
<i>But sometimes I think he gets sad,</i>

723
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,693
<i>and that's why he drinks too much.</i>

724
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,694
<i>I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.</i>

725
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,775
<i>Now that I'm seeing it, I know.</i>

726
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:19,784
<i>You won't believe how beautiful nature is.
It is as beautiful as they say.</i>

727
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,955
<i>And the traffic out here in the country
is nothing, which is fine by me.</i>

728
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,625
<i>Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner</i>

729
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,423
<i>that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.</i>

730
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,675
<i>We are heading down south now.</i>

731
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,845
<i>I will write you another letter
when we get down south.</i>

732
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,639
<i>I love you. Your husband, Tony.</i>

733
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,683
<i>PS. Kiss the kids for me.</i>

734
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,894
Got any family, Doc?

735
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,444
Not really.

736
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,239
Not really? Either you do or you don't.

737
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,443
It's a long story, Tony.

738
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,453
What, we're in a hurry now?

739
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,958
Let's hear it.

740
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,081
I have a brother somewhere.

741
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,084
We used to get together once in a while,

742
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,791
but it got more and more difficult
to stay in touch.

743
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,669
Curse of being a musician, I guess.

744
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,171
Always on the road.

745
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,723
Like a carnival worker.

746
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,801
- Hmm.
- Or a criminal.

747
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,729
Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.

748
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,935
- You're married?
- Was.

749
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,266
June.

750
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,028
Good person.
Terrible grammar, but a kind soul.

751
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,780
You'd quite like her.

752
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,075
June. Like, uh... like Lassie's mom.

753
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,741
Unfortunately, I couldn't do a husband act
and a concert pianist act.

754
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,286
Couldn't seem to manage both worlds.

755
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,207
Kentucky fried chicken!

756
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,755
In Kentucky!
When's that ever gonna happen?

757
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,732
All right!

758
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,776
Hey, you want some?

759
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,103
- I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.
- All right.

760
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,407
Mmm. I think this is the best
Kentucky fried chicken I ever had.

761
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,922
Probably 'cause it's fresher down here,
right?

762
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,324
I don't think I've ever met anyone
with your appetite.

763
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,161
No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.

764
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,837
I've never had fried chicken in my life.

765
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,665
Who you bullshitting?

766
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,589
You people love the fried chicken,
the grits, and the collard greens.

767
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,170
I love it, too.

768
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,348
Negro cooks used to make it all the time
when I was in the army.

769
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,767
You have a very narrow assessment of me,
Tony.

770
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,969
Yeah, right? I'm good.

771
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,019
No. No, you're not good. You're bad.

772
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,522
I'm saying, just because other Negroes
enjoy certain types of music,

773
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,853
it doesn't mean I have to.

774
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,610
- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

775
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,448
If you said all guineas like pizza
and spaghetti and meatballs,

776
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,618
I'm not gonna get insulted.

777
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,071
You're missing the point.

778
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,125
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

779
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,783
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

780
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,294
Here. Come on.

781
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,377
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

782
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,251
- Huh?
- It smells okay.

783
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,459
I prefer not to get grease on my blanket.

784
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,386
Ooh, I'm gonna get grease on my blankey!

785
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,158
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

786
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,468
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

787
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,675
Take it. I'm throwing it in the back.

788
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,852
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

789
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,475
How? Do you have plates or utensils?

790
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,227
<i>Baffangul!</i> Eat it with your hands!

791
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,003
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

792
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,815
Eat it. Come on. Take it. I gotta drive.
10:00 and 2:00 on the wheel.

793
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,299
- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...

794
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,763
Come on, come on.

795
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,152
There you go.

796
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,118
Huh?

797
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,244
I... I can't do this, Tony.

798
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,287
Eat the goddamn thing!

799
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,249
Jesus.

800
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,801
What, no good?

801
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,090
Mmm.

802
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,221
It just seems...

803
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,936
so un... unsanitary.

804
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,264
Who gives a shit?

805
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,349
Just relax and enjoy it.

806
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,064
You know, my father used to say...

807
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,606
"Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent."

808
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,863
When you work, work.
When you laugh, laugh.

809
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,536
When you eat,
eat like it's your last meal.

810
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,533
You want another piece?
Here. Have a breast.

811
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Delicious.

812
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,495
Take it. Here you go.

813
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,039
What do we do about the bones?

814
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,261
We do this.

815
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,428
This is what we do.

816
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,732
There you go.

817
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,786
What's the big deal, Doc?
The squirrels would've ate it anyway.

818
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,703
Pick it up, Tony.

819
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,183
Nature takes care of the earth.

820
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,994
- Pick it up.
- Ah, jeez.

821
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,279
This can't be right.

822
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,161
It says right here,
"Cozy as your own home."

823
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,293
Place looks like my ass.

824
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,041
This is the place.

825
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,178
The square one, please.

826
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,633
- Just this one?
- Thank you.

827
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,681
Hey, uh, if you need anything,

828
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,641
I'll be right up the street
at the Easton Inn.

829
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,694
Thank you, Tony.

830
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,775
Hey, Floyd, we ready.

831
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,531
I told you I can't play. My shoulder.

832
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,157
You and that damn shoulder.

833
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,117
Hey! Hey, fancy-pants. You want to play?

834
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,081
I beg your pardon?

835
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,003
Come on, brother. We short a man.

836
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,707
Oh, I'd rather not.

837
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,589
What, you too high and mighty?

838
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,671
No, no, let him alone. Let him alone.

839
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,552
He just afraid of getting
that butler uniform a little dusty.

840
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:54,976
Mm.

841
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,351
I'm just, um...

842
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,351
I'm on my way to meet a friend.

843
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,312
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.

844
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,612
Floyd, come on, man.

845
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,690
Shut your ass up, man, and leave me alone!

846
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:40,438
Mmm.

847
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,190
Eh.

848
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,561
"Vacation without aggravation."

849
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
Hmm.

850
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,661
"Delightful dinners
for particular people."

851
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,502
- Yeah?
- Get up. It's George.

852
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,749
Get up.

853
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,124
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

854
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,255
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

855
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,511
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

856
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,558
and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

857
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,132
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

858
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,680
Who let him out of his cage?

859
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,558
And they put that little tie on him, too.

860
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,917
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

861
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,562
Get your hands off him.

862
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,189
What in the good goddamn we got here,
fellas?

863
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,367
Hand him over. We walk out.
Won't be a problem.

864
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,953
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

865
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,621
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

866
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,874
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

867
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,873
We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.

868
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,670
Listen, assholes.

869
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,169
Do yourselves a favor and let him go.

870
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,093
Now!

871
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,636
Say it nice.

872
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,218
I just said it nice.

873
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,969
This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

874
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,432
And you, you ain't got no say.

875
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,028
Maybe. But whatever happens here,

876
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,825
I'm gonna put a bullet
right in the middle of your thick skull.

877
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,662
He ain't got no gun, Ray.
He's full of shit.

878
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,032
What if he ain't?

879
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,837
Well, I sure ain't.

880
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,300
And I ain't about to let this come to pass
in my place.

881
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,839
Let the spook go. Let him go.

882
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,934
Come on.

883
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,478
Get him out of here.

884
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,230
I want these Yankees off of my property.

885
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,774
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

886
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,897
I got you, Doc.

887
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,481
Go on.

888
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,621
You out of your mind?

889
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,122
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put you in that position.

890
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,248
Wait, wait, wait.

891
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,000
Are you gonna throw up again?

892
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,921
I'm okay.

893
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,257
Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.

894
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,974
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

895
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,011
I just needed some air.

896
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,434
Air? Do you know where you are?

897
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,896
Does geography really matter?

898
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,358
What?

899
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,611
If I was in a bar in your neighborhood,

900
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,360
would the conversation be any different?

901
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,077
From now on,
you don't go nowhere without me.

902
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,905
Nowhere!

903
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,748
- Got it?
- I understand.

904
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,669
Where's your room?

905
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,254
Tony.

906
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,256
What?

907
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,212
Do you really have a gun?

908
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,134
Of course not.

909
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,926
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

910
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,053
- Come on.
- There it is.

911
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,146
Over there?

912
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,889
You gotta get to bed, Doc.

913
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,689
You got a big show tomorrow night.
Come on.

914
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,874
Thank you.

915
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,298
Louisville.

916
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,754
Thank you for your warm hospitality.

917
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,679
Thank you. Thank you.

918
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,399
Don't be lazy, Tony. Enunciate.

919
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,648
- I am.
- Betty bought a bit of better butter

920
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,633
- to make the bitter butter better.
- Betty bought...

921
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,991
B-Bought...
Betty bought butta-er... butta...

922
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,535
Who says that? Butta-er.

923
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,308
You have to start somewhere,
Tony. A singer does vocal exercises.

924
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,244
An athlete warms up before they rehearse.

925
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,166
Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.

926
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,630
Ah, shit.

927
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:47,505
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guest from the far north,

928
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,088
Don Shirley.

929
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,813
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,

930
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:00,266
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,

931
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,103
and his associate Tony Valle...

932
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,279
Valle... Vallelong-longia.

933
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,195
Oh, this is my lovely wife, Margaret.

934
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,998
If you gentlemen don't mind,
we're going to steal Donnie away

935
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,746
for some, uh, introductions.

936
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,376
I'd like you all to meet Don Shirley.

937
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,924
Yeah. I'll take one.

938
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,343
- What's that?
- A pimento-and-cheese sandwich, sir.

939
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,011
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

940
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:32,889
Oof.

941
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,483
Sorry. Not for me.

942
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:54,158
Earlier this week, we asked our help
what Mr. Shirley might like for supper.

943
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,245
So the boys in the kitchen whipped up
a special menu in honor of our guest.

944
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,710
Gentlemen.

945
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,411
Home-cooked fried chicken.

946
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,628
There we go.

947
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,926
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

948
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,546
Thank you. Thank you.

949
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,215
We'll return after a brief intermission.

950
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,470
Excuse me, Don.

951
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,591
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

952
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,300
Uh, are you looking for the commode?

953
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,914
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

954
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:02,225
It's right out there before that pine.

955
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,440
I'd prefer not to use that.

956
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,740
Well, don't be silly, Don.
It looks a lot worse from the outside.

957
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,492
And I suppose you'd know from experience.

958
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,410
Well, I've never had any complaints.

959
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,044
Well, I could return to my motel
and use the facilities there...

960
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,547
but that would take
at least a half an hour.

961
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,094
We don't mind waiting.

962
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,091
Why don't I just pull over?
You can piss in the woods.

963
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,059
Animals go in the woods.

964
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,916
It's gonna be at least 20 minutes
I gotta go all the way back to your motel.

965
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,728
So let's just get there
so I can go back and finish the show.

966
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,731
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

967
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,257
I'd have zero problem going in the woods.

968
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,281
I'm well aware.

969
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,359
What are you sore at me for?
I don't make the rules down here.

970
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,287
No? Then who does?

971
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,292
Oh. You're saying
just 'cause I'm white and they're white?

972
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,356
You know, that's a very prejudiced thing
you just said there.

973
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,996
A very prejudiced thing.

974
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,878
I got more in common with the hymies
at Second Avenue Deli

975
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,960
than I do with these hillbilly pricks
down here.

976
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,214
Eyes on the road.

977
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,843
You always say that
when you don't like what I'm saying.

978
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,343
Eyes on the road.

979
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,187
I don't get it.

980
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:28,016
How does he smile
and shake their hands like that?

981
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,820
They try to pull that outhouse shit on me,
I'd piss right on the living room floor.

982
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,943
Don't... Don't do that.

983
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,736
We have many concert dates left.

984
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,907
Yeah? So?

985
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,085
You realize we're contractually obliged
to perform them?

986
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,585
Of course I do.
You don't play, we don't get paid.

987
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,510
What's your point?

988
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,678
Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,

989
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,880
so control yourself.

990
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,512
Don't lecture me, you rat.

991
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,350
Dr. Shirley could have stayed up north

992
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,104
getting rear end kissed at Park Avenue
parties for three times money.

993
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,773
But he ask for this.

994
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:19,826
Why?

995
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,343
What on God's green earth are you doing?

996
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,225
A letter.

997
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,722
Looks more like a piecemeal ransom note.

998
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,099
May I?

999
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,737
"Dear Dolores."

1000
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,322
D-E-A-R.

1001
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,650
This is an animal.

1002
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,862
"I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens of the town.

1003
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,166
People that use big words, all of them.

1004
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,085
But you know me. I get by.

1005
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,746
I'm a good bullshitter."

1006
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,748
Two T's in "bullshitter."

1007
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,427
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

1008
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,889
and I'm starting to get thirsty.

1009
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,931
I washed my socks
and dried them on the TV.

1010
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,055
I should have brung the iron."

1011
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,560
You know this is pathetic, right?

1012
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,470
Tell me what you're trying to say.

1013
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,195
I don't know.

1014
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,193
You know, I miss her and shit.

1015
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,444
Then say that.

1016
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,902
But do it in a manner
that no one else has ever done it before.

1017
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,954
And without the profanity.

1018
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,664
Something like, uh...

1019
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:51,788
Put this down.

1020
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,038
Dear Dolores.

1021
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,498
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

1022
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,336
D-E-A-R Dolores.

1023
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,172
When I think of you...

1024
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,765
I'm reminded
of the beautiful plains of Iowa.

1025
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,433
What planes?

1026
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,477
The plains.

1027
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,692
P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big fields we saw.

1028
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,816
Oh. Yeah, those were nice.

1029
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,406
Plains.

1030
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,576
Which is what they call

1031
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,159
big fields around here.

1032
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,872
Tony, no expounding.

1033
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,204
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

1034
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,831
No good.

1035
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,838
The distance between us...

1036
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,212
is breaking my spirit.

1037
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,170
Between us...

1038
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,967
My time and experiences without you
are meaningless to me.

1039
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,857
Falling in love with you
was the easiest thing I've ever done.

1040
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:02,025
Falling... in love... with you...

1041
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,569
This is very fucking romantic.

1042
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,160
<i>...was the easiest thing
I have ever done.</i>

1043
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,954
<i>Nothing matters to me but you,</i>

1044
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,787
<i>and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.</i>

1045
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:19,042
<i>I loved you the day I met you,
I love you today,</i>

1046
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,292
<i>and I will love you the rest of my life.</i>

1047
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,804
So, can I put, uh, "PS. Kiss the kids"?

1048
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,890
A PS?

1049
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,553
Yeah, like, at the end.

1050
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,600
That's like clanging a cowbell
at the end of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1051
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,144
Right. And that's good?

1052
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,231
It's perfect, Tony.

1053
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:49,239
Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.

1054
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,661
It wasn't even the greatest catch
in the Polo Grounds.

1055
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,913
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,
second game of the World Series.

1056
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,710
Final out, 500 feet...

1057
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,673
You like that, Doc?

1058
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,126
That's a handsome suit.

1059
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,630
- Sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

1060
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,012
Guy looks just like you.

1061
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,427
He does?

1062
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,431
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1063
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,098
It is about a 42.

1064
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,144
- Why don't you try it on?
- Hmm.

1065
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,445
What, you gotta wear a tuxedo
on stage every night?

1066
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,864
You could mix it up a little, Doc.

1067
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,488
Come on, let's see how it looks on you.
We got plenty of time.

1068
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,123
I'll be right back.

1069
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,412
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1070
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,587
Yeah, we want to try on that, uh,
beautiful gray suit in the window.

1071
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,126
- You got it in a 42?
- Of course.

1072
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:48,637
That's the one.

1073
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,462
Dressing room is in the back, sir.

1074
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,382
Thank you. I'll be just a moment.

1075
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,264
Take your time, Doc.
I'll check out some ties for you.

1076
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,732
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, you're not allowed to try that on.

1077
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,981
I beg your pardon?

1078
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:09,816
Uh, if you'd like to purchase it first,
we'd be happy to tailor it to your needs.

1079
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,495
I see.

1080
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Ah!

1081
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,098
Yeah.

1082
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:19,895
That's me.

1083
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,196
Hey, Officer.
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.

1084
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,078
Come on.

1085
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,416
His friend's here.

1086
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,087
Thank you.

1087
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,051
Get a guy a towel, for Christ's sake.

1088
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,303
- You a lawyer?
- No.

1089
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,408
Well, you should call one.

1090
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,094
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1091
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,392
Manager caught him and the other guy.

1092
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,723
Well, can we get the cuffs off him,

1093
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,059
let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?

1094
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,689
Sure, we could.

1095
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
But we ain't.

1096
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,234
Okay, look,
we're out of here tomorrow morning.

1097
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,443
You'll never see us again.

1098
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,074
There's gotta be something we can do
to work this out.

1099
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,617
What if you let him go
and I give you something to thank you?

1100
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,540
You bribing us?

1101
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,496
No. Hell, no.

1102
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,798
A gift. A thank-you.

1103
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,088
What kind of thank-you?

1104
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,337
Like a...

1105
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,342
You know, donation to the police force.

1106
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,513
Youse guys.

1107
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,518
Whatever you want.

1108
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,144
You like suits?

1109
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,809
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1110
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,141
and I seen a store that was selling suits.

1111
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,563
Primo suits.

1112
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,818
What if, as a thank-you... a donation...

1113
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,027
I buy youse each a suit?

1114
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,824
You get all dressed up,
you take the wife out for dinner.

1115
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,491
I mean, guys like you, you work hard.
You deserve it.

1116
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,316
They were wrong for the way
they treated me, and you rewarded them.

1117
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,139
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1118
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,091
How I do it shouldn't matter to you.

1119
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,767
I just wish you hadn't paid 'em off.

1120
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,186
I did what I had to do.

1121
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,751
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1122
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,856
Okay, Tony.

1123
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,026
I need you to stop it
with the phony altruism

1124
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,445
and concern for my career.

1125
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,026
What the hell does that mean?

1126
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,996
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1127
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,819
because you know if I miss a show,
it'll come out of your pocketbook.

1128
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,030
Of course I don't want you to miss a show,
you ungrateful bastard.

1129
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,865
You think I'm doing this for my health?

1130
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,333
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1131
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,582
So show a little appreciation maybe.

1132
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,502
Besides, I told you
never to go nowhere without me!

1133
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,090
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1134
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,504
Want me to get some makeup or something
for the show tomorrow?

1135
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,960
No, I'm fine.

1136
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,216
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1137
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,592
I said I'm fine.

1138
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,101
Okay.

1139
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,504
He didn't ask me to do that.

1140
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,408
I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.

1141
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,607
He didn't ask me.

1142
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,314
Oh. Tony Lip.

1143
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,651
Dominic, Mags.
What the hell you guys doing down here?

1144
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:05,826
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1145
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,200
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1146
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,358
I'm working here.

1147
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,327
Sorry, Doc.
They're some friends from New York.

1148
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,500
Hey, can you get Dr. Shirley's luggage?

1149
01:17:58,591 --> 01:17:59,591
All right.

1150
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,874
Called his room. Be down in a minute.

1151
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,544
- Hey, Doc.
- Where are you off to?

1152
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,343
I'm just going downstairs.
To have a drink.

1153
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:04,781
Tony.

1154
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,399
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1155
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,036
So...

1156
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,406
I'd like to formally offer you
the position of my road manager.

1157
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:18,748
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1158
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,750
that also means a raise in pay.

1159
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,423
No. No.

1160
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,591
No, thanks.

1161
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:32,057
We agreed on 125 a week, plus expenses.

1162
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,099
That's our deal, right?

1163
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,392
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1164
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,098
I was just going down to tell them.

1165
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:51,953
Tony.

1166
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,121
I'm sorry about last night.

1167
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,331
Don't worry about it.

1168
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,878
I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.

1169
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,429
I know it's a...

1170
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,299
complicated world.

1171
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,231
So, where'd you learn
how to play like that?

1172
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,325
My mother.

1173
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,655
- Your mother? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1174
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,284
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1175
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:43,329
Soon as I could walk,
we'd travel around the Florida Panhandle,

1176
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,589
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1177
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,092
Fortunately, a man who had seen me play

1178
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,754
arranged for me to study
at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music.

1179
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,386
I was the first Negro ever accepted there.

1180
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,343
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1181
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,599
Actually,
I was trained to play classical music.

1182
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:05,434
Brahms, Franz Liszt, Beethoven, Chopin.

1183
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,194
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1184
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,107
But I was persuaded by my record company

1185
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,909
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1186
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,781
They insisted that audiences
would never accept a Negro pianist

1187
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,285
on a classical stage.

1188
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,873
Wanted to turn me
into just another colored entertainer.

1189
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,878
You know,
the guy who's smoking while he's playing

1190
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,425
and sets a glass of whiskey on his piano

1191
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:35,722
and then complains because
he's not respected like Arthur Rubinstein.

1192
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:41,053
You don't see Arthur Rubinstein
putting a glass of whiskey on his piano.

1193
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,479
I don't know. Personally,
I think if you stuck to the classic stuff,

1194
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,059
it would've been a big mistake.

1195
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:52,364
A mistake? Performing the music
I trained my entire life to play?

1196
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,070
Trained? What are you, a seal?

1197
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,068
People love what you do.

1198
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,496
Anyone could sound like Beethoven
or "Joe Pan"

1199
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,118
or them other guys you said.

1200
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,668
But your music, what you do...

1201
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,422
only you can do that.

1202
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:13,839
Thank you, Tony.

1203
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,679
But not everyone can play Chopin.

1204
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,012
Not like I can.

1205
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,940
<i>The trees have shed
their leafy clothing,</i>

1206
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,818
and their colors have faded
to grays and browns.

1207
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,201
"I saw millions of trees
all dusted with snow,

1208
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,994
just like out of a fairy tale."

1209
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,992
He's so expressive.

1210
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,664
Got to admit, Lip's letters,
they're not bad.

1211
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:47,994
Oh, well, it's in the family.

1212
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,706
They say our great-great-great-grandfather

1213
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,041
helped da Vinci with the Sixteen Chapel.

1214
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,548
- You mean Michelangelo.
- Right.

1215
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,879
What does Michelangelo have to do
with writing letters?

1216
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,556
I'm just saying, we're an arty family.

1217
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:05,057
"I will count the hours,
minutes, and seconds

1218
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,139
until you are in my arms.

1219
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,064
Love you, Tony.

1220
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,642
PS. Kiss the kids."

1221
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,645
- John!
- Yeah?

1222
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,817
I want a letter.

1223
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,983
Yeah, soon as you make a meal.

1224
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,216
Eyes forward, Tony.

1225
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,783
Tony.

1226
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,739
All right, everybody.
Let's give our finest Louisiana welcome

1227
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,700
to Don Shirley and the Don Shirley Trio.

1228
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,646
Your mother's ass.

1229
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,278
Can't see shit.

1230
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,202
What the hell's this guy doing?

1231
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,620
Son of a bitch.

1232
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,101
License and papers.

1233
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,603
Am I glad to see you!

1234
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,526
We had to turn off the main road,
and, uh, now we're lost.

1235
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,279
Step out of the car.

1236
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,157
- What'd I do?
- Out of the car.

1237
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,754
Why are you on this road?

1238
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,467
I told you.
We had to make a detour, and we got lost.

1239
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,136
And why are you driving <i>him</i>?

1240
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,135
He's my boss.

1241
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,027
He can't be out here at night.
This a sundown town.

1242
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:01,778
What's that?

1243
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,859
Get him out of the car and check his ID.

1244
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,160
Oh, come on. It's pouring rain.

1245
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,243
Sir, I can just get it right here
through the window.

1246
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,665
Get him out of the car.

1247
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,785
Come on, get out now.
Get out now. Get out.

1248
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,205
Got ID?

1249
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,008
How you say this last name?

1250
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,170
Vallelonga.

1251
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,303
- Yeah, what kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

1252
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:34,980
Oh. Oh, I see.
That's why you're driving him around.

1253
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,604
You're half a nigger yourself.

1254
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,358
Hands in the air! Now! Now!

1255
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:47,702
Excuse me.

1256
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,660
Excuse me, sirs.

1257
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,628
I understand
why my associate is being held,

1258
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:01,047
but what exactly am I being charged with?

1259
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,802
You seem like reasonable men.

1260
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:08,930
Perhaps you could let me out

1261
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,972
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1262
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,176
Just put the apple butter away, boy.

1263
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,853
You ain't going nowhere no time soon.

1264
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,432
You cannot hold me without cause.

1265
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:20,733
Oh, I got cause.

1266
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,686
'Cause you let the sun
set on your black ass.

1267
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,319
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1268
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,366
I want my call.

1269
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,741
This is a flagrant violation of my rights.

1270
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,910
You know...

1271
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,415
he does have, uh, rights.

1272
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,677
Give the Negro his goddamn phone call.

1273
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,638
You happy?

1274
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,055
You know a lawyer?

1275
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:57,772
Call him.

1276
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:12,482
I walk up to the car and I say,
"Sir, you know how fast you were goin'?"

1277
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:15,284
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer.
I didn't mean to speed, but"...

1278
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,332
As my mother always said,
"What kind of brand-new fool are you?"

1279
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,493
Look at them over there.

1280
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,355
Take a good look at the officer you hit.

1281
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:26,124
Look at him.
He's over there having a grand old time,

1282
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:30,383
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1283
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,380
And where are you?

1284
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,433
In here, with me, who did nothing.

1285
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,219
Yet I'm the one who pays the price.

1286
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,646
I'm the one who's gonna miss
the Birmingham show.

1287
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:44,146
Hey, I'm gonna lose a lot of money, too,
if you don't play Birmingham.

1288
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,400
So, that little temper tantrum,
was it worth it?

1289
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,490
Hmm?

1290
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,400
You never win with violence, Tony.

1291
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,077
You only win
when you maintain your dignity.

1292
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,951
Dignity always prevails.

1293
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,833
And tonight, because of you, we did not.

1294
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:09,421
I wouldn't touch that mattress, Doc.

1295
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,798
Maryville Police.

1296
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,100
No, sir.

1297
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,642
No, no, I... I'm not, sir.

1298
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,520
Yes, sir. He's right here, sir. Yes, sir.

1299
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,190
Yes, sir.

1300
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,025
Gimme.

1301
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:26,855
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1302
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,529
Baloney.

1303
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,738
Yes, sir. I can hear it now, Governor.

1304
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:37,496
Uh...

1305
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,448
No, sir. I'm sorry.

1306
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,034
No, of course I can recognize your voice.
It's...

1307
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,381
Sir?

1308
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,585
You're saying the boy
we got locked up called who?

1309
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,052
Oh, and he called you.

1310
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,720
No... No, sir.

1311
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,765
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1312
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:05,681
No, sir. No.

1313
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,143
I don't want no National Guard
coming down here neither, sir.

1314
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,279
I'll get to it immediately, Governor.

1315
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,240
Good night to you and the missus.

1316
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,534
- Get 'em out.
- What?

1317
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,324
Cut 'em goddamn loose.

1318
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,000
That dago wop hit me!

1319
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,286
You want to keep your goddamn job?

1320
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,215
Then you do what I goddamn tell you to do
when I goddamn tell you to do it!

1321
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,588
And I'm telling you
to get 'em the goddamn out!

1322
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:35,465
Who the hell did you call?

1323
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,141
Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses.

1324
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,469
<i>Marone</i>. How great is that?

1325
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,600
It's not great.

1326
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,390
It's not great at all.

1327
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,817
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1328
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,815
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1329
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,106
And I just put the attorney general
of the United States

1330
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,566
in an incredibly awkward position.

1331
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,277
So what?
That's what the guy gets paid for.

1332
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,612
What else he got to do?

1333
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:04,657
That man and his brother
are trying to change this country.

1334
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,287
That's what else he got to do.

1335
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,708
Now he thinks I'm some kind of...

1336
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,550
Calling from some... backwoods swamp jail,

1337
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,298
asking to attenuate assault charges?

1338
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,754
Who does that?

1339
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:21,386
Garbage. That's who.
You shouldn't have hit him.

1340
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,954
I didn't like the way he was treating you,

1341
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,844
making you stand
out in the rain like that.

1342
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,851
Please, you hit him
because of what he called you.

1343
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,733
I've had to endure that kind of talk
my entire life.

1344
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,797
You should be able to take it
for at least one night.

1345
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,549
What? I can't get mad at that stuff
he was saying 'cause I ain't black?

1346
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,030
Christ, I'm blacker than you are.

1347
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,028
Excuse me?

1348
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,405
You don't know shit
about your own people...

1349
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,579
what they eat, how they talk,
how they live.

1350
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,017
You don't even know who Little Richard is.

1351
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,000
Oh, so, knowing who Little Richard is
makes you blacker than me?

1352
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,082
Oh, Tony,
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

1353
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,879
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1354
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,425
Bullshit. I know exactly who I am.

1355
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,365
I'm the guy who lived in the same
neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life

1356
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:02,427
with my mother, my father, my brother,
and now my wife and kids.

1357
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,509
That's it. That's who I am.

1358
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,060
I'm the asshole who has to hustle
every goddamn day

1359
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,479
to put food on the table.

1360
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:11,603
You, Mr. Big Shot,
you live on top of a castle,

1361
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,401
traveling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1362
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,070
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1363
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,865
So, yeah,
my world is way more blacker than yours.

1364
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,112
- Pull over.
- What?

1365
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,743
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1366
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,040
Stop the car, Tony!

1367
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,786
What?

1368
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,212
What are you doing?

1369
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,424
Doc.

1370
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,593
Doc, what the hell are you doing?

1371
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,471
Doc. Get back in the car.

1372
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,550
Yes, I live in a castle, Tony! Alone!

1373
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,854
And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

1374
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,379
because it makes them feel cultured.

1375
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,213
But as soon as I step off that stage,

1376
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,563
I go right back to being
just another nigger to them.

1377
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,562
Because that is their true culture.

1378
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,570
And I suffer that slight alone
because I'm not accepted by my own people,

1379
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,117
'cause I'm not like them either.

1380
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,035
So if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1381
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,242
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1382
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,908
I need some sleep.

1383
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,292
All right.

1384
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,753
I'll stop at the next place we see
and sneak you into my room.

1385
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,331
No. No.

1386
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,417
I refuse to stay in an establishment
where I'm not welcome.

1387
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,134
Yeah. Okay.

1388
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,071
Tony, do you have to smoke everywhere?

1389
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:30,405
I didn't know it bothered you.

1390
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,331
You should have told me.

1391
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,952
All you gotta do is say the word, Doc.

1392
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,767
You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1393
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,558
Yeah, I know.
Just thought I'd bring it with me.

1394
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,014
Save on stamps.

1395
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,775
All right.

1396
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,769
Tony, give it here. I'll fix it.

1397
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:06,945
No offense, Doc,
but I think I got the hang of it now.

1398
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,828
"Dear Dolores,

1399
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,456
sometimes you remind me of a house.

1400
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,212
A house with beautiful lights on it...

1401
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,420
where everyone is happy inside."

1402
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,560
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1403
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,481
Yeah?

1404
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,436
Thanks.

1405
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:48,191
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with, uh, the letters.

1406
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:50,242
You're really good at writing 'em.

1407
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:52,661
My pleasure, Tony.

1408
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,456
You know, um, when you get home,

1409
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,205
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1410
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:04,835
He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.

1411
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,801
Eh. I wouldn't wait.

1412
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,008
You know...

1413
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,926
world's full of lonely people
afraid to make the first move.

1414
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,981
Yeah, I'll finish this tomorrow.

1415
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:40,205
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1416
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,670
Hmm?

1417
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:46,631
That Titsburgh was a major disappointment.

1418
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,301
I didn't notice any difference at all.
Did you?

1419
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,257
Good night, Tony.

1420
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:06,314
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome. Come on in.

1421
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:10,991
All righty.

1422
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,237
Welcome, Mr. Shirley.

1423
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:19,745
Graham Kindell. I'm the general manager.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1424
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,312
Thank you, Mr. Kindell.

1425
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,918
This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1426
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,481
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1427
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,418
Uh, let's keep the car right here
in our "guest of honor" spot.

1428
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,249
Right this way, gentlemen.

1429
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
- Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1430
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,410
- Oh, it was wonderful.
- Good to hear. Good to hear.

1431
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,382
As you can imagine, our Christmas show
is our biggest show of the year,

1432
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,843
and we are so happy to have you here,
Mr. Shirley.

1433
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,929
So, if you need anything, anything at all,
you let me know.

1434
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,390
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1435
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:47,192
We got about an hour before show time.
Any questions?

1436
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:49,696
Where's the restaurant?

1437
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:51,985
Well, you continue down the hall here,
Tony,

1438
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,611
to the right and across the lobby.

1439
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,114
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1440
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:01,457
Well, he said we got an hour.
You must be starving, Doc.

1441
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,999
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1442
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:30,904
May we join you?

1443
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,735
Yeah. Go ahead.

1444
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,909
- Cocktail, gentlemen?
- I'm good.

1445
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,664
Three shots vodka.

1446
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,252
Oh.

1447
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,212
Last show. Cold War over. Time for truce.

1448
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,490
Is Dr. Shirley in his dressing room?

1449
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,336
Yeah. More like half a broom closet.

1450
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,172
Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.

1451
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,558
Six years ago, in 1956...

1452
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:08,808
Nat King Cole was invited to perform

1453
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,735
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1454
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:17,859
Mr. Cole was the first Negro asked to play
at a white establishment in this city.

1455
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,284
As soon as he started playing,

1456
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,454
a group of men attack him
for playing white people's music.

1457
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,786
They pull him off stage...

1458
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,452
and beat him badly.

1459
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:30,538
Jesus Christ.

1460
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:38,879
You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.

1461
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,382
I tell you.

1462
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:44,135
Because genius is not enough.

1463
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:47,684
It takes courage
to change people's hearts.

1464
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,656
Thanks.

1465
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:58,903
Thank you.

1466
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,737
<i>Nu? Na zdorov'ye.</i>

1467
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:04,867
<i>Danke schön.</i>

1468
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,730
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1469
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:10,754
Oh, um...

1470
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:16,292
Um, there. Some friends of mine.

1471
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,968
Uh, you-you... You can't come in here.

1472
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,684
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1473
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:34,185
This... gentleman says
that I'm not permitted to dine here.

1474
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,778
No, you don't understand.
He's playing tonight.

1475
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:37,966
He's the main event. Come on.

1476
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,279
I'm sorry,
but it is the policy of the restaurant.

1477
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:42,450
Everything all right?

1478
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,869
Uh, no, it's not all right.

1479
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,868
This guy's saying
Dr. Shirley can't eat here.

1480
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,120
Oh, well, I apologize, but...

1481
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:52,127
These are long-standing traditions,
club rules.

1482
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,329
I'm sure you understand.

1483
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,296
No, I do not understand.

1484
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:59,259
In 45 minutes, I will be right up there
on that stage entertaining your guests,

1485
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:00,461
yet I can't eat here?

1486
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:02,547
I... I'm sorry.

1487
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,925
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me the bozos in his band

1488
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,135
and all these people
who came here to see him play,

1489
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:09,345
they can eat here,

1490
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,015
but the star of the show,
the parking spot of honor, he can't?

1491
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,312
I'm afraid not.

1492
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,358
Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.

1493
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,528
Okay. I'll tell you what.

1494
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,555
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?

1495
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:25,911
John, show him a menu.

1496
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:29,866
No. I'm not eating in that storage room.

1497
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:33,581
Okay, uh, well, if you prefer,

1498
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,835
there's a very popular establishment
right down the road, the Orange Bird.

1499
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,881
They'd be happy to feed you.

1500
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:42,590
Doc, come here.

1501
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:45,265
Just one second.

1502
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,761
You know what,
maybe that other place is better anyway.

1503
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,598
I mean,
the dinner rolls here are like rocks.

1504
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,226
You just go over and...
You go over and come back.

1505
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,853
It's the last show.

1506
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,108
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1507
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,038
Let's just get it over with
and we can go home,

1508
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,574
get away from these pricks.

1509
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,578
Huh?

1510
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:08,529
Ah, there you go.

1511
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,535
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1512
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:17,955
Either I eat in this room...

1513
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,124
or I'm not performing tonight.

1514
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,464
May I have a word with you?

1515
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:44,694
Mr. Villanueva,
you have to talk sense to Mr. Shirley.

1516
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,743
Please make him understand.
We're not insulting him personally.

1517
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,668
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1518
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,704
Yeah, well, he's not from down here.

1519
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,078
Yeah, just... just ask him
to be reasonable.

1520
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:56,647
I've got 400 guests in there
expecting to be entertained tonight.

1521
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,754
And Dr. Shirley expects to eat tonight.

1522
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,631
Why can't you just make an exception
this one time?

1523
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:04,300
Let me tell you a story.

1524
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,010
You ever hear of the Boston Celtics
basketball club?

1525
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:09,931
Yeah.

1526
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,727
Well, those boys came through here
couple years ago on a barnstorming tour.

1527
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,916
Seeing as they was the world champions
of the league and all,

1528
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,729
we were tickled to have them here,
and we rolled out the welcome wagon.

1529
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:22,857
So, do you know what table
their big coon ate at that night?

1530
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:25,485
No.

1531
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:28,367
I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.

1532
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:30,410
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1533
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,398
Tell me what it's gonna take, huh?

1534
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,453
Say, uh, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1535
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,294
You think you can buy me?

1536
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,417
With all due respect, sir,

1537
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:44,170
you wouldn't be in a job like this
if you couldn't be bought.

1538
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,085
- You...
- Stop.

1539
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,178
Tony.

1540
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,634
It's all right.

1541
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:53,892
I'll play...

1542
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:56,895
if you want me to.

1543
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,737
All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.

1544
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,740
What do you mean "Let's get out of here"?

1545
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,330
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1546
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,982
Don, don't do this.
Now, you signed a contract, and I...

1547
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,123
I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.

1548
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,236
Connie, Bill, everything's gonna be fine.
It's all right.

1549
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,592
You got a show to do, mister!

1550
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,136
You turn yourself around right now,
goddamn it!

1551
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,222
Right now!

1552
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:34,133
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1553
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:36,092
'Cause you're unreliable. You hear me?

1554
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:39,271
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you!

1555
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:49,277
Tony, are you hungry?

1556
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,526
Does Betty like butta... er?

1557
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,290
One, two...

1558
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:38,164
You a cop?

1559
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,248
Do I look Irish?

1560
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,621
What you want, baby?

1561
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,539
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1562
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,630
Coming up.

1563
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,464
Mm. Whatever your specialty is,
we'll take it.

1564
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,141
Two Orange Birds!

1565
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,818
I like what you did back there, Doc.

1566
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,866
You stood up for yourself.

1567
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,321
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1568
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,121
"Ask not...

1569
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,793
your country, what you can do for it.

1570
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,370
Ask what you do for yourself."

1571
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:30,216
You know?

1572
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,885
So, darling, what you do,
all dressed up like that?

1573
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:38,799
Nothing particularly important.

1574
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:43,436
Shouldn't judge a man by his clothes.

1575
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,686
He's only the greatest piano player
in the world.

1576
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:49,483
That right? You good?

1577
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,564
Don't be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are.

1578
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,898
Don't tell me nothing.

1579
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,659
Show me.

1580
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,334
Come on.

1581
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:50,481
Whoo!

1582
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:53,850
Yeah! Yeah!

1583
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,025
That's how you break a key.

1584
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,362
Oh, that was a good time.

1585
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,413
I'd do that once a month for free.

1586
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,120
You were unbelievable.

1587
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,210
Hey, Tony.

1588
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,041
I bet if we leave right now,
we can make it.

1589
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:38,542
Make what?

1590
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:41,249
Christmas Eve in New York City.

1591
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:46,675
Oh, shit!

1592
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,109
Don't ever flash a wad of cash
in a bar.

1593
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,488
I knew you had a gun.

1594
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,272
This could get bad, Doc.

1595
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,195
Yes. It's a shame we don't have something
to protect us on our journey.

1596
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:46,530
Oh, I know.

1597
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,863
Why don't you put your lucky rock
up on the dash, Tony?

1598
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,533
Come on, Tony.

1599
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,573
We need all the help we can get.

1600
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,874
Thank you. I feel safer already.

1601
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,628
You're a real prick, you know that?

1602
01:52:31,954 --> 01:52:33,911
Ah, shit!

1603
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:45,256
Goddamn cops.

1604
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:58,414
What are you doing out here?

1605
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,100
We're trying to get to New York.

1606
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,191
Is there a problem, Officer?

1607
01:53:04,278 --> 01:53:05,394
Yeah.

1608
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:09,735
I noticed your car was tilting left.
Looks like your back tire is flat.

1609
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,206
Eh!

1610
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:27,548
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

1611
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:42,892
Okay, be careful, gentlemen.

1612
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:46,150
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1613
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:47,984
Thanks, Officer.

1614
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,729

All right, that's it. We're done.

1620
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:19,850
I'm pulling us into the next motel.

1621
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:22,303
Keep going as long as you can, Tony.

1622
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:24,354
I can't keep my eyes open.

1623
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,561
I'm getting hypnotized here.

1624
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,644
Think my brain's gonna explode.

1625
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:35,783
Hey, we gave it a shot, Doc.

1626
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:38,028
What are you gonna do?

1627
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:49,255
All right, the table is set,
ladies and gentlemen.

1628
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:52,084
Don't run in the house.
Don't run in the house.

1629
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,047
Mom, Frankie won't let me use it.

1630
01:54:58,141 --> 01:54:59,757
Frankie, let Nicky use it!

1631
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:00,851
Use what?

1632
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,188
Here it is.

1633
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,482
Kids! Wash your hands.

1634
01:55:13,365 --> 01:55:16,358
Here we go. <i>Alla salute. Alla salute.</i>

1635
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:19,280
Dee! Do you need help with the calzone?

1636
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,237
- No, I'm fine. No.
- All right!

1637
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,072
It's time to eat!

1638
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:47,231
Tony.

1639
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,773
Tony, wake up.

1640
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:53,690
You all right?

1641
01:55:54,156 --> 01:55:56,239
You're home. Get inside.

1642
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,340
Good night.

1643
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:17,590
Wait, wait. Come...
Come up and meet my family.

1644
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,348
Merry Christmas, Tony.

1645
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,811
Hey...

1646
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:29,058
Merry Christmas.

1647
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,982
Hey, hey!
You're gonna choke on the bone.

1648
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:54,406
I'm just getting started over here.

1649
01:56:56,301 --> 01:56:58,167
- You got it? You got it.
- I got it.

1650
01:56:58,887 --> 01:57:00,879
- Dolores, do you need any help?
- No, no, honey.

1651
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,928
- Not while I'm eating!
- Go ahead, smoke.

1652
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,721
Oh!

1653
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,349
Look who it is! Shakespeare's home! Hey!

1654
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:10,689
Dad!

1655
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:14,652
Hey.

1656
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,610
How are you?

1657
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,980
You made it back!

1658
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:20,406
Hey, Pop. Mwah!

1659
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:22,358
- Merry Christmas.
- What a Christmas!

1660
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:23,943
<i>- Buon Natale!</i>
- Tony, God bless.

1661
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,448
- Hey.
- I'm glad you made it back.

1662
01:57:29,834 --> 01:57:31,666
Wonderful, wonderful!

1663
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:39,709
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

1664
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,135
- Hey!
- All right. Sit down.

1665
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,675
Anything left?

1666
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:44,765
Let's go!

1667
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:59,604
- Welcome home, Dr. Shirley.
- Thank you, Amit.

1668
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:01,488
I turned down your bed, sir.

1669
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:03,487
Uh, shall I unpack your luggage now?

1670
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:06,661
No, no. Please, go home to your family.

1671
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,828
Thank you, sir.

1672
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,753
Merry Christmas, sir.

1673
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:17,292
Merry Christmas.

1674
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:10,453
The holidays are just starting.

1675
01:59:10,477 --> 01:59:13,470
I love everything in white.

1676
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:16,226
Always. Always with the kissing.

1677
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:18,558
What?
You never kiss me like that at the table.

1678
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:20,132
Why don't you ever kiss me like that?

1679
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:24,064
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, relax.

1680
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:29,986
So, Tony, you all right?
You seem a little quiet.

1681
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,369
Yeah. Nah, I'm just tired, you know?

1682
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:36,830
Long trip.

1683
01:59:40,799 --> 01:59:42,210
You take care of that thing?

1684
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,300
Oh.

1685
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,179
Thanks.

1686
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:50,597
Yeah, you owe me 75 bucks.

1687
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:52,515
Seventy-five?

1688
01:59:53,144 --> 01:59:54,144
Charlie said 60.

1689
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:56,520
Oh. I'm doing this for free?

1690
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,441
Hey, Tony.

1691
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:02,439
Tony, tell us about the trip.

1692
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:03,690
You've been gone two months.

1693
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,271
Yeah, how was he, the <i>tutsoon</i>?

1694
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:06,572
He get on your nerves?

1695
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:08,528
Don't call him that.

1696
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,164
All right.

1697
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:19,831
Tony,
you should have seen the day last week

1698
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:22,288
little Frankie climbed up onto the TV.

1699
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,294
I took a picture of him. It was so cute.

1700
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,966
He was so funny up there.

1701
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,385
What are you, nuts, Dee?
With all the tubes back there?

1702
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:30,032
- He could've got electrocuted.
- Oh, no.

1703
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,534
- What, he break it?
- What are you talking about?

1704
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:33,015
You're thinking of toasters.

1705
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:35,718
You can't get electrocuted
from the TV set.

1706
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:38,930
She's not thinking about a toaster.
She's thinking about a TV.

1707
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:40,980
Is he taking it into the bathtub?

1708
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,562
You're not gonna get electrocuted.

1709
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,993
Charlie.

1710
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:55,196
Hey, Lip. Johnny invited me.

1711
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,289
Oh. Well, come on in.

1712
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,992
All right. Oh. You remember Marie?

1713
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:02,624
- Hey, Marie.
- Charlie, you actually came?

1714
02:01:02,714 --> 02:01:05,001
I was kidding.

1715
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,798
With the wife, too? Jeez.

1716
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:08,842
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1717
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:10,281
- Hello! What a surprise.
- Merry Christmas.

1718
02:01:10,305 --> 02:01:11,512
Nice to see you.

1719
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:13,242
Everybody, Charlie from the pawnshop.

1720
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:14,744
- Hey!
- Didn't bring nothing.

1721
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:16,370
- Christmas. Can you believe it?
- Come here, come here.

1722
02:01:16,394 --> 02:01:18,932
- Sit down.
- Sit down, sit down.

1723
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,692
Doc.

1724
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:30,272
Ah. Welcome.

1725
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:32,034
Oh.

1726
02:01:33,453 --> 02:01:35,786
Hey, everybody.

1727
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:37,533
Stop it, stop it.

1728
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:39,584
This is Dr. Donald Shirley.

1729
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,376
Merry Christmas.

1730
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:50,335
Well, come on. Make some room.
Get this man a plate!

1731
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:57,309
Oh.

1732
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:01,721
- Hello.
- You must be Dolores.

1733
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:03,730
Welcome.
