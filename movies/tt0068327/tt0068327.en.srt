Good day, miss.

67
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,340
I am looking for Schneider.
Do you speak...?

68
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,605
I am looking for a room.

69

Mrs. Schneider is not at home.

70
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,514
Have you a cigarette, darling?
I am desperate!

71
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:50,709
Oh, yes.

72
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:53,618
- Yes, I think so.
- Oh, fantastic.

73
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,116
You're American.

74

Oh, God, how depressing.

75
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,026
You're meant to think
I'm an international woman of mystery.

76
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,921
I've been working on it like mad.

77
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,157
I was told there might be
a room to rent, here.

78
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,031
Not too expensive I...

79

83
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,581
A fine English cigarette.

84
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,613
Oh, God, I've even begun
to think in German.

85
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,756
- How long have you been here?
- Forever.

86
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:31,952
How long is that?

87
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,255
Almost three months.

88
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:36,388
It's the most marvelous boarding house.
Marvelous lodgers.

89
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,130
Everybody's broke, of course,
but who isn't these days?

90
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,635
Now there's Frהulein Mayr,
who is a masseuse... for ladies only.

91
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:46,066
And there's Frהulein Kost,
who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.

92
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,280
Frהulein Kost, Frהulein Mayr.

93
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,980
Mayr tells Kost's fortune every morning.
It's always the same.

94
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,090
"You'll meet a strange man," which, under
the circumstances, is a pretty safe bet.

95
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,457
The toilet.

96
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,465
Frהulein Kost's room.
Oh, you can just imagine.

97
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,297
Here it is, darling.

98
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,367
Well, what else do you need in a bedroom
besides a bed?

99
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:25,540
Pupils. I've got to give English lessons
to pay the rent.

100
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:28,208
Well, look, you can use my room for that.

101
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,118
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.

102
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,117
You'll adore these.

103
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,381
Prairie oysters, darling.

104
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:41,029
It's an egg with Worcestershire sauce,
all sort of whooshed up together.

105
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,899
Fifty marks with breakfast,
even when I'm behind on the rent.

106
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:47,330
Divine, isn't it?

107
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:50,231
- Of course, I'm hardly ever in.
- Why not?

108
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,534
Well, I dash all day
and I work late at the Cabaret.

109
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,672
Now... these work instantly,
even on the most sinister hangovers.

110
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,650
Of course, I may bring a boyfriend home
occasionally, but only occasionally...

111
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,185
...because I do think that one ought
to go to the man's room if one can.

112
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,917
I mean, it doesn't look so much
as if one expected it, does it?

113
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,285
Exactly.

114
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,166
I see you've acquired a lot
of worldly wisdom.

115
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,632
Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts.
I have ancient instincts.

116
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,939
I have this strange, mystical...

117
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,503
...thatish feeling about you.

118
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,642
So you're moving right in, okay?

119
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:32,871
Okay.

120

You should have known by now

163
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,137
"You'd every cause to doubt me,
Mein Herr.

164
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,929
"Bye-bye, Mein Lieber Herr..."

165
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,899
You know, you're really very good.

166
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,735
I know, darling, isn't it fabulous?

167
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,810
Listen, I want you to meet Fritz Wendel,
absolutely my oldest friend in Berlin.

168
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:03,808
Brian Roberts.

169
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,541
He's a divine playboy,
hurtling from party to party...

170
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,048
...seducing everyone in all directions.

171
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:10,984
You mustn't believe from Sally.
I'm a most serious man of business.

172
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,283
Making import-export with machineries.

173
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,858
Listen, Fritz is crazy
to improve his English...

174
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,926
...so he can dazzle fat American divorcees.

175
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,892
And I said you might deign
to give him lessons.

176
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,730
Darling, give me one of those cigarettes.

177
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,330
One moment.

178
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:33,937
Oh, you've got to try one of these.
They're absolutely devastating.

179
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,236
I'm sure they're filled with opium,
or some such thing.

180
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,438
They make me feel wildly sensual.

181
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:39,841
Till later.

182
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,056
She's hot stuff, yes?

183
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:53,752
No, thank you.

184
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,271
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.

185
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,866
That is correct? "On?"

186
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,101
"With."

187
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,304
"With."

188
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,773
Linken Lieselotte...

189
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:18,781
...72 kilos.

190
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:24,383
Her father, you know,
is a big ambassador from Washington.

191
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,884
An ambassador?

192
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,188
Oh, yes, dear chap.

193
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:31,959
And soon, with her, I think,
I am entering the high diplomatic circles.

194
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,134
Strict rules will be obeyed.

195
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,937
Sally tells me, sir, that you're
from Oxford University.

196
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,575
A professor of language.

197
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,002
Well, it's, it's Cambridge,
actually, and I'm...

198
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,172
...l'm still working for
my doctor of philosophy.

199
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:47,912
That's why I'm here.

200
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,351
But, if you really want lessons,
I'd be pleased to help.

201
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,444
Excellent.

202
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:53,748
Start!

203
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,220
For the sport!

204
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:02,029
If it's not... if it's not too expensive.
You know, business is...

205
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,086
...business is terrible.

206
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,134
The inflation, the Communists...

207
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,297
...the Nazis.

208
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,669
Soon I am with a tin cup, too...

209
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:15,501
...or I make a rich marriage.

210
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,038
That at least is sensible.

211
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,590
I suppose you're wondering
what I'm doing...

212
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,492
...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub?

213
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,798
It is a rather unusual place.

214
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,798
That's me, darling...
unusual places, unusual love affairs.

215
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,764
I am a most strange
and extraordinary person.

216
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:59,202
Now, tell me all about you.
I want to hear everything.

217
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,176
Everything?

218
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,578
Absolutely everything.

219
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,480
Well, there's nothing very dramatic to tell.

220
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,489
Well, since I've been down
from Cambridge, l...

221
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,428
Lya de Putti.
Absolutely my favorite screen siren.

222
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:17,759
Well, when I left Cambridge, l...

223
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,926
I'm going to be a great film star.

224
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:23,864
That is, if booze and sex
don't get me first.

225
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,066
Do I shock you, darling?

226
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,234
Not a bit.

227
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,532
I don't?

228
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,079
Since mother died we're even closer.

229
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,980
He's an ambassador, I understand.

230
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:37,177
Who told you that?

231
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,310
Fritz Wendel.

232
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:39,945
Oh, Fritz.

233
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,422
He's practically an ambassador.

234
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,983
Where is he now?

235
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,052
Oh, who knows?
Timbuctoo, outer Mongolia.

236
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,095
He dashes all over the globe
on momentous affairs of state.

237
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,565
Then, you don't see much of him.

238
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,939
Darling, what are you talking about?
Of course I do.

239
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,976
He can't bear us being apart.

240
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:06,237
He's always swooping down
and carrying me off for divine vacations.

241
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,850
The Riviera, Capri.

242
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,152
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?

243
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,047
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.

244
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,888
Oh, I know I can sing,
but what I really want to be is an actress.

245
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,197
Like... who is it?

246
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,428
Lya de Putti?

247
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:30,133
Oh, darling, come on.
I could act her right off the screen.

248
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,302
I thought you said she was your favorite.

249
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,375
She makes too many faces.

250
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:38,544
No, please...

251
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:40,103
We made an agreement.

252
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,976
Thank you.

253
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,183
Just you wait.

254
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,320
One of these days Max Reinhardt
is gonna drift into the club.

255
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,992
Well, you never know.

256
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,652
That's right, you never know.

257
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,321
It has happened before.

258
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:59,265
What, just last week,
a man who's a very good friend...

259
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,963
...of the head of casting for UFA
asked me to sit at his table, and he's...

260
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,036
Come on. Come on.

261
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,072
Run, run!

262
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,238
Where?

263
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,637
Excuse me, miss...

264
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,069
Didn't you just scream?

265
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,245
Does my company upset you that much?

266
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,410
You know, sometimes I come down here
and just wait.

267
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,148
I mean, just especially.

268
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,047
You should try it sometime.

269
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,113
Me?

270
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:00,954
Yes.

271
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,221
Me?

272
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:04,929
- You.
- No.

273
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,528
Yes, you.

274
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:08,628
Go on.

275
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,227
I couldn't possibly.

276
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,863
Don't be so British.

277
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,169
You'll feel terrific afterwards.

278
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,808
You know you want to.

279
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,074
No, I don't.

280
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:24,776
Here comes one now.

281
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,785
- Will you do it?
- All right.

282
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,122
No, not yet.

283
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,865
Okay, you ready?

284
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:40,892
Now.

285
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,431
I can't promise you anything,
but we can give it a try.

286
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,694
Darling, I want you to meet Herr Ludwig.

287
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,133
He's just back from Hamburg.

288
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:51,661
He lives in the room off the kitchen,
and he's a marvelous publisher.

289
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,368
Now look, he's got this book,
and it's got to be translated.

290
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,410
And I told him
what a famous writer you are...

291
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,571
...and it's 50 marks. Right?

292
00:24:59,614 --> 00:25:00,638
Fabulous.

293
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,841
It's all settled.

294
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,349
It will be an honor for me
to associate with...

295
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:07,910
...so talented a young man of letters
as Miss Bowles tells me.

296
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,890
This book, I assure you,
is most artistic...

297
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,056
...most artistic and color...

298
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:15,119
Twenty-five marks in advance. Right?

299
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,326
I think, Herr Roberts,
you will find the style...

300
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,958
Is there any hot water left?

301
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,900
- Hot water?
- Yes, a little.

302
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,474
I think you will find the style admirable...

303
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:31,644
...and the subject matter,
I feel, is universal.

304
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,274
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.

305
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,511
No, you must. It's the finest Havana.

306
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,947
It's a deal?

307
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:44,818
Herr Ludwig, I'm afraid that Sally's
rather overestimated my powers of...

308
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:50,722
It's a deal.

309
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,274
That's it.

310
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:12,050
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?

311
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,480
Do you know what this artistic
and colorful book's about?

312
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:17,855
No. Tell, tell.

313
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:20,053
It's pure pornography.

314
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:23,928
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.

315
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,624
What's this one called?

316
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,500
"Cleo, the Whip Lady."

317
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:39,303
You lied about the hot water.

318
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,243
I'm freezing.

319
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,108
I'm freezing to death.

320
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:44,878
Hug me?

321
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,081
Tighter.

322
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,490
Don't be so literal.

323
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,224
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

324
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,366
Doesn't it?

325
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,336
It's a very nice body.

326
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:15,105
Do you really think so, darling?

327
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,001
It does have a certain kind of style.

328
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:20,940
I mean, look, it's very flat here...

329
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,650
...not much hips, and...

330
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,280
...here...

331
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:33,758
It's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

332
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,259
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.

333
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,635
You don't.

334
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,845
Well, listen, we're practically
living together, so if you only like boys...

335
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,279
...I mean, I wouldn't dream
of pestering you.

336
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,185
Well, do you sleep with girls, or don't you?

337
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,623
You don't ask questions like that.

338
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,052
I do.

339
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,191
All right.

340
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:14,329
If you insist.

341
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,999
I do not sleep with girls.

342
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,567
Let me be absolutely accurate.

343
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,201
I've gone through the motions
of sleeping with girls exactly...

344
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,668
...three times.

345
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,581
All of them disastrous.

346
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:34,150
The word for my sex life now is...

347
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,218
..."nil," or...

348
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,315
...as you Americans would say...

349
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:39,690
..."plenty of nuttin"'!

350
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,725
All right?

351
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,270
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

352
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,812
Look, Brian.

353
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,776
You're absolutely my best friend.

354
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,945
And friends are much harder to find
than lovers.

355
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:11,651
Besides, sex always screws up
a friendship, anyway, if you let it.

356
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:15,019
So we won't let it.

357
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,296
Okay, Sally.

358
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,448
"You would have been,
he would have been..."

359
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:46,760
Pluperfect tense.

360
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:48,659
"I have been..."

361
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,598
If you did a little homework,
instead of gadding about all over town...

362
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:59,463
Frהulein Schneider,
there's a new pupil coming at 3:00.

363
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,938
- Would you show her up, please?
- Certainly.

364
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:05,104
"You had have been, I had have been..."

365
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,510
Future perfect.

366
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,240
"I shall have..."

367
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,683
"I shall have been." This English.

368
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,316
I go now to try to pull a deal.

369
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,521
Or I make business soon...

370
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,553
...or I go as a gigolo.

371
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,818
"Either, or."

372
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,295
"Either, or," I go as a gigolo.

373
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,595
Anyway, who is the new pupil?

374
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,466
Natalia Landauer.

375
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:30,428
Landauer?

376
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,403
Of the big department store?

377
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:38,505
A Landauer?

378
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,541
How did you meet a Landauer?

379
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,913
I had a letter of introduction
from England.

380
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:48,784
They invited me for coffee.

381
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:50,515
Invited you for coffee?

382
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,419
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.

383
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,195
Stinking rich, it seems.

384
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:10,968
Good.

385
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,380
I shall make a pass after her.

386
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,742
What if she's... fat and hideous?

387
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:27,587
Perhaps the father will take
a liking from me and give me a job.

388
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:30,795
If I marry her, a partnership perhaps.

389
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,634
I'm not prejudiced.

390
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,033
Hello.

391
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,302
You said you wouldn't be back until 4:00.

392
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,469
I must have a drink this instant.

393
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:48,075
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?

394
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,682
Oh, God, only gin.

395
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:51,715
Sally, please!

396
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,855
Three marks an hour. I need it.

397
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,714
- We need it.
- All I need is a drink!

398
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,522
She's young and very strictly brought up.

399
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,722
Look, I may have my tiny faults...

400
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:06,831
...but I'm really not planning
to white slave her to Latin America.

401
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,026
Whose room is this, anyhow?

402
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:11,731
Sally, in all fairness...

403
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,967
Fairness? Who cares about fairness?

404
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,373
Honestly.

405
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,885
Thank you.

406
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,724
You're welcome.

407
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,523
- Excuse me.
- How fat?

408
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:43,260
How fat?

409
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:46,431
I think the weather will be fine,
isn't it true, Miss Landauer?

410
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:52,946
Frהulein Landauer.

411
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:54,773
Come in.

412
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,152
- Good afternoon, Frהulein Landauer.
- Good afternoon.

413
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:01,450
- How nice to see you again.
- It's nice to see you again.

414
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,923
It is good, you have others.

415
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:07,152
So, we shall make a party
for speaking English, yes?

416
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:10,922
Well, actually, my friends
were just leaving.

417
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:14,095
No, I'm delighted to stay, Brian.

418
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,965
Sally, you have this appointment,
don't you?

419
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,105
I'll cancel it. I love parties.

420
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,068
Good, this is splendid for the practicing.

421
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,313
You will introduce me, please.

422
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:29,406
Yes, of course.

423
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:31,852
Herr Wendel, Frהulein Landauer.

424
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:35,849
- It is a pleasure, miss.
- No, no, English conversation.

425
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,591
I am so charmed, dearest miss.

426
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,060
And... and this...

427
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,454
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.

428
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,324
How do you do?

429
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:51,129
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.

430
00:34:56,477 --> 00:34:58,707
Last summer when I...

431
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,960
You are all healthy, I hope.

432
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:29,706
I have had a cold, but it is better now.

433
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:31,441
Good.

434
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:32,501
How sad.

435
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,441
A cold from the nose is most aggravating.

436
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:40,050
This was a cold of the bosom,
not of the nose.

437
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,820
All the plegm vas here.

438
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,616
All the what?

439
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,123
Ze plegm... zat comes in the tubes.

440
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,993
I think I'm gonna be sick.

441
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,467
Phlegm. "Ph" is always pronounced
as "f", and...

442
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,302
...you don't sound... the "g."

443
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,504
Then why are they putting the "g",
please?

444
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,044
That's a very good question, but...

445
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,007
...it's rather difficult to explain.

446
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,377
Try, Brian.

447
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:15,983
It's just there.

448
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:19,417
So, Mr. Professor, you do not know?

449
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:20,457
No.

450
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:23,959
Then I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

451
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,392
It's most amusing.

452
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:32,469
Very amusing.

453
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,131
Come in.

454
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,939
How thoughtful of you,
Frהulein Schneider.

455
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,442
Thank you very much.

456
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,709
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

457
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:50,247
Please.

458
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,757
Please, you must take a cake,
dearest miss.

459
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,865
I'm not eating between meals.

460
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,164
You're not eating between meals.

461
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:03,765
I am eating between meals.

462
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,667
Thank you.

463
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,001
So much.

464
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,169
You're welcome.

465
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:17,778
Brian, Liebling, did I tell you?

466
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,178
I saw a film the other day about syphilis.

467
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,645
It was too awful.

468
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,989
I couldn't let a man touch me for a week.

469
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,884
Coffee?

470
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,492
Is it true you can get it from kissing?

471
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:31,754
Oh, yes.

472
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:34,026
And your king, Henry Vlll...

473
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,160
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey
whisper in his ear.

474
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:40,101
That is not, I think, founded in fact.

475
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,909
But from kissing, most decidedly.

476
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:47,038
And from towels... and from cups.

477
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,884
And, of course, screwing.

478
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:58,991
"Screwing," please?

479
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,384
Fornication.

480
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,695
Fornication?

481
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,636
Brian, darling, what is the German word?

482
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:10,829
I don't remember.

483
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,932
- Oh, yes...
- Oh, no.

484
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:17,935
Bumsen.

485
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:27,014
It would be the one German word
you pronounce perfectly.

486
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:30,223
Well, I ought to.
I spent the entire afternoon bumsening...

487
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,623
...like mad with
some ghastly old producer...

488
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,661
...who promised to give me a contract.

489
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:38,563
Gin, Miss Landauer?

490
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,569
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?

491
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,229
Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke.

492
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,575
That old heel-clicking,
hand-kissing routine of his...

493
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,474
...isn't going to get him
anywhere with her.

494
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,809
The only thing to do with virgins
is to make a ferocious pounce.

495
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:58,174
I can't imagine anyone
pouncing on Natalia.

496
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,550
That's why it would be
so effective, darling.

497
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,850
You are a woman
of many sexual experiences, I think.

498
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,856
I'll say, darling. Ever since I was so high,
men have found me irresistible.

499
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,156
- Daddy was always worrying that...
- Yes?

500
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,423
You know.

501
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,065
How's the gigolo campaign going?

502
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:16,927
Terrible.

503
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,498
This week, already I'm giving up
three dinner invitations...

504
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,201
...to spend 32 marks on her.

505
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:24,567
That's quite a sacrifice.

506
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,303
And here is the craziness.

507
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:27,671
I like it.

508
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,275
Goddammit!

509
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:31,807
What?

510
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:34,517
I think I'm falling in love with her.

511
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,816
I'm so sorry.

512
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,014
So am I.

513
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,812
You assure me the English reader
will find this...

514
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:05,344
...arousing... stimulating?

515
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,512
Well, I...

516
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,958
Yes, I... I should think so.

517
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:15,026
Look, everybody.

518
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,920
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?

519
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:22,163
- You look lovely, Sally.
- Just lovely.

520
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,664
Thank you. Well, I'm off to the Adlon...

521
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,699
...to see my sexy...

522
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:33,072
...marvelous, devastating father.

523
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,743
- Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.
- Auf wiedersehen.

524
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,744
Good luck.

525
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:48,184
I'm terribly sorry, but I couldn't
possibly find any more of them.

526
00:40:50,464 --> 00:40:53,900
Good night, and thank you so much
for a delightful evening.

527
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,999
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

528
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,505
- Good night.
- Good night.

529
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,706
It really has been... sublime.

530
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:05,602
Thank you.

531
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:07,439
Dearest miss.

532
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,824
You see how she is with me?

533
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,937
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?

534
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,400
No, I... I was too discreet to look back.

535
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:36,201
I think I go...
I go crazy with the frustration.

536
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:40,947
You know, I... I kiss and inside me
comes the explosion. But her?

537
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:45,182
Brian, I tell you a simple fact...

538
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,812
...and I'm not boosting.
- "Boasting."

539
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,422
The French women, the Swedish women,
even the English...

540
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,924
...they go wild for my kisses, but...

541
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,361
...this one...

542
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,421
Nothing?

543
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:01,858
Nothing.

544
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:07,739
And I'm a crazy, love-sick fool.

545
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:12,073
Sally says you ought to pounce.

546
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:13,535
Pounce?

547
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:16,445
Throw her on a couch or something.

548
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,515
To attack Natalia?

549
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:21,348
Lmpossible.

550
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:25,657
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable
in these areas.

551
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:31,059
You do what Sally says and you end up,
I think, in the prison cell.

552
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:40,305
- Pounce, huh?
- Pounce.

553
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,056
How'd it go?

554
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:07,457
Bad?

555
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:11,068
Sally, what is it?

556
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,388
I waited at the Adlon till 10:00.

557
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,285
When I got back, there was this.

558
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,193
"Dear Sally:

559
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:39,455
"Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.

560
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,865
"Writing. Love."

561
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,199
Well, these... these things do happen.

562
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,370
I'm sure he had a good reason.

563
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:53,670
Ten words. Exactly.

564
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:57,273
After ten it's extra.

565
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,883
You see, Daddy thinks of these things.

566
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:04,117
If I had leprosy, there'd be a cable.

567
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,352
"Gee, kid, tough.

568
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,532
"Sincerely hope... nose doesn't fall off.

569
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:16,792
"Love."

570
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:23,101
Bastard!

571
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:25,168
I'll show him!

572
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,812
I'll become a big film star.

573
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,648
The poor man, he tries to love me.

574
00:44:40,794 --> 00:44:42,853
Perhaps he even thinks he does...

575
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,226
...but the real truth...

576
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:50,761
...is that he just doesn't care.

577
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:55,340
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I'm not worth caring about.

578
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:03,808
Maybe I am... just nothing. Nothing.

579
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,728
You're a perfectly marvelous girl.

580
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:26,004
- And beautiful.
- No.

581
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,665
- And talented.
- No, I'm not.

582
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:31,308
Yes, you are.

583
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,746
Do you really think so?

584
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:43,955
I mean really?

585
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:45,649
Yes, I do.

586
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:50,487
Thank you.

587
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:47,450
"Maybe this time, I'll be lucky

588
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:52,815
"Maybe this time, he'll stay."

589
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,699
Obviously those three girls...

590
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,236
...were just the wrong three girls.

591
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:16,576
"Maybe this time, for the first time

592
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,218
"Love won't hurry away."

593
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,192
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

594
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,496
"He will hold me fast

595
00:47:38,972 --> 00:47:42,635
"I'll be home at last

596
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:49,581
"Not a loser anymore

597
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:55,683
"Like the last time
And the time before.

598
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:28,682
"Everybody loves a winner

599
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,289
"So nobody loves me.

600
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:41,189
"Lady peaceful,
Lady happy

601
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:45,304
"That's what I long to be.

602
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:53,109
"Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor

603
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:58,113
"Something's bound to begin.

604
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:05,214
"It's gotta happen,
Happen sometime

605
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:09,322
"Maybe this time, I'll win.

606
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:15,999
"Cause everybody, they love a winner

607
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,067
"So nobody loves me.

"Maybe this time, I'll win."

615
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:44,081
Hey, what's going on?

616
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:50,488
Tell him your lover
is a gangster from Chicago.

617
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:13,943
- You told him?
- I did better than that.

618
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,515
I just told him that I had
the teeniest touch of syphilis.

619
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,030
Wait till he gets a load
of what little old Elke's got.

620
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:33,371
- Landauer?
- Ja.

621
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:42,741
I am grateful to you
that you came to me from my call.

622
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,544
Don't be silly. I'm all agog.

623
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,445
Thank you.

624
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:54,157
- You will eat food, please?
- Thank you.

625
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:05,628
- You see, Frהulein...
- Sally.

626
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:12,403
Our acquaintance is not long,
but I am choosing you...

627
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:14,804
...because I know
no other young woman...

628
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,974
...who is giving her body
frequently to men.

629
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:20,881
My English.

630
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,051
I am rending you an embarrassment?

631
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:25,119
No, no, I'm fascinated.

632
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:30,090
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.

633
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:34,198
At first I not taking this seriously.

634
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:36,393
He is so...

635
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:41,900
...so formal. And also I think so much...

636
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:45,134
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune.

637
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,377
Is that what you say?

638
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:50,476
That's what we say, all right.

639
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:52,475
Then...

640
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,047
...the night before yesterday...

641
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,390
...my parents are from the house...

642
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,786
...und we are seated here...

643
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,492
...upon my father's library sofa.

644
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:06,257
Suddenly...

645
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,867
...he throws aside the formalities...

646
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:11,733
...there is fire, there is passion.
- Oh, my God...

647
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:14,936
...he pounced!
- Please?

648
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,040
He made love to you.

649
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,144
On my father's library sofa.

650
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,381
Und even for that
he is showing no respect.

651
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,020
I am fighting,
I'm calling out harsh words...

652
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:30,914
...but then...

653
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,121
May we not be frank?

654
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,087
Suddenly...

655
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,158
...all is... equal fire...

656
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:44,602
...equal passion in me.

657
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:49,041
And since then, I think only of him.

658
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,971
Now, is this love...

659
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:56,039
...or mere fatuation of the body?

660
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:00,450
You with so many, as you call,
"screwings"...

661
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,348
...shall please tell me the truth of it.

662
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:14,091
Please.

663
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:18,871
Does it really matter,
as long as you're having fun?

664
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,805
How can you speak of "fun"?

665
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:23,108
He has asked me to marry him.

666
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:25,840
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?

667
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:31,006
And say to my father that I am marrying
a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?

668
00:54:32,786 --> 00:54:33,980
And a Christian, too.

669
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:38,189
Oh, this I think is... breaking his heart.

670
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:43,151
Well, in that case then, I guess
you better just forget the whole thing.

671
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:45,488
Forget Fritz?

672
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,390
How am I ever forgetting Fritz?

673
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,695
Look, I really have to be running along.

674
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:55,734
Don't cry.

675
00:54:56,743 --> 00:54:58,608
Oh, please, don't cry.

676
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,671
I'm no good at all if anybody cries.

677
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:08,313
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...

678
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,680
...you see, I thought...

679
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,589
I didn't think...

680
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,266
How shall so grave a problem
resolve itself?

681
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:24,727
Poor thing.

682
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,199
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up.

683
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,005
I don't suppose you'd ever consider
seeing him on the sly, every now...

684
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:36,372
No, I didn't think so.

685
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,616
My God, it's enough
to drive a girl into a convent.

686
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:46,522
Do they have Jewish nuns?

687
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,633
- Good day.
- Good day.

688
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:07,807
Please... can you wash...?

689
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:10,175
- Excuse me, miss, I think you lost this.
- What?

690
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:15,180
- I think you dropped this.
- Yes, thank you.

691
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,820
Can you wash my clothes...

692
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,591
...Monday, Tuesday?

693
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,728
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

694
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,287
Excuse me, may I help you?

695
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:28,266
I want my laundry back by Tuesday.

696
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:32,562
The young lady would like
her laundry back by Tuesday.

697
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:34,066
I understand.

698
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,164
It's okay.

699
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,375
Thank you so much.

700
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,268
Maximilian von Heune.

701
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:42,608
Sally Bowles.

702
00:56:45,385 --> 00:56:48,252
Do you have a cigarette?
I'm absolutely desperate.

703
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:50,679
I must have left mine at the club.

704
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:52,755
The Kit Kat Klub.

705
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:56,192
Divine decadence.

706
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,690
May I drop you somewhere?
I have my car outside.

707
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:03,260
All right.

708
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:06,003
- Auf wiedersehen.
- Auf wiedersehen, darling.

709
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:12,967
Money.

710
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:14,872

you are like me, adrift in Berlin.

I think it's my duty to corrupt you.
Agreed?

Fascinating.

He must know everybody.

769
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,176
I betcha a man like that
could get me into films...

...faster than you can say
Eric von Stroheim.

771

772

Don't worry, I can handle him.

774
01:01:58,097 --> 01:02:00,258
Trust me. Just trust me, darling.

775
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,534
All right, don't trust me.

776
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:41,069

777
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:46,403

Bri, darling, wake up.

781
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:12,871
We have a visitor. Maximilian's here.

782
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:21,144
Please, what time is it?

783
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,409
- Three thirty.
- I'm sorry, Brian, we're late.

784
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,383
Oh, darling,
we had the most glorious time.

785
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,783
- We didn't stop laughing.
- Don't open your eyes.

786
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:29,617
Don't look! Okay.

787
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,685
Isn't it fabulous?

788
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,195
I feel just like Kay Francis.

789
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:41,463
Bri, why didn't you come?
We had the best time, and so much fun.

790
01:03:43,269 --> 01:03:46,102
- Max really knows how to corrupt a girl.
- I try.

791
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,200
Not only did I get this glorious pelt,
I got perfume, I got silk stockings...

792
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,404
And you got that funny little blue hat.

793
01:03:54,947 --> 01:03:57,848
You call it funny.
I think it's divine. I love it.

794
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,846
Oh, God, we didn't get anything for Brian.

795
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:09,593
I'm afraid I had no time
to have it wrapped.

796
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:13,124
Darling, isn't that beautiful?

797
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,158
What on earth makes you think
I'd accept that?

798
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:20,738
- To give me pleasure.
- Max loves buying things.

799
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,876
Brian, you're a man of strong convictions.

800
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:29,542
Can we have caviar again?

801
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,849
But, you had it for breakfast.

802
01:04:32,985 --> 01:04:34,714
Can I have it for lunch?

803
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:38,185
For lunch, for dinner, breakfast again...
Anything you want.

804
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:42,856
Drei Caviar, bitte!

805
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:46,498
That's for me. What are you having?

806
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:01,747
Oh, you should have been there.

807
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,382
The Nazis are just a gang of stupid
hooligans, but they do serve a purpose.

808
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:16,423
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.

809
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:19,894
- But who exactly is "we"?
- Germany, of course.

810
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,398
Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar?

811
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,297
- Why not?
- Oh, wonderful.

812
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:28,033
I'm dying to show off my new coat.

813
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,764
I think I could do with a drink, too.

814
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,709
Good. We'll make a night of it.
Or, why not a weekend?

815
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,576
Berlin makes strange bedfellows
these days.

816
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:42,083
Some people have one people...

817
01:05:43,255 --> 01:05:44,449
...some have two.

818
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:45,985
Some even...

819
01:05:49,762 --> 01:05:51,286
"Two ladies

820
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,764

"I go out daily to earn our daily bread.

01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:46,310
"But we've one thing in common.

835
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:47,414
"He

836

- She
- Und me

"The key

01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:45,307
"We switch partners daily
To play as we please.

843
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:50,345
- Twosies beats onesies
- But nothing beats threes.

844
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:52,778
"I sleep in the middle.

845
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:54,818

- Und I'm right.

846
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:59,559
"But there's room on the bottom
If you drop in some night.

"This two for one."

851
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:45,036
- What'd he say?
- He's asking about his asthma.

852
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:48,108
Miss Bowles, in mother's room, I thought.

853
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:51,741
- Mr. Roberts, in the blue room.
- Yes, Mr. Baron.

854
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:55,906
The master says in case you have
nothing to change into...

855
01:08:55,984 --> 01:08:58,009
...he asked me to bring you these.

856
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:01,212
Thanks.

857
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,788
Come in.

858
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:47,057
No, no, help yourself. Please.

859
01:09:50,305 --> 01:09:52,364
I'm not quite sure,
but I think they're mine.

860
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,767
This used to be my room
before I was married.

861
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,077
Looks familiar.

862
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,181
You can at least get out of that shirt.

863
01:10:03,618 --> 01:10:05,916
Try this one. Blue should be your color.

864
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:11,819
Brian, not even a sweater?

865
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:17,730
Are you still married?

866
01:10:20,201 --> 01:10:21,225
Very much so.

867
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,205
- Where is your wife, now?
- In Cologne.

868
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:35,479
For the culture.

869
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,314
She lends her support to the arts.

870
01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:40,616
She in her way, I in mine.

871
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:47,155
We have quite a special understanding.

872
01:10:48,096 --> 01:10:49,563
That must be useful at times.

873
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,066
What about these?

874
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,503
I was right. Blue is your color.

875
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:15,684
We thought you deserted us
permanently, Max.

876
01:11:15,757 --> 01:11:17,987
My dear Stephanie,
I would never desert you.

877
01:11:18,426 --> 01:11:19,950
I find it very interesting.

878
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:23,762
Your father must be
a very important man, Miss Bowles.

879
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:26,896
Oh, I'll say, darling.
He's practically an ambassador.

880
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:30,731
We have the most
marvelous relationship...

881
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:34,508
Instant he can tear himself away,
he dashes to wherever I am.

882
01:11:37,078 --> 01:11:39,945
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.

883
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:43,882
Excuse me, but didn't we meet
with Emil Jannings at UFA last winter?

884
01:11:44,185 --> 01:11:45,015
I don't...

885
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:46,713
You do know Emil, don't you?

886
01:11:46,788 --> 01:11:48,881
I find him trטs amusant.

887
01:11:58,399 --> 01:11:59,559
Money.

888
01:12:00,668 --> 01:12:01,794
Be careful!

889
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:04,529
Clara Bow.

890
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:07,669
- That's not Clara Bow.
- It's early Clara Bow.

891
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:12,009
Wait, I got one. I got one.

892
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:16,440
Late Sally Bowles.

893
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:18,211
Yes, it is.

894
01:12:18,987 --> 01:12:20,579
You two are marvelous.

895
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:23,190
Have you ever been to Africa?

896
01:12:23,992 --> 01:12:25,892
- Where, mein Schatz?
- Africa.

897
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:29,319
Let's go, the three of us.
Smile Brian.

898
01:12:37,538 --> 01:12:39,972
- Sally, you're really talented.
- What?

899
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:42,474
You're talented.

900
01:12:47,015 --> 01:12:48,915
He wants to take us to Africa.

901
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:54,944
He must be insane.

902
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,727
More! Come on, please. More!
More, more, more! Please!

903
01:13:00,895 --> 01:13:01,953
- That's all.
- More!

904
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,156
More, please!

905
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,391
More!

906
01:13:10,705 --> 01:13:12,502
- Come on, Max.
- No, no. No.

907
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,202
Oh, please?

908
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:17,306
Oh, bravo, bravo.

909
01:13:46,074 --> 01:13:47,666
The king of the jungle.

910
01:15:12,493 --> 01:15:14,324
What's the matter? You all right?

911
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:22,295
You okay?

912
01:16:12,954 --> 01:16:15,047
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really.

913
01:16:15,223 --> 01:16:17,657
I mean, the way ports are
all over the world.

914
01:16:18,092 --> 01:16:19,616
Sounds absolutely exotic.

915
01:16:20,628 --> 01:16:22,755
All the way through Tanganyika.

916
01:16:23,331 --> 01:16:24,389
Sure?

917
01:16:25,299 --> 01:16:26,630
Sally, champagne?

918
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:36,200
Every now and then the train stops
in the middle of nowhere...

919
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:39,678
...and right there is a family of giraffes,
nibbling the trees...

920
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:42,950
...or a herd of zebra,
galloping off in a cloud of dust.

921
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:46,845
And when the flamingos come in,
thousands and thousands of them...

922
01:16:47,255 --> 01:16:49,189
...turning the whole sky pink...

923
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:51,054
You'll be amazed when you see it.

924
01:16:53,294 --> 01:16:54,921
Hey! Hey, Sally.

925
01:16:56,264 --> 01:16:58,027
Are you quite comfortable?

926
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,259
Come on.

927
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:29,555
Sally is an endearing child.

928
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:33,229
But I must admit I find it peaceful
when she's taking her nap.

929
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:04,855
To Africa.

930
01:18:08,102 --> 01:18:09,126
To Africa.

931

Natalia.

957
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:32,948
Fritz, you frightened me.

958

I'm sorry, but I must speak to you.

959
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:39,193
No, go away. Please go away.
I told you not to come.

The situation is impossible.

962
01:21:43,633 --> 01:21:45,760
We must not see each other anymore.

963
01:21:45,836 --> 01:21:47,565
Is it the money? Is it that?

964
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:02,209
I did think it was the money, at first.

965
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:03,745
But not now.

966
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:07,752
Now I know that you love me.
I know you are an honest man...

Natalia, I beg of you, marry me.

01:22:19,403 --> 01:22:20,461
I can't.

970
01:22:22,906 --> 01:22:25,067
Is it your parents? Isn't it?

971
01:22:25,509 --> 01:22:27,909
It's not my parents. It is me.

972
01:22:28,178 --> 01:22:29,338
It is you, too.

973
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,540
Fritz, be careful!

974
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:38,877
What am I doing?

975
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:42,853
I've never jumped
on a running board before.

976
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,321
Are you all right?

977
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,124
Why won't you marry me?

978
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:54,629
Don't you see what is happening
in Germany today?

979
01:22:55,272 --> 01:22:56,569
I'm a Jew.

980
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,266
You are not.

981
01:23:01,845 --> 01:23:03,107
Goodbye, dear Fritz.

982
01:23:58,168 --> 01:23:59,294
You, drive.

983
01:23:59,436 --> 01:24:00,926
There is somebody in the way, sir.

984
01:24:01,004 --> 01:24:02,562
Just drive on, idiot!

985
01:24:07,811 --> 01:24:11,338
I told Schneider we'd be gone
for at least two months, maybe more.

986
01:24:11,581 --> 01:24:14,049
She cried and cried
and said she'd miss us.

987
01:24:14,518 --> 01:24:16,782
I think the only reason she was crying,
though, was because she knew...

988
01:24:16,853 --> 01:24:19,083
...she can't get 50 marks a month
from anybody else...

989
01:24:19,322 --> 01:24:20,721
...for this pitiful little room.

990
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,281
You know:
"Money makes the world go around."

991
01:24:24,528 --> 01:24:27,725
Where've you been?
I've been packing for hours.

992
01:24:28,999 --> 01:24:31,968
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.

993
01:24:33,603 --> 01:24:36,231
Oh, your laundry came back.
It's there on the bed.

994
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,566
You know Bri, it occurred to me...

995
01:24:41,478 --> 01:24:43,844
I know I've handled Max brilliantly...

996
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:46,407
Enough of the African moon.

997
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:49,213
I mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it,
if he asked me to become...

998
01:24:49,286 --> 01:24:51,948
...the next Baroness von Heune
und Regensburg?

999
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:58,026
I've been looking for that for months.
I mean, stranger things have happened.

1000
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:03,331
I wouldn't dream of accepting him,
of course.

1001
01:25:04,067 --> 01:25:07,332
For God's sake,
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

1002
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:09,805
I mean, really hear yourself!

1003
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:12,196
Christ!

1004
01:25:16,947 --> 01:25:19,780
Aren't you ever gonna stop
deluding yourself?

1005
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,847
"Handling Max!"

1006
01:25:22,586 --> 01:25:26,386
Behaving like some ludicrous, little,
underage femme fatale!

1007
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:30,650
You're about as "fatale"
as an after-dinner mint.

1008
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,862
Darling, we all know...

1009
01:25:42,372 --> 01:25:45,341
...about your vast experiences
with les femmes...

1010
01:25:45,976 --> 01:25:47,273
...fatales, or otherwise.

1011
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:52,404
Why don't you just come out with it?

1012
01:25:53,016 --> 01:25:57,180
You can't stand Maximilian
because he's everything you're not!

1013
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:02,383
He doesn't have to give English lessons
for three marks an hour.

1014
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:03,618
He's rich!

1015
01:26:03,927 --> 01:26:07,192
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books!

1016
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:09,464
He's suave...

1017
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,168
...and he's divinely sexy...

1018
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,571
...and he really appreciates a woman.

1019
01:26:16,873 --> 01:26:19,137
Oh, screw Maximilian!

1020
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:21,666
I do.

1021
01:26:32,455 --> 01:26:33,444
So do I.

1022
01:26:53,043 --> 01:26:55,273
You two bastards!

1023
01:26:58,615 --> 01:26:59,639
Two?

1024
01:27:00,817 --> 01:27:01,875
Two?!

1025
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,516
Shouldn't that be three?

1026
01:27:20,837 --> 01:27:22,429
Help us with our order...

1027
01:27:22,806 --> 01:27:26,071
I think your paper and your party
are pure crap, sir!

1028
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:27,632
What did you say?

1029
01:27:28,111 --> 01:27:30,409
I said: That's a lot of crap!

1030
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,311
And so are you!

1031
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,614
He's a foreigner.

1032
01:27:52,569 --> 01:27:55,732
I hear you took on
the entire Nazi party single-handed.

1033
01:27:58,675 --> 01:27:59,733
Only two?

1034
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:07,410
Sounds like... cigarette?

1035
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,512
Feel up to a little surprise?

1036
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:26,862
Poor thing, you're blind.

1037
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:32,665
"Dear Sally and Bri..."
In that order, please note.

1038
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:39,415
"I know you will forgive me,
but family affairs make it imperative...

1039
01:28:39,549 --> 01:28:41,517
"...for me to leave
for Argentina, immediately.

1040
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:43,379
"It was fun, wasn't it?"

1041
01:28:44,854 --> 01:28:46,412
Signed: "Maximilian."

1042
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:48,913
Argentina, my ass.

1043
01:28:50,727 --> 01:28:52,194
He also sent this.

1044
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,296
Three hundred marks.

1045
01:28:54,597 --> 01:28:55,996
For the two of us.

1046
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,395
A hundred and fifty each.

1047
01:29:03,373 --> 01:29:05,739
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...

1048
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:08,571
...that puts us on a par with Frהulein Kost.

1049
01:29:11,981 --> 01:29:13,539
Some gold diggers, aren't we?

1050
01:29:19,823 --> 01:29:21,484
Oh, Brian, I'm so sorry.

1051
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:14,194
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1052
01:31:14,404 --> 01:31:16,736
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1053
01:32:20,036 --> 01:32:21,503
Anything the matter?

1054
01:32:26,342 --> 01:32:28,207
What is it? What's happened?

1055
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:32,272
Goddammit, I'm gonna have a baby!

1056
01:32:36,252 --> 01:32:38,015
Well, aren't you gonna ask?

1057
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:39,480
All right.

1058
01:32:40,123 --> 01:32:41,886
- Whose is it?
- I don't know.

1059
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:46,328
I really don't know.

1060
01:32:47,063 --> 01:32:49,759
- What are you going to do?
- Obviously, I can't have it.

1061
01:32:51,334 --> 01:32:53,165
The doctor I went to said he'll do it.

1062
01:32:54,637 --> 01:32:56,662
But it's expensive. He has to...

1063
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:59,399
...bribe somebody or other
for some kind of...

1064
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:02,103
...a certificate or something.
Oh, I don't know.

1065
01:33:03,446 --> 01:33:04,708
Well...

1066
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,373
...there goes my fur coat.

1067
01:33:53,763 --> 01:33:55,458
I would like to marry you.

1068
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:03,600
- Okay, a touch of toothpaste.
- Naturally.

1069
01:34:03,973 --> 01:34:05,167
A lot of gin.

1070
01:34:06,175 --> 01:34:08,075
All whooshed up together.

1071
01:34:09,846 --> 01:34:13,247
With this spiked prairie oyster,
I thee wed.

1072
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,247
To the future.

1073
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:19,751
With any luck,
I'll get a fellowship at King's.

1074
01:34:19,856 --> 01:34:21,551
Oh, dear, what's that?

1075
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:23,619
My college at Cambridge.

1076
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:26,824
- You'll absolutely love it there.
- I know I will.

1077
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:32,867
- It's crazy.
- Who?

1078
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:37,038
Me. Wanting to be an actress.

1079
01:34:44,013 --> 01:34:46,811
I guess babies love you automatically,
don't they?

1080
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:52,047
They don't have much of a choice.

1081
01:34:57,894 --> 01:35:00,488
- To you and the baby.
- To me and the baby.

1082
01:35:06,669 --> 01:35:08,136
Probably is yours.

1083
01:35:10,106 --> 01:35:11,971
But I don't suppose
we'll ever know for sure.

1084
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:16,066
So what?

1085
01:35:19,482 --> 01:35:21,211
You sure you don't mind?

1086
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:24,041
Honestly?

1087
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:25,876
Honestly.

1088
01:35:30,259 --> 01:35:31,419
Oh, Bri...

1089
01:35:32,995 --> 01:35:35,429
- To me and the baby.
- To you and the baby.

1090
01:35:40,203 --> 01:35:41,636
To you. You.

1091
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:43,135
Me? To me.

1092
01:35:44,607 --> 01:35:46,040
And the baby.

1093
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,674
- Oh, where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1094
01:35:57,553 --> 01:36:01,580
You are a most strange
and extraordinary person.

1095
01:36:01,724 --> 01:36:02,986
I know, I know.

1096
01:36:10,967 --> 01:36:12,298
The proud father.

1097
01:37:09,959 --> 01:37:13,690
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. I can't believe it.

1098
01:37:15,464 --> 01:37:16,692
How's Natalia?

1099
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:19,198
Please, I do not speak of Natalia.

1100
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:21,361
As bad as that?

1101
01:37:21,704 --> 01:37:22,693
Bad.

1102
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:25,400
Perhaps I cut myself at the throat.

1103
01:37:25,574 --> 01:37:27,701
Prepositions, Fritz, prepositions.

1104
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:29,441
"In the throat?"

1105
01:37:29,612 --> 01:37:31,307
No, just "cut my throat."

1106
01:37:32,415 --> 01:37:33,677
I assure you...

1107
01:37:35,117 --> 01:37:37,711
...they're all in it together.

1108
01:37:38,354 --> 01:37:42,814
If all the Jews are bankers,
then how can they be Communists, too?

1109
01:37:43,659 --> 01:37:44,785
Subtle...

1110
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,657
...very subtle, Frהulein Kost.

1111
01:37:47,363 --> 01:37:49,797
If they can't destroy us one way...

1112
01:37:52,535 --> 01:37:54,196
...they try the other.

1113
01:37:55,538 --> 01:37:57,768
You don't really believe that, do you?

1114
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,932
But you read it every day
in the Volkischer Beobachter.

1115
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:04,610
That ridiculous Nazi tripe!

1116
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:07,880
It is an established fact, Herr Roberts...

1117
01:38:08,684 --> 01:38:13,212
...that there exists a well-organized
international conspiracy...

1118
01:38:13,622 --> 01:38:17,023
...of Jewish bankers and Communists.

1119
01:38:18,928 --> 01:38:21,590
It's also an established fact,
that there exists...

1120
01:38:21,664 --> 01:38:25,293
...another well-organized group,
of which you're obviously a member.

1121
01:38:25,601 --> 01:38:28,695
The International Conspiracy
of Horses' Asses.

1122
01:38:33,509 --> 01:38:35,306
I wish the Kaiser was back.

1123
01:38:36,178 --> 01:38:37,975
In those days we had order.

1124
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:42,742
I expect Schneider will raise my rent
after that little exhibition.

1125
01:38:43,652 --> 01:38:45,313
Oh, well, what the hell.

1126
01:38:47,156 --> 01:38:48,919
Let's get on with these prepositions.

1127
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:51,516
What a black day I'm meeting that girl!

1128
01:38:53,662 --> 01:38:55,425
I... I thought you loved her.

1129
01:38:55,931 --> 01:38:58,331
Love, love,
who's needing verdammtes love?

1130
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,537
You want to hear the big joke on me?

1131
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:04,239
You want to hear it?

1132
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:08,009
I am a Jew.

1133
01:39:09,345 --> 01:39:10,369
So?

1134
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,509
To be a Jew in Germany?

1135
01:39:13,582 --> 01:39:15,447
Only a fool is this, I think.

1136
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:17,107
So...

1137
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:20,014
...I come to Berlin and I'm not a Jew.

1138
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:22,752
How did you manage that?

1139
01:39:23,526 --> 01:39:25,960
Where it says on my papers "religion"...

1140
01:39:26,595 --> 01:39:29,257
...I am writing..."Protestant."

1141
01:39:29,999 --> 01:39:31,990
So, the work comes.

1142
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:34,500
The friends come.

1143
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:36,802
The parties come.

1144
01:39:37,873 --> 01:39:38,862
Parties.

1145
01:39:41,277 --> 01:39:44,542
Whoever dreams
that I shall fall in love with a Jewish girl?

1146
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,175
But surely that solves your problem.

1147
01:39:47,783 --> 01:39:50,843
- All you've got to do is tell her...
- Do you understand nothing?

1148
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:51,978
This girl!

1149
01:39:55,057 --> 01:39:57,617
Do you know what she has done to me?

1150
01:39:58,461 --> 01:39:59,689
It's terrible!

1151
01:40:02,198 --> 01:40:04,928
She has turned me into an honest man.

1152
01:40:06,435 --> 01:40:08,232
"Oh, you're good," she says.

1153
01:40:08,404 --> 01:40:11,464
"A man of integrity,
who will never lie to me."

1154
01:40:16,212 --> 01:40:18,612
What does she do if I tell her now?

1155
01:40:19,615 --> 01:40:22,209
I tell you what she does,
if I tell her now.

1156
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:24,343
She kicks me out into the streets.

1157
01:40:25,688 --> 01:40:28,623
Don't be silly! She'd understand.

1158
01:40:30,793 --> 01:40:32,522
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

1159
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:36,390
What do I lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.

1160
01:40:36,632 --> 01:40:39,965
All my friends hear I'm a Jew,
they kick me out into the streets.

1161
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:44,199
And then, I think, comes a big Nazi
with a club and bangs me on the head.

1162
01:40:48,077 --> 01:40:50,705
Fritz, I really think
you're underestimating Natalia.

1163
01:40:55,718 --> 01:40:57,049
What am I doing?

1164
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,710
I don't like whiskey.

1165
01:41:00,723 --> 01:41:02,190
Look, just tell her.

1166
01:41:02,758 --> 01:41:04,589
No, I can't, I can't.

1167
01:41:06,128 --> 01:41:07,925
What a coward am I.

1168
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:26,043
"I know what you're thinking.

1169
01:41:27,016 --> 01:41:29,109
"You wonder why I chose her

1170
01:41:29,752 --> 01:41:33,085
"Out of all the ladies in the world.

1171
01:41:35,057 --> 01:41:37,457
"It's just a first impression.

1172
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,654
"What good's a first impression?

1173
01:41:41,597 --> 01:41:46,091
"If you knew her like I do

1174
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:53,606
"It would change your point of view.

1175
01:42:05,387 --> 01:42:08,823
"If you could see her through my eyes

1176
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:12,892
"You wouldn't wonder at all.

1177
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:16,965
"If you could see her through my eyes

1178
01:42:17,566 --> 01:42:21,468
"I guarantee you would fall like I did.

1179
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:24,639
"When we're in public together

1180
01:42:25,507 --> 01:42:28,874
"I hear society moan

1181
01:42:29,545 --> 01:42:33,174
"But if they could see her through my eyes

1182
01:42:33,816 --> 01:42:36,751
"Maybe they'd leave us alone.

1183
01:42:43,826 --> 01:42:46,954
"How can I speak of her virtues

1184
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:50,899
"I don't know where to begin.

1185
01:42:51,734 --> 01:42:53,668
"She's clever,
She's smart

1186
01:42:53,969 --> 01:42:55,300
"She reads music.

1187
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:59,773
"She doesn't smoke or drink gin like I do

1188
01:43:00,075 --> 01:43:03,044
"Yet when we're walking together

1189
01:43:03,912 --> 01:43:07,177
"They sneer if I'm holding her hand

1190
01:43:07,983 --> 01:43:11,817
"But if they could see her through my eyes

1191
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:15,054
"Maybe they'd all understand.

1192
01:43:47,322 --> 01:43:51,122
"Why don't they leave us alone?"

1193
01:44:08,477 --> 01:44:11,071
Meine Damen und Herren,
mesdames et messieurs...

1194
01:44:11,146 --> 01:44:12,841
...ladies und gentlemen...

1195
01:44:13,282 --> 01:44:14,544
...I ask you...

1196
01:44:14,616 --> 01:44:17,084
...is it a crime to fall in love?

1197
01:44:18,353 --> 01:44:22,153
Can one ever choose
where the heart leads us?

1198
01:44:23,358 --> 01:44:26,486
All we ask is that you understand.

1199
01:44:27,629 --> 01:44:29,221
A little understanding.

1200
01:44:29,465 --> 01:44:33,458
Why can't the world live and let live?

1201
01:44:34,603 --> 01:44:38,061
Live und let live.

1202
01:44:39,241 --> 01:44:42,642
"Oh, I understand your objection

1203
01:44:43,145 --> 01:44:46,308
"I grant you the problem's not small

1204
01:44:47,516 --> 01:44:50,451
"But if you could see her

1205
01:44:50,853 --> 01:44:54,584
"Through my eyes

1206
01:44:59,261 --> 01:45:02,094
"She wouldn't look Jewish at all."

1207
01:45:49,545 --> 01:45:50,569
I'm a Jew.

1208
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,831
Brian, anything wrong?

1209
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:56,209
Lazy that's all.

1210
01:46:56,812 --> 01:46:58,074
That's all?

1211
01:46:58,947 --> 01:47:00,107
That's all.

1212
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:17,763
Look what I found.

1213
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:20,790
See?

1214
01:47:22,104 --> 01:47:23,435
We must be lucky.

1215
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:38,384
Will you still love me
when I'm blown up like a balloon?

1216
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:40,819
Will my body drive you
wild with desire?

1217
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,597
Sure. Why not?

1218
01:47:55,404 --> 01:47:58,805
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:

1219
01:47:59,141 --> 01:48:01,041
Your life and my life...

1220
01:48:02,044 --> 01:48:04,842
...solved in one fell swoop.
And all by the baby!

1221
01:48:06,949 --> 01:48:11,113
I guess it's just about the most significant
baby the world has ever known...

1222
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,287
...since Jesus.

1223
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:20,624
It'll be a most strange
and extraordinary baby, won't it?

1224
01:49:59,528 --> 01:50:01,086
Good morning, darling.

1225
01:50:07,335 --> 01:50:10,463
Darling, would you mind seeing
if there's a bit of brandy left?

1226
01:50:11,173 --> 01:50:13,471
Put an egg in it,
and we'll call it breakfast.

1227
01:50:17,312 --> 01:50:19,837
I suppose you wonder
what on earth happened to me?

1228
01:50:20,882 --> 01:50:23,282
I'm afraid we made a night of it.

1229
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,528
Where's your fur coat?

1230
01:50:48,243 --> 01:50:49,835
You did it, didn't you?

1231
01:50:51,246 --> 01:50:52,611
Did what, darling?

1232
01:50:53,482 --> 01:50:54,676
The abortion.

1233
01:51:02,324 --> 01:51:03,655
In God's name...

1234
01:51:05,927 --> 01:51:06,916
...why?

1235
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:12,664
One of my whims?

1236
01:51:17,272 --> 01:51:19,103
Is that all you can say?

1237
01:51:20,008 --> 01:51:21,407
"One of my whims?"

1238
01:51:22,644 --> 01:51:23,702
What right...?

1239
01:51:23,778 --> 01:51:26,975
If you wanna hit me,
why don't you just hit me?

1240
01:51:35,991 --> 01:51:37,356
But you wanted it.

1241
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:41,120
Didn't you?

1242
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:49,701
Me and the baby.

1243
01:51:52,607 --> 01:51:55,804
I suppose Max Reinhardt
did show up at the club.

1244
01:51:55,877 --> 01:51:58,675
Or was it a friend of a friend
of a friend of...

1245
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:03,114
...an assistant director who said he'd
try to squeeze you into the chorus line?

1246
01:52:03,185 --> 01:52:05,210
That is, of course, if you...

1247
01:52:06,454 --> 01:52:07,853
...if you went to bed with him.

1248
01:52:11,326 --> 01:52:13,260
- You think that?
- Yes.

1249
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:19,497
Well then, it's just as well, isn't it?

1250
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:21,666
For you, for everyone.

1251
01:52:23,705 --> 01:52:27,471
And, darling, would you be an angel
and just let me get some sleep?

1252
01:52:38,853 --> 01:52:40,445
Tell me why you did it.

1253
01:52:44,759 --> 01:52:47,557
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.

1254
01:52:48,563 --> 01:52:49,791
Sally, please.

1255
01:52:51,766 --> 01:52:53,028
I have to know.

1256
01:52:56,137 --> 01:52:57,126
Okay.

1257
01:53:01,943 --> 01:53:04,377
I'm self-centered, inconsiderate...

1258
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:08,912
...and what was the third adjective?

1259
01:53:09,184 --> 01:53:10,208
Oh, yes.

1260
01:53:10,452 --> 01:53:13,182
And I have this infantile fantasy...

1261
01:53:13,588 --> 01:53:17,046
...that one day I'll amount
to something as an actress.

1262
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:25,758
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?

1263
01:53:26,434 --> 01:53:29,767
A playpen in the bedroom,
diapers on the towel rack...

1264
01:53:31,906 --> 01:53:35,501
How soon would it be
before we started hating each other?

1265
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:40,310
How soon would it be before
I started dashing out...

1266
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:43,679
...disgracing myself at some nearest pub?

1267
01:53:44,619 --> 01:53:46,746
And how soon would it be before...?

1268
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:52,752
Before?

1269
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:57,092
Say it.

1270
01:53:58,199 --> 01:53:59,257
Go on!

1271
01:54:00,168 --> 01:54:01,965
You might as well, now.

1272
01:54:02,404 --> 01:54:03,598
Forget it.

1273
01:54:04,506 --> 01:54:05,768
Just forget it.

1274
01:54:09,444 --> 01:54:10,502
I see.

1275
01:54:20,922 --> 01:54:22,719
I really do love you.

1276
01:54:24,192 --> 01:54:26,183
Yes. Yes, I think...

1277
01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:30,694
...I think you do love me.

1278
01:54:39,607 --> 01:54:41,074
You... you all right?

1279
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:47,209
Is there anything I can...

1280
01:54:49,284 --> 01:54:50,649
...do for you?

1281
01:54:54,756 --> 01:54:57,350
I just think I should sleep a little while.

1282
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:20,007
Oh, shit!

1283
01:55:22,951 --> 01:55:23,975
Magazines?

1284
01:55:24,919 --> 01:55:25,749
No.

1285
01:55:26,788 --> 01:55:27,880
It's a long trip.

1286
01:55:32,594 --> 01:55:33,652
Chocolate?

1287
01:55:35,063 --> 01:55:35,927
No.
