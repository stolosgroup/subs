00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:44,571
My fellow Amerlcans, 
thls war Is a new klnd of war. 

11
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:48,113

18
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:56,742
Thanks, Dad.

19
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,113
Nice of you to come.

20
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,221
- Come on, you're gonna miss the train.
- Okay.

21
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,662
- Make it back.
- I promise I will.

22
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,014
Bye.

23
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:50,658
Chlcagol

24
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,235
Next stop, Chicago!

25
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,101
Keep your tickets to reboard!

26
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,921
You see any lipstick on me?

27
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,194
Lipstick? No.

28
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:17,490
No? Frances sure did.

29
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,931
That girl's got eagle eyes when
it comes to spottin' lipstick on me.

30
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,201
If I ain't got nothin' on me
she probably slapped it off.

31
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,812
- Is that seat taken?
- Have a sit down.

32
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:43,753
Tickets, please.

33
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,217
"Stick and Rudder"? You a pilot?

34
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,698
Me neither.

35
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:57,033
But I will when Uncle Sam finishes kickin'
my ass and pinnin' them wings on me.

36
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,838
- You fellas on your way to Tuskegee?
- Yes.

37
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,671
- You, too?
- Finally.

38
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,937
Yes, I am.

39
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,141
Excuse me?

40
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,539
A licensed pilot.

41
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,309
I bet he didn't even have to take the test.

42
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:16,656
Billy Roberts.

43
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:21,193
On the block they call me, "Train".
As in "A-Train". Quickest way to Harlem.

44
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,455
- Block?
- Lennox and 125th.

45
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,457
What block you from?

46
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:28,296
I'm from a small town in Iowa. Ottumwa.

47
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,494
Iowa?

48
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,267
I didn't know they had colored folk in Iowa.

49
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,206
But now I got livin' proof
sittin' here next to me.

50
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:40,143
What'd you get on that exam there, Iowa?

51
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,508
Ninety-eight.

52
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,847
Ninety-eight. That's very good.

53
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:47,078
So you did take that test?

54
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,584
That is very good.

55
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,385
But it ain't as good as mine,
which is one-zero-zero.

56
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,960
But congratulations on bein' second best.

57
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:58,590
Here we go.

58
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,345
Getup. Come on, get up.

59
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,852
- What?
- Move it. That's what.

60
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,657
Get your stuff and move it up front.
Now. Let's go.

61
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,926
- Move it, boy!
- All right.

62
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:31,361
- I won't ask you to do it again, damnit!
- Excuse me, please.

63
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:40,664
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

64
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,204
But why are we getting off the train?

65
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,369
See that?

66
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,078
The car you are in
is now for white folks only.

67
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,808
That's why you're gettin' off.

68
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:55,218
Keep in line now. One behind the other.

69
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,421
Keep it tight.

70
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,388
- German prisoners.
- Make way!

71
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,288
I'll be damned.

72
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,304
German pro car's in the front, boys.

73
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,042
Shit.

74
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,810
We give up seats
for German prisoners?

75
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,507
This train's leavin, boy.
Either get on or back off.

76
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,654
All aboard!

77
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:54,101
Hold up!

78
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,449
Where you goin'?

79
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,284
That's me. Just like a raven.

80
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:21,837
Let's go!

81
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,409
Drill Sergeants, give me two lines of six!

82
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,381
Get the lead out! You gotta start movin'!

83
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,421
- Put your bag behind you!
- Behind you!

84
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,189
Turn to your right!

85
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,658
Your military right!

86
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,993
Pick your bag up with your right hand!

87
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:45,656
Follow me!

88
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,567
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left!

89
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,043
Cadets march!

90
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:05,709
Left, left, left. Group, halt!

91
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,413
Turn to your left.

92
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,583
Push your man on your left to your left.

93
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,793
Come on. Come on. Move over.

94
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,885
Put your bag down on your right.

95
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:20,997
Post.

96
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,239
Gentlemen,
welcome to Tuskegee Army Airfield.

97
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,837
I'm Colonel Noel Rogers,
the Commanding Officer.

98
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,845
This is Major Sherman Joy,
Director of Training...

99
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,381
...and Lieutenant Glenn, Liaison Officer.

100
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:41,176
It is the task of myself,
Major Joy, Lieutenant Glenn...

101
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,313
...and others at this training facility...

102
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:46,722
...to train and evaluate you men
as potential combat pilots.

103
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,896
There have been many obstacles
on the road to getting you here.

104
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:57,764
Now that you are here,
the only obstacle you will encounter...

105
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,971
...will be how quick you learn...

106
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,234
...how well you obey orders...

107
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,603
...and how expert you fly.

108
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,074
If I am the first to tell you...

109
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,974
...that your being here is an experiment...

110
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,747
...take time to understand
just what that means.

111
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,292
There are people in very high places
wonderin' if this will succeed.

112
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:29,828
If I and my staff
have anything to say about it, it will.

113
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:31,829
However...

114
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:35,473
...we will cut no corners.

115
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,975
We will allow no favors.

116
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:42,013
Our business is killin' our enemies
from the air...

117
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:45,915
...as efficiently and expeditiously
as we know how.

118
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:50,650
Assuming you make it through
this training, that task will be your honor.

119
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,919
- Lieutenant.
- Major.

120
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,129
Why did you join the Air Corps?

121
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,269
Cadet?

122
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:10,770
Sir.

123
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:13,341
I don't like repeatin' myself, Cadet.

124
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,277
To serve my country, sir.

125
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,545
Your country?

126
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,076
Boy, are you stupid?

127
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:23,683
No, sir.

128
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,351
You people...

129
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,193
Don't you know how bad
we treat you people?

130
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,290
Servin' your country...

131
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,292
This ain't your country.

132
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,301
Your country's full of apes and gorillas...

133
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,734
...malaria...

134
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,163
...missionaries.

135
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,103
Ain't no gorillas in Harlem.

136
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,009
Why'd you join the Air Corps, boy?

137
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,221
This country has enemies and there
are people who need protecting from them.

138
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,790
What people, nigger?

139
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:00,690
All people, sir.

140
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:04,186
To my knowledge
the Germans aren't sparing the coloreds.

141
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:08,529
To my knowledge, the colored aren't up to
fightin' the Germans, let alone, beatin' 'em.

142
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,392
Max Schmeling found out differently, sir.

143
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,002
You know what?

144
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:20,443
My job is to see if you Joe Louises can fly.

145
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:26,549
In case the Colonel gave you
the wrong impression, let me clear it up.

146
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,050
You are nothing...

147
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,551
...special.

148
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,330
You just heard two
very different speeches...

149
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,400
...from two very different officers.

150
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,604
I hope you were paying attention.

151
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:59,908
It is my job as Liaison Officer
to ease your transition to military life.

152
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:03,745
Reveille's at zero six-hundred
PT's at zero six-thirty...

153
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,658
...and breakfast is at zero seven-thirty.

154
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,259
At the top of the military
command structure...

155
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,092
...is President Roosevelt
as Commander and Chief.

156
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:16,392
At the bottom is you, the cadet.

157
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:22,539
Everything you need
can and will be found on this base.

158
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:27,709
Everything you need to know
has the words "U.S. Army Air Corps"...

159
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,475
...written on the cover.

160
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,140
If it doesn't...

161
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:33,615
...you don't need it.

162
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,314
We got weekends. 

163
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,321
I klnd of flgured that would happen. 

164
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,743
Hey, Iowa.

165
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,007
Yeah?

166
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,647
You ready for all of this?

167
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,624
I mean, "We in the Army now, boy."

168
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:18,629
Well, it's not Ottumwa, but...
I've been ready for this for a long time.

169
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,757
What about you, Walter?

170
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,197
What, Stick?

171
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,798
Stick was born ready.

172
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,573
He probably popped out his mama
with a full bomb load.

173
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,072
Come graduation...

174
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,742
...none of your names
will be in front of mine.

175
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,008
Is that right?

176
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,713
Guaranteed.

177
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:43,811
What might that name be, Reverend
Book Worm? "Stick" or "Rudder?"

178
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,747
Peoples.

179
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,128
Walter Derrick, the third.

180
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,864
Aeronautical Engineer.

181
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:58,133
Hannibal Lee, Jr. Pre-med.

182
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,568
Lewis Johns. English Literature.

183
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:07,576
William "A-Train" Roberts.
Political Science.

184
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:13,276
Roy Jonas Cappy. Art History.

185
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,680
Andrew Turner. Sociology.

186
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,159
Charles Tate. Halfback.

187
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,388
William Pitts. Economics.

188
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,733
Class. Attention!

189
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,702
Take your seats.

190
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,244
Take one and pass 'em back.

191
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:52,416
What is this?

192
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,728
Permission to speak, sir?

193
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,161
What is it, cadet?

194
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,926
Sir, I believe we've already taken
this test before.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,161
And I believe you'll take it again.

196
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,333
May the cadet ask why, sir?

197
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,232
You don't have time for an explanation,
cadet.

198
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,475
You have one hour for this exam.

199
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,902
Begin and end on my mark.

200
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:15,974
Name an element.

201
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,848
Cadet Lee.

202
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,849
Water, sir.

203
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,113
Any others? Cadet Johns?

204
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,277
Earth, sir.

205
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,616
Cadet Peoples?

206
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:24,978
Air, sir.

207
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,791
- Cappy?
- Fire, sir.

208
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:30,118
Water, air, earth, and fire.

209
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,526
Of these elements,
I direct your attention to air and fire.

210
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,937
Although it's your privilege to live
in the air, it's your destiny to die by fire.

211
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,437
Many of you will wash out
before you ever set foot in an airplane.

212
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:48,941
Others will die during primary
flight training. Still others in advanced.

213
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:54,176
When you die, we will cross off your name,
close ranks and carry on.

214
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,018
Now...

215
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,618
...any of you ever been
up in an airplane before?

216
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,886
Yes, sir. When I was in college, sir.

217
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,195
I have a pilot's license, sir.

218
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,296
Is that right?

219
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:08,793
Yes, sir.

220
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,398
Follow me, Mr. Lindbergh.

221
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:22,178
All right, Peoples,
let's see what you're made of.

222
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,187
He's tryin' to wear Stick out.

223
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,221
Doin' it on purpose, too.

224
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,285
Yell when you had enough, "Fly Boy."

225
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,752
How you doin' back there?

226
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,856
What about a loop?

227
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,481
You must read your flight manual
and know it like the Holy Bible.

228
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:36,783
Yes, sir.

229
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:39,357
That goes for all of you. Is that clear?

230
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,414
Yes, sir!

231
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,190
Hey you! Cadet Peoples!

232
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,859
Why'd you join the Air Corps, boy?

233
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,334
I ain't thinking about Major Joy.

234
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,773
He's just another door in the way.

235
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,331
Another crack in the box.

236
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,400
Another pecker in the woods.

237
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:05,173
"I just want to serve my country, sir."

238
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,742
"What country?
You don't have a country!"

239
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,454
Goddamn uppity nigger son of a bitch!

240
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,116
I'm real sorry, sir. Your country!

241
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,592
Uppity niggers turn into strange fruit
where I come from.

242
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,430
Strange what?

243
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,737
"Nigger hangin' from a tree.

244
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,367
"Just swingin'
from a hangman's vine is he.

245
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:36,442
"Talk Back Joe was his name, all three.

246
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,915
"Massa shut-his mouth
then he turned to me.

247
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:45,019
"Lord, Massa shut his mouth!

248
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,117
"Then he turned to me."

249
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,838
Did you learn that in English Lit, Johns?

250
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,134
My great granddaddy
told me that sittin' on his knee.

251
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,904
It's a hell of a bedtime story.

252
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,021
As Director of Training
I assumed I had the authority...

253
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,785
...to conduct any testing
I thought necessary, sir.

254
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:23,157
That assumption was incorrect, Major.

255
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,130
These men have all previously been tested.

256
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,062
Why should you test them again?

257
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:32,868
The previous test scores themselves, sir.
Nineties, one hundreds.

258
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:36,466
I am suspicious
about the accuracy of those scores.

259
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,807
You think they cheated to get here?

260
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:43,812
A lot of people dream to be pilots, Colonel.
Many will stop at nothing to become one.

261
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:49,510
Eliminating dishonest, untrainable cadets
will save my staff time and aggravation.

262
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:51,980
I see.

263
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:56,190
Here are the answers to your retest.

264
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:01,793
I got the results as soon as
they were compiled. I too have curiosity.

265
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,959
Although, I suspect my motives
are somewhat different.

266
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,934
Cadet Lewis Johns, 98.

267
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,673
Cadet Billy Roberts, 100.

268
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,239
Cadet Walter Peoples, 100.
Cadet Hannibal Lee, 100.

269
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:19,147
I could go on. No one scored less than 95.

270
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:27,416
These people are taking up training slots
that would be better filled by real pilots.

271
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,061
There's a war on.

272
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:32,088
Yes, Major, there is.

273
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:35,561
And I'd prefer that war
was not on this base.

274
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,396
That'll be all, Major.

275
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,606
PT-17.

276
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:50,077
Fuel capacity and engine? Cadet Johns.

277
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:54,447
Fuel: 46 gallons.
Engine: 220 horse power, Continental, sir!

278
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,786
Left spin recovery technique?
Cadet Peoples.

279
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:06,559
Right rudder, stop rotation,
sharp forward stick, pull out from dive, sir!

280
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,867
All right. Let's go up!

281
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,541
Pay attention, cadet!

282
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:21,971
- Nose down!
- Yes, sir!

283
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,739
Let's do it now!

284
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:31,283
- Recover, cadet!
- I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!

285
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,457
Nose up. Nose down.

286
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,257
Watch your air speed.

287
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:37,224
Pick up, damn it! Pick up!

288
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,422
Let go! I got it!

289
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,097
Step on the ball.

290
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,630
I'd like to step on his balls.

291
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,101
Let go, damn it!

292
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,299
Lewlsl

293
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:58,806
Cadet Lewls Johns... 

294
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:03,919
...just taught you men the most important
lesson you'll learn here at Tuskegee.

295
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:12,455
If you don't believe in God,
you better find a damn good substitute.

296
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,398
As you were.

297
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,154
You missed chow.

298
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,056
I wasn't hungry.

299
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,663
- Can I give you a hand?
- I don't need a hand!

300
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,802
What the hell is eatin' you, Cappy?

301
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:34,707
Three more washed out today:
Bradley, Wade and Patterson.

302
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:40,009
Wade just broke down
and walked off the base. And Lewis!

303
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,910
I can't get him out of my head.

304
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:46,218
You'll get your chance to solo.
You'll make it. We'll make it.

305
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,793
That's bullshit, Hannibal! And you know it!

306
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:51,191
We're not all gonna make it.

307
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:55,094
When we first got here
this barracks was filled.

308
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,098
Look at it now.

309
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,967
One third of us is gone and
we're halfway through this program.

310
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,029
So what?

311
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,265
Big deal.

312
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,238
I know I'm gonna make it, Leroy.

313
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,210
That's all that matters.

314
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,048
What about you?

315
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,052
You gonna make it?

316
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,251
I don't know.

317
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:23,862
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I said "I don't know", okay?

318
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:25,328
No.

319
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,862
It's not okay.

320
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,469
It's the wrong damn answer.

321
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,931
Now, the question is:
"Are you gonna make it?"

322
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,673
'Cause if you don't think you will,
you won't.

323
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:44,849
And then you will have failed.

324
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:48,883
You will have failed your family,
you will have failed your friends...

325
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:52,720
...and most importantly,
you will have failed yourself.

326
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,525
Can you live with that?

327
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:57,891
No.

328
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,633
Are you going to make it?

329
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:16,937
- Yeah. I'm gonna make it.
- Say it like you mean it, cadet.

330
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,683
I'm going to make it.

331
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:33,829
"Flght, flght, flght, flght, 
flghtlng 99th

332
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:38,165
"Down in flames they go

333
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,500
"Fighting men of the 99th
Send them down below

334
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:45,600
"For we are heroes of the night
To hell with the axer's might

335
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,702
"Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fighting 99th

336
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,182
"Drink up

337
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,914
"Raise those cups to those gallant men

338
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:02,225
"Fighting cross of flame, oh, God

339
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,691
"Red, white, blue..."

340
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:19,610
- It's all yours.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,450
Nice turn!

342
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:40,691
Beg your pardon, sir,
but why are we stopping?

343
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,057
Did the cadet do something wrong, sir?

344
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:47,330
I'll give you the opportunity of killing
yourself without taking me with you.

345
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:49,366
You're soloing, cadet!

346
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:53,265
Give me three circuits around the pattern,
each to a full stop.

347
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:56,963
Yes, sir!

348
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:04,931
Damn.

349
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:13,312
Any questions on the film you just saw?

350
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:19,917
No questions?

351
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:27,921
Timidness is a characteristic
that gets fighter pilots killed.

352
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,396
Sir, where's Major Joy?

353
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:33,960
I was assumed that he was teaching
air combat techniques.

354
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,939
And why is that...

355
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,632
...cadet?

356
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,639
Because he's white and I'm colored?

357
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,244
Come on, spit it out, man.

358
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,013
No disrespect.

359
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:52,551
It's just a matter of experience, Sir.

360
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:59,457
Another assumption.

361
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:08,305
I'm going to give you the facts, cadet.

362
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:13,942
Out of 150 U.S. Army officers
on this base...

363
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:18,849
...you are looking at the only one
with actual air combat experience.

364
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,484
I have three 109 kills...

365
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:28,684
...and I've had a Spitfire and a Hurricane
shot out from under me.

366
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
Both times behind enemy lines...

367
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,023
...and both times I escaped.

368
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,163
But the Air Corps didn't allow
colored fliers. How'd you do that?

369
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:42,502
He went north. Royal Canadian Air Force.
Right, Lieutenant?

370
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,506
Forty-eight missions.

371
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:49,738
Now, if you don't think I have
anything to teach you...

372
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,873
...you are free to walk out of that door.

373
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:56,979
My job...

374
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,017
...is to teach you basic air combat tactics.

375
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:08,123
Your next training machine, the AT-6.

376
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:11,660
"Bank without a turn."

377
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:15,896
If you learn nothing else, learn this one.
It will save your life.

378
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,738
It starts with a hard bank.

379
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:26,381
Peoples,
you're supposed to be tryin' to get away.

380
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:30,343
Yeah? You're lookin' at the man
who put the "dog" in "dogfight."

381
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:37,790
I got your ass now, Walter.

382
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,633
Walter,
you didn't expect me to fall for that.

383
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,233
Fall for this.

384
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:56,070
Where the hell are you?

385
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:58,012
Look behind your ass, Iowa.

386
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:03,109
Bang! You are dead.

387
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:08,091
- Damn! Where'd you learn that?
- Just made it up, man. Just made it up.

388
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:12,090
Come on, Peoples.
I don't believe you just made that up.

389
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:15,462
- Where'd you learn it?
- The same place I learned this.

390
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,030
You're too low!

391
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,868
We can't buzz the field.

392
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,242
Walterl

393
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,150
What's a llttle vlctory roll between frlends? 

394
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,329
I don't see we have much choice, Colonel.

395
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:53,501
I lost one instructor
when Johns crashed and burned.

396
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:56,131
This stunt could have cost us
another plane and pilot.

397
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:59,635
Besides, I've had my doubts
about cadet Peoples for some time.

398
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:03,442
He and that boy Hannibal are showboats,
with attitudes that get men killed.

399
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,476
And what do you think, Lieutenant?

400
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,482
It was a damn fool thing to do, sir.

401
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,723
But I've seen the Air Corps overlook worse.

402
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,625
Would you trust him
on your wing in combat?

403
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,828
He's one of the few that I'd trust.

404
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:24,895
Maybe there's a reason for that,
apart from his flying abilities.

405
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:31,139
I've flown with white pilots
in actual combat...

406
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:34,003
...who don't have his skills, sir.

407
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:42,313
When these men arrived, I told them
no corners would be cut for them.

408
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:46,646
They're gonna have to be held
to the highest standards of the service.

409
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:55,190
But is it fair for that standard to be
higher than any other group of men?

410
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,727
It was simple youthful exuberance,
Colonel!

411
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:02,498
I do a difficult job as well as I can,
Lieutenant.

412
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:08,874
That'll be all, gentlemen.

413
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:19,849
- High test scores don't mean everything.
- I said, "That will be all," Major!

414
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:26,528
Cadets, attention!

415
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,003
I'm sorry.

416
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:58,059
- Lieutenant...
- I wish there was something I could do.

417
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:10,170
Walter?

418
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:14,245
Dismissed.

419
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,647
Walter! Walter!

420
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,048
There's little margin for error here.

421
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,648
I don't see any margin at all, sir.

422
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:44,004
- Permission to speak, sir.
- What is it?

423
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,872
- I made a mistake. It won't happen again.
- That's right, it won't. You're out.

424
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,545
Colonel, I did something really stupid.

425
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,949
I'll take any punishment, but please
don't put me out of the program.

426
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,647
Son, my hands are tied.

427
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:02,993
I can't go home like this.

428
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:04,460
Home?

429
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,121
- I'd send you to the infantry if I could.
- Major!

430
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,058
I got a right to fight
for what I believe in like anybody else.

431
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:17,402
- I'm the best pilot in this damn place!
- Get a grip! Peoples!

432
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,840
- Peoples!
- Walter!

433
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,099
Peoples!

434
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,208
Peoples, get back here!

435
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:30,476
Don't do it, Walter! Walter! Come on!

436
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,529
Come graduatlon day, 
no name called wlll be hlgher than mlne. 

437
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,628
Guaranteed. 

438
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,149
Peoples! Get your ass
down here right now!

439
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:05,956
It's an order!

440
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,227
Peoples!

441
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,460
Peoples!

442
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,565
Pull up, Walter!

443
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:35,880
Crazy nigger.

444
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:27,465
You alright?

445
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,203
Look at that.

446
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,645
Took it right after his solo.

447
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,909
I'm gonna send it home to his folks.

448
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,082
Give it a rest.

449
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:47,554
Let them pack up his things.

450
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:50,924
- It's not our job!
- No!

451
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:54,555
Back off, okay?
They'll take care of it. I told you.

452
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:57,896
They killed him!

453
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:01,461
Hannibal, they killed him.
Major Joy set out to break him and he did.

454
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:04,404
Just as clean as if he put
a carbine to his head.

455
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:06,668
He was my friend, too.

456
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:10,039
Get off me!

457
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:12,314
You know he's right, Hannibal.

458
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,284
This shit doesn't make any sense.
Why they even bothering?

459
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:18,720
- Might as well forget it and send us home.
- You wanna go home, Cappy?

460
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:19,881
Shove off!

461
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:21,691
You too, Train, go on!

462
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:26,093
Tuck your tail between your legs and run
back to Harlem. Make Major Joy happy.

463
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,126
Me too, for that matter!

464
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,093
I'd sooner be here by my Ionesome...

465
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:35,099
...than to play with a pair of jokers
who can't figure out the game.

466
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,907
Don't you see that's what he wants?

467
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:40,773
He wants us to quit,
he wants us all to wash out!

468
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,046
I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction.

469
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,278
I came here for one reason.

470
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,114
To do one thing. To learn how to fly!

471
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,848
I'm gonna do that
and I ain't gonna let you stop me.

472
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:54,584
- I didn't say that.
- Not you, not Major Joy.

473
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:57,024
Not the goddamn
Commander in Chief himself!

474
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,527
You readin' me, Train?

475
00:41:58,629 --> 00:41:59,721
Attention!

476
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,502
What's going on?

477
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,940
Nothing, sir. Just a little discussion.

478
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:18,610
While you're cleaning up,
add this to your discussion.

479
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:22,947
You lost a friend today.

480
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,185
And I understand how you feel.

481
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,796
But you better get over it...

482
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:33,896
...quick!

483
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,331
Friends die in our business
and for a lot of reasons.

484
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:43,870
And the only protection you have
against losing one is not to have any.

485
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,047
As you were.

486
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:17,072
- What's wrong, Cappy?
- I'm losing manifold pressure.

487
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,675
Roberts, break formation.

488
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,038
Yes, sir.

489
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,849
Lieutenant Glenn, it's pretty bad.

490
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,354
I gotta put her down.

491
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,389
We passed a country road
about a mile back.

492
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,021
Stay wlth hlm, Lee. 

493
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,919
Yes, slr. 

494
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,228
Comin' around on your other wing.

495
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:50,904
Hang on, Cappy.

496
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,290
Keep workin' at that hill!

497
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:49,893
Them's our boys.

498
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:55,928
Get off the road!

499
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:57,938
Give 'em room.

500
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,101
I said move it, damnit!

501
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:28,528
Just a little engine trouble.

502
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:33,337
Son of a bitch, they're niggers.

503
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:48,955
They's colored fliers.

504
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:00,503
Lieutenant Roberts.

505
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:02,696
Congratulations, sir.

506
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,411
Lieutenant Thompson, sir.

507
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:17,677
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

508
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:22,857
Lieutenant Cappy.

509
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:29,025
- Congratulations, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.

510
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,097
Lieutenant Lee.

511
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,148
- Congratulations, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, Colonel.

512
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:54,081
Thank you, Lieutenant.

513
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:00,697
What you men have accomplished,
given the odds against it...

514
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,926
...your friends back home
could only dream about.

515
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:08,030
And your families watchin' today
never imagined.

516
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:14,400
You are among a select few who will ever
know the honor of serving their country...

517
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:16,676
...in the realm of flight.

518
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:22,181
You are now United States Army
Air Corps aviators.

519
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,824
For that achievement, I congratulate you.

520
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:40,593
"Down In fllght they go

521
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:42,501
"Gallant men of the 99th

524
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,078

acceptance of sacrlflce and of effort. 

526
00:47:58,355 --> 00:48:02,883
That means a natlonal unlty
that can know no llmltatlons... 

527
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:06,654
... of race or creed or selflsh polltlcs. 

528
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:10,866
The Amerlcan people expect that much
from themselves. 

529
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:13,225
Thls meetlng Is adjourned. 

530
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,315
I understand your position, Beach.

531
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:32,444
But it's a very sticky subject.
Particularly in the Negro press.

532
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,649
And I've said this committee should not
be concerned with the Negro press.

533
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:40,490
However,
I know a dead horse when I beat one.

534
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:46,500
So I think this might inject a little
courage to our more timid colleagues.

535
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,403
What's that?

536
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:52,932
It's a scientific study that I commissioned
by the anthropology department...

537
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:55,739
...of one of our most
prestigious Universities.

538
00:48:56,347 --> 00:49:01,250
The credentials of its authors are as
unimpeachable as its conclusions. Look.

539
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:05,248
The intellectual capacity of the Negro
to operate complicated machinery...

540
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:09,554
...i.e. a front line war plane,
is questionable.

541
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,390
Smaller blood vessels
in the Negro translates...

542
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:15,830
...to restricted blood supply
and problems in severe maneuvers.

543
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:20,230
There are documented reports of
mysterious training crashes at Tuskegee.

544
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:23,239
Blacking out and losing control
might very well explain them.

545
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,705
Might very well.

546
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:29,202
- When does the committee get the report?
- In due time.

547
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:33,171
Right now it's under lock and key.
I got a few more ducks to line up...

548
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:35,013
...before I make my move.

549
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:38,913
And see that this Tuskegee nonsense
is brought to an end.

550
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:43,752
As God as my witness,
those boys will never see combat.

551
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:53,603
You know you better get that part looked
at before you're ready to solo!

552
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:54,995
Yes, sir!

553
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:05,506
General Stevenson, I wish I had
more time to prepare for this visit, sir.

554
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,516
So in the hell do I, Colonel.

555
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,189
Mrs. Roosevelt.

556
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,188
Colonel Rogers is
the Commanding Officer of Tuskegee.

557
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,059
As I said on the phone, the
First Lady is here to look at the operations.

558
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:27,031
A little background might help
before we start with a tour of the facilities.

559
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:30,402
The field sits on 1600 acres,
one of the largest in the country.

560
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:33,534
How would you gauge
the progress of your colored flyers?

561
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,171
Their progress is commensurate with
the standards of the training command.

562
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,874
Plain English.
Does that mean you are or aren't satisfied?

563
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,213
- I'm very satisfied, ma'am.
- Good.

564
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:48,891
Then I want a ride in one of your airplanes.

565
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,363
Major, take the First Lady up
in that Stearman over there.

566
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,765
- Take a couple of loops around the field.
- No.

567
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,531
I want to ride with him.

568
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,577
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
I thought you said these men were trained.

569
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:17,910
The addition of an old lady in the
rear seat won't unravel that confidence.

570
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,280
No, ma'am.

571
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:20,621
Good.

572
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:24,619
When I'm finished you can also tell
me why these pilots are still here...

573
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:29,227
...and not overseas fighting
for their country like the rest of our boys.

574
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,348
Mrs. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Lee.

575
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:53,656
- Good afternoon, young man.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

576
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:57,322
It's turned into a beautiful day
for an airplane ride.

577
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:00,489
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,301
That isn't who I think it is, is it?

579
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:15,573
Lieutenant Lee's about to
make all your dreams come true.

580
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:17,378
What do you mean?

581
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,781
Take a good look around you, gentlemen.

582
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:25,081
I suspect Alabama will soon become
a fond memory.

583
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,179
Hold it, please.

584
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:29,726
Smile.

585
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:23,505
Don't tell me I spelled your name wrong.
I mean, how can you screw up "Lee"?

586
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,776
No, you spelled it right.

587
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:31,680
- I just never had my own plane before.
- Well, it's not yours, Lieutenant, it's mine.

588
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:34,516
I put your name on it
so you think it's yours.

589
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:36,853
Sergeant Toby Wills, sir.

590
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:40,688
Your Crew Chief. Call me "Tank."

591
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:42,889
Nice to meet you, Tank. I'm Hannibal.

592
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:46,800
Don't you worry, I'll take care of
your plane just like it was my own.

593
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:01,746
I want to welcome you
men to North Africa.

594
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:06,317
For those of you who don't know me,
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin O. Davis.

595
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:09,223
Commander of the 99th Pursuit Squadron.

596
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:14,486
Tomorrow you'll get an opportunity
to meet the entire 33rd Fighter Group.

597
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,427
Despite the long
and hard road you've traveled...

598
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:25,338
...and the many obstacles that
have been thrown in your path...

599
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:27,734
...you have...

600
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:29,634
...arrived!

601
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,512
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

602
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:39,947
Welcome to the war, gentlemen.

603
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:47,025
It's a long day, man.
I'll be glad to get some sleep.

604
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:50,460
Now there's a class act.

605
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,566
- You said it, brother.
- B.O. Davis.

606
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:55,229
He's a lot shorter than what I pictured.

607
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:58,103
- West Point will do that to a colored man.
- What do you mean?

608
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:02,134
He was silenced the entire time that he
was at West Point. Nobody talked to him.

609
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:05,179
- But he never gave up, just kept on in.
- That's right.

610
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:09,446
- Like Walter said, "Just a matter of focus."
- Hey, Train, we're startin' up!

611
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,381
Poker calls, gents. Gotta take the pot.

612
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:14,321
Good luck, Billy.

613
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:25,332
You know, it's so beautiful out here.
I shoulda brought my watercolors.

614
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:31,404
You'd never know
there was a war goin' on.

615
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,506
- You guys stay closer in formation.
- Yes, sir!

616
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:40,616
- Well, time to pay the dances.
- You got that right.

617
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:43,480
How you doin?

618
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:51,117
Lift off time is zero seven-hundred.
Lieutenant?

619
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:56,898
It's the buffalo soldiers.

620
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:00,666
A day late and a dollar short.

621
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:03,699
Take a seat.

622
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:05,765
Yes, sir.

623
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:15,717
I guess we can begin our briefing.

624
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:18,184
Why wasn't I informed
the briefing was earlier?

625
00:56:18,522 --> 00:56:21,958
You and your men are expected to read
the board just like everyone else.

626
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:23,882
The board said, "0600".

627
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:26,052
I'd look again, Colonel.

628
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,130
They changed it.

629
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,297
Same-ol', same-ol'.
Might as well be back in Alabama.

630
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,531
- Lee, Roberts, Cappy.
- Sir.

631
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:38,073
We're flying. You're up.
Follow me for instructions.

632
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:39,073
Yes, sir.

633
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:25,780
We've got a rall yard
that has to be taken out. 

634
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:29,957
German target dlvlslons have been
klckln' the shlt out of our ground forces. 

635
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:32,824
But are now low on fuel and munltlons. 

636
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,696
G2 thlnks thls yard Is the supply depot. 

637
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:38,599
Our job Is to make
those supplles dlsappear. 

638
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:26,113
Target's comin' up just ahead,
over that ridge.

639
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:30,353
You gotta knock out
the German supply trains, it's the target.

640
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,111
Five miles to target.

641
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:36,323
Okay. Let's show him what we're made of.

642
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,051
Go get 'em, Hannlbal. 

643
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,324
Easy, Hannibal, easy.

644
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,865
Ready and fire!

645
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:49,436
Yeah!

646
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:54,435
Let's hit 'em again!

647
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:03,685
Beautiful! Look at that!

648
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:10,092
Yeah! Come on you son of a bitch!
I got your mama!

649
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:32,407
For your first mission
you guys did damn good.

650
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:35,109
I see Lieutenant Glenn trained you well.
I like that.

651
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:39,719
- Thank you, sir.
- Nine months of practice didn't hurt, sir.

652
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:44,086
I'd check that attitude, Lieutenant.

653
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:52,693
Go get your sleep.
We have a briefing tomorrow at 0530.

654
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:04,910
Remember to check your fuel. 

655
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:08,282
This one will stretch our range.
Don't suck your tanks dry.

656
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:10,615
Or it's a long camel ride back home.

657
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:14,113
You fellas stay in tight formation.
There's safety in numbers.

658
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:17,125
Safety from what, sir? A circling buzzard?

659
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:19,422
I haven't seen a Jerry
since we've been here.

660
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,895
That doesn't mean they're not out there.

661
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:25,832
Dual targets this morning.
The German airfield and the power station.

662
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,132
- Turn out the lights!
- Excuse me, Colonel Davis.

663
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:29,132
Yes?

664
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,867
When do you think
we'll be seein' some air combat, sir?

665
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,574
- You in a hurry to die, Lieutenant Lee?
- No, sir.

666
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:38,113
But we've been doing nothing
but ground runs.

667
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,480
The white units have already rotated
out to France. Why haven't we?

668
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:45,787
If you're not in a hurry to die,
you must have somethin' to prove.

669
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:49,922
With all due respect
to the Colonel as a West Point graduate...

670
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:55,091
...your father being the first Negro
appointed General to the US Military...

671
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,958
...I think we all have something to prove.

672
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:03,395
Don't you dream of jeopardizing
this mission with your glory seekin'.

673
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,508
Do you understand?

674
01:01:09,879 --> 01:01:10,903
Yes, sir.

675
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,824
Goln' after the flrst target. 

676
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:27,294
We caught 'em on the ground!

677
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:28,989
Clip his wings, Cappy!

678
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:33,996
Ready or not, I'm rollin' in.

679
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:40,343
I have a little somethin'
from Uncle Sam for you, Jerry.

680
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:43,037
Take that you Nazi bastard!

681
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:48,145
I'm goin' after the power station!

682
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:52,077
I got it! I got it!

683
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:58,321
Alright, let's head for home.

684
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:33,623
Hey, fellas.

685
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:36,191
- Colonel wants to see us.
- Us?

686
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:38,364
Yeah, you guys, me.

687
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:42,063
Lieutenants Lee, Cappy and Roberts
reporting as ordered, General.

688
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,101
Gentlemen, relax, have a seat.

689
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,580
I'm General Stevenson,
this is Senator Conyers.

690
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:58,920
General, I believe we've met before.
Back at Tuskegee with Mrs. Roosevelt.

691
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,186
- You're the one who took her up?
- Yes, sir.

692
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:05,921
- She could barrel roll with the best of 'em.
- And just what would that mean?

693
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:08,125
It's a maneuver, sir.

694
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,861
Gentlemen, we all have things to do,
so let's move on.

695
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:17,067
The Senator and I are on a final swing of
a fact-finding tour through the war zone.

696
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,574
We wanna see how you are settling in.

697
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:23,737
We've been gettin' reports
which require some clarification.

698
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:27,706
We have critics back in the States.

699
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:32,777
- I wasn't aware of any criticism, sir.
- Well, let me make you aware.

700
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:36,689
Inability to locate targets.

701
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,195
Failure to press home attacks
or find secondary targets...

702
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:44,232
...when the first is obscured.
Attitude problems with fellow officers.

703
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,434
Poor formation discipline counters.

704
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:48,471
- Excuse me?
- Lieutenant!

705
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,165
Senator, I...

706
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:56,336
I'm here to have a talk with the pilots.

707
01:03:56,813 --> 01:04:00,214
I'm not interested in practiced excuses.
I thought I made that clear.

708
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:07,783
Where do you guys thlnk
they'll reasslgn Colonel Davls? 

709
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:12,417
- We don't know he's been reassigned.
- I don't see him out here anywhere.

710
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:16,699
They're probably gonna punish him
by stickin' him behind a desk.

711
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:19,026
It's the worst thing you could do to a pilot.

712
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:22,104
It would sure as shootin' kill me.

713
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:28,070
Shit! Bandits, two o'clock.

714
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:32,374
109's!

715
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:37,711
Finally some action! Let's get 'em boys!

716
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:41,145
Leroy.

717
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:44,459
Cappy, get back in formation now!

718
01:04:44,627 --> 01:04:48,063
They're probably just recon, 
they won't attack us If we stlck together. 

719
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,758
Here's our chance for some kills!

720
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:57,031
They're gonna isolate him!
They're gonna cut him off!

721
01:05:02,512 --> 01:05:04,503
Damnl Come on, Traln.  Let's go.

722
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:11,611
-Cappy, there's one on your tall. 
- Get him off me, Hannibal. I got this one.

723
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,921
Hannibal, help me!

724
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,196
- I'm hit!
- Hang on, Cappy.

725
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:34,470
Come on, Jerry. You wanna fight?
Fight me. I'll give you a fight!

726
01:05:34,544 --> 01:05:36,910
I got you dead in my sight
you son of a bitch!

727
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:43,977
- The Jerrles are runnln' homel
- Cappy? Cappy talk to me!

728
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:48,784
Oh, shit! Now the plane is...
Hannibal, help me!

729
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:52,518
Leroy, don't panic! Don't panic, Leroy!

730
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,959
Cappy, jump!

731
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,235
Bail, Leroy! Bail!

732
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,038
Cappy!

733
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:00,118
The Negro has been observed to have
a chlldlsh and lmpulslve character. 

734
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:03,357
Now, gentlemen,
you must agree that this report is...

735
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:05,057
...highly inflammatory.

736
01:07:05,168 --> 01:07:08,296
I have on my desk
a War Department memo...

737
01:07:08,638 --> 01:07:12,369
...on a colored pilot
recently shot down in North Africa...

738
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:16,970
...after breaking formation.
As a description, impulsive...

739
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,948
...quite appears
the appropriate terminology.

740
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:26,148
Maybe, but this report smacks
of a singular point of view.

741
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:29,781
All points of view are singular
if they're not to your liking, Senator.

742
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,587
Meanwhile,
I've got constituents who wonder why...

743
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:36,556
...when they're sufferin'
from war rationin' and over taxation...

744
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:41,194
...why we're spendin' their tax dollars
on a bunch of college educated niggers...

745
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:44,797
...who've convinced the press
that they can fly expensive war planes.

746
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:47,707
Gentlemen.

747
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:52,908
This experiment certainly
had noble beginnings.

748
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,875
But failures are evident and glaring.

749
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:03,450
Perhaps we should abandon
this project until after the war...

750
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:07,393
...when calmer conditions will allow
for more thoughtful approach.

751
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:10,599
Where you goin'?

752
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:16,304
To give the representative of the accused
an opportunity to defend himself.

753
01:08:41,898 --> 01:08:43,627
General Stevenson you know.

754
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:46,899
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Benjamin O. Davis...

755
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,802
...the Commanding Officer
of the squadron in question.

756
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:51,796
Be seated.

757
01:08:57,914 --> 01:09:00,439
Colonel, you are aware of the accusations...

758
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:05,581
...such as: malaise and fatigue
in the face of little enemy contact?

759
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:10,349
We've been in continuous combat
for months with no replacements, sir.

760
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:13,119
My men are tired.

761
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:16,091
Other units get four fresh bodies a month...

762
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:19,960
...but something always goes wrong
with our paperwork or movement orders.

763
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:24,132
- How many missions have your men flown?
- Most have flown well over fifty.

764
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:27,540
That's the standard cut-off point
for white pilots to be sent home.

765
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:31,706
- And your men are still flying?
- They don't know what else to do with us.

766
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:37,174
White pilots rotate back to the States
as instructors.

767
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:41,389
But since the Army won't allow
colored pilots to train white cadets...

768
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:42,890
Nine months of training.

769
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,995
Countless missions in Africa...

770
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,955
...and not one air to air kill. Is that right?

771
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:53,268
We can't fight what we don't see.

772
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:56,033
We're so far from front line action...

773
01:09:56,105 --> 01:09:58,198
...we rarely encounter an enemy plane...

774
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,367
...let alone the opportunity to engage one.

775
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:03,441
You recently lost a pilot
who cut and ran from...

776
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:07,245
...what, an imaginary Messerschmitt?

777
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:11,446
Those men understand
Lieutenant Cappy's action...

778
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:15,412
...was a mistake.
- Mistakes are all we see, young man.

779
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:19,758
Late for mission briefings,
piss poor discipline and leadership...

780
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,897
...and nothin' but excuses.

781
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:24,458
I see a unit that is an embarrassment...

782
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:27,935
...to the Air Corps, to the American people
and to themselves!

783
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:32,398
Might I remind you gentlemen
that this war is by no means won.

784
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:34,739
And this sad experiment...

785
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:37,773
...is a drain and a hindrance to that effort.

786
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:43,450
My vote is that we abandon the project
and move the agenda.

787
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:47,746
All we asked for was a chance
to prove ourselves.

788
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,790
A fair and impartial opportunity.

789
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,451
We thought we had that chance.

790
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:54,553
But you invite us to a poker game,
hand us a fixed deck...

791
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:56,255
...and then wonder why we can't win?

792
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:59,096
- Young man, we really don't...
- Let him finish, sir.

793
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:05,200
Every colored pilot in the 99th...

794
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:08,107
...went through his own private hell
to wear those wings.

795
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:10,904
Each of those men carry...

796
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,677
...not only the dream
of becoming American Military Aviators...

797
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,947
...but the hopes
of an entire people as well.

798
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:22,491
Am I the only one here
that understands what that means?

799
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:30,063
I was brought up to believe
that beneath it all...

800
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:33,331
...Americans are a decent people...

801
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:36,962
...with an abiding sense of
integrity and fair play.

802
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:40,609
The cheers I heard across this country
when Joe Louis and Jesse Owens...

803
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,509
...humiliated Hitler's "Master Race"...

804
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:47,080
...didn't just come
from proud colored folks.

805
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,246
They came from everyone.

806
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:53,849
How are we to interpret that?

807
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:57,955
As a United States Army Officer...

808
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,052
...who gladly puts his life
on the line everyday...

809
01:12:01,797 --> 01:12:04,425
...there's no greater conflict within me.

810
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,236
How do I feel about my country?

811
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:11,269
And how does my country...

812
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:14,942
...feel about me?

813
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:21,376
Are we only to be Americans
when the mood suits you?

814
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:27,515
A fair and impartial opportunity
is all we ask.

815
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:33,187
Nothing that you yourselves
wouldn't demand.

816
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:53,673
THE U.S. 22ND BOMB GROUP
OVER NORTHERN ITALY

817
01:12:56,318 --> 01:12:58,912
Vance, we got another one
comin' in high over here!

818
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,617
He's on your side, pick him off!

819
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:08,023
I got two of 'em breakln' upl

820
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:09,291
Son of a bitch!

821
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:11,363
I lost him!

822
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:13,798
I got one at nlne o'clockl

823
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:16,195
Oh, my God! No! No!

824
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,931
Number three's losing MP!

825
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,446
Damnit, I'm feathering!

826
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:33,053
Look out. There's another one.

827
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:40,288
Man, he's hit bad!

828
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:43,463
Kansas,
there's all kinds of hits back at the wing!

829
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:44,762
Kansas!

830
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:49,060
I got two Jerries comin' in high!

831
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:57,405
- Shit! I'm goin' back!
- No, no! I need you up here!

832
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:58,670
Damnit!

833
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:02,645
- Where the hell is our escort?
- I never saw them!

834
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:04,747
Son of a bitch!

835
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,051
Hold on!

836
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:12,820
Hold on, back there!

837
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:16,627
Shit! Shit!
Vance, let's get this thing home!

838
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:19,458
Okay. We're goin' home!

839
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,844
Master switch off.

840
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:18,960
Shit.

841
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:22,093
God, Wally. Wally!

842
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,133
Kansas?

843
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:30,135
Kansas?

844
01:15:42,117 --> 01:15:45,518
If it's any consolation,
the word's in it was a good strike.

845
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:48,850
I lost half my crew up there, Colonel.

846
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:51,526
In my book that's the shit end of the stick.

847
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:56,993
The fighter escort never even made
the rendezvous point.

848
01:15:57,233 --> 01:16:01,192
They ran into some trouble en route,
took some heavy casualties of their own.

849
01:16:01,303 --> 01:16:02,600
Damn!

850
01:16:03,072 --> 01:16:05,370
They always got some sort of excuse.

851
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,236
Me, I got parts of four kids all over...

852
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:11,479
...the Italian countryside
'cause of their limp dick excuses.

853
01:16:11,547 --> 01:16:14,072
Captain, you're forgettin' yourself.

854
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,445
Attention!

855
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:27,222
Take your seats, gentlemen.

856
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:30,559
Son of a bitch, the Colonel's gone full bird.

857
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,867
I have good news,
and I have not so good news.

858
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:39,003
The good news, we've been reassigned
to the European theatre. We'll go to Italy.

859
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,739
- Finally, we're gonna see some action.
- Yes.

860
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:45,211
However, there will be some changes.
Once in Italy...

861
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:49,848
...the 99th pursuit squadron will
join three new squadrons from Tuskegee...

862
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:53,410
...the 100th, 301st
and 302nd fighter squadrons...

863
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:56,822
...will now comprise
the 332nd fighter group.

864
01:16:56,926 --> 01:16:59,759
They're all colored units,
we're gonna be segregated again.

865
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:02,831
In addition our mission has changed.

866
01:17:02,965 --> 01:17:05,763
From dive-bombing to bomber escort.

867
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:10,431
Why has our mission changed, sir?
Why all of a sudden are we chaperons?

868
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:14,475
Their flying fortresses are taking
heavy losses and need effective cover.

869
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,710
Sir, why don't they let
the white pilots cover them?

870
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:22,513
I don't have time to lay it all out for you.
I will say this.

871
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:27,153
This entire unit came within
a hillbilly's heartbeat of goin' home.

872
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:31,589
And, if certain people had their way,
coming back carrying rifles...

873
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:34,458
...if we came back at all.

874
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:51,313
Say, you fellas with the 99th?

875
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:52,141
Yeah.

876
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:54,147
Reggie Miller, 332nd.

877
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:57,242
Hannibal Lee, nice to meet you.
This is Billy Roberts.

878
01:17:58,253 --> 01:17:59,584
Call me, "Train."

879
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:03,783
Hey, Train.
Well, fellas, welcome to Ramitelli.

880
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:05,655
Right this way.

881
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:08,720
You mean, "Rami damn Telli."

882
01:18:29,952 --> 01:18:32,216
It's about time you showed up, Lieutenant.

883
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:35,154
- I thought I shook you in North Africa.
- Not a chance, sir.

884
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:38,518
- It's good to see you, Tank.
- Good to see you, sir.

885
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,389
I've something to show you later.

886
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:43,431
- Alright. See you out at the flight line.
- Take care, sir.

887
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:48,096
Lieutenant Lee.

888
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:49,835
Sir.

889
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:54,642
I depend on you and the others in the 99th
to show some guidance and leadership.

890
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:58,441
These kids just came from Tuskegee
and they still say their prayers at night.

891
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:00,981
So do us all a favor
and give 'em some help.

892
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:02,281
Roger, sir.

893
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:06,854
By the way, Colonel.

894
01:19:07,723 --> 01:19:08,690
I still do.

895
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,783
- Still do what, Lieutenant?
- Still say my prayers at night, sir.

896
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,865
You gotta be kiddin' me.

897
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:29,870
No, sir!

898
01:19:32,948 --> 01:19:35,678
- Brand new Mustangs?
- Yes, sir!

899
01:19:41,957 --> 01:19:44,983
P-51B, 275 gallons with drop tanks.

900
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:47,756
You can ride these ponies
1,000 miles and back.

901
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:52,459
Six fifty calibers on her wings,
and hauling two one thousand pounders.

902
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:55,131
If you don't bring back
swastikas with all this...

903
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,768
...you can keep on flyin' back
to Octopus, Iowa.

904
01:19:57,873 --> 01:20:00,000
Ottumwa. Ottumwa.

905
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:01,708
What's this?

906
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,369
New signature from the group.

907
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:05,844
Do you like it?

908
01:20:07,082 --> 01:20:08,515
It ain't loud enough.

909
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:13,546
- Paint the whole goddamn tail red, Tank.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:17,823
We're less than 90 minutes from Germany.
And they know we're here.

911
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:20,361
Those of you
wonderin' about seein' action...

912
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:22,490
...you got your wish.

913
01:20:22,764 --> 01:20:26,860
The 33rd and 324th
regularly tangle with the Jerries.

914
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:31,866
- Colonel, they're flying bomber escort.
- Occasionally, Lieutenant, yes.

915
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:35,732
They're doing it occasionally,
we have the honor of doin' it full time.

916
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:37,869
That's right. Consider it an honor.

917
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:41,908
Bomber losses to enemy action
are unacceptably high.

918
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:46,717
Yesterday's run into Germany cost them
65 of 200 bombers. That's one in three.

919
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:51,422
Six hundred men killed or missing.

920
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,321
You wanna make your mark...

921
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:57,562
...here's your chance.

922
01:21:34,403 --> 01:21:37,372
How do you llke thls, glrls? 
All dressed up and no dates. 

923
01:21:37,539 --> 01:21:39,803
Yeah, I thlnk we've been stood up... 

924
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:41,466
...not a B-17 in sight.

925
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:45,141
This is the rendezvous point...

926
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:47,846
... they must have been grounded
by bad weather. 

927
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,784
He's comln' back aroundl

928
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:55,014
Hey, Iowa, turn to Channel 8.

929
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,851
Alrlght, Medlna, come on let's get hlml
Take hlm offl

930
01:21:58,994 --> 01:22:00,723
Sounds like one of ours.

931
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:02,424
Must be stragglers.

932
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:04,459
Let's help them.

933
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:05,992
Roger thatl

934
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:16,202
Hey, he's comln' up on topl

935
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:22,478
He's comln' In agalnl

936
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:24,917
Hang on.

937
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:29,554
He's above us!

938
01:22:32,594 --> 01:22:35,062
Here we come, fellasl Here we comel

939
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:37,588
Hang on, Hannibal, I got him!

940
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:42,470
The "Train" is always on time, that's one.
Let's clean 'em up now!

941
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:43,663
Let's clean 'em up!

942
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:47,633
- What the hell? Did you see that?
- Oh, yeah! Who is that?

943
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:50,839
Get the other one, Hannibal.

944
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:53,581
Wait! We got another one
comin' in high over here.

945
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:55,240
Come on, Medina!

946
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:02,181
Keep your shirt on. I got him. I got him.

947
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:07,555
Moment of truth, Jerry.

948
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:11,155
We live in the air.

949
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:14,369
We die by fire!

950
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:17,927
Yes!

951
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:22,699
Say goodbye, Mr. Kraut.
Give my regards to the Fuhrer.

952
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:28,841
Mustang, starboard side.
Come on, Vance. Who are they?

953
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:31,349
I don't know.

954
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:37,217
Red Tall 51 thls Is Fortress 3-2-0.
Come In. Over. 

955
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,188
Nothing.

956
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,627
I can't raise 'em, they must be
on a separate frequency or somethin'.

957
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,528
- You get any kind of I.D.?
- Nothing I recognize.

958
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,895
I tell you,
we need to find out who those boys are.

959
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:54,565
- Red tails, huh?
- Yeah.

960
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:57,872
No fire group I know
carries those markings.

961
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,004
Well, I gotta find 'em.

962
01:24:00,115 --> 01:24:03,642
I got a bottle of whiskey for both of 'em
for savin' our asses.

963
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:07,811
Try Ramitelli. We're gettin' new escort
assignments, they might be one of them.

964
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:09,220
I'll check it out.

965
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:12,149
Poor slob did everything
but pull the trigger for me!

966
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:16,390
That last kill, I took that son of a bitch out
from a thousand yards!

967
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,229
Sir, how do you get 'em off you?
Splits? Climbin' turns?

968
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:22,565
No, no. Walter People's special,
"You make it up as you go along."

969
01:24:24,973 --> 01:24:26,463
Hey, how you guy's doin'?

970
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,633
We're B-17 bomb group based at Foggia...

971
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:32,146
...and we're lookin' for the pilots
who were up at Pleven yesterday.

972
01:24:32,914 --> 01:24:36,145
We wanna say thanks.
A couple of those guys saved our asses.

973
01:24:36,651 --> 01:24:37,640
Don't mention it.

974
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:39,981
- So where are they?
- Where's who?

975
01:24:40,088 --> 01:24:42,318
The pilots, boy.
We came up here to see them.

976
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:44,724
You're lookin' at 'em.

977
01:24:48,497 --> 01:24:50,522
Lieutenant Lee, Lieutenant Roberts.

978
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:51,666
How are you?

979
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:56,770
- We appreciate your thanks.
- This whole base is colored?

980
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:59,565
Colored, yes. Lock, stock and pilot.

981
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:09,039
Let's get out of here, Lieutenant.

982
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,421
- What?
- This isn't right, let's go.

983
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:19,289
- What's wrong? He just said...
- I don't care.

984
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:20,919
Them pilots was niggers.

985
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:24,391
Niggers weren't flyin' them planes today.
Let's move it out.

986
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:27,561
Yes, sir.

987
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,874
You saved their asses,
and they got the nerve to be insulted?

988
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:38,676
Makes you wanna hurt somebody.

989
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:43,918
What are you writing?

990
01:25:44,886 --> 01:25:45,910
My folks.

991
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:50,185
This boy mails a letter
to his folks every night.

992
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:52,189
I won't mail this one, you will.

993
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:56,456
Oh, no, no, no.
I am not mailing that letter.

994
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:59,500
If you die, you mail it yourself.

995
01:26:01,436 --> 01:26:03,301
You'll mail it just like I'll mail yours.

996
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,997
You won't have to worry about me askin'.

997
01:26:07,275 --> 01:26:10,108
Writin' 'em one of those letters is
like expecting to die.

998
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:11,577
No one expects to die.

999
01:26:16,318 --> 01:26:19,913
My father had a friend,
he fought in the First World War.

1000
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:23,991
He was one of the first
colored soldiers in France.

1001
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:28,357
This man had so many medals he came
home decorated like a Christmas tree.

1002
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,793
He disappeared one night.

1003
01:26:35,804 --> 01:26:39,103
They found him in Georgia,
lynched in his uniform.

1004
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:52,542
Why would you want to fly for a country
that thanks you by lynching you?

1005
01:26:57,225 --> 01:27:01,628
I like the feeling of respect that we get.

1006
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,725
Especially from colored folks.

1007
01:27:04,332 --> 01:27:05,230
Like...

1008
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:10,668
...me and Cappy came upon them fellas in
the chain-gang while training in Tuskegee.

1009
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:14,464
I even got some satisfaction outta the look
on those white fellas today...

1010
01:27:14,543 --> 01:27:17,410
...when they found out it was us
that saved their tails.

1011
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:30,815
Captain...

1012
01:27:31,593 --> 01:27:35,393
...that colored outfit, the 332nd,
HQ confirmed.

1013
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:38,865
They were the boys that helped us
at Pleven and...

1014
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:41,733
...we weren't even their assignment.

1015
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:45,498
Lieutenant,
let me give you a little Sociology lesson.

1016
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:49,099
I think bein' from California and all,
you might be a little bit confused.

1017
01:27:50,011 --> 01:27:51,603
Now, I'm a Texas boy.

1018
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:54,304
I grew up with niggers.
I was around 'em every day.

1019
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:57,579
Hell, in Lubbock you can't throw a rock
without hittin' one.

1020
01:27:57,786 --> 01:27:59,549
Now, I know how they think.

1021
01:27:59,621 --> 01:28:03,079
And I know how they live and
I can tell you with complete certainty...

1022
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:05,659
...what they are and are not capable of.

1023
01:28:07,095 --> 01:28:09,495
You don't think they can fly them planes,
sir?

1024
01:28:09,598 --> 01:28:13,090
Lance, if they was flyin' them planes,
and that's a big "if"...

1025
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:17,001
...then what happened up there
was a fluke. So forget about it.

1026
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,542
I'm gettln' tlred of these long mlsslons... 

1027
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:26,808
... where we get stuck out here
by our lonesome. 

1028
01:28:27,215 --> 01:28:29,615
I'm low on fuel,
I say we should head back.

1029
01:28:34,656 --> 01:28:37,250
- Wait a second. What's that?
- Where?

1030
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:40,728
Down below,
looks like a German destroyer.

1031
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:46,660
Ain't one of ours.

1032
01:28:48,637 --> 01:28:50,366
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

1033
01:28:51,506 --> 01:28:53,133
Always.

1034
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:56,772
Straighten up.

1035
01:28:58,146 --> 01:28:59,579
Fly right.

1036
01:29:03,318 --> 01:29:05,218
Alright, here we go.

1037
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:08,652
Geronimo!

1038
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:14,260
Go down, Papa. Go down, Papa.
Don't you blow your top!

1039
01:29:16,798 --> 01:29:19,392
That a boy. That a boy. That a boyl
Yesl

1040
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:51,059
Hey, Iowa.

1041
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,565
You're in the spotlight in there, man.
You sunk a damn destroyer.

1042
01:29:55,637 --> 01:29:57,730
People get medals for doin' that shit.

1043
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:02,706
You're gonna tell me you think
they'll give you or me...

1044
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:06,008
...or anybody else on this base
a medal for doin' anything right?

1045
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:12,380
Okay. Alright, so you won't get a medal.

1046
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:16,152
The bottom line is, we know what you did.

1047
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:18,785
And we know it was a lucky shot.

1048
01:30:22,197 --> 01:30:24,392
But it's still one destroyer down.

1049
01:30:41,516 --> 01:30:43,074
Do you see our escort?

1050
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:47,911
Sure do. And they're right on time.

1051
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:57,823
They know we're here.

1052
01:30:58,433 --> 01:31:02,267
They'll give us' their best shot but
we gotta get these guys to Biretta Pass.

1053
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:05,905
Biretta Pass and back.

1054
01:31:10,078 --> 01:31:13,673
Heads up. Seven MB 109s at one o'clock.

1055
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:18,079
I'll take the leader.

1056
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,946
- Roger that. Straighten up!
- Fly right!

1057
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:24,251
Starboard wlng now, 
I almost got 'em In my slghts. 

1058
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:27,123
Keep your line unengaged!
Twelve miles till target.

1059
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:30,392
All statlonsl All statlons check Inl
Tall gunner, come upl

1060
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:33,663
Make it easy for me.
Bring it around. That's it.

1061
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:39,704
Go get 'em, Traln. 
You shake that buzzard down, boy. 

1062
01:31:40,074 --> 01:31:41,166
Roger that!

1063
01:31:47,015 --> 01:31:48,004
I got him!

1064
01:31:48,316 --> 01:31:49,510
Bomb door's openl

1065
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:51,413
Target up! Target up!

1066
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:01,194
Got another one tryin'
to sneak over the top, Iowa.

1067
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:02,593
Ground him!

1068
01:32:10,872 --> 01:32:11,964
Come on, baby!

1069
01:32:14,475 --> 01:32:15,942
That's it, I got you!

1070
01:32:20,849 --> 01:32:22,146
That's two, Iowa!

1071
01:32:28,289 --> 01:32:29,847
Two mlles to target. 

1072
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,589
On your six, Train!

1073
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:43,235
Bombs awayl

1074
01:32:43,371 --> 01:32:44,963
- Bombs away.
- Bombs away.

1075
01:32:45,974 --> 01:32:48,738
- Hang on, Traln. 
- Get this guy off me, Iowa!

1076
01:32:53,648 --> 01:32:54,945
I'm comin'!

1077
01:33:09,197 --> 01:33:10,596
Billy!

1078
01:33:16,838 --> 01:33:18,305
No, Blllyl Nol

1079
01:33:23,144 --> 01:33:24,736
I'm right behind him, Train!

1080
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:30,007
You go straight to hell you son of a bitch!

1081
01:33:32,453 --> 01:33:34,284
Good hit! Good hit!

1082
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,790
Train, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Train?

1083
01:33:40,695 --> 01:33:42,322
I got two more, Iowa.

1084
01:33:42,764 --> 01:33:44,629
I saw you. You dld good, Traln. 

1085
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,761
Now, come on.
The bombers went back, come on.

1086
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:50,736
You climb. No!
You gotta climb to them, Iowa.

1087
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:52,996
You gotta climb to them!

1088
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:57,140
Straighten up and fly right, boy.
You can make it!

1089
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:08,821
Billy?

1090
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:12,521
Train?

1091

- I'll take some smokes.
- Alright.

Leroy Jonas Cappy, Art History.

1105
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:03,328
Colonel,
just how bad will the Eighty-Eights be?

1106
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:09,061
You'll be attacking Berlin, son.
The very heart of Germany.

1107
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:12,598
Every anti-aircraft gun in the region
will be trying to stop you.

1108
01:37:15,376 --> 01:37:16,934
And there'll be the fighters.

1109
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:24,613
Now, gentlemen, on this one,
we need every load placed on the target.

1110
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:26,887
We may not have a second chance.

1111
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:29,012
Sir, who's flyin' cover?

1112
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:31,315
The 51st will escort your wing, Lieutenant.

1113
01:37:32,493 --> 01:37:34,825
Now, anymore questions?

1114
01:37:35,897 --> 01:37:37,455
If not, good luck.

1115
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:39,427
Sir?

1116
01:37:41,502 --> 01:37:42,992
Why the change?

1117
01:37:43,404 --> 01:37:47,704
How come our escort was changed from
the 332nd to the 51st?

1118
01:37:48,176 --> 01:37:50,542
Logistics, Captain. Is that a problem?

1119
01:37:51,379 --> 01:37:54,348
- No, sir. No problem.
- Good. Have a good mission.

1120
01:37:54,549 --> 01:37:55,880
Sir.

1121
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:59,979
You got a point to make, Captain?
I suggest you get on with it.

1122
01:38:01,622 --> 01:38:04,250
Speak up, Captain,
we got a mission to run here.

1123
01:38:04,592 --> 01:38:05,991
Yes, sir. Well, I...

1124
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:10,727
...I got men whose lives are
my responsibility up there, sir.

1125
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:13,966
And I want the 332nd as our escort.

1126
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:16,495
Colored boys?

1127
01:38:23,844 --> 01:38:25,402
That's right, sir.

1128
01:38:25,813 --> 01:38:27,872
I looked into it, and...

1129
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:32,579
...since they've been escorting bombers
they haven't lost one to enemy action, sir.

1130
01:38:32,653 --> 01:38:36,384
Not a single ship.
And if it's all the same to you...

1131
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:42,357
...I want the 332nd
to take me to Berlin and back.

1132
01:38:52,206 --> 01:38:55,232
Alright, Captain.
I'll take it under advisement.

1133
01:39:19,934 --> 01:39:20,992
At ease.

1134
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:25,796
You're up awfully early today.

1135
01:39:26,607 --> 01:39:28,507
I haven't gotten much sleep, sir.

1136
01:39:32,947 --> 01:39:34,847
We're all gonna miss him, Hannibal.

1137
01:39:38,386 --> 01:39:41,014
The really sad thing is
he's gonna miss this.

1138
01:39:51,032 --> 01:39:54,195
Distinguished flying cross
for taking out the destroyer.

1139
01:39:55,202 --> 01:39:58,638
General Crowell will be here next week
to officially present it to you.

1140
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,264
There's somethin' else.

1141
01:40:14,922 --> 01:40:16,890
- Sir.
- Congratulations.

1142
01:40:19,393 --> 01:40:20,553
Captain Lee.

1143
01:40:21,996 --> 01:40:24,464
The word's in about our next mission.

1144
01:40:28,736 --> 01:40:29,532
Berlin.

1145
01:40:32,506 --> 01:40:34,064
And we weren't assigned.

1146
01:40:36,844 --> 01:40:38,004
We were requested.
